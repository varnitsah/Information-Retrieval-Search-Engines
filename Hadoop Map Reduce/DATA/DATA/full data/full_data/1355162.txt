used to being shuddered at none of us spies mind it at all whenever i enter a hotel and register myself as a spy i am quite accustomed to see a thrill of fear run round the clerks or clerk behind the desk  us spies or we spiesfor we call ourselves bothare thus a race apart none know us all fear us where do we live nowhere where are we everywhere frequently we dont know ourselves where we are the secret orders that we receive come from so high up that it is often forbidden to us even to ask where we are a friend of mine or at least a fellow spyus spies have no friendsone of the most brilliant men in the hungarian secret service once spent a month in new york under the impression that he was in winnipeg if this happened to the most brilliant think of the others  all i say fear us because they know and have reason to know our power hence in spite of the prejudice against us we are able to move everywhere to lodge in the best hotels and enter any society that we wish to penetrate  let me relate an incident to illustrate this a month ago i entered one of the largest of the new york hotels which i will merely call the b hotel without naming it to do so might blast it we spies in fact never name a hotel at the most we indicate it by a number known only to ourselves such as 1 2 or 3  on my presenting myself at the desk the clerk informed me that he had no room vacant i knew this of course to be a mere subterfuge whether or not he suspected that i was a spy i cannot say i was muffled up to avoid recognition in a long overcoat with the collar turned up and reaching well above my ears while the black beard and the moustache that i had slipped on in entering the hotel concealed my face let me speak a moment to the manager i said when he came i beckoned him aside and taking his ear in my hand i breathed two words into it good heavens he gasped while his face turned as pale as ashes is it enough i asked can i have a room or must i breathe again no no said the manager still trembling then turning to the clerk give this gentleman a room he said and give him a bath  what these two words are that will get a room in new york at once i must not divulge even now when the veil of secrecy is being lifted the international interests involved are too complicated to permit it suffice it to say that if these two had failed i know a couple of others still better  i narrate this incident otherwise trivial as indicating the astounding ramifications and the ubiquity of the international spy system a similar illustration occurs to me as i write i was walking the other day with another man on upper b way between the t building and the w garden  do you see that man over there i said pointing from the side of the street on which we were walking on the sidewalk to the other side opposite to the side that we were on  the man with the straw hat he asked yes what of him  oh nothing i answered except that hes a spy  great heavens exclaimed my acquaintance leaning up against a lamppost for support a spy how do you know that what does it mean  i gave a quiet laughwe spies learn to laugh very quietly  ha i said that is my secret my friend verbum sapientius che sara sara yodel doodle doo  my acquaintance fell in a dead faint upon the street i watched them take him away in an ambulance will the reader be surprised to learn that among the whitecoated attendants who removed him i recognized no less a person than the famous russian spy poulispantzoff what he was doing there i could not tell no doubt his orders came from so high up that he himself did not know i had seen him only twice beforeonce when we were both disguised as zulus at buluwayo and once in the interior of china at the time when poulispantzoff made his secret entry into thibet concealed in a teacase he was inside the teacase when i saw him so at least i was informed by the coolies who carried it yet i recognized him instantly neither he nor i however gave any sign of recognition other than an imperceptible movement of the outer eyelid we spies learn to move the outer lid of the eye so imperceptibly that it cannot be seen yet after meeting poulispantzoff in this way i was not surprised to read in the evening papers a few hours afterward that the uncle of the young king of siam had been assassinated the connection between these two events i am unfortunately not at liberty to explain the consequences to the vatican would be too serious i doubt if it could remain topside up  these however are but passing incidents in a life filled with danger and excitement they would have remained unrecorded and unrevealed like the rest of my revelations were it not that certain recent events have to some extent removed the seal of secrecy from my lips the death of a certain royal sovereign makes it possible for me to divulge things hitherto undivulgeable even now i can only tell a part a small part of the terrific things that i know when more sovereigns die i can divulge more i hope to keep on divulging at intervals for years but i am compelled to be cautious my relations with the wilhelmstrasse with downing street and the quai dorsay are so intimate and my footing with the yildiz kiosk and the waldorfastoria and childs restaurants are so delicate that a single faux pas might prove to be a false step  it is now seventeen years since i entered the secret service of the g empire during this time my activities have taken me into every quarter of the globe at times even into every eighth or sixteenth of it  it was i who first brought back word to the imperial chancellor of the existence of an entente between england and france is there an entente he asked me trembling with excitement on my arrival at the wilhelmstrasse your excellency i said there is he groaned can you stop it he asked dont ask me i said sadly where must we strike demanded the chancellor fetch me a map i said they did so i placed my finger on the map quick quick said the chancellor look where his finger is they lifted it up morocco they cried i had meant it for abyssinia but it was too late to change that night the warship panther sailed under sealed orders the rest is history or at least history and geography  in the same way it was i who brought word to the wilhelmstrasse of the rapprochement between england and russia in persia what did you find asked the chancellor as i laid aside the russian disguise in which i had travelled a rapprochement i said he groaned they seem to get all the best words he said  i shall always feel to my regret that i am personally responsible for the outbreak of the present war it may have had ulterior causes but there is no doubt that it was precipitated by the fact that for the first time in seventeen years i took a six weeks vacation in june and july of 1914 the consequences of this careless step i ought to have foreseen yet i took such precautions as i could do you think i asked that you can preserve the status quo for six weeks merely six weeks if i stop spying and take a rest well try they answered remember i said as i packed my things keep the dardanelles closed have the sandjak of novi bazaar properly patrolled and let the dobrudja remain under a modus vivendi till i come back  two months later while sitting sipping my coffee at a kurhof in the schwarzwald i read in the newspapers that a german army had invaded france and was fighting the french and that the english expeditionary force had crossed the channel this i said to myself means war as usual i was right  it is needless for me to recount here the life of busy activity that falls to a spy in wartime it was necessary for me to be here there and everywhere visiting all the best hotels wateringplaces summer resorts theatres and places of amusement it was necessary moreover to act with the utmost caution and to assume an air of careless indolence in order to lull suspicion asleep with this end in view i made a practice of never rising till ten in the morning i breakfasted with great leisure and contented myself with passing the morning in a quiet stroll taking care however to keep my ears open after lunch i generally feigned a light sleep keeping my ears shut a table dhote dinner followed by a visit to the theatre brought the strenuous day to a close few spies i venture to say worked harder than i did  it was during the third year of the war that i received a peremptory summons from the head of the imperial secret service at berlin baron fisch von gestern i want to see you it read nothing more in the life of a spy one learns to think quickly and to think is to act i gathered as soon as i received the despatch that for some reason or other fisch von gestern was anxious to see me having as i instantly inferred something to say to me this conjecture proved correct  the baron rose at my entrance with military correctness and shook hands  are you willing he inquired to undertake a mission to america  i am i answered  very good how soon can you start  as soon as i have paid the few bills that i owe in berlin i replied  we can hardly wait for that said my chief and in case it might excite comment you must start tonight  very good i said  such said the baron are the kaisers orders here is an american passport and a photograph that will answer the purpose the likeness is not great but it is sufficient  but i objected abashed for a moment this photograph is of a man with whiskers and i am unfortunately cleanshaven  the orders are imperative said gestern with official hauteur you must start tonight you can grow whiskers this afternoon  very good i replied  and now to the business of your mission continued the baron the united states as you have perhaps heard is making war against germany  i have heard so i replied  yes continued gestern the fact has leaked outhow we do not knowand is being widely reported his imperial majesty has decided to stop the war with the united states  i bowed  he intends to send over a secret treaty of the same nature as the one recently made with his recent highness the recent czar of russia under this treaty germany proposes to give to the united states the whole of equatorial africa and in return the united states is to give to germany the whole of china there are other provisions but i need not trouble you with them your mission relates not to the actual treaty but to the preparation of the ground  i bowed again  you are aware i presume continued the baron that in all high international dealings at least in europe the ground has to be prepared a hundred threads must be unravelled this the imperial government itself cannot stoop to do the work must be done by agents like yourself you understand all this already no doubt  i indicated my assent  these then are your instructions said the baron speaking slowly and distinctly as if to impress his words upon my memory on your arrival in the united states you will follow the accredited methods that are known to be used by all the best spies of the highest diplomacy you have no doubt read some of the books almost manuals of instruction that they have written  i have read many of them i said  very well you will enter that is to say enter and move everywhere in the best society mark specially please that you must not only enter it but you must move you must if i may put it so get a move on  i bowed  you must mix freely with the members of the cabinet you must dine with them this is a most necessary matter and one to be kept well in mind dine with them often in such a way as to make yourself familiar to them will you do this  i will i said  very good remember also that in order to mask your purpose you must constantly be seen with the most fashionable and most beautiful women of the american capital can you do this  can i i said  you must if need beand the baron gave a most significant look which was not lost upon mecarry on an intrigue with one or better with several of them are you ready for it  more than ready i said  very good but this is only a part you are expected also to familiarize yourself with the leaders of the great financial interests you are to put yourself on such a footing with them as to borrow large sums of money from them do you object to this  no i said frankly i do not  good you will also mingle freely in ambassadorial and foreign circles it would be well for you to dine at least once a week with the british ambassador and now one final wordhere gestern spoke with singular impressivenessas to the president of the united states  yes i said  you must mix with him on a footing of the most openhanded friendliness be at the white house continually make yourself in the fullest sense of the words the friend and adviser of the president all this i think is clear in fact it is only what is done as you know by all the masters of international diplomacy  precisely i said  very good and then continued the baron as soon as you find yourself sufficiently en rapport with everybody or i should say he added in correction for the baron shares fully in the present german horror of imported french words when you find yourself sufficiently in enggeknupfterverwandtschaft with everybody you may then proceed to advance your peace terms and now my dear fellow said the baron with a touch of genuine cordiality one word more are you in need of money  yes i said  i thought so but you will find that you need it less and less as you go on meantime goodbye and best wishes for your mission  such was such is in fact the mission with which i am accredited i regard it as by far the most important mission with which i have been accredited by the wilhelmstrasse yet i am compelled to admit that up to the present it has proved unsuccessful my attempts to carry it out have been baffled there is something perhaps in the atmosphere of this republic which obstructs the working of high diplomacy for over five months now i have been waiting and willing to dine with the american cabinet they have not invited me for four weeks i sat each night waiting in the j hotel in washington with my suit on ready to be asked they did not come near me  nor have i yet received an invitation from the british embassy inviting me to an informal lunch or to midnight supper with the ambassador everybody who knows anything of the inside working of the international spy system will realize that without these invitations one can do nothing nor has the president of the united states given any sign i have sent ward to him in cipher that i am ready to dine with him on any day that may be convenient to both of us he has made no move in the matter  under these circumstances an intrigue with any of the leaders of fashionable society has proved impossible my attempts to approach them have been misunderstoodin fact have led to my being invited to leave the j hotel the fact that i was compelled to leave it owing to reasons that i cannot reveal without paying my account has occasioned unnecessary and dangerous comment i connect it in fact with the singular attitude adopted by the b hotel on my arrival in new york to which i have already referred  i have therefore been compelled to fall back on revelations and disclosures here again i find the american atmosphere singularly uncongenial i have offered to reveal to the secretary of state the entire family history of ferdinand of bulgaria for fifty dollars he says it is not worth it i have offered to the british embassy the inside story of the abdication of constantine for five dollars they say they know it and knew it before it happened i have offered for little more than a nominal sum to blacken the character of every reigning family in germany i am told that it is not necessary  meantime as it is impossible to return to central europe i expect to open either a fruit store or a peanut stand very shortly in this great metropolis i imagine that many of my former colleagues will soon be doing the same     ii father knickerbocker a fantasy  it happened quite recentlyi think it must have been on april the second of 1917that i was making the long pilgrimage on a daytrain from the remote place where i dwell to the city of new york and as we drew near the city and day darkened into night i had fallen to reading from a quaint old copy of washington irvings immortal sketches of father knickerbocker and of the little town where once he dwelt  i had picked up the book i know not where very old it apparently was and made in england for there was pasted across the flyleaf of it an extract from some ancient magazine or journal of a century ago giving what was evidently a description of the new york of that day  from reading the book i turnedmy head still filled with the vision of father knickerbocker and sleepy hollow and tarrytownto examine the extract i read it in a sort of halfdoze for the dark had fallen outside and the drowsy throbbing of the running train attuned ones mind to dreaming of the past  the town of new yorkso ran the extract pasted in the little bookis pleasantly situated at the lower extremity of the island of manhattan its recent progress has been so amazing that it is now reputed on good authority to harbour at least twenty thousand souls viewed from the sea it presents even at the distance of half a mile a striking appearance owing to the number and beauty of its church spires which rise high above the roofs and foliage and give to the place its characteristically religious aspect the extreme end of the island is heavily fortified with cannon commanding a range of a quarter of a mile and forbidding all access to the harbour behind this battery a neat greensward affords a pleasant promenade where the citizens are accustomed to walk with their wives every morning after church  how i should like to have seen it i murmured to myself as i laid the book aside for a moment the battery the harbour and the citizens walking with their wives their own wives on the greensward  then i read on  from the town itself a wide thoroughfare the albany post road runs meandering northward through the fields it is known for some distance under the name of the broad way and is so wide that four moving vehicles are said to be able to pass abreast the broad way especially in the springtime when it is redolent with the scent of clover and appleblossoms is a favourite evening promenade for the citizenswith their wivesafter church here they may be seen any evening strolling toward the high ground overlooking the hudson their wives on one arm a spyglass under the other in order to view what they can see down the broad way may be seen moving also droves of young lambs with their shepherds proceeding to the market while here and there a goat stands quietly munching beside the road and gazing at the passersby  it seems i muttered to myself as i read in some ways but little changed after all  the townso the extract continuedis not without its amusements a commodious theatre presents with great success every saturday night the plays of shakespeare alternating with sacred concerts the new yorker indeed is celebrated throughout the provinces for his love of amusement and late hours the theatres do not come out until long after nine oclock while for the gayer habitues two excellent restaurants serve fish macaroni prunes and other delicacies till long past ten at night the dress of the new yorker is correspondingly gay in the other provinces the men wear nothing but plain suits of a rusty black whereas in new york there are frequently seen suits of brown snuffcolour and even of pepperandsalt the costumes of the new york women are equally daring and differ notably from the quiet dress of new england  in fine it is commonly said in the provinces that a new yorker can be recognized anywhere with his wife by their modish costumes their easy manners and their willingness to spend moneytwo three and even five cents being paid for the smallest service  dear me i thought as i paused a moment in my reading so they had begun it even then  the whole spirit of the placethe account continuedhas recently been admirably embodied in literary form by an american writer mr washington irving not to be confounded with george washington his creation of father knickerbocker is so lifelike that it may be said to embody the very spirit of new york the accompanying woodcutwhich was drawn on wood especially for this periodicalrecalls at once the delightful figure of father knickerbocker the new yorkers of today are accustomed indeed to laugh at mr irvings fancy and to say that knickerbocker belongs to a day long since past yet those who know tell us that the image of the amiable old gentleman kindly but irascible generous and yet frugal loving his town and seeing little beyond it may be held once and for all to typify the spirit of the place without reference to any particular time or generation  father knickerbocker i murmured as i felt myself dozing off to sleep rocked by the motion of the car father knickerbocker how strange if he could be here again and see the great city as we know it now how different from his day how i should love to go round new york and show it to him as it is  so i mused and dozed till the very rumble of the wheels seemed to piece together in little snatches father knickerbockerfather knickerbockerthe batterythe batterycitizens walking with their wives with their wivestheir own wivesuntil presently i imagine i must have fallen asleep altogether and knew no more till my journey was over and i found myself among the roar and bustle of the concourse of the grand central  and there lo and behold waiting to meet me was father knickerbocker himself i know not how it happened by what queer freak of hallucination or by what actual miraclelet those explain it who deal in such thingsbut there he stood before me with an outstretched hand and a smile of greeting father knickerbocker himself the embodied spirit of new york  how strange i said i was just reading about you in a book on the train and imagining how much i should like actually to meet you and to show you round new york  the old man laughed in a jaunty way  show me round he said why my dear boy i live here  i know you did long ago i said  i do still said father knickerbocker ive never left the place ill show you around but wait a bitdont carry that handbag ill get a boy to call a porter to fetch a man to take it  oh i can carry it i said its a mere nothing  my dear fellow said father knickerbocker a little testily i thought im as democratic and as plain and simple as any man in this city but when it comes to carrying a handbag in full sight of all this crowd why as i said to peter stuyvesant aboutabouthere a misty look seemed to come over the old gentlemans faceabout two hundred years ago ill be hanged if i will it cant be done its not up to date  while he was saying this father knickerbocker had beckoned to a group of porters  take this gentlemans handbag he said and you carry his newspapers and you take his umbrella heres a quarter for you and a quarter for you and a quarter for you one of you go in front and lead the way to a taxi  dont you know the way yourself i asked in a halfwhisper  of course i do but i generally like to walk with a boy in front of me we all do only the cheap people nowadays find their own way  father knickerbocker had taken my arm and was walking along in a queer excited fashion senile and yet with a sort of forced youthfulness in his gait and manner  now then he said get into this taxi  cant we walk i asked  impossible said the old gentleman its five blocks to where we are going  as we took our seats i looked again at my companion this time more closely father knickerbocker he certainly was yet somehow strangely transformed from my pictured fancy of the sleepy hollow days his antique coat with its wide skirt had it seemed assumed a modish cut as if in imitation of the bellshaped spring overcoat of the young man about town his threecornered hat was set at a rakish angle till it looked almost like an uptodate fedora the great stick that he used to carry had somehow changed itself into the curved walkingstick of a broadway lounger the solid old shoes with their wide buckles were gone in their place he wore narrow slippers of patent leather of which he seemed inordinately proud for he had stuck his feet up ostentatiously on the seat opposite his eyes followed my glance toward his shoes  for the foxtrot he said the old ones were no good have a cigarette these are armenian or would you prefer a honolulan or a nigerian now he resumed when we had lighted our cigarettes what would you like to do first dance the tango hear some hawaiian music drink cocktails or what  why what i should like most of all father knickerbocker  but he interrupted me  theres a devilish fine woman look the tall blonde one give me blondes every time here he smacked his lips by gad sir the women in this town seem to get finer every century what were you saying  why father knickerbocker i began but he interrupted me again  my dear fellow he said may i ask you not to call me father knickerbocker  but i thought you were so old i said humbly  old me old oh i dont know why dash it there are plenty of men as old as i am dancing the tango here every night pray call me if you dont mind just knickerbocker or simply knickymost of the other boys call me knicky now whats it to be  most of all i said i should like to go to some quiet place and have a talk about the old days  right he said were going to just the place nownice quiet dinner a good quiet orchestra hawaiian but quiet and lots of women here he smacked his lips again and nudged me with his elbow lots of women bunches of them do you like women  why mr knickerbocker i said hesitatingly i supposei  the old man sniggered as he poked me again in the ribs  you bet you do you dog he chuckled we all do for me i confess it sir i cant sit down to dinner without plenty of women stacks of them all round me  meantime the taxi had stopped i was about to open the door and get out  wait wait said father knickerbocker his hand upon my arm as he looked out of the window ill see somebody in a minute wholl let us out for fifty cents none of us here ever gets in or out of anything by ourselves its bad form ah here he is  a moment later we had passed through the portals of a great restaurant and found ourselves surrounded with all the colour and tumult of a new york dinner a la mode a burst of wild music pounded and thrummed out on ukuleles by a group of yellow men in hawaiian costume filled the room helping to drown or perhaps only serving to accentuate the babel of talk and the clatter of dishes that arose on every side men in evening dress and women in all the colours of the rainbow decollete to a degree were seated at little tables blowing blue smoke into the air and drinking green and yellow drinks from glasses with thin stems a troupe of cabaret performers shouted and leaped on a little stage at the side of the room unheeded by the crowd  ha ha said knickerbocker as we drew in our chairs to a table some place eh theres a peach look at her or do you like better that lazylooking brunette next to her  mr knickerbocker was staring about the room gazing at the women with open effrontery and a senile leer upon his face i felt ashamed of him yet oddly enough no one about us seemed in the least disturbed  now what cocktail will you have said my companion theres a new one this week the fantan fifty cents each will you have that right two fantans now to eatwhat would you like  may i have a slice of cold beef and a pint of ale  beef said knickerbocker contemptuously my dear fellow you cant have that beef is only fifty cents do take something reasonable try lobster newburg or no heres a more expensive thingfilet bourbon a la something i dont know what it is but by gad sir its three dollars a portion anyway  all right i said you order the dinner  mr knickerbocker proceeded to do so the headwaiter obsequiously at his side and his long finger indicating on the menu everything that seemed most expensive and that carried the most incomprehensible name when he had finished he turned to me again  now he said lets talk  tell me i said about the old days and the old times on broadway  ah yes he answered the old daysyou mean ten years ago before the winter garden was opened weve been going ahead sir going ahead why ten years ago there was practically nothing sir above times square and look at it now  i began to realize that father knickerbocker old as he was had forgotten all the earlier times with which i associated his memory there was nothing left but the cabarets and the gardens the palm rooms and the ukuleles of today behind that his mind refused to travel  dont you remember i asked the apple orchards and the quiet groves of trees that used to line broadway long ago  groves he said ill show you a grove a coconut grovehere he winked over his wineglass in a senile fashionthat has appletrees beaten from here to honolulu thus he babbled on  all through our meal his talk continued of cabarets and dances or foxtrots and midnight suppers of blondes and brunettes peaches and dreams and all the while his eye roved incessantly among the tables resting on the women with a bold stare at times he would indicate and point out for me some of what he called the representative people present  notice that man at the second table he would whisper across to me hes worth all the way to ten millions made it in government contracts they tried to send him to the penitentiary last fall but they cant get himhes too smart for them ill introduce you to him presently see the man with him thats his lawyer biggest crook in america they say well meet him after dinner then he would suddenly break off and exclaim egad sir theres a fine bunch of them as another bevy of girls came trooping out upon the stage  i wonder i murmured if there is nothing left of him but this has all the fine old spirit gone is it all drowned out in wine and suffocated in the foul atmosphere of luxury  then suddenly i looked up at my companion and i saw to my surprise that his whole face and manner had altered his hand was clenched tight on the edge of the table his eyes looked before himthrough and beyond the riotous crowd all about himinto vacancy into the far past back into memories that i thought forgotten his face had altered the senile leering look was gone and in its place the firmset face of the knickerbocker of a century ago  he was speaking in a strange voice deep and strong  listen he said listen do you hear ittherefar out at seaships gunslistentheyre calling for helpships gunsfar out at sea he had clasped me by the arm quick to the battery theyll need every man tonight theyll  then he sank back into his chair his look changed again the vision died out of his eyes  what was i saying he asked ah yes this old brandy a very special brand they keep it for me here a dollar a glass they know me here he added in his fatuous way all the waiters know me the headwaiter always knows me the minute i come into the roomkeeps a chair for me now try this brandy and then presently well move on and see whats doing at some of the shows  but somehow in spite of himself my companion seemed to be unable to bring himself fully back into the consciousness of the scene before him the faraway look still lingered in his eyes  presently he turned and spoke to me in a low confidential tone  was i talking to myself a moment ago he asked yes ah i feared i was do you knowi dont mind telling it to youlately ive had a strange queer feeling that comes over me at times as if something were happeningsomething i dont know what i suppose he continued with a false attempt at resuming his fatuous manner im going the pace a little too hard eh makes one fanciful but the fact is at timeshe spoke gravely againi feel as if there were something happening something coming  knickerbocker i said earnestly father knickerbocker dont you know that something is happening that this very evening as we are sitting here in all this riot the president of the united states is to come before congress on the most solemn mission that ever  but my speech fell unheeded knickerbocker had picked up his glass again and was leering over it at a bevy of girls dancing upon the stage  look at that girl he interrupted quickly the one dancing at the end what do you think of her eh some peach  knickerbocker broke off suddenly for at this moment our ears caught the sound of a noise a distant tumult as it were far down the street and growing nearer the old man had drawn himself erect in his seat his hand to his ear listening as he caught the sound  out on the broad way he said instinctively calling it by its ancient name as if a flood of memories were upon him do you hear it listenlistenwhat is it ive heard that sound beforeive heard every sound on the broad way these two centuries backwhat is it i seem to know it  the sound and tumult as of running feet and of many voices crying came louder from the street the people at the tables had turned in their seats to listen the music of the orchestra had stopped the waiters had thrown back the heavy curtains from the windows and the people were crowding to them to look out into the street knickerbocker had risen in his place his eyes looked toward the windows but his gaze was fixed on vacancy as with one who sees a vision passing  i know the sound he cried i see it all again look cant you see them its massachusetts soldiers marching south to the warcant you hear the beating of the drums and the shrill calling of the fifethe regiments from the north the first to come i saw them pass here where we are sitting sixty years ago  knickerbocker paused a moment his hand still extended in the air and then with a great light upon his face he cried  i know it now i know what it meant the feeling that has haunted methe sounds i kept hearingthe guns of the ships at sea and the voices calling in distress i know now it means sir it means  but as he spoke a great cry came up from the street and burst in at the doors and windows echoing in a single word  war war the message of the president is for war  war cried father knickerbocker rising to his full height stern and majestic and shouting in a stentorian tone that echoed through the great room war war to your places every one of you be done with your idle luxury out with the glare of your lights begone you painted women and worthless men to your places every man of you to the battery man the guns stand to it every one of you for the defence of americafor our new york new york  then with the sound new york new york still echoing in my ears i woke up the vision of my dream was gone i was still on the seat of the car where i had dozed asleep the book upon my knee the train had arrived at the depot and the porters were calling into the doorway of the car new york new york  all about me was the stir and hubbub of the great depot but loud over all it was heard the call of the newsboys crying war war the presidents message is for war late extra war war  and i knew that a great nation had cast aside the bonds of sloth and luxury and was girding itself to join in the fight for the free democracy of all mankind     iii the prophet in our midst  the eminent authority looked around at the little group of us seated about him at the club he was telling us or beginning to tell us about the outcome of the war it was a thing we wanted to know we were listening attentively we felt that we were getting something  i doubt very much he said whether downing street realizes the enormous power which the quai dorsay has over the yildiz kiosk  so do i i said what is it  but he hardly noticed the interruption  youve got to remember he went on that from the point of view of the yildiz the wilhelmstrasse is just a thing of yesterday  quite so i said  of course he added the ballplatz is quite different  altogether different i admitted  and mind you he said the ballplatz itself can be largely moved from the quirinal through the vatican  why of course it can i agreed with as much relief in my tone as i could put into it after all what simpler way of moving the ballplatz than that  the eminent authority took another sip at his tea and looked round at us through his spectacles  it was i who was taking on myself to do most of the answering because it was i who had brought him there and invited the other men to meet him hes coming round at five i had said do come and have a cup of tea and meet him he knows more about the european situation and the probable solution than any other man living naturally they came gladly they wanted to knowas everybody wants to knowhow the war will end they were just ordinary plain men like myself  i could see that they were a little mystified perhaps disappointed they would have liked just as i would to ask a few plain questions such as can the italians knock the stuff out of the austrians are the rumanians getting licked or not how many submarines has germany got anyway such questions in fact as we are accustomed to put up to one another every day at lunch and to answer out of the morning paper as it was we didnt seem to be getting anywhere  no one spoke the silence began to be even a little uncomfortable it was broken by my friend rapley who is in wholesale hardware and who has all the intellectual bravery that goes with it he asked the authority straight out the question that we all wanted to put  just what do you mean by the ballplatz what is the ballplatz  the authority smiled an engaging smile  precisely he said i see your drift exactly you say what is the ballplatz i reply quite frankly that it is almost impossible to answer probably one could best define it as the driving power behind the ausgleich  i see said rapley  though the plain fact is that ever since the herzegovinian embroglio the ballplatz is little more than a counterpoise to the wilhelmstrasse  ah said rapley  indeed as everybody knows the whole relationship of the ballplatz with the nevski prospekt has emanated from the wilhelmstrasse  this was a thing which personally i had not known but i said nothing neither did the other men they continued smoking looking as innocent as they could  dont misunderstand me said the authority when i speak of the nevski prospekt i am not referring in any way to the tsarskoe selo  no no we all agreed  no doubt there were as we see it plainly now under currents in all directions from the tsarskoe selo  we all seemed to suggest by our attitude that these undercurrents were sucking at our very feet  but the tsarskoe selo said the authority is now definitely eliminated  we were glad of that we shifted our feet back into attitudes of ease  i felt that it was time to ask a leading question  do you think i said that germany will be broken up by the war  you mean germany in what sense are you thinking of preuszenthum are you referring to junkerismus  no i said quite truthfully neither of them  ah said the authority i see you mean germany as a souverantat embodied in a reichsland  thats it i said  then its rather hard said the eminent authority to answer your question in plain terms but ill try one thing of course is absolutely certain mitteleuropa goes overboard  it does eh  oh yes absolutely this is the end of mitteleuropa i mean to sayhere weve had mitteleuropa that is the mitteleuropa idea as a sort of fantasmus in front of teutonism ever since koniggratz  the authority looked all round us in that searching way he had we all tried to look like men seeing a fantasmus and disgusted at it  so you see he went on mitteleuropa is done with  i suppose it is i said i didnt know just whether to speak with regret or not i heard rapley murmur i guess so  and there is not a doubt continued the authority that when mitteleuropa goes grossdeutschthum goes with it  oh sure to we all murmured  well then there you arewhat is the result for germanywhy the things as plain as a pikestaffin fact youre driven to it by the sheer logic of the situationthere is only one outcome  the authority was speaking very deliberately he even paused at this point and lighted a cigarette while we all listened breathlessly we felt that we had got the thing to a focus at last  only one outcomea staatenbund  great heavens i said not a staatenbund  undoubtedly said the authority puffing quietly at his cigarette as if personally he wouldnt lift a finger to stop the staatenbund if he could thats the end of it a staatenbund in other words we are back where we were before the vienna congress  at this he chuckled heartily to himself so the rest of us laughed too the thing was too absurd but the authority who was a man of nice distinctions and genuinely anxious to instruct us was evidently afraid that he had overstated things a little  mind you he said therell be something leftcertainly the zollverein and either the ausgleich or something very like it  all of the men gave a sort of sigh of relief it was certainly something to have at least a sort of resemblance or appearance of the ausgleich among us we felt that we were getting on one could see that a number of the men were on the brink of asking questions  what about rumania asked nelleshe is a banker and interested in government bondsis this the end of it  no said the authority its not the end of rumania but it is the end of rumanian irridentismus  that settled nelles  what about the turks asked rapley  the turks or rather i suppose it would be more proper to say the osmanli as that is no doubt what you mean rapley nodded well speaking personally i should say that theres no difficulty in a permanent settlement in that quarter if i were drawing up the terms of a treaty of peace meant to be really lasting i should lay down three absolute bases the rest neednt matterthe authority paused a moment and then proceeded to count off the three conditions of peace on his fingersthese would be first the evacuation of the sandjak second an international guarantee for the capitulations and third for internal matters an arrangement along the lines of the original firman of midhat pasha  a murmur of complete satisfaction went round the group  i dont say continued the eminent authority that there wouldnt be other minor matters to adjust but they would be a mere detail you ask me for instance for a milice or at least a gendarmerie in the albanian hinterland very good i grant it you at once you retain if you like you abolish the cypriotic suzerainty of the porteall right these are matters of indifference  we all assumed a look of utter indifference  but what about the dardanelles would you have them fixed so that ships could go through or not asked rapley  he is a plain man not easily put down and liking a plain answer he got it  the dardanelles said the authority could easily be denationalized under a quadrilateral guarantee to be made a pars materia of the pactum foederis  that ought to hold them i murmured  the authority felt now that he had pretty well settled the map of europe he rose and shook hands with us all around very cordially we did not try to detain him we felt that time like his was too valuable to be wasted on things like us  well i tell you said rapley as we settled back into our chairs when the great authority had gone my own opinion boys is that the united states and england can trim germany and austria any day in the week and twice on sunday  after which somebody else said  i wonder how many of these submarines germany has anyway  and then we drifted back into the humbler kind of war talk that we have been carrying on for three years  but later as we walked home together rapley said to me  that fellow threw a lot of light on things in europe didnt he  and i answered  yes  what liars we all are     iv personal adventures in the spirit world  i do not write what follows with the expectation of convincing or converting anybody we spiritualists or spiritistswe call ourselves both or eithernever ask anybody to believe us if they do well and good if not all right our attitude simply is that facts are facts there they are believe them or not as you like as i said the other night in conversation with aristotle and john bunyan and george washington and a few others why should anybody believe us aristotle i recollect said that all that he wished was that everybody should know how happy he was and washington said that for his part if people only knew how bright and beautiful it all was where he was they would willingly indeed gladly pay the mere dollaritself only a nominal feethat it cost to talk to him bunyan i remember added that he himself was quite happy  but as i say i never ask anybody to believe me the more so as i was once an absolute sceptic myself as i see it now i was prejudiced the mere fact that spiritual seances and the services of a medium involved the payment of money condemned the whole thing in my eyes i did not realize as i do now that these medii like anybody else have got to live otherwise they would die and become spirits  nor would i now place these disclosures before the public eyes were if not that i think that in the present crisis they will prove of value to the allied cause  but let me begin at the beginning my own conversion to spiritualism came about like that of so many others through the more or less casual remark of a friend  noticing me one day gloomy and depressed this friend remarked to me  have you any belief in spiritualism  had it come from anyone else i should have turned the question aside with a sneer but it so happens that i owe a great deal of gratitude to this particular friend it was he who at a time when i was so afflicted with rheumatism that i could scarcely leap five feet into the air without pain said to me one day quite casually have you ever tried pyro for your rheumatism one month later i could leap ten feet in the airhad i been able towithout the slightest malaise the same man i may add hearing me one day exclaiming to myself oh if there were anything that would remove the stains from my clothes said to me very simply and quietly have you ever washed them in luxo it was he too who noticing a haggard look on my face after breakfast one morning inquired immediately what i had been eating for breakfast after which with a simplicity and directness which i shall never forget he said why not eat humpo  nor can i ever forget my feeling on another occasion when hearing me exclaim aloud oh if there were only something invented for removing the proteins and amygdaloids from a carbonized diet and leaving only the pure nitrogenous lifegiving elements seized my hand in his and said in a voice thrilled with emotion there is it has  the reader will understand therefore that a question or query from such a friend was not to be put lightly aside when he asked if i believed in spiritualism i answered with perfect courtesy  to be quite frank i do not  there was silence between us for a time and then my friend said  have you ever given it a trial  i paused a moment as the idea was a novel one  no i answered to be quite candid i have not  neither of us spoke for perhaps twenty minutes after this when my friend said  have you anything against it  i thought awhile and then i said  yes i have  my friend remained silent for perhaps half an hour then he asked  what  i meditated for some time then i said  thisit seems to me that the whole thing is done for money how utterly unnatural it is to call up the deadones greatgrandfather let us sayand pay money for talking to him  precisely said my friend without a moments pause i thought so now suppose i could bring you into contact with the spirit world through a medium or through different medii without there being any question of money other than a merely nominal fee the money being as it were left out of count and regarded as only so to speak nominal something given merely pro forma and ad interim under these circumstances will you try the experiment  i rose and took my friends hand  my dear fellow i said i not only will but i shall  from this conversation dated my connection with spiritualism which has since opened for me a new world  it would be out of place for me to indicate the particular address or the particular methods employed by the agency to which my friend introduced me i am anxious to avoid anything approaching a commercial tinge in what i write moreover their advertisement can be seen along with many othersall i am sure just as honourable and just as trustworthyin the columns of any daily newspaper as everybody knows many methods are employed the tapping of a table the movement of a ouija board or the voice of a trance medium are only a few among the many devices by which the spirits now enter into communication with us but in my own case the method used was not only simplicity itself but was so framed as to carry with it the proof of its own genuineness one had merely to speak into the receiver of a telephone and the voice of the spirit was heard through the transmitter as in an ordinary telephone conversation  it was only natural after the scoffing remark that i had made that i should begin with my greatgrandfather nor can i ever forget the peculiar thrill that went through me when i was informed by the head of the agency that a tracer was being sent out for greatgrandfather to call him to the phone  greatgrandfatherlet me do him this justicewas prompt he was there in three minutes whatever his line of business was in the spirit worldand i was never able to learn ithe must have left it immediately and hurried to the telephone whatever later dissatisfaction i may have had with greatgrandfather let me state it fairly and honestly he is at least a punctual man every time i called he came right away without delay let those who are inclined to cavil at the methods of the spiritualists reflect how impossible it would be to secure such punctuality on anything but a basis of absolute honesty  in my first conversation with greatgrandfather i found myself so absurdly nervous at the thought of the vast gulf of space and time across which we were speaking that i perhaps framed my questions somewhat too crudely  how are you greatgrandfather i asked  his voice came back to me as distinctly as if he were in the next room  i am happy very happy please tell everybody that i am happy  greatgrandfather i said i will ill see that everybody knows it where are you greatgrandfather  here he answered beyond  beyond what  here on the other side  side of which i asked  of the great vastness he answered the other end of the illimitable  oh i see i said thats where you are  we were silent for some time it is amazing how difficult it is to find things to talk about with ones greatgrandfather for the life of me i could think of nothing better than  what sort of weather have you been having  there is no weather here said greatgrandfather its all bright and beautiful all the time  you mean bright sunshine i said  there is no sun here said greatgrandfather  then how do you mean i began  but at this moment the head of the agency tapped me on the shoulder to remind me that the two minutes conversation for which i had deposited as a nominal fee five dollars had expired the agency was courteous enough to inform me that for five dollars more greatgrandfather would talk another two minutes  but i thought it preferable to stop for the moment  now i do not wish to say a word against my own greatgrandfather yet in the conversations which followed on successive days i found himhow shall i put itunsatisfactory he had been when on this sideto use the term we spiritualists prefera singularly able man an english judge so at least i have always been given to understand but somehow greatgrandfathers brain on the other side seemed to have got badly damaged my own theory is that living always in the bright sunshine he had got sunstroke but i may wrong him perhaps it was locomotor ataxy that he had that he was very very happy where he was is beyond all doubt he said so at every conversation but i have noticed that feebleminded people are often happy he said too that he was glad to be where he was and on the whole i felt glad that he was too once or twice i thought that possibly greatgrandfather felt so happy because he had been drinking his voice even across the great gulf seemed somehow to suggest it but on being questioned he told me that where he was there was no drink and no thirst because it was all so bright and beautiful i asked him if he meant that it was bonedry like kansas or whether the rich could still get it but he didnt answer  our intercourse ended in a quarrel no doubt it was my fault but it did seem to me that greatgrandfather who had been one of the greatest english lawyers of his day might have handed out an opinion  the matter came up thus i had had an argumentit was in the middle of last winterwith some men at my club about the legal interpretation of the adamson law the dispute grew bitter  im right i said and ill prove it if you give me time to consult the authorities  consult your greatgrandfather sneered one of the men  all right i said i will  i walked straight across the room to the telephone and called up the agency  give me my greatgrandfather i said i want him right away  he was there good punctual old soul ill say that for him he was there  greatgrandfather i said im in a discussion here about the constitutionality of the adamson law involving the power of congress under the constitution now you remember the constitution when they made it is the law all right  there was silence  how does it stand greatgrandfather i said will it hold water  then he spoke  over here he said there are no laws no members of congress and no adamsons its all bright and beautiful and  greatgrandfather i said as i hung up the receiver in disgust you are a mutt  i never spoke to him again yet i feel sorry for him feeble old soul flitting about in the illimitable and always so punctual to hurry to the telephone so happy so feeblewitted and courteous a better man perhaps take it all in all than he was in life lonely too it may be out there in the vastness yet i never called him up again he is happy let him stay  indeed my acquaintance with the spirit world might have ended at that point but for the good offices once more of my friend  you find your greatgrandfather a little slow a little dull he said well then if you want brains power energy why not call up some of the spirits of the great men some of the leading men for instance of your greatgrandfathers time  youve said it i exclaimed ill call up napoleon bonaparte  i hurried to the agency  is it possible i asked for me to call up the emperor napoleon and talk to him  possible certainly it appeared that nothing was easier in the case of napoleon bonaparte the nominal fee had to be ten dollars in place of five but it seemed to me that if greatgrandfather cost five napoleon bonaparte at ten was cheapness itself  will it take long to get him i asked anxiously  well send out a tracer for him right away they said  like greatgrandfather napoleon was punctual that i will say for him if in any way i think less of napoleon bonaparte now than i did let me at least admit that a more punctual obliging willing man i never talked with  he came in two minutes  hes on the line now they said  i took up the receiver trembling  hello i called estce que cest lempereur napoleon a qui jai lhonneur de parler  hows that said napoleon  je demande si je suis en communication avec lempereur napoleon  oh said napoleon thats all right speak english  what i said in surprise you know english i always thought you couldnt speak a word of it  he was silent for a minute then he said  i picked it up over here its all right go right ahead  well i continued ive always admired you so much your wonderful brain and genius that i felt i wanted to speak to you and ask you how you are  happy said napoleon very happy  thats good i said thats fine and how is it out there all bright and beautiful eh  very beautiful said the emperor  and just where are you i continued somewhere out in the unspeakable i suppose eh  yes he answered out here beyond  thats good i said pretty happy eh  very happy said napoleon tell everybody how happy i am  i know i answered ill tell them all but just now ive a particular thing to ask weve got a big war on pretty well the whole world in it and i thought perhaps a few pointers from a man like you  but at this point the attendant touched me on the shoulder your time is up he said  i was about to offer to pay at once for two minutes more when a better idea struck me talk with napoleon id do better than that id call a whole war council of great spirits lay the war crisis before them and get the biggest brains that the world ever produced to work on how to win the war  who should i have let me see napoleon himself of course id bring him back and for the sea business the submarine problem id have nelson george washington naturally for the american end for politics say good old ben franklin the wisest old head that ever walked on american legs and witty too yes franklin certainly if only for his wit to keep the council from getting gloomy lincolnhonest old abehim certainly i must have those and perhaps a few others  i reckoned that a consultation at ten dollars apiece with spirits of that class was cheap to the verge of the ludicrous their advice ought to be worth millionsyes billionsto the cause  the agency got them for me without trouble there is no doubt they are a punctual crowd over there beyond in the unthinkable  i gathered them all in and talked to them all and severally the payment a merely nominal matter being made pro forma in advance  i have in front of me in my rough notes the result of their advice when properly drafted it will be i feel sure one of the most important state documents produced in the war  in the personal sensei have to admit iti found them just a trifle disappointing franklin poor fellow has apparently lost his wit the spirit of lincoln seemed to me to have none of that homely wisdom that he used to have and it appears that we were quite mistaken in thinking disraeli a brilliant man it is clear to me now that he was dulljust about as dull as greatgrandfather i should say washington too is not at all the kind of man we thought him  still these are only personal impressions they detract nothing from the extraordinary value of the advice given which seems to me to settle once and for ever any lingering doubt about the value of communications with the other side  my draft of their advice runs in part as follows  the spirit of nelson on being questioned on the submarine problem holds that if all the men on the submarines were where he is everything would be bright and happy this seems to me an invaluable hint there is nothing needed now except to put them there  the advice of the spirit of napoleon about the campaign on land seemed to me if possible of lower value than that of nelson on the campaign at sea it is hardly conceivable that napoleon has forgotten where the marne is but it may have changed since his day at any rate he says that if ever the russians cross the marne all is over coming from such a masterstrategist this ought to be attended to  franklin on being asked whether the united states had done right in going into the war said yes asked whether the country could with honour have stayed out he said no there is guidance here for thinking men of all ranks  lincoln is very happy where he is so too i was amazed to find is disraeli in fact it was most gratifying to learn that all of the great spirits consulted are very happy and want everybody to know how happy they are where they are i may say it is all bright and beautiful  fear of trespassing on their time prevented me from questioning each of them up to the full limit of the period contracted for  i understand that i have still to my credit at the agency five minutes talk with napoleon available at any time and similarly five minutes each with franklin and washington to say nothing of ten minutes unexpired time with greatgrandfather  all of these opportunities i am willing to dispose of at a reduced rate to anyone still sceptical of the reality of the spirit world     v the sorrows of a summer guest  let me admit as i start to write that the whole thing is my own fault i should never have come i knew better i have known better for years i have known that it is sheer madness to go and pay visits in other peoples houses  yet in a moment of insanity i have let myself in for it and here i am there is no hope no outlet now till the first of september when my visit is to terminate either that or death i do not greatly care which  i write this where no human eye can see me down by the pondthey call it the lakeat the foot of beverlyjoness estate it is six oclock in the morning no one is up for a brief hour or so there is peace but presently miss larkspurthe jolly english girl who arrived last weekwill throw open her casement window and call across the lawn hullo everybody what a ripping morning and young poppleson will call back in a swiss yodel from somewhere in the shrubbery and beverlyjones will appear on the piazza with big towels round his neck and shout whos coming for an early dip and so the days fun and jollityheaven help mewill begin again  presently they will all come trooping in to breakfast in coloured blazers and fancy blouses laughing and grabbing at the food with mimic rudeness and bursts of hilarity and to think that i might have been breakfasting at my club with the morning paper propped against the coffeepot in a silent room in the quiet of the city  i repeat that it is my own fault that i am here  for many years it had been a principle of my life to visit nobody i had long since learned that visiting only brings misery if i got a card or telegram that said wont you run up to the adirondacks and spend the weekend with us i sent back word no not unless the adirondacks can run faster than i can or words to that effect if the owner of a country house wrote to me our man will meet you with a trap any afternoon that you care to name i answered in spirit at least no he wont not unless he has a beartrap or one of those traps in which they catch wild antelope if any fashionable lady friend wrote to me in the peculiar jargon that they use can you give us from july the twelfth at halfafterthree till the fourteenth at four i replied madam take the whole month take a year but leave me in peace  such at least was the spirit of my answers to invitations in practice i used to find it sufficient to send a telegram that read crushed with work impossible to get away and then stroll back into the readingroom of the club and fall asleep again  but my coming here was my own fault it resulted from one of those unhappy moments of expansiveness such as occur i imagine to everybodymoments when one appears to be something quite different from what one really is when one feels oneself a thorough good fellow sociable merry appreciative and finds the people around one the same such moods are known to all of us some people say that it is the superself asserting itself others say it is from drinking but let it pass that at any rate was the kind of mood that i was in when i met beverlyjones and when he asked me here  it was in the afternoon at the club as i recall it we were drinking cocktails and i was thinking what a bright genial fellow beverlyjones was and how completely i had mistaken him for myselfi admit iti am a brighter better man after drinking two cocktails than at any other timequicker kindlier more genial and higher morally i had been telling stories in that inimitable way that one has after two cocktails in reality i only know four stories and a fifth that i dont quite remember but in moments of expansiveness they feel like a fund or flow  it was under such circumstances that i sat with beverlyjones and it was in shaking hands at leaving that he said i do wish old chap that you could run up to our summer place and give us the whole of august and i answered as i shook him warmly by the hand my dear fellow id simply love to by gad then its a go he said you must come up for august and wake us all up  wake them up ye gods me wake them up  one hour later i was repenting of my folly and wishing when i thought of the two cocktails that the prohibition wave could be hurried up so as to leave us all high and drybonedry silent and unsociable  then i clung to the hope that beverlyjones would forget but no in due time his wife wrote to me they were looking forward so much she said to my visit they feltshe repeated her husbands ominous phrasethat i should wake them all up  what sort of alarmclock did they take me for anyway  ah well they know better now it was only yesterday afternoon that beverlyjones found me standing here in the gloom of some cedartrees beside the edge of the pond and took me back so quietly to the house that i realized he thought i meant to drown myself so i did  i could have stood it bettermy coming here i meanif they hadnt come down to the station in a body to meet me in one of those long vehicles with seats down the sides sillylooking men in coloured blazers and girls with no hats all making a hullabaloo of welcome we are quite a small party mrs beverlyjones had written small great heavens what would they call a large one and even those at the station turned out to be only half of them there were just as many more all lined up on the piazza of the house as we drove up all waving a fool welcome with tennis rackets and golf clubs  small party indeed why after six days there are still some of the idiots whose names i havent got straight that fool with the fluffy moustache which is he and that jackass that made the salad at the picnic yesterday is he the brother of the woman with the guitar or who  but what i mean is there is something in that sort of noisy welcome that puts me to the bad at the start it always does a group of strangers all laughing together and with a set of catchwords and jokes all their own always throws me into a fit of sadness deeper than words i had thought when mrs beverlyjones said a small party she really meant small i had had a mental picture of a few sad people greeting me very quietly and gently and of myself quiet too but cheerfulsomehow lifting them up with no great effort by my mere presence  somehow from the very first i could feel that beverlyjones was disappointed in me he said nothing but i knew it on that first afternoon between my arrival and dinner he took me about his place to show it to me i wish that at some proper time i had learned just what it is that you say when a man shows you about his place i never knew before how deficient i am in it i am all right to be shown an ironandsteel plant or a sodawater factory or anything really wonderful but being shown a house and grounds and trees things that i have seen all my life leaves me absolutely silent  these big gates said beverlyjones we only put up this year  oh i said that was all why shouldnt they put them up this year i didnt care if theyd put them up this year or a thousand years ago  we had quite a struggle he continued before we finally decided on sandstone  you did eh i said there seemed nothing more to say i didnt know what sort of struggle he meant or who fought who and personally sandstone or soapstone or any other stone is all the same to me  this lawn said beverlyjones we laid down the first year we were here i answered nothing he looked me right in the face as he said it and i looked straight back at him but i saw no reason to challenge his statement the geraniums along the border he went on are rather an experiment theyre dutch  i looked fixedly at the geraniums but never said a word they were dutch all right why not they were an experiment very good let them be so i know nothing in particular to say about a dutch experiment  i could feel that beverlyjones grew depressed as he showed me round i was sorry for him but unable to help i realized that there were certain sections of my education that had been neglected how to be shown things and make appropriate comments seems to be an art in itself i dont possess it it is not likely now as i look at this pond that i ever shall  yet how simple a thing it seems when done by others i saw the difference at once the very next day the second day of my visit when beverlyjones took round young poppleton the man that i mentioned above who will presently give a swiss yodel from a clump of laurel bushes to indicate that the days fun has begun  poppleton i had known before slightly i used to see him at the club in club surroundings he always struck me as an ineffable young ass loud and talkative and perpetually breaking the silence rules yet i have to admit that in his summer flannels and with a straw hat on he can do things that i cant  these big gates began beverlyjones as he showed poppleton round the place with me trailing beside them we only put up this year  poppleton who has a summer place of his own looked at the gates very critically  now do you know what id have done with those gates if they were mine he said  no said beverlyjones  id have set them two feet wider apart theyre too narrow old chap too narrow poppleton shook his head sadly at the gates  we had quite a struggle said beverlyjones before we finally decided on sandstone  i realized that he had one and the same line of talk that he always used i resented it no wonder it was easy for him great mistake said poppleton too soft look at thishere he picked up a big stone and began pounding at the gatepostsee how easily it chips smashes right off look at that the whole corner knocks right off see  beverlyjones entered no protest i began to see that there is a sort of understanding a kind of freemasonry among men who have summer places one shows his things the other runs them down and smashes them this makes the whole thing easy at once beverlyjones showed his lawn  your turf is all wrong old boy said poppleton look it has no body to it see i can kick holes in it with my heel look at that and that if i had on stronger boots i could kick this lawn all to pieces  these geraniums along the border said beverlyjones are rather an experiment theyre dutch  but my dear fellow said poppleton youve got them set in wrongly they ought to slope from the sun you know never to it wait a bithere he picked up a spade that was lying where a gardener had been workingill throw a few out notice how easily they come up ah that fellow broke theyre apt to there i wont bother to reset them but tell your man to slope them over from the sun thats the idea  beverlyjones showed his new boathouse next and poppleton knocked a hole in the side with a hammer to show that the lumber was too thin  if that were my boathouse he said id rip the outside clean off it and use shingle and stucco  it was i noticed poppletons plan first to imagine beverlyjoness things his own and then to smash them and then give them back smashed to beverlyjones this seemed to please them both apparently it is a wellunderstood method of entertaining a guest and being entertained beverlyjones and poppleton after an hour or so of it were delighted with one another  yet somehow when i tried it myself it failed to work  do you know what i would do with that cedar summerhouse if it was mine i asked my host the next day  no he said  id knock the thing down and burn it i answered  but i think i must have said it too fiercely beverlyjones looked hurt and said nothing  not that these people are not doing all they can for me i know that i admit it if i should meet my end here and ifto put the thing straight outmy lifeless body is found floating on the surface of this pond i should like there to be documentary evidence of that much they are trying their best this is liberty hall mrs beverlyjones said to me on the first day of my visit we want you to feel that you are to do absolutely as you like  absolutely as i like how little they know me i should like to have answered madam i have now reached a time of life when human society at breakfast is impossible to me when any conversation prior to eleven am must be considered out of the question when i prefer to eat my meals in quiet or with such mild hilarity as can be got from a comic paper when i can no longer wear nankeen pants and a coloured blazer without a sense of personal indignity when i can no longer leap and play in the water like a young fish when i do not yodel cannot sing and to my regret dance even worse than i did when young and when the mood of mirth and hilarity comes to me only as a rare visitantshall we say at a burlesque performanceand never as a daily part of my existence madam i am unfit to be a summer guest if this is liberty hall indeed let me oh let me go  such is the speech that i would make if it were possible as it is i can only rehearse it to myself  indeed the more i analyse it the more impossible it seems for a man of my temperament at any rate to be a summer guest these people and i imagine all other summer people seem to be trying to live in a perpetual joke everything all day has to be taken in a mood of uproarious fun  however i can speak of it all now in quiet retrospect and without bitterness it will soon be over now indeed the reason why i have come down at this early hour to this quiet water is that things have reached a crisis the situation has become extreme and i must end it  it happened last night beverlyjones took me aside while the others were dancing the foxtrot to the victrola on the piazza  were planning to have some rather good fun tomorrow night he said something that will be a good deal more in your line than a lot of it im afraid has been up here in fact my wife says that this will be the very thing for you  oh i said  were going to get all the people from the other houses over and the girlsthis term beverlyjones uses to mean his wife and her friendsare going to get up a sort of entertainment with charades and things all impromptu more or less of course  oh i said i saw already what was coming  and they want you to act as a sort of masterofceremonies to make up the gags and introduce the different stunts and all that i was telling the girls about that afternoon at the club when you were simply killing us all with those funny stories of yours and theyre all wild over it  wild i repeated  yes quite wild over it they say it will be the hit of the summer  beverlyjones shook hands with great warmth as we parted for the night i knew that he was thinking that my character was about to be triumphantly vindicated and that he was glad for my sake  last night i did not sleep i remained awake all night thinking of the entertainment in my whole life i have done nothing in public except once when i presented a walkingstick to the vicepresident of our club on the occasion of his taking a trip to europe even for that i used to rehearse to myself far into the night sentences that began this walkingstick gentleman means far more than a mere walkingstick  and now they expect me to come out as a merry masterofceremonies before an assembled crowd of summer guests  but never mind it is nearly over now i have come down to this quiet water in the early morning to throw myself in they will find me floating here among the lilies some few will understand i can see it written as it will be in the newspapers  what makes the sad fatality doubly poignant is that the unhappy victim had just entered upon a holiday visit that was to have been prolonged throughout the whole month needless to say he was regarded as the life and soul of the pleasant party of holiday makers that had gathered at the delightful country home of mr and mrs beverlyjones indeed on the very day of the tragedy he was to have taken a leading part in staging a merry performance of charades and parlour entertainmentsa thing for which his genial talents and overflowing high spirits rendered him specially fit  when they read that those who know me best will understand how and why i died he had still over three weeks to stay there they will say he was to act as the stage manager of charades they will shake their heads they will understand  but what is this i raise my eyes from the paper and i see beverlyjones hurriedly approaching from the house he is hastily dressed with flannel trousers and a dressinggown his face looks grave something has happened thank god something has happened some accident some tragedy something to prevent the charades  i write these few lines on a fast train that is carrying me back to new york a cool comfortable train with a deserted clubcar where i can sit in a leather armchair with my feet up on another smoking silent and at peace  villages farms and summer places are flying by let them fly i too am flyingback to the rest and quiet of the city  old man beverlyjones said as he laid his hand on mine very kindlyhe is a decent fellow after all is jonestheyre calling you by longdistance from new york  what is it i asked or tried to gasp  its bad news old chap fire in your office last evening im afraid a lot of your private papers were burned robinsonthats your senior clerk isnt itseems to have been on the spot trying to save things hes badly singed about the face and hands im afraid you must go at once  yes yes i said at once  i know ive told the man to get the trap ready right away youve just time to catch the seventen come along  right i said i kept my face as well as i could trying to hide my exultation the office burnt fine robinsons singed glorious i hurriedly packed my things and whispered to beverlyjones farewell messages for the sleeping household i never felt so jolly and facetious in my life i could feel that beverlyjones was admiring the spirit and pluck with which i took my misfortune later on he would tell them all about it  the trap ready hurrah goodbye old man hurrah all right ill telegraph right you are goodbye hip hip hurrah here we are train right on time just these two bags porter and theres a dollar for you what merry merry fellows these darky porters are anyway  and so here i am in the train safe bound for home and the summer quiet of my club  well done for robinson i was afraid that it had missed fire or that my message to him had gone wrong it was on the second day of my visit that i sent word to him to invent an accidentsomething anythingto call me back i thought the message had failed i had lost hope but it is all right now though he certainly pitched the note pretty high  of course i cant let the beverlyjoneses know that it was a putup job i must set fire to the office as soon as i get back but its worth it and ill have to singe robinson about the face and hands but its worth that too     vi to nature and back again  it was probably owing to the fact that my place of lodgment in new york overlooked the waving trees of central park that i was consumed all the summer through with a great longing for the woods to me as a lover of nature the waving of a tree conveys thoughts which are never conveyed to me except by seeing a tree wave  this longing grew upon me i became restless with it in the daytime i dreamed over my work at night my sleep was broken and restless at times i would even wander forth at night into the park and there deep in the night shadow of the trees imagine myself alone in the recesses of the dark woods remote from the toil and fret of our distracted civilization  this increasing feeling culminated in the resolve which becomes the subject of this narrative the thought came to me suddenly one night i woke from my sleep with a plan fully matured in my mind it was this i would for one month cast off all the travail and cares of civilized life and become again the wild man of the woods that nature made me m  woods somewhere in new england divest myself of my clothesexcept only my union suitcrawl into the woods stay there a month and then crawl out again to a trained woodsman and crawler like myself the thing was simplicity itself for food i knew that i could rely on berries roots shoots mosses mushrooms fungi bungiin fact the whole of natures ample storehouse for my drink the running brook and the quiet pool and for my companions the twittering chipmunk the chickadee the chocktaw the choochoo the chowchow and the hundred and one inhabitants of the forgotten glade and the tangled thicket  fortunately for me my resolve came to me upon the last day in august the month of september was my vacation my time was my own i was free to go  on my rising in the morning my preparations were soon made or rather there were practically no preparations to make i had but to supply myself with a camera my one necessity in the woods and to say goodbye to my friends even this last ordeal i wished to make as brief as possible i had no wish to arouse their anxiety over the dangerous perhaps foolhardy project that i had in mind i wished as far as possible to say goodbye in such a way as to allay the very natural fears which my undertaking would excite in the minds of my friends  from myself although trained in the craft of the woods i could not conceal the danger that i incurred yet the danger was almost forgotten in the extraordinary and novel interest that attached to the experiment would it prove possible for a man unaided by our civilized arts and industries to maintain himself nakedexcept for his union suitin the heart of the woods could he do it or could he not and if he couldnt what then  but this last thought i put from me time alone could answer the question  as in duty bound i went first to the place of business where i am employed to shake hands and say goodbye to my employer  i am going i said to spend a month naked alone in the woods  he looked up from his desk with genial kindliness  thats right he said get a good rest  my plan is i added to live on berries and funguses  fine he answered well have a good time old mangoodbye  then i dropped in casually upon one of my friends  well i said im off to new england to spend a month naked  nantucket he said or newport  no i answered speaking as lightly as i could im going into the woods and stay there naked for a month  oh yes he said i see well goodbye old chapsee you when you get back  after that i called upon two or three other men to say a brief word of farewell i could not help feeling slightly nettled i must confess at the very casual way in which they seemed to take my announcement oh yes they said naked in the woods eh well tata till you get back  here was a man about to risk his lifefor there was no denying the factin a great sociological experiment yet they received the announcement with absolute unconcern it offered one more assurance had i needed it of the degenerate state of the civilization upon which i was turning my back  on my way to the train i happened to run into a newspaper reporter with whom i have some acquaintance  im just off i said to new england to spend a month nakedat least naked all but my union suitin the woods no doubt youll like a few details about it for your paper  thanks old man he said weve pretty well given up running that nature stuff we couldnt do anything with itunless of course anything happens to you then wed be glad to give you some space  several of my friends had at least the decency to see me off on the train one and one alone accompanied me on the long nightride to new england in order that he might bring back my clothes my watch and other possessions from the point where i should enter the woods together with such few messages of farewell as i might scribble at the last moment  it was early morning when we arrived at the wayside station where we were to alight from here we walked to the edge of the woods arrived at this point we halted i took off my clothes with the exception of my union suit then taking a pot of brown stain from my valise i proceeded to dye my face and hands and my union suit itself a deep butternut brown  whats that for asked my friend  for protection i answered dont you know that all animals are protected by their peculiar markings that render them invisible the caterpillar looks like the leaf it eats from the scales of the fish counterfeit the glistening water of the brook the bear and the possum are coloured like the treetrunks on which they climb there i added as i concluded my task i am now invisible  gee said my friend  i handed him back the valise and the empty paintpot dropped to my hands and kneesmy camera slung about my neckand proceeded to crawl into the bush my friend stood watching me  why dont you stand up and walk i heard him call  i turned half round and growled at him then i plunged deeper into the bush growling as i went  after ten minutes active crawling i found myself in the heart of the forest it reached all about me on every side for hundreds of miles all around me was the unbroken stillness of the woods not a sound reached my ear save the twittering of a squirrel or squirl in the branches high above my head or the fardistant call of a loon hovering over some woodland lake  i judged that i had reached a spot suitable for my habitation  my first care was to make a fire difficult though it might appear to the degenerate dweller of the city to do this to the trained woodsman such as i had now become it is nothing i selected a dry stick rubbed it vigorously against my hind leg and in a few moments it broke into a generous blaze half an hour later i was sitting beside a glowing fire of twigs discussing with great gusto an appetizing mess of boiled grass and fungi cooked in a hollow stone  i ate my fill not pausing till i was full careless as the natural man ever is of the morrow then stretched out upon the pineneedles at the foot of a great tree i lay in drowsy contentment listening to the song of the birds the hum of the myriad insects and the strident note of the squirrel high above me at times i would give utterance to the soft answering call known to every woodsman that is part of the freemasonry of animal speech as i lay thus i would not have exchanged places with the pale dweller in the city for all the wealth in the world here i lay remote from the world happy full of grass listening to the crooning of the birds  but the mood of inaction and reflection cannot last even with the lover of nature it was time to be up and doing much lay before me to be done before the setting of the sun should bring with it as i fully expected it would darkness before night fell i must build a house make myself a suit of clothes lay in a store of nuts and in short prepare myself for the oncoming of winter which in the bush may come on at any time in the summer  i rose briskly from the ground to my hands and knees and set myself to the building of my house the method that i intended to follow here was merely that which nature has long since taught to the beaver and which moreover is known and practised by the gauchos of the pampas by the googoos of rhodesia and by many other tribes i had but to select a suitable growth of trees and gnaw them down with my teeth taking care so to gnaw them that each should fall into the place appointed for it in the building the sides once erected in this fashion another row of trees properly situated is gnawed down to fall crosswise as the roof  i set myself briskly to work and in half an hour had already the satisfaction of seeing my habitation rising into shape i was still gnawing with unabated energy when i was interrupted by a low growling in the underbrush with animal caution i shrank behind a tree growling in return i could see something moving in the bushes evidently an animal of large size from its snarl i judged it to be a bear i could hear it moving nearer to me it was about to attack me a savage joy thrilled through me at the thought while my union suit bristled with rage from head to foot as i emitted growl after growl of defiance i bared my teeth to the gums snarling and lashed my flank with my hind foot eagerly i watched for the onrush of the bear in savage combat who strikes first wins it was my idea as soon as the bear should appear to bite off its front legs one after the other this initial advantage once gained i had no doubt of ultimate victory  the brushes parted i caught a glimpse of a long brown body and a hairy head then the creature reared up breasting itself against a log full in front of me great heavens it was not a bear at all it was a man  he was dressed as i was in a union suit and his face and hands like mine were stained a butternut brown his hair was long and matted and two weeks stubble of beard was on his face  for a minute we both glared at one another still growling then the man rose up to a standing position with a muttered exclamation of disgust  ah cut it out he said lets talk english  he walked over towards me and sat down upon a log in an attitude that seemed to convey the same disgust as the expression of his features then he looked round about him  what are you doing he said  building a house i answered  i know he said with a nod what are you here for  why i explained my plan is this i want to see whether a man can come out here in the woods naked with no aid but that of his own hands and his own ingenuity and  yes yes i know interrupted the disconsolate man earn himself a livelihood in the wilderness live as the caveman lived carefree and far from the curse of civilization  thats it that was my idea i said my enthusiasm rekindling as i spoke thats what im doing my food is to be the rude grass and the roots that nature furnishes for her children and for my drink  yes yes he interrupted again with impatience for your drink the running rill for your bed the sweet couch of hemlock and for your canopy the open sky lit with the soft stars in the deeppurple vault of the dewy night i know  great heavens man i exclaimed thats my idea exactly in fact those are my very phrases how could you have guessed it  he made a gesture with his hand to indicate weariness and disillusionment  pshaw he said i know it because ive been doing it ive been here a fortnight now on this openair lifeinthewoods game well im sick of it this last lets me out  what last i asked  why meeting you do you realize that you are the nineteenth man that ive met in the last three days running about naked in the woods theyre all doing it the woods are full of them  you dont say so i gasped  fact wherever you go in the bush you find naked men all working out this same blasted old experiment why when you get a little farther in youll see signs up naked men not allowed in this bush and naked men keep off and gentlemen who are naked will kindly keep to the high road and a lot of things like that you must have come in at a wrong place or youd have noticed the little shanties that they have now at the edge of the new england bush with signs up union suits bought and sold cameras for sale or to rent highest price for castoff clothing and all that sort of thing  no i said i saw nothing  well you look when you go back as for me im done with it the things worked out im going back to the city to see whether i cant right there in the heart of the city earn myself a livelihood with my unaided hands and brains thats the real problem no more bumming on the animals for me this bush business is too easy well goodbye im off  but stop a minute i said how is it that if what you say is true i havent seen or heard anybody in the bush and ive been here since the middle of the morning  nonsense the man answered they were probably all round you but you didnt recognize them  no no its not possible i lay here dreaming beneath a tree and there wasnt a sound except the twittering of a squirrel and far away the cry of a lakeloon nothing else  exactly the twittering of a squirrel that was some feller up the tree twittering to beat the band to let on that he was a squirrel and no doubt some other feller calling out like a loon over near the lake i suppose you gave them the answering cry  i did i said i gave that low guttural note which  preciselywhich is the universal greeting in the freemasonry of animal speech i see youve got it all down pat well goodbye again im off oh dont bother to growl please im sick of that line of stuff  goodbye i said  he slid through the bushes and disappeared i sat where i was musing my work interrupted a mood of bitter disillusionment heavy upon me so i sat it may have been for hours  in the far distance i could hear the faint cry of a bittern in some lonely marsh  now who the deuce is making that noise i muttered some silly fool i suppose trying to think hes a waterfowl cut it out  long i lay my dream of the woods shattered wondering what to do  then suddenly there came to my ear the loud sound of voices human voices strident and eager with nothing of the animal growl in them  hes in there i seen him i heard some one call  rapidly i dived sideways into the underbrush my animal instinct strong upon me again growling as i went instinctively i knew that it was i that they were after all the animal joy of being hunted came over me my union suit stood up on end with mingled fear and rage  as fast as i could i retreated into the wood yet somehow as i moved the wood instead of growing denser seemed to thin out i crouched low still growling and endeavouring to bury myself in the thicket i was filled with a wild sense of exhilaration such as any lover of the wild life would feel at the knowledge that he is being chased that some one is after him that some one is perhaps just a few feet behind him waiting to stick a pitchfork into him as he runs there is no ecstasy like this  then i realized that my pursuers had closed in on me i was surrounded on all sides  the woods had somehow grown thin they were like the mere shrubbery of a parkit might be of central park itself i could hear among the deeper tones of men the shrill voices of boys there he is one cried going through them bushes look at him humping himself what is it whats the sport another called some crazy guy loose in the park in his underclothes and the cops after him  then they closed in on me i recognized the blue suits of the police force and their short clubs in a few minutes i was dragged out of the shrubbery and stood in the open park in my pyjamas wide awake shivering in the chilly air of early morning  fortunately for me it was decided at the policecourt that sleepwalking is not an offence against the law i was dismissed with a caution  my vacation is still before me and i still propose to spend it naked but i shall do so at atlantic city     vii the caveman as he is  i think it likely that few people besides myself have ever actually seen and spoken with a caveman  yet everybody nowadays knows all about the caveman the fifteencent magazines and the new fiction have made him a familiar figure a few years ago it is true nobody had ever heard of him but lately for some reason or other there has been a run on the caveman no uptodate story is complete without one or two references to him the hero when the heroine slights him is said to feel for a moment the wild primordial desire of the caveman the longing to seize her to drag her with him to carry her away to make her his when he takes her in his arms it is recorded that all the elemental passion of the caveman surges through him when he fights on her behalf against a drayman or a gunman or an iceman or any other compound that makes up a modern villain he is said to feel all the fierce fighting joy of the caveman if they kick him in the ribs he likes it if they beat him over the head he never feels it because he is for the moment a caveman and the caveman is and is known to be quite above sensation  the heroine too shares the same point of view take me she murmurs as she falls into the heros embrace be my caveman as she says it there is so the writer assures us something of the fierce light of the cavewoman in her eyes the primordial woman to be wooed and won only by force  so like everybody else i had till i saw him a great idea of the caveman i had a clear mental picture of himhuge brawny muscular a wolfskin thrown about him and a great warclub in his hand i knew him as without fear with nerves untouched by our effete civilization fighting as the beasts fight to the death killing without pity and suffering without a moan  it was a picture that i could not but admire  i liked tooi am free to confess ithis peculiar way with women his system was as i understood it to take them by the neck and bring them along with him that was his fierce primordial way of wooing them and they liked it so at least we are informed by a thousand credible authorities they liked it and the modern woman so we are told would still like it if only one dared to try it on theres the trouble if one only dared  i see lots of themill be frank about itthat i should like to grab to sling over my shoulder and carry away with me or what is the same thing allowing for modern conditions have an express man carry them i notice them at atlantic city i see them in fifth avenueyes everywhere but would they come thats the deuce of it would they come right along like the cavewoman merely biting off my ear as they came or are they degenerate enough to bring an action against me indicting the express company as a party of the second part  doubts such as these prevent me from taking active measures but they leave me as they leave many another man preoccupied and fascinated with the caveman  one may imagine then my extraordinary interest in him when i actually met him in the flesh yet the thing came about quite simply indeed more by accident than by design an adventure open to all  it so happened that i spent my vacation in kentuckythe region as everybody knows of the great caves they extendit is a matter of common knowledgefor hundreds of miles in some places dark and sunless tunnels the black silence broken only by the dripping of the water from the roof in other places great vaults like subterranean temples with vast stone arches sweeping to the dome and with deep still water of unfathomed depth as the floor and here and there again they are lighted from above through rifts in the surface of the earth and are dry and sand strewnfit for human habitation  in such caves as theseso has the obstinate legend run for centuriesthere still dwell cavemen the dwindling remnant of their race and here it was that i came across him  i had penetrated into the caves far beyond my guides i carried a revolver and had with me an electric lantern but the increasing sunlight in the cave as i went on had rendered the latter needless  there he sat a huge figure clad in a great wolfskin besides him lay a great club across his knee was a spear round which he was binding sinews that tightened under his muscular hand his head was bent over his task his matted hair had fallen over his eyes he did not see me till i was close beside him on the sanded floor of the cave i gave a slight cough  excuse me i said  the caveman gave a startled jump  my goodness he said you startled me  i could see that he was quite trembling  you came along so suddenly he said it gave me the jumps then he muttered more to himself than to me too much of this darned cavewater i must quit drinking it  i sat down near to the caveman on a stone taking care to place my revolver carefully behind it i dont mind admitting that a loaded revolver especially as i get older makes me nervous i was afraid that he might start fooling with it one cant be too careful  as a way of opening conversation i picked up the cavemans club  say i said thats a great club you have eh by gee its heavy  look out said the caveman with a certain agitation in his voice as he reached out and took the club from me dont fool with that club its loaded you know you could easily drop the club on your toes or on mine a man cant be too careful with a loaded club  he rose as he said this and carried the club to the other side of the cave where he leant it against the wall now that he stood up and i could examine him he no longer looked so big in fact he was not big at all the effect of size must have come i think from the great wolfskin that he wore i have noticed the same thing in grand opera i noticed too for the first time that the cave we were in seemed fitted up in a rude sort of way like a dwellingroom  this is a nice place youve got i said  dandy isnt it he said as he cast his eyes around she fixed it up shes got great taste see that mud sideboard thats the real thing aone mud none of your cheap rock about that we fetched that mud for two miles to make that and look at that wicker bucket isnt it great hardly leaks at all except through the sides and perhaps a little through the bottom she wove that shes a humdinger at weaving  he was moving about as he spoke showing me all his little belongings he reminded me for all the world of a man in a harlem flat showing a visitor how convenient it all is somehow too the caveman had lost all appearance of size he looked in fact quite little and when he had pushed his long hair back from his forehead he seemed to wear that same worried apologetic look that we all have to a higher being if there is such our little faces one and all appear no doubt pathetic  i knew that he must be speaking about his wife  where is she i asked  my wife he said oh shes gone out somewhere through the caves with the kid you didnt meet our kid as you came along did you no well hes the greatest boy you even saw he was only two this nineteenth of august and you should hear him say pop and mom just as if he was grown up he is really i think about the brightest boy ive ever knowni mean quite apart from being his father and speaking of him as if he were anyone elses boy you didnt meet them  no i said i didnt  oh well the caveman went on there are lots of ways and passages through i guess they went in another direction the wife generally likes to take a stroll round in the morning and see some of the neighbours but say he interrupted i guess im forgetting my manners let me get you a drink of cavewater here take it in this stone mug there you are say when where do we get it oh we find it in parts of the cave where it filters through the soil above alcoholic oh yes about fifteen per cent i think some say it soaks all through the soil of this state sit down and be comfortable and say if you hear the woman coming just slip your mug behind that stone out of sight do you mind now try one of these elmroot cigars oh pick a good onethere are lots of them  we seated ourselves in some comfort on the soft sand our backs against the boulders sipping cavewater and smoking elmroot cigars it seemed altogether as if one were back in civilization talking to a genial host  yes said the caveman and he spoke as it were in a large and patronizing way i generally let my wife trot about as she likes in the daytime she and the other women nowadays are getting up all these different movements and the way i look at it is that if it amuses her to run around and talk and attend meetings why let her do it of course he continued assuming a look of great firmness if i liked to put my foot down  exactly exactly i said its the same way with us  is it now he questioned with interest i had imagined that it was all different outside youre from the outside arent you i guessed you must be from the skins you wear  have you never been outside i asked  no fear said the caveman not for mine down here in the caves clean underground and mostly in the dark its all right its nice and safe he gave a sort of shudder gee you fellows out there must have your nerve to go walking around like that on the outside rim of everything where the stars might fall on you or a thousand things happen to you but then you outside men have got a natural elemental fearlessness about you that we cavemen have lost i tell you i was pretty scared when i looked up and saw you standing there  had you never seen any outside men i asked  why yes he answered but never close the most ive done is to go out to the edges of the cave sometimes and look out and see them outside men and women in the distance but of course in one way or another we cavemen know all about them and the thing we envy most in you outside men is the way you treat your women by gee you take no nonsense from themyou fellows are the real primordial primitive men weve lost it somehow  why my dear fellow i began  but the caveman who had sat suddenly upright interrupted  quick quick he said hide that infernal mug shes coming dont you hear  as he spoke i caught the sound of a womans voice somewhere in the outer passages of the cave  now willie she was saying speaking evidently to the cavechild you come right along back with me and if i ever catch you getting in such a mess as that again ill never take you anywhere so there  her voice had grown louder she entered the cave as she spokea bigboned woman in a suit of skins leading by the hand a pathetic little mite in a rabbitskin with blue eyes and a slobbered face  but as i was sitting the cavewoman evidently couldnt see me for she turned at once to speak to her husband unconscious of my presence  well of all the idle creatures she exclaimed loafing here in the sandshe gave a sniffand smoking  my dear began the caveman  dont you mydear me she answered look at this place nothing tidied up yet and the day half through did you put the alligator on to boil  i was just going to say began the caveman  going to say yes i dont doubt you were going to say youd go on saying all day if id let you what im asking you is is the alligator on to boil for dinner or is it notmy gracious she broke off all of a sudden as she caught sight of me why didnt you say there was company land sakes and you sit there and never say there was a gentleman here  she had hustled across the cave and was busily arranging her hair with a pool of water as a mirror  gracious she said im a perfect fright you must excuse me she added looking round toward me for being in this state id just slipped on this old fur blouse and run around to a neighbours and id no idea that he was going to bring in company just like him im afraid weve nothing but a plain alligator stew to offer you but im sure if youll stay to dinner  she was hustling about already good primitive housewife that she was making the stoneplates rattle on the mud table  why really i began but i was interrupted by a sudden exclamation from both the caveman and the cavewoman together  willie wheres willie  gracious cried the woman hes wandered out aloneoh hurry look for him something might get him he may have fallen in the water oh hurry  they were off in a moment shouting into the dark passages of the outer cave willie willie there was agonized anxiety in their voices  and then in a moment as it seemed they were back again with willie in their arms blubbering his rabbitskin all wet  goodness gracious said the cavewoman hed fallen right in the poor little man hurry dear and get something dry to wrap him in goodness what a fright quick darling give me something to rub him with  anxiously the caveparents moved about beside the child all quarrel vanished  but surely i said as they calmed down a little just there where willie fell in beside the passage that i came through there is only three inches of water  so there is they said both together but just suppose it had been three feet  later on when willie was restored they both renewed their invitation to me to stay to dinner  didnt you say said the caveman that you wanted to make some notes on the difference between cavepeople and the people of your world of today  i thank you i answered i have already all the notes i want     viii ideal interviews     i with a european prince  with any european prince travelling in america  on receiving our card the prince to our great surprise and pleasure sent down a most cordial message that he would be delighted to see us at once this thrilled us  take us we said to the elevator boy to the apartments of the prince we were pleased to see him stagger and lean against his wheel to get his breath back  in a few moments we found ourselves crossing the threshold of the princes apartments the prince who is a charming young man of from twentysix to twentyseven came across the floor to meet us with an extended hand and a simple gesture of welcome we have seldom seen anyone come across the floor more simply  the prince who is travelling incognito as the count of flim flam was wearing when we saw him the plain morning dress of a gentleman of leisure we learned that a little earlier he had appeared at breakfast in the costume of a unitarian clergyman under the incognito of the bishop of bongee while later on he appeared at lunch as a delicate compliment to our city in the costume of a columbia professor of yiddish  the prince greeted us with the greatest cordiality seated himself without the slightest affectation and motioned to us with indescribable bonhomie his permission to remain standing  well said the prince what is it  we need hardly say that the prince who is a consummate master of ten languages speaks english quite as fluently as he does chinese indeed for a moment we could scarcely tell which he was talking  what are your impressions of the united states we asked as we took out our notebook  i am afraid answered the prince with the delightful smile which is characteristic of him and which we noticed again and again during the interview that i must scarcely tell you that  we realized immediately that we were in the presence not only of a soldier but of one of the most consummate diplomats of the present day  may we ask then we resumed correcting our obvious blunder what are your impressions prince of the atlantic ocean  ah said the prince with that peculiar thoughtfulness which is so noticeable in him and which we observed not once but several times the atlantic  volumes could not have expressed his thought better  did you we asked see any ice during your passage across  ah said the prince ice let me think  we did so  ice repeated the prince thoughtfully  we realized that we were in the presence not only of a soldier a linguist and a diplomat but of a trained scientist accustomed to exact research  ice repeated the prince did i see any ice no  nothing could have been more decisive more final than the clear simple brevity of the princes no he had seen no ice he knew he had seen no ice he said he had seen no ice nothing could have been more straightforward more direct we felt assured from that moment that the prince had not seen any ice  the exquisite good taste with which the prince had answered our question served to put us entirely at our ease and we presently found ourselves chatting with his highness with the greatest freedom and without the slightest gene or mauvaise honte or in fact malvoisie of any kind  we realized indeed that we were in the presence not only of a trained soldier a linguist and a diplomat but also of a conversationalist of the highest order  his highness who has an exquisite sense of humourindeed it broke out again and again during our talk with himexpressed himself as both amused and perplexed over our american money  it is very difficult he said with us it is so simple six and a half groner are equal to one and a third grossgroner or the quarter part of our rigsdaler here it is so complicated  we ventured to show the prince a fiftycent piece and to explain its value by putting two quarters beside it  i see said the prince whose mathematical ability is quite exceptional two twentyfivecent pieces are equal to one fiftycent piece i must try to remember that meantime he added with a gesture of royal condescension putting the money in his pocket i will keep your coins as instructorswe murmured our thanksand now explain to me please your fivedollar gold piece and your tendollar eagle  we felt it proper however to shift the subject and asked the prince a few questions in regard to his views on american politics we soon found that his highness although this is his first visit to this continent is a keen student of our institutions and our political life indeed his altitude showed by his answers to our questions that he is as well informed about our politics as we are ourselves on being asked what he viewed as the uppermost tendency in our political life of today the prince replied thoughtfully that he didnt know to our inquiry as to whether in his opinion democracy was moving forward or backward the prince after a moment of reflection answered that he had no idea on our asking which of the generals of our civil war was regarded in europe as the greatest strategist his highness answered without hesitation george washington  before closing our interview the prince who like his illustrious father is an enthusiastic sportsman completely turned the tables on us by inquiring eagerly about the prospects for large game in america  we told him somethingas much as we could recollectof woodchuck hunting in our own section of the country the prince was interested at once his eye lighted up and the peculiar air of fatigue or languor which we had thought to remark on his face during our interview passed entirely off his features he asked us a number of questions quickly and without pausing with the air in fact of a man accustomed to command and not to listen how was the woodchuck hunted from horseback or from an elephant or from an armoured car or turret how many beaters did one use to beat up the woodchuck what bearers was it necessary to carry with one how great a danger must one face of having ones beaters killed what percentage of risk must one be prepared to incur of accidentally shooting ones own beaters what did a bearer cost and so on  all these questions we answered as best we could the prince apparently seizing the gist or essential part of our answer before we had said it  in concluding the discussion we ventured to ask his highness for his autograph the prince who has perhaps a more exquisite sense of humour than any other sovereign of europe declared with a laugh that he had no pen still roaring over this inimitable drollery we begged the prince to honour us by using our own fountainpen  is there any ink in it asked the princewhich threw us into a renewed paroxysm of laughter  the prince took the pen and very kindly autographed for us seven photographs of himself he offered us more but we felt that seven was about all we could use we were still suffocated with laughter over the princes wit his highness was still signing photographs when an equerry appeared and whispered in the princes ear his highness with the consummate tact to be learned only at a court turned quietly without a word and left the room  we never in all our experience remember seeing a princeor a mere man for the matter of thatleave a room with greater suavity discretion or aplomb it was a revelation of breeding of race of long slavery to caste and yet with it all it seemed to have a touch of finality about ita hint that the entire proceeding was deliberate planned not to be altered by circumstance he did not come back  we understand that he appeared later in the morning at a civic reception in the costume of an alpine jaeger and attended the matinee in the dress of a lieutenant of police  meantime he has our pen if he turns up in any costume that we can spot at sight we shall ask him for it     ii with our greatest actor     that is to say with any one of    our sixteen greatest actors  it was within the privacy of his own library that we obtainedneed we say with infinite difficultyour interview with the great actor he was sitting in a deep armchair so buried in his own thoughts that he was oblivious of our approach on his knee before him lay a cabinet photograph of himself his eyes seemed to be peering into it as if seeking to fathom its unfathomable mystery we had time to note that a beautiful carbon photogravure of himself stood on a table at his elbow while a magnificent halftone pastel of himself was suspended on a string from the ceiling it was only when we had seated ourself in a chair and taken out our notebook that the great actor looked up  an interview he said and we noted with pain the weariness in his tone another interview  we bowed  publicity he murmured rather to himself than to us publicity why must one always be forced into publicity  it was not our intention we explained apologetically to publish or to print a single word  eh what exclaimed the great actor not print it not publish it then what in  not we explained without his consent  ah he murmured wearily my consent yes yes i must give it the world demands it print publish anything you like i am indifferent to praise careless of fame posterity will judge me but he added more briskly let me see a proof of it in time to make any changes i might care to  we bowed our assent  and now we began may we be permitted to ask a few questions about your art and first in which branch of the drama do you consider that your genius chiefly lies in tragedy or in comedy  in both said the great actor  you excel then we continued in neither the one nor the other  not at all he answered i excel in each of them  excuse us we said we havent made our meaning quite clear what we meant to say is stated very simply that you do not consider yourself better in either of them than in the other  not at all said the actor as he put out his arm with that splendid gesture that we have known and admired for years at the same time throwing back his leonine head so that his leonine hair fell back from his leonine forehead not at all i do better in both of them my genius demands both tragedy and comedy at the same time  ah we said as a light broke in upon us then that we presume is the reason why you are about to appear in shakespeare  the great actor frowned  i would rather put it he said that shakespeare is about to appear in me  of course of course we murmured ashamed of our own stupidity  i appear went on the great actor in hamlet i expect to present i may say an entirely new hamlet  a new hamlet we exclaimed fascinated a new hamlet is such a thing possible  entirely said the great actor throwing his leonine head forward again i have devoted years of study to the part the whole conception of the part of hamlet has been wrong  we sat stunned  all actors hitherto continued the great actor or rather i should say all socalled actorsi mean all those who tried to act before mehave been entirely mistaken in their presentation they have presented hamlet as dressed in black velvet  yes yes we interjected in black velvet yes  very good the thing is absurd continued the great actor as he reached down two or three heavy volumes from the shelf beside him have you ever studied the elizabethan era  the which we asked modestly  the elizabethan era  we were silent  or the preshakespearean tragedy  we hung our head  if you had you would know that a hamlet in black velvet is perfectly ridiculous in shakespeares dayas i could prove in a moment if you had the intelligence to understand itthere was no such thing as black velvet it didnt exist  and how then we asked intrigued puzzled and yet delighted do you present hamlet  in brown velvet said the great actor  great heavens we exclaimed this is a revolution  it is but that is only one part of my conception the main thing will be my presentation of what i may call the psychology of hamlet  the psychology we said  yes resumed the great actor the psychology to make hamlet understood i want to show him as a man bowed down by a great burden he is overwhelmed with weltschmerz he carries in him the whole weight of the zeitgeist in fact everlasting negation lies on him  you mean we said trying to speak as cheerfully as we could that things are a little bit too much for him  his will went on the great actor disregarding our interruption is paralysed he seeks to move in one direction and is hurled in another one moment he sinks into the abyss the next he rises above the clouds his feet seek the ground but find only the air  wonderful we said but will you not need a good deal of machinery  machinery exclaimed the great actor with a leonine laugh the machinery of thought the mechanism of power of magnetism  ah we said electricity  not at all said the great actor you fail to understand it is all done by my rendering take for example the famous soliloquy on death you know it  to be or not to be we began  stop said the great actor now observe it is a soliloquy precisely that is the key to it it is something that hamlet says to himself not a word of it in my interpretation is actually spoken all is done in absolute unbroken silence  how on earth we began can you do that  entirely and solely with my face  good heavens was it possible we looked again this time very closely at the great actors face we realized with a thrill that it might be done  i come before the audience so he went on and soliloquizethusfollow my face please  as the great actor spoke he threw himself into a characteristic pose with folded arms while gust after gust of emotion of expression of alternate hope doubt and despair sweptwe might say chased themselves across his features  wonderful we gasped  shakespeares lines said the great actor as his face subsided to its habitual calm are not necessary not at least with my acting the lines indeed are mere stage directions nothing more i leave them out this happens again and again in the play take for instance the familiar scene where hamlet holds the skull in his hand shakespeare here suggests the words alas poor yorick i knew him well  yes yes we interrupted in spite of ourself a fellow of infinite jest  your intonation is awful said the actor but listen in my interpretation i use no words at all i merely carry the skull quietly in my hand very slowly across the stage there i lean against a pillar at the side with the skull in the palm of my hand and look at it in silence  wonderful we said  i then cross over to the right of the stage very impressively and seat myself on a plain wooden bench and remain for some time looking at the skull  marvellous  i then pass to the back of the stage and lie down on my stomach still holding the skull before my eyes after holding this posture for some time i crawl slowly forward portraying by the movement of my legs and stomach the whole sad history of yorick finally i turn my back on the audience still holding the skull and convey through the spasmodic movements of my back hamlets passionate grief at the loss of his friend  why we exclaimed beside ourself with excitement this is not merely a revolution it is a revelation  call it both said the great actor  the meaning of it is we went on that you practically dont need shakespeare at all  exactly i do not i could do better without him shakespeare cramps me what i really mean to convey is not shakespeare but something greater largerhow shall i express itbigger the great actor paused and we waited our pencil poised in the air then he murmured as his eyes lifted in an expression of something like rapture in factme  he remained thus motionless without moving we slipped gently to our hands and knees and crawled quietly to the door and so down the stairs our notebook in our teeth     iii with our greatest scientist  as seen in any of our college laboratories  it was among the retorts and testtubes of his physical laboratory that we were privileged to interview the great scientist his back was towards us when we entered with characteristic modesty he kept it so for some time after our entry even when he turned round and saw us his face did not react off us as we should have expected  he seemed to look at us if such a thing were possible without seeing us or at least without wishing to see us  we handed him our card  he took it read it dropped it in a bowlful of sulphuric acid and then with a quiet gesture of satisfaction turned again to his work  we sat for some time behind him this then we thought to ourselves we always think to ourselves when we are left alone is the man or rather is the back of the man who has done more here we consulted the notes given us by our editor to revolutionize our conception of atomic dynamics than the back of any other man  presently the great scientist turned towards us with a sigh that seemed to our ears to have a note of weariness in it something we felt must be making him tired  what can i do for you he said  professor we answered we have called upon you in response to an overwhelming demand on the part of the public  the great scientist nodded  to learn something of your new researches and discoveries in here we consulted a minute card which we carried in our pocket in radioactiveemanations which are already becoming we consulted our card again a household word  the professor raised his hand as if to check us  i would rather say he murmured helioradioactive  so would we we admitted much rather  after all said the great scientist helium shares in the most intimate degree the properties of radium so too for the matter of that he added in afterthought do thorium and borium  even borium we exclaimed delighted and writing rapidly in our notebook already we saw ourselves writing up as our headline borium shares properties of thorium  just what is it said the great scientist that you want to know  professor we answered what our journal wants is a plain and simple explanation so clear that even our readers can understand it of the new scientific discoveries in radium we understand that you possess more than any other man the gift of clear and lucid thought  the professor nodded  and that you are able to express yourself with greater simplicity than any two men now lecturing  the professor nodded again  now then we said spreading our notes on our knee go at it tell us and through us tell a quarter of a million anxious readers just what all these new discoveries are about  the whole thing said the professor warming up to his work as he perceived from the motions of our face and ears our intelligent interest is simplicity itself i can give it to you in a word  thats it we said give it to us that way  it amounts if one may boil it down into a phrase  boil it boil it we interrupted  amounts if one takes the mere gist of it  take it we said take it  amounts to the resolution of the ultimate atom  ha we exclaimed  i must ask you first to clear your mind the professor continued of all conception of ponderable magnitude  we nodded we had already cleared our mind of this  in fact added the professor with what we thought a quiet note of warning in his voice i need hardly tell you that what we are dealing with must be regarded as altogether ultramicroscopic  we hastened to assure the professor that in accordance with the high standards of honour represented by our journal we should of course regard anything that he might say as ultramicroscopic and treat it accordingly  you say then we continued that the essence of the problem is the resolution of the atom do you think you can give us any idea of what the atom is  the professor looked at us searchingly  we looked back at him openly and frankly the moment was critical for our interview could he do it were we the kind of person that he could give it to could we get it if he did  i think i can he said let us begin with the assumption that the atom is an infinitesimal magnitude very good let us grant then that though it is imponderable and indivisible it must have a spacial content you grant me this  we do we said we do more than this we give it to you  very well if spacial it must have dimension if dimensionform let us assume ex hypothesi the form to be that of a spheroid and see where it leads us  the professor was now intensely interested he walked to and fro in his laboratory his features worked with excitement we worked ours too as sympathetically as we could  there is no other possible method in inductive science he added than to embrace some hypothesis the most attractive that one can find and remain with it  we nodded even in our own humble life after our days work we had found this true  now said the professor planting himself squarely in front of us assuming a spherical form and a spacial content assuming the dynamic forces that are familiar to us and assumingthe thing is bold i admit  we looked as bold as we could  assuming that the ions or nuclei of the atomi know no better word  neither do we we said  that the nuclei move under the energy of such forces what have we got  ha we said  what have we got why the simplest matter conceivable the forces inside our atomitself mind you the function of a circlemark that  we did  becomes merely a function of pi  the great scientist paused with a laugh of triumph  a function of pi we repeated in delight  precisely our conception of ultimate matter is reduced to that of an oblate spheroid described by the revolution of an ellipse on its own minor axis  good heavens we said merely that  nothing else and in that case any further calculation becomes a mere matter of the extraction of a root  how simple we murmured  is it not said the professor in fact i am accustomed in talking to my class to give them a very clear idea by simply taking as our root ff being any finite constant  he looked at us sharply we nodded  and raising f to the log of infinity i find they apprehend it very readily  do they we murmured ourselves we felt as if the log of infinity carried us to ground higher than what we commonly care to tread on  of course said the professor the log of infinity is an unknown  of course we said very gravely we felt ourselves here in the presence of something that demanded our reverence  but still continued the professor almost jauntily we can handle the unknown just as easily as anything else  this puzzled us we kept silent we thought it wiser to move on to more general ground in any case our notes were now nearly complete  these discoveries then we said are absolutely revolutionary  they are said the professor  you have now as we understand got the atomhow shall we put itgot it where you want it  not exactly said the professor with a sad smile  what do you mean we asked  unfortunately our analysis perfect though it is stops short we have no synthesis  the professor spoke as in deep sorrow  no synthesis we moaned we felt it was a cruel blow but in any case our notes were now elaborate enough we felt that our readers could do without a synthesis we rose to go  synthetic dynamics said the professor taking us by the coat is only beginning  in that case we murmured disengaging his hand  but wait wait he pleaded wait for another fifty years  we will we said very earnestly but meantime as our paper goes to press this afternoon we must go now in fifty years we will come back  oh i see i see said the professor you are writing all this for a newspaper i see  yes we said we mentioned that at the beginning  ah said the professor did you very possibly yes  we propose we said to feature the article for next saturday  will it be long he asked  about two columns we answered  and how much said the professor in a hesitating way do i have to pay you to put it in  how much which we asked  how much do i have to pay  why professor we began quickly then we checked ourselves after all was it right to undeceive him this quiet absorbed man of science with his ideals his atoms and his emanations no a hundred times no let him pay a hundred times  it will cost you we said very firmly ten dollars  the professor began groping among his apparatus we knew that he was looking for his purse  we should like also very much we said to insert your picture along with the article  would that cost much he asked  no that is only five dollars  the professor had meantime found his purse  would it be all right he began that is would you mind if i pay you the money now i am apt to forget  quite all right we answered we said goodbye very gently and passed out we felt somehow as if we had touched a higher life such we murmured as we looked about the ancient campus are the men of science are there perhaps any others of them round this morning that we might interview     iv with our typical novelists  edwin and ethelinda afterthoughthusband and wifein their delightful home life  it was at their beautiful country place on the woonagansett that we had the pleasure of interviewing the afterthoughts at their own cordial invitation we had walked over from the nearest railway station a distance of some fourteen miles indeed as soon as they heard of our intention they invited us to walk we are so sorry not to bring you in the motor they wrote but the roads are so frightfully dusty that we might get dust on our chauffeur this little touch of thoughtfulness is the keynote of their character  the house itself is a delightful old mansion giving on a wide garden which gives in turn on a broad terrace giving on the river  the eminent novelist met us at the gate we had expected to find the author of angela rivers and the garden of desire a pale aesthetic type we have a way of expecting the wrong thing in our interviews we could not resist a shock of surprise indeed we seldom do at finding him a burly outofdoor man weighting as he himself told us a hundred stone in his stockinged feet we think he said stone  he shook hands cordially  come and see my pigs he said  we wanted to ask you we began as we went down the walk something about your books  lets look at the pigs first he said are you anything of a pig man  we are always anxious in our interviews to be all things to all men but we were compelled to admit that we were not much of a pig man  ah said the great novelist perhaps you are more of a dog man  not altogether a dog man we answered  anything of a bee man he asked  something we said we were once stung by a bee  ah he said you shall have a go at the beehives then right away  we assured him that we were willing to postpone a go at the beehives till later  come along then to the styes said the great novelist and he added perhaps youre not much of a breeder  we blushed we thought of the five little faces around the table for which we provide food by writing our interviews  no we said we were not much of a breeder  now then said the great novelist as we reached our goal how do you like this stye  very much indeed we said  ive put in a new tile drainingmy own plan you notice how sweet it keeps the stye  we had not noticed this  i am afraid said the novelist that the pigs are all asleep inside  we begged him on no account to waken them he offered to open the little door at the side and let us crawl in we insisted that we could not think of intruding  what we would like we said is to hear something of your methods of work in novel writing we said this with very peculiar conviction quite apart from the immediate purposes of our interview we have always been most anxious to know by what process novels are written if we could get to know this we would write one ourselves  come and see my bulls first said the novelist ive got a couple of young bulls here in the paddock that will interest you  we felt sure that they would  he led us to a little green fence inside it were two ferocious looking animals eating grain they rolled their eyes upwards at us as they ate  how do those strike you he asked  we assured him that they struck us as our beau ideal of bulls  like to walk in beside them said the novelist opening a little gate  we drew back was it fair to disturb these bulls  the great novelist noticed our hesitation  dont be afraid he said theyre not likely to harm you i send my hired man right in beside them every morning without the slightest hesitation  we looked at the eminent novelist with admiration we realized that like so many of our writers actors and even our thinkers of today he was an openair man in every sense of the word  but we shook our heads  bulls we explained were not a department of research for which we were equipped what we wanted we said was to learn something of his methods of work  my methods of work he answered as we turned up the path again well really i hardly know that i have any  what is your plan or method we asked getting out our notebook and pencil of laying the beginning of a new novel  my usual plan said the novelist is to come out here and sit in the stye till i get my characters  does it take long we questioned  not very i generally find that a quiet halfhour spent among the hogs will give me at least my leading character  and what do you do next  oh after that i generally light a pipe and go and sit among the beehives looking for an incident  do you get it we asked  invariably after that i make a few notes then go off for a ten mile tramp with my esquimaux dogs and get back in time to have a go through the cattle sheds and take a romp with the young bulls  we sighed we couldnt help it novel writing seemed further away than ever  have you also a goat on the premises we asked  oh certainly a ripping old fellowcome along and see him  we shook our heads no doubt our disappointment showed in our face it often does we felt that it was altogether right and wholesome that our great novels of today should be written in this fashion with the help of goats dogs hogs and young bulls but we felt too that it was not for us  we permitted ourselves one further question  at what time we said do you rise in the morning  oh anywhere between four and five said the novelist  ah and do you generally take a cold dip as soon as you are upeven in winter  i do  you prefer no doubt we said with a dejection that we could not conceal to have water with a good coat of ice over it  oh certainly  we said no more we have long understood the reasons for our own failure in life but it was painful to receive a renewed corroboration of it this ice question has stood in our way for fortyseven years  the great novelist seemed to note our dejection  come to the house he said my wife will give you a cup of tea  in a few moments we had forgotten all our troubles in the presence of one of the most charming chatelaines it has been our lot to meet  we sat on a low stool immediately beside ethelinda afterthought who presided in her own gracious fashion over the teaurn  so you want to know something of my methods of work she said as she poured hot tea over our leg  we do we answered taking out our little book and recovering something of our enthusiasm we do not mind hot tea being poured over us if people treat us as a human being  can you indicate we continued what method you follow in beginning one of your novels  i always begin said ethelinda afterthought with a study  a study we queried  yes i mean a study of actual facts take for example my leaves from the life of a steam laundrywomanmore tea  no no we said  well to make that book i first worked two years in a laundry  two years we exclaimed and why  to get the atmosphere  the steam we questioned  oh no said mrs afterthought i did that separately i took a course in steam at a technical school  is it possible we said our heart beginning to sing again was all that necessary  i dont see how one could do it otherwise the story opens as no doubt you rememberteain the boiler room of the laundry  yes we said moving our legno thank you  so you see the only possible point dappui was to begin with a description of the inside of the boiler  we nodded  a masterly thing we said  my wife interrupted the great novelist who was sitting with the head of a huge danish hound in his lap sharing his buttered toast with the dog while he adjusted a set of trout flies is a great worker  do you always work on that method we asked  always she answered for frederica of the factory i spent six months in a knitting mill for marguerite of the mud flats i made special studies for months and months  of what sort we asked  in mud learning to model it you see for a story of that sort the first thing needed is a thorough knowledge of mudall kinds of it  and what are you doing next we inquired  my next book said the lady novelist is to be a studyteaof the pickle industryperfectly new ground  a fascinating field we murmured  and quite new several of our writers have done the slaughterhouse and in england a good deal has been done in jam but so far no one has done pickles i should like if i could added ethelinda afterthought with the graceful modesty that is characteristic of her to make it the first of a series of pickle novels showing dont you know the whole pickle district and perhaps following a family of pickle workers for four or five generations  four or five we said enthusiastically make it ten and have you any plan for work beyond that  oh yes indeed laughed the lady novelist i am always planning ahead what i want to do after that is a study of the inside of a penitentiary  of the inside we said with a shudder  yes to do it of course i shall go to jail for two or three years  but how can you get in we asked thrilled at the quiet determination of the frail woman before us  i shall demand it as a right she answered quietly i shall go to the authorities at the head of a band of enthusiastic women and demand that i shall be sent to jail surely after the work i have done that much is coming to me  it certainly is we said warmly  we rose to go  both the novelists shook hands with us with great cordiality mr afterthought walked as far as the front door with us and showed us a short cut past the beehives that could take us directly through the bull pasture to the main road  we walked away in the gathering darkness of evening very quietly we made up our mind as we went that novel writing is not for us we must reach the penitentiary in some other way  but we thought it well to set down our interview as a guide to others     ix the new education  so youre going back to college in a fortnight i said to the bright young thing on the veranda of the summer hotel arent you sorry  in a way i am she said but in another sense im glad to go back one cant loaf all the time  she looked up from her rockingchair over her red cross knitting with great earnestness  how full of purpose these modern students are i thought to myself in my time we used to go back to college as to a treadmill  i know that i said but what i mean is that college after all is a pretty hard grind things like mathematics and greek are no joke are they in my day as i remember it we used to think spherical trigonometry about the hardest stuff of the lot  she looked dubious  i didnt elect mathematics she said  oh i said i see so you dont have to take it and what have you elected  for this coming half semesterthats six weeks you knowive elected social endeavour  ah i said thats since my day what is it  oh its awfully interesting its the study of conditions  what kind of conditions i asked  all conditions perhaps i cant explain it properly but i have the prospectus of it indoors if youd like to see it we take up society  and what do you do with it  analyse it she said  but it must mean reading a tremendous lot of books  no she answered we dont use books in this course its all laboratory work  now i am mystified i said what do you mean by laboratory work  well answered the girl student with a thoughtful look upon her face you see we are supposed to break society up into its elements  in six weeks  some of the girls do it in six weeks some put in a whole semester and take twelve weeks at it  so as to break up pretty thoroughly i said  yes she assented but most of the girls think six weeks is enough  that ought to pulverize it pretty completely but how do you go at it  well the girl said its all done with laboratory work we take for instance department stores i think that is the first thing we do we take up the department store  and what do you do with it  we study it as a social germ  ah i said as a social germ  yes said the girl delighted to see that i was beginning to understand as a germ all the work is done in the concrete the class goes down with the professor to the department store itself  and then  then they walk all through it observing  but have none of them ever been in a departmental store before  oh of course but you see we go as observers  ah now i understand you mean you dont buy anything and so you are able to watch everything  no she said its not that we do buy things thats part of it most of the girls like to buy little knickknacks and anyway it gives them a good chance to do their shopping while theyre there but while they are there they are observing then afterwards they make charts  charts of what i asked  charts of the employes theyre used to show the brain movement involved  do you find much  well she said hesitatingly the idea is to reduce all the employes to a curve  to a curve i exclaimed an in or an out  no no not exactly that didnt you use curves when you were at college  never i said  oh well nowadays nearly everything you know is done into a curve we put them on the board  and what is this particular curve of the employe used for i asked  why said the student the idea is that from the curve we can get the norm of the employe  get his norm i asked  yes get the norm that stands for the root form of the employe as a social factor  and what can you do with that  oh when we have that we can tell what the employe would do under any and every circumstance at least thats the ideathough im really only quoting she added breaking off in a diffident way from what miss thinker the professor of social endeavour says shes really fine shes making a general chart of the female employes of one of the biggest stores to show what percentage in case of fire would jump out of the window and what percentage would run to the fire escape  its a wonderful course i said we had nothing like it when i went to college and does it only take in departmental stores  no said the girl the laboratory work includes for this semester icecream parlours as well  what do you do with them  we take them up as social cells nuclei i think the professor calls them  and how do you go at them i asked  why the girls go to them in little laboratory groups and study them  they eat icecream in them  they have to she said to make it concrete but while they are doing it they are considering the icecream parlour merely as a section of social protoplasm  does the professor go i asked  oh yes she heads each group professor thinker never spares herself from work  dear me i said you must be kept very busy and is social endeavour all that you are going to do  no she answered im electing a halfcourse in nature work as well  nature work well well that i suppose means cramming up a lot of biology and zoology does it not  no said the girl its not exactly done with books i believe it is all done by field work  field work  yes field work four times a week and an excursion every saturday  and what do you do in the field work  the girls she answered go out in groups anywhere out of doors and make a nature study of anything they see  how do they do that i asked  why they look at it suppose for example they come to a stream or a pond or anything  yes  well they look at it  had they never done that before i asked  ah but they look at it as a nature unit each girl must take forty units in the course i think we only do one unit each day we go out  it must i said be pretty fatiguing work and what about the excursion  thats every saturday we go out with miss stalk the professor of ambulation  and where do you go  oh anywhere one day we go perhaps for a trip on a steamer and another saturday somewhere in motors and so on  doing what i asked  field work the aim of the courseim afraid im quoting miss stalk but i dont mind shes really fineis to break nature into its elements  i see  so as to view it as the external structure of society and make deductions from it  have you made any i asked  oh noshe laughedim only starting the work this term but of course i shall have to each girl makes at least one deduction at the end of the course some of the seniors make two or three but you have to make one  its a great course i said no wonder you are going to be busy and as you say how much better than loafing round here doing nothing  isnt it said the girl student with enthusiasm in her eyes it gives one such a sense of purpose such a feeling of doing something  it must i answered  oh goodness she exclaimed theres the lunch bell i must skip and get ready  she was just vanishing from my side when the burly male student who was also staying in the hotel came puffing up after his fivemile run he was getting himself into trim for enlistment so he told me he noted the retreating form of the college girl as he sat down  ive just been talking to her i said about her college work she seems to be studying a queer lot of stuffsocial endeavour and all that  awful piffle said the young man but the girls naturally run to all that sort of rot you know  now your work i went on is no doubt very different i mean what you were taking before the war came along i suppose you fellows have an awful dose of mathematics and philology and so on just as i did in my college days  something like a blush came across the face of the handsome youth  well no he said i didnt coopt mathematics at our college you know we coopt two majors and two minors  i see i said and what were you coopting  i coopted turkish music and religion he answered  oh yes i said with a sort of reverential respect fitting yourself for a position of choirmaster in a turkish cathedral no doubt  no no he said im going into insurance but you see those subjects fitted in better than anything else  fitted in  yes turkish comes at nine music at ten and religion at eleven so they make a good combination they leave a man free to  to develop his mind i said we used to find in my college days that lectures interfered with it badly but now turkish that must be an interesting language eh  search me said the student all you have to do is answer the roll and go out forty rollcalls give you one turkish unitbut say i must get on ive got to change so long  i could not help reflecting as the young man left me on the great changes that have come over our college education it was a relief to me later in the day to talk with a quiet sombre man himself a graduate student in philosophy on this topic he agreed with me that the old strenuous studies seem to be very largely abandoned  i looked at the sombre man with respect  now your work i said is very different from what these young people are doinghard solid definite effort what a relief it must be to you to get a brief vacation up here i couldnt help thinking today as i watched you moving round doing nothing how fine it must feel for you to come up here after your hard work and put in a month of outandout loafing  loafing he said indignantly im not loafing im putting in a half summer course in introspection thats why im here i get credit for two majors for my time here  ah i said as gently as i could you get credit here  he left me i am still pondering over our new education meantime i think i shall enter my little boys name on the books of tuskegee college where the education is still oldfashioned     x the errors of santa claus   it was christmas eve  the browns who lived in the adjoining house had been dining with the joneses  brown and jones were sitting over wine and walnuts at the table the others had gone upstairs  what are you giving to your boy for christmas asked brown  a train said jones new kind of thingautomatic  lets have a look at it said brown  jones fetched a parcel from the sideboard and began unwrapping it  ingenious thing isnt it he said goes on its own rails queer how kids love to play with trains isnt it  yes assented brown how are the rails fixed  wait ill show you said jones just help me to shove these dinner things aside and roll back the cloth there see you lay the rails like that and fasten them at the ends so  oh yes i catch on makes a grade doesnt it just the thing to amuse a child isnt it i got willy a toy aeroplane  i know theyre great i got edwin one on his birthday but i thought id get him a train this time i told him santa claus was going to bring him something altogether new this time edwin of course believes in santa claus absolutely say look at this locomotive would you it has a spring coiled up inside the fire box  wind her up said brown with great interest lets see her go  all right said jones just pile up two or three plates or something to lean the end of the rails on there notice the way it buzzes before it starts isnt that a great thing for a kid eh  yes said brown and say see this little string to pull the whistle by gad it toots eh just like real  now then brown jones went on you hitch on those cars and ill start her ill be engineer eh  half an hour later brown and jones were still playing trains on the diningroom table  but their wives upstairs in the drawingroom hardly noticed their absence they were too much interested  oh i think its perfectly sweet said mrs brown just the loveliest doll ive seen in years i must get one like it for ulvina wont clarisse be perfectly enchanted  yes answered mrs jones and then shell have all the fun of arranging the dresses children love that so much look there are three little dresses with the doll arent they cute all cut out and ready to stitch together  oh how perfectly lovely exclaimed mrs brown i think the mauve one would suit the doll best dont you with such golden hair only dont you think it would make it much nicer to turn back the collar so and to put a little bandso  what a good idea said mrs jones do lets try it just wait ill get a needle in a minute ill tell clarisse that santa claus sewed it himself the child believes in santa claus absolutely  and half an hour later mrs jones and mrs brown were so busy stitching dolls clothes that they could not hear the roaring of the little train up and down the dining table and had no idea what the four children were doing  nor did the children miss their mothers  dandy arent they edwin jones was saying to little willie brown as they sat in edwins bedroom a hundred in a box with cork tips and see an amber mouthpiece that fits into a little case at the side good present for dad eh  fine said willie appreciatively im giving father cigars  i know i thought of cigars too men always like cigars and cigarettes you cant go wrong on them say would you like to try one or two of these cigarettes we can take them from the bottom youll like them theyre russianaway ahead of egyptian  thanks answered willie id like one immensely i only started smoking last springon my twelfth birthday i think a fellers a fool to begin smoking cigarettes too soon dont you it stunts him i waited till i was twelve  me too said edwin as they lighted their cigarettes in fact i wouldnt buy them now if it werent for dad i simply had to give him something from santa claus he believes in santa claus absolutely you know  and while this was going on clarisse was showing little ulvina the absolutely lovely little bridge set that she got for her mother  arent these markers perfectly charming said ulvina and dont you love this little dutch designor is it flemish darling  dutch said clarisse isnt it quaint and arent these the dearest little things for putting the money in when you play i neednt have got them with ittheyd have sold the rest separatelybut i think its too utterly slow playing without money dont you  oh abominable shuddered ulvina but your mamma never plays for money does she  mamma oh gracious no mammas far too slow for that but i shall tell her that santa claus insisted on putting in the little money boxes  i suppose she believes in santa claus just as my mamma does  oh absolutely said clarisse and added what if we play a little game with a double dummy the french way or norwegian skat if you like that only needs two  all right agreed ulvina and in a few minutes they were deep in a game of cards with a little pile of pocket money beside them  about half an hour later all the members of the two families were again in the drawingroom but of course nobody said anything about the presents in any case they were all too busy looking at the beautiful big bible with maps in it that the joneses had brought to give to grandfather they all agreed that with the help of it grandfather could hunt up any place in palestine in a moment day or night  but upstairs away upstairs in a sittingroom of his own grandfather jones was looking with an affectionate eye at the presents that stood beside him there was a beautiful whisky decanter with silver filigree outside and whiskey inside for jones and for the little boy a big nickelplated jews harp  later on far in the night the person or the influence or whatever it is called santa claus took all the presents and placed them in the peoples stockings  and being blind as he always has been he gave the wrong things to the wrong peoplein fact he gave them just as indicated above  but the next day in the course of christmas morning the situation straightened itself out just as it always does  indeed by ten oclock brown and jones were playing with the train and mrs brown and mrs jones were making dolls clothes and the boys were smoking cigarettes and clarisse and ulvina were playing cards for their pocketmoney  and upstairsaway upgrandfather was drinking whisky and playing the jews harp  and so christmas just as it always does turned out all right after all     xi lost in new york  a visitors soliloquy  well well  whatever has been happening to this place to new york changed changed since i was here in 86 well i should say so  the hackdriver of the old days that i used to find waiting for me at the station curb with that impossible horse of histhe hackdriver with his bulbous red face and the nice smell of rye whisky all round him for yardsgone so it seems for ever  and in place of him thiswhat is it they call ittaxi with a cleanshaven cutthroat steering it get in he says just that he doesnt offer to help me or lift my satchel all right young man im crawling in  thats the machine that marks it eh i suppose they have them rigged up so they can punch up anything they like i thought sohe hits it up to fifty cents before we start but i saw him do it well i can stand for it this time ill not be caught in one of these again  the hotel all right im getting out my hotel but what is it they have done to it they must have added ten stories to it it reaches to the sky but ill not try to look to the top of it not with this satchel in my hand no sir ill wait till im safe inside in there ill feel all right theyll know me in there theyll remember right away my visit in the fall of 86 they wont easily have forgotten that big dinner i gavenine people at a dollar fifty a plate with the cigars extra the clerk will remember me all right  know me not they the clerk know me how could he for it seems now there isnt any clerk or not as there used to be they have subdivided him somehow into five or six there is a man behind a desk a majestic sort of man waving his hand it would be sheer madness to claim acquaintance with him there is another with a great book adjusting cards in it and another behind glass labelled cashier and busy as a bank there are two with mail and telegrams they are all too busy to know me  shall i sneak up near to them keeping my satchel in my hand i wonder do they see me can they see me a mere thing like me i am within ten feet of them but i am certain that they cannot see me i am and i feel it absolutely invisible  ha one has seen me he turns to me or rather he rounds upon me with the words well sir that and nothing else sharp and hard there is none of the ancient kindly pretence of knowing my name no reaching out a welcome hand and calling me mr erertill he has read my name upside down while i am writing it and can address me as a familiar friend no friendly questioning about the crops in my part of the country the crops forsooth what do these young men know about crops  a room had i any reservation any which any reservation oh i see had i written down from home to say that i was coming no i had not because the truth is i came at very short notice i didnt know till a week before that my brotherinlawhe is not listening he has moved away i will stand and wait till he comes back i am intruding here i had no right to disturb these people like this  oh i can have a room at eleven oclock when it is whichis vacated oh yes i see when the man in it gets up and goes away i didnt for the minute catch on to what the wordhe has stopped listening  never mind i can wait from eight to eleven is only three hours anyway i will move about here and look at things if i keep moving they will notice me less ha books and news papers and magazineswhat a stack of them like a regular bookstore i will stand here and take a look at some of them eh whats that did i want to buy anything well no i hadnt exactlyi was justoh i see theyre on sale all right yes give me this onefifty centsall rightand this and these others thats all right miss im not stingy they always say of me up in our town that when ishe has stopped listening  never mind i will walk up and down again with the magazines under my arm that will make people think i live here better still if i could put the magazines in my satchel but how there is no way to set it down and undo the straps i wonder if i could dare put it for a minute on that table the polished one or no they wouldnt likely allow a man to put a bag there  well i can wait anyway its eight oclock and soon surely breakfast will be ready as soon as i hear the gong i can go in there i wonder if i could find out first where the diningroom is it used always to be marked across the door but i dont seem to see it darn it ill ask that man in uniform if im here prepared to spend my good money to get breakfast i guess im not scared to ask a simple question of a man in uniform or no ill not ask him ill try this oneor no hes busy ill ask this other boy say would you mind if you please telling me please which way the diningroomeh what do i want which the grill room or the palm room why i tell you young man i just wanted to get some breakfast if itswhat do i want what i didnt quite get thata la carte no thanksand whats that table de what in the palm room no i just wantedbut it doesnt matter ill wait round here and look about till i hear the gong dont worry about me  whats that whats that boy shouting outthat boy with the tray a call for mr something or othersay must be something happened pretty serious a call for mrwhy thats for me hullo here i am here its me here i amwanted at the desk all right im coming im hurrying i guess somethings wrong at home eh here i am thats my name im ready  oh a room youve got a room for me all right the fifteenth floor good heavens away up there never mind ill take it cant give me a bath thats all right i had one  elevator over this way all right ill come along thanks i can carry it but i dont see any elevator oh this door in the wall well im hanged this the elevator it certainly has changed the elevator that i remember had a rope in the middle of it and you pulled the rope up as you went wheezing and clanking all the way to the fifth floor but this looks a queer sort of machine how do you dooh i beg your pardon i was in the road of the door i guess excuse me im afraid i got in the way of your elbow its all right you didnt hurtor not bad  gee whiz it goes fast are you sure you can stop it better be careful young man there was an elevator once in our town thatfifteenth floor all right  this room eh great scott its high up say better not go too near that window boy that would be a hell of a drop if a feller fell out you neednt wait oh i see i beg your pardon i suppose a quarter is enough eh  well its a relief to be alone but say this is high up and what a noise what is it theyre doing out there away out in the air with all that clatterbuilding a steel building i guess well those fellers have their nerve all right ill sit further back from the window  its lonely up here in the old days i could have rung a bell and had a drink sent up to the room but away up here on the fifteenth floor oh no theyd never send a drink clean up to the fifteenth floor of course in the old days i could have put on my canvas slippers and walked down to the bar and had a drink and talked to the bartender  but of course they wouldnt have a bar in a place like this id like to go down and see but i dont know that id care to ask anyway no i guess ill just sit and wait some one will come for me i guess after a while  if i were back right now in our town i could walk into ed clanceys restaurant and have ham and eggs or steak and eggs or anything for thirtyfive cents  our town up home is a peach of a little town anyway  say i just feel as if id like to take my satchel and jump clean out of that window it would be a good rebuke to them  but pshaw what would they care     xii this strenuous age  something is happening i regret to find to the world in which we used to live the poor old thing is being speeded up there is efficiency in the air offices open at eight oclock millionaires lunch on a baked apple bankers eat practically nothing a college president has declared that there are more foot pounds of energy in a glass of peptonized milk than insomething else i forget what all this is very fine yet somehow i feel out of it  my friends are failing me they wont sit up after midnight they have taken to sleeping out of doors on porches and pergolas some i understand merely roost on plain wooden bars they rise early they take deep breathing they bathe in ice water they are no good  this change i am sure is excellent it is i am certain just as it ought to be i am merely saying quietly and humbly that i am not in it i am being left behind take for example the case of alcohol that at least is what it is called now there were days when we called it bourbon whisky and tom gin and when the very name of it breathed romance that time is past  the poor stuff is now called alcohol and none so low that he has a good word for it quite right i am certain i dont defend it alcohol they are saying today if taken in sufficient quantities tears all the outer coating off the diaphragm it leaves the epigastric tissue so i am informed a useless wreck  this i dont deny it gets they tell me into the brain i dont dispute it it turns the prosencephalon into mere punk i know it ive felt it doing it they tell meand i believe itthat after even one glass of alcohol or shall we say scotch whisky and soda a mans working power is lowered by twenty per cent this is a dreadful thing after three glasses so it is held his capacity for sustained rigid thought is cut in two and after about six glasses the mans working power is reduced by at least a hundred per cent he merely sits therein his armchair at his club let us saywith all power even all desire to work gone out of him not thinking rigidly not sustaining his thought a mere shapeless chunk of geniality half hidden in the blue smoke of his cigar  very dreadful not a doubt alcohol is doomed it is going it is gone yet when i think of a hot scotch on a winter evening or a tom collins on a summer morning or a gin rickey beside a tenniscourt or a stein of beer on a bench beside a bowlinggreeni wish somehow that we could prohibit the use of alcohol and merely drink beer and whisky and gin as we used to but these things it appears interfere with work they have got to go  but turn to the broader and simpler question of work itself in my time one hated it it was viewed as the natural enemy of man now the world has fallen in love with it my friends i find take their deep breathing and their porch sleeping because it makes them work better they go for a weeks vacation in virginia not for its own sake but because they say they can work better when they get back i know a man who wears very loose boots because he can work better in them and another who wears only soft shirts because he can work better in a soft shirt there are plenty of men now who would wear dogharness if they thought they could work more in it i know another man who walks away out into the country every sunday not that he likes the countryhe wouldnt recognize a bumble bee if he saw itbut he claims that if he walks on sunday his head is as clear as a bell for work on monday  against work itself i say nothing but i sometimes wonder if i stand alone in this thing am i the only person left who hates it  nor is work all take food i admit here and now that the lunch i like besti mean for an ordinary plain lunch not a partyis a beef steak about one foot square and two inches thick can i work on it no i cant but i can work in spite of it that is as much as one used to ask twentyfive years ago  yet now i find that all my friends boast ostentatiously about the meagre lunch they eat one tells me that he finds a glass of milk and a prune is quite as much as he cares to take another says that a dry biscuit and a glass of water is all that his brain will stand one lunches on the white of an egg another eats merely the yolk i have only two friends left who can eat a whole egg at a time  i understand that the fear of these men is that if they eat more than an egg or a biscuit they will feel heavy after lunch why they object to feeling heavy i do not know personally i enjoy it i like nothing better than to sit round after a heavy lunch with half a dozen heavy friends smoking heavy cigars i am well aware that that is wicked i merely confess the fact i do not palliate it  nor is food all nor drink nor work nor open air there has spread abroad along with the socalled physical efficiency a perfect passion for information somehow if a mans stomach is empty and his head clear as a bell and if he wont drink and wont smoke he reaches out for information he wants facts he reads the newspapers all though instead of only reading the headings he clamours for articles filled with statistics about illiteracy and alien immigration and the number of battleships in the japanese navy  i know quite a lot of men who have actually bought the new encyclopaedia britannica what is more they read the thing they sit in their apartments at night with a glass of water at their elbow reading the encyclopaedia they say that it is literally filled with facts other men spend their time reading the statistical abstract of the united states they say the figures in it are great and the acts of congress and the list of presidents since washington or was it washington  spending their evenings thus and topping it off with a cold baked apple and sleeping out in the snow they go to work in the morning so they tell me with a positive sense of exhilaration i have no doubt that they do but for me i confess that once and for all i am out of it i am left behind  add to it all such rising dangers as total prohibition and the female franchise the daylight saving and eugenic marriage together with proportional representation the initiative and the referendum and the duty of the citizen to take an intelligent interest in politicsand i admit that i shall not be sorry to go away from here  but before i do go i have one hope i understand that down in hayti things are very different bull fights cock fights dog fights are openly permitted business never begins till eleven in the morning everybody sleeps after lunch and the bars remain open all night marriage is but a casual relation in fact the general condition of morality so they tell me is lower in hayti than it has been anywhere since the time of nero me for hayti     xiii the old old story of how five men went fishing  this is a plain account of a fishing party it is not a story there is no plot nothing happens in it and nobody is hurt the only point of this narrative is its peculiar truth it not only tells what happened to usthe five people concerned in itbut what has happened and is happening to all the other fishing parties that at the season of the year from halifax to idaho go gliding out on the unruffled surface of our canadian and american lakes in the still cool of early summer morning  we decided to go in the early morning because there is a popular belief that the early morning is the right time for bass fishing the bass is said to bite in the early morning perhaps it does in fact the thing is almost capable of scientific proof the bass does not bite between eight and twelve it does not bite between twelve and six in the afternoon nor does it bite between six oclock and midnight all these things are known facts the inference is that the bass bites furiously at about daybreak  at any rate our party were unanimous about starting early better make an early start said the colonel when the idea of the party was suggested oh yes said george popley the bank manager we want to get right out on the shoal while the fish are biting  when he said this all our eyes glistened everybodys do theres a thrill in the words to get right out on the shoal at daybreak when the fish are biting is an idea that goes to any mans brain  if you listen to the men talking in a pullman car or an hotel corridor or better still at the little tables in a firstclass bar you will not listen long before you hear one say well we got out early just after sunrise right on the shoal and presently even if you cant hear him you will see him reach out his two hands and hold them about two feet apart for the other man to admire he is measuring the fish no not the fish they caught this was the big one that they lost but they had him right up to the top of the water oh yes he was up to the top of the water all right the number of huge fish that have been heaved up to the top of the water in our lakes is almost incredible or at least it used to be when we still had bar rooms and little tables for serving that vile stuff scotch whisky and such foul things as gin rickeys and john collinses it makes one sick to think of it doesnt it but there was good fishing in the bars all the winter  but as i say we decided to go early in the morning charlie jones the railroad man said that he remembered how when he was a boy up in wisconsin they used to get out at five in the morningnot get up at five but be on the shoal at five it appears that there is a shoal somewhere in wisconsin where the bass lie in thousands kernin the lawyer said that when he was a boythis was on lake rosseauthey used to get out at four it seems there is a shoal in lake rosseau where you can haul up the bass as fast as you can drop your line the shoal is hard to findvery hard kernin can find it but it is doubtfulso i gatherif any other living man can the wisconsin shoal too is very difficult to find once you find it you are all right but its hard to find charlie jones can find it if you were in wisconsin right now hed take you straight to it but probably no other person now alive could reach that shoal in the same way colonel morse knows of a shoal in lake simcoe where he used to fish years and years ago and which i understand he can still find  i have mentioned that kernin is a lawyer and jones a railroad man and popley a banker but i neednt have any reader would take it for granted in any fishing party there is always a lawyer you can tell him at sight he is the one of the party that has a landing net and a steel rod in sections with a wheel that is used to wind the fish to the top of the water  and there is always a banker you can tell him by his good clothes popley in the bank wears his banking suit when he goes fishing he wears his fishing suit it is much the better of the two because his banking suit has ink marks on it and his fishing suit has no fish marks on it  as for the railroad manquite so the reader knows it as well as i doyou can tell him because he carries a pole that he cut in the bush himself with a tencent line wrapped round the end of it jones says he can catch as many fish with this kind of line as kernin can with his patent rod and wheel so he can too just the same number  but kernin says that with his patent apparatus if you get a fish on you can play him jones says to hades with playing him give him a fish on his line and hell haul him in all right kernin says hed lose him but jones says he wouldnt in fact he guarantees to haul the fish in kernin says that more than oncein lake rosseauhe has played a fish for over half an hour i forget now why he stopped i think the fish quit playing  i have heard kernin and jones argue this question of their two rods as to which rod can best pull in the fish for half an hour others may have heard the same question debated i know no way by which it could be settled  our arrangement to go fishing was made at the little golf club of our summer town on the veranda where we sit in the evening oh its just a little place nothing pretentious the links are not much good for golf in fact we dont play much golf there so far as golf goes and of course we dont serve meals at the club its not like thatand no weve nothing to drink there because of prohibition but we go and sit there it is a good place to sit and after all what else can you do in the present state of the law  so it was there that we arranged the party  the thing somehow seemed to fall into the mood of each of us jones said he had been hoping that some of the boys would get up a fishing party it was apparently the one kind of pleasure that he really cared for for myself i was delighted to get in with a crowd of regular fishermen like these four especially as i hadnt been out fishing for nearly ten years though fishing is a thing i am passionately fond of i know no pleasure in life like the sensation of getting a fourpound bass on the hook and hauling him up to the top of the water to weigh him but as i say i hadnt been out for ten years oh yes i live right beside the water every summer and yes certainlyi am saying soi am passionately fond of fishing but still somehow i hadnt been out every fisherman knows just how that happens the years have a way of slipping by yet i must say i was surprised to find that so keen a sport as jones hadnt been outso it presently appearedfor eight years i had imagined he practically lived on the water and colonel morse and kernin i was amazed to find hadnt been out for twelve years not since the dayso it came out in conversationwhen they went out together in lake rosseau and kernin landed a perfect monster a regular corker five pounds and a half they said or no i dont think he landed him no i remember he didnt land him he caught himand he could have landed him he should have landed himbut he didnt land him that was it yes i remember kernin and morse had a slight discussion about itoh perfectly amicableas to whether morse had fumbled with the net or whether kerninthe whole argument was perfectly friendlyhad made an ass of himself by not striking soon enough of course the whole thing was so long ago that both of them could look back on it without any bitterness or ill nature in fact it amused them kernin said it was the most laughable thing he ever saw in his life to see poor old jackthats morses nameshoving away with the landing net wrong side up and morse said hed never forget seeing poor old kernin yanking his line first this way and then that and not knowing where to try to haul it it made him laugh to look back at it  they might have gone on laughing for quite a time but charlie jones interrupted by saying that in his opinion a landing net is a piece of darned foolishness here popley agrees with him kernin objects that if you dont use a net youll lose your fish at the side of the boat jones says no give him a hook well through the fish and a stout line in his hand and that fish has got to come in popley says so too he says let him have his hook fast through the fishs head with a short stout line and put him popley at the other end of that line and that fish will come in its got to otherwise popley will know why thats the alternative either the fish must come in or popley must know why theres no escape from the logic of it  but perhaps some of my readers have heard the thing discussed before  so as i say we decided to go the next morning and to make an early start all of the boys were at one about that when i say boys i use the word as it is used in fishing to mean people from say fortyfive to sixtyfive there is something about fishing that keeps men young if a fellow gets out for a good mornings fishing forgetting all business worries once in a whilesay once in ten yearsit keeps him fresh  we agreed to go in a launch a large launchto be exact the largest in the town we could have gone in row boats but a row boat is a poor thing to fish from kernin said that in a row boat it is impossible properly to play your fish the side of the boat is so low that the fish is apt to leap over the side into the boat when half played popley said that there is no comfort in a row boat in a launch a man can reach out his feet and take it easy charlie jones said that in a launch a man could rest his back against something and morse said that in a launch a man could rest his neck young inexperienced boys in the small sense of the word never think of these things so they go out and after a few hours their necks get tired whereas a group of expert fishers in a launch can rest their backs and necks and even fall asleep during the pauses when the fish stop biting  anyway all the boys agreed that the great advantage of a launch would be that we could get a man to take us by that means the man could see to getting the worms and the man would be sure to have spare lines and the man could come along to our different placeswe were all beside the waterand pick us up in fact the more we thought about the advantage of having a man to take us the better we liked it as a boy gets old he likes to have a man around to do the work  anyway frank rolls the man we decided to get not only has the biggest launch in town but what is more frank knows the lake we called him up at his boathouse over the phone and said wed give him five dollars to take us out first thing in the morning provided that he knew the shoal he said he knew it  i dont know to be quite candid about it who mentioned whisky first in these days everybody has to be a little careful i imagine we had all been thinking whisky for some time before anybody said it but there is a sort of convention that when men go fishing they must have whisky each man makes the pretence that one thing he needs at six oclock in the morning is cold raw whisky it is spoken of in terms of affection one man says the first thing you need if youre going fishing is a good snort of whisky another says that a good snifter is the very thing and the others agree that no man can fish properly without a horn or a bracer or an eyeopener each man really decides that he himself wont take any but he feels that in a collective sense the boys need it  so it was with us the colonel said hed bring along a bottle of booze popley said no let him bring it kernin said let him and charlie jones said no hed bring it it turned out that the colonel had some very good scotch at his house that hed like to bring oddly enough popley had some good scotch in his house too and queer though it is each of the boys had scotch in his house when the discussion closed we knew that each of the five of us was intending to bring a bottle of whisky each of the five of us expected the other to drink one and a quarter bottles in the course of the morning  i suppose we must have talked on that veranda till long after one in the morning it was probably nearer two than one when we broke up but we agreed that that made no difference popley said that for him three hours sleep the right kind of sleep was far more refreshing than ten kernin said that a lawyer learns to snatch his sleep when he can and jones said that in railroad work a man pretty well cuts out sleep  so we had no alarms whatever about not being ready by five our plan was simplicity itself men like ourselves in responsible positions learn to organize things easily in fact popley says it is that faculty that has put us where we are so the plan simply was that frank rolls should come along at five oclock and blow his whistle in front of our places and at that signal each man would come down to his wharf with his rod and kit and so wed be off to the shoal without a moments delay  the weather we ruled out it was decided that even if it rained that made no difference kernin said that fish bite better in the rain and everybody agreed that man with a couple of snorts in him need have no fear of a little rain water  so we parted all keen on the enterprise nor do i think even now that there was anything faulty or imperfect in that party as we planned it  i heard frank rolls blowing his infernal whistle opposite my summer cottage at some ghastly hour in the morning even without getting out of bed i could see from the window that it was no day for fishing no not raining exactly i dont mean that but one of those peculiar daysi dont mean windthere was no wind but a sort of feeling in the air that showed anybody who understands bass fishing that it was a perfectly rotten day for going out the fish i seemed to know it wouldnt bite  when i was still fretting over the annoyance of the disappointment i heard frank rolls blowing his whistle in front of the other cottages i counted thirty whistles altogether then i fell into a light dozenot exactly sleep but a sort of dozei can find no other word for it it was clear to me that the other boys had thrown the thing over there was no use in my trying to go out alone i stayed where i was my doze lasting till ten oclock  when i walked up town later in the morning i couldnt help being struck by the signs in the butchers shops and the restaurants fish fresh fish fresh lake fish  where in blazes do they get those fish anyway     xiv back from the land  i have just come back now with the closing in of autumnto the city i have hung up my hoe in my study my spade is put away behind the piano i have with me seven pounds of paris green that i had over anybody who wants it may have it i didnt like to bury it for fear of its poisoning the ground i didnt like to throw it away for fear of its destroying cattle i was afraid to leave it in my summer place for fear that it might poison the tramps who generally break in in november i have it with me now i move it from room to room as i hate to turn my back upon it anybody who wants it i repeat can have it  i should like also to give away either to the red cross or to anything else ten packets of radish seed the early curled variety i think fifteen packets of cucumber seed the long succulent variety i believe it says and twenty packets of onion seed the yellow danvers distinguished i understand for its edible flavour and its nutritious properties it is not likely that i shall ever on this side of the grave plant onion seed again all these things i have with me my vegetables are to come after me by freight they are booked from simcoe county to montreal at present they are i believe passing through schenectady but they will arrive later all right they were seen going through detroit last week moving west it is the first time that i ever sent anything by freight anywhere i never understood before the wonderful organization of the railroads but they tell me that there is a bad congestion of freight down south this month if my vegetables get tangled up in that there is no telling when they will arrive  in other words i am one of the legion of menquiet determined resolute menwho went out last spring to plant the land and who are now back  with meand i am sure that i speak for all the others as wellit was not a question of mere pleasure it was no love of gardening for its own sake that inspired us it was a plain national duty what we said to ourselves was this war has got to stop the men in the trenches thus far have failed to stop it now let us try the whole thing we argued is a plain matter of food production  if we raise enough food the germans are bound to starve very good let us kill them  i suppose there was never a more grimly determined set of men went out from the cities than those who went out last may as i did to conquer the food problem i dont mean to say that each and every one of us actually left the city but we all went forth in the metaphorical sense some of the men cultivated back gardens others took vacant lots some went out into the suburbs and others like myself went right out into the country  we are now back each of us has with him his paris green his hoe and the rest of his radish seed  the time has therefore come for a plain clear statement of our experience we have as everybody knows failed we have been beaten hack all along the line our potatoes are buried in a jungle of autumn burdocks our radishes stand seven feet high uneatable our tomatoes when last seen were greener than they were at the beginning of august and getting greener every week our celery looked as delicate as a maidenhair fern our indian corn was nine feet high with a tall feathery spike on top of that but no sign of anything eatable about it from top to bottom  i look back with a sigh of regret at those bright early days in april when we were all buying hoes and talking soil and waiting for the snow to be off the ground the street cars as we went up and down to our offices were a busy babel of garden talk there was a sort of farmerlike geniality in the air one spoke freely to strangers every man with a hoe was a friend men chewed straws in their offices and kept looking out of windows to pretend to themselves that they were afraid it might blow up rain got your tomatoes in one man would ask another as they went up in the elevator yes i got mine in yesterday the other would answer but im just a little afraid that this east wind may blow up a little frost what we need now is growing weather and the two men would drift off together from the elevator door along the corridor their heads together in friendly colloquy  i have always regarded a lawyer as a man without a soul there is one who lives next door to me to whom i have not spoken in five years yet when i saw him one day last spring heading for the suburbs in a pair of old trousers with a hoe in one hand and a box of celery plants in the other i felt that i loved the man i used to think that stockbrokers were mere sordid calculating machines now that i have seen whole firms of them busy at the hoe wearing old trousers that reached to their armpits and were tied about the waist with a polka dot necktie i know that they are men i know that there are warm hearts beating behind those trousers  old trousers i say where on earth did they all come from in such a sudden fashion last spring everybody had them who would suspect that a man drawing a salary of ten thousand a year was keeping in reserve a pair of pepperandsalt breeches four sizes too large for him just in case a war should break out against germany talk of german mobilization i doubt whether the organizing power was all on their side after all at any rate it is estimated that fifty thousand pairs of old trousers were mobilized in montreal in one week  but perhaps it was not a case of mobilization or deliberate preparedness it was rather an illustration of the primitive instinct that is in all of us and that will out in war time any man worth the name would wear old breeches all the time if the world would let him any man will wind a polka dot tie round his waist in preference to wearing patent braces the makers of the ties know this that is why they make the tie four feet long and in the same way if any manufacturer of hats will put on the market an old fedora with a limp rim and a mark where the ribbon used to be but is nota hat guaranteed to be six years old well weathered well rained on and certified to have been walked over by a herd of cattlethat man will make and deserve a fortune  these at least were the fashions of last may alas where are they now the men that wore them have relapsed again into tailormade tweeds they have put on hard new hats they are shining their boots again they are shaving again not merely on saturday night but every day they are sinking back into civilization  yet those were bright times and i cannot forbear to linger on them nor the least pleasant feature was our rediscovery of the morning my neighbour on the right was always up at five my neighbour on the left was out and about by four with the earliest light of day little columns of smoke rose along our street from the kitchen ranges where our wives were making coffee for us before the servants got up by six oclock the street was alive and busy with friendly salutations the milkman seemed a late comer a poor sluggish fellow who failed to appreciate the early hours of the day a man we found might live through quite a little iliad of adventure before going to his nine oclock office  how will you possibly get time to put in a garden i asked of one of my neighbours during this glad period of early spring before i left for the country time he exclaimed why my dear fellow i dont have to be down at the warehouse till eightthirty  later in the summer i saw the wreck of his garden choked with weeds your garden i said is in poor shape garden he said indignantly how on earth can i find time for a garden do you realize that i have to be down at the warehouse at eightthirty  when i look back to our bright beginnings our failure seems hard indeed to understand it is only when i survey the whole garden movement in melancholy retrospect that i am able to see some of the reasons for it  the principal one i think is the question of the season it appears that the right time to begin gardening is last year for many things it is well to begin the year before last for good results one must begin even sooner here for example are the directions as i interpret them for growing asparagus having secured a suitable piece of ground preferably a deep friable loam rich in nitrogen go out three years ago and plough or dig deeply remain a year inactive thinking two years ago pulverize the soil thoroughly wait a year as soon as last year comes set out the young shoots then spend a quiet winter doing nothing the asparagus will then be ready to work at this year  this is the rock on which we were wrecked few of us were men of sufficient means to spend several years in quiet thought waiting to begin gardening yet that is it seems the only way to begin asparagus demands a preparation of four years to fit oneself to grow strawberries requires three years even for such humble things as peas beans and lettuce the instructions inevitably read plough the soil deeply in the preceeding autumn this sets up a dilemma which is the preceeding autumn if a man begins gardening in the spring he is too late for last autumn and too early for this on the other hand if he begins in the autumn he is again too late he has missed this summers crop it is therefore ridiculous to begin in the autumn and impossible to begin in the spring  this was our first difficulty but the second arose from the question of the soil itself all the books and instructions insist that the selection of the soil is the most important part of gardening no doubt it is but if a man has already selected his own backyard before he opens the book what remedy is there all the books lay stress on the need of a deep friable loam full of nitrogen this i have never seen my own plot of land i found on examination to contain nothing but earth i could see no trace of nitrogen i do not deny the existence of loam there may be such a thing but i am admitting now in all humility of mind that i dont know what loam is last spring my fellow gardeners and i all talked freely of the desirability of a loam my own opinion is that none of them had any clearer ideas about it than i had speaking from experience i should say that the only soils are earth mud and dirt there are no others  but i leave out the soil in any case we were mostly forced to disregard it perhaps a more fruitful source of failure even than the lack of loam was the attempt to apply calculation and mathematics to gardening thus if one cabbage will grow in one square foot of ground how many cabbages will grow in ten square feet of ground ten not at all the answer is one you will find as a matter of practical experience that however many cabbages you plant in a garden plot there will be only one that will really grow this you will presently come to speak of as the cabbage beside it all the others till the caterpillars finally finish their existence will look but poor lean things but the cabbage will be a source of pride and an object of display to visitors in fact it would ultimately have grown to be a real cabbage such as you buy for ten cents at any market were it not that you inevitably cut it and eat it when it is still only halfgrown  this always happens to the one cabbage that is of decent size and to the one tomato that shows signs of turning red it is really a feeble greenpink and to the only melon that might have lived to ripen they get eaten no one but a practised professional gardener can live and sleep beside a melon threequarters ripe and a cabbage twothirds grown without going out and tearing it off the stem  even at that it is not a bad plan to eat the stuff while you can the most peculiar thing about gardening is that all of a sudden everything is too old to eat radishes change over night from delicate young shoots not large enough to put on the table into huge plants seven feet high with a root like an irish shillelagh if you take your eyes off a lettuce bed for a week the lettuces not ready to eat when you last looked at them have changed into a tall jungle of hollyhocks green peas are only really green for about two hours before that they are young peas after that they are old peas cucumbers are the worst case of all they change overnight from delicate little bulbs obviously too slight and dainty to pick to old cases of yellow leather filled with seeds  if i were ever to garden again a thing which is out of the bounds of possibility i should wait until a certain day and hour when all the plants were ripe and then go out with a gun and shoot them all dead so that they could grow no more  but calculation i repeat is the bane of gardening i knew among our group of food producers a party of young engineers college men who took an empty farm north of the city as the scene of their summer operations they took their coats off and applied college methods they ran out first a base line ab and measured off from it lateral spurs mn op qr and so on from these they took side angles with a theodolite so as to get the edges of each of the separate plots of their land absolutely correct i saw them working at it all through one saturday afternoon in may they talked as they did it of the peculiar ignorance of the socalled practical farmer he neverso they agreeduses his head he neveri think i have their phrase correctstops to think in laying out his ground for use it never occurs to him to try to get the maximum result from a given space if a farmer would only realize that the contents of a circle represent the maximum of space enclosable in a given perimeter and that a circle is merely a function of its own radius what a lot of time he would save  these young men that i speak of laid out their field engineerfashion with little white posts at even distances they made a blueprint of the whole thing as they planted it every corner of it was charted out the yield was calculated to a nicety they had allowed for the fact that some of the stuff might fail to grow by introducing what they called a coefficient of error by means of this and by reducing the variation of autumn prices to a mathematical curve those men not only knew already in the middle of may the exact yield of their farm to within half a bushel they allowed they said a variation of half a bushel per fifty acres but they knew beforehand within a few cents the market value that they would receive the figures as i remember them were simply amazing it seemed incredible that fifty acres could produce so much yet there were the plain facts in front of one calculated out the thing amounted practically to a revolution in farming at least it ought to have and it would have if those young men had come again to hoe their field but it turned out most unfortunately that they were busy to their great regret they were too busy to come they had been working under a freeandeasy arrangement each man was to give what time he could every saturday it was left to every mans honour to do what he could there was no compulsion each man trusted the others to be there in fact the thing was not only an experiment in food production it was also a new departure in social cooperation the first saturday that those young men worked there were so i have been told seventyfive of them driving in white stakes and running lines the next saturday there were fifteen of them planting potatoes the rest were busy the week after that there was one man hoeing weeds after that silence fell upon the deserted garden broken only by the cry of the chickadee and the choochoo feeding on the waving heads of the thistles  but i have indicated only two or three of the ways of failing at food production there are ever so many more what amazes me in returning to the city is to find the enormous quantities of produce of all sorts offered for sale in the markets it is an odd thing that last spring by a queer oversight we never thought any of us of this process of increasing the supply if every patriotic man would simply take a large basket and go to the market every day and buy all that he could carry away there need be no further fear of a food famine  and meantime my own vegetables are on their way they are in a soap box with bars across the top coming by freight they weigh fortysix pounds including the box they represent the result of four months arduous toil in sun wind and storm yet it is pleasant to think that i shall be able to feed with them some poor family of refugees during the rigour of the winter either that or give them to the hens i certainly wont eat the rotten things myself     xv the perplexity column as done by the jaded journalist

years ago when i was on the staff of a great public school we engaged a new swimming master  he was the most successful man in that capacity that we had had for years  then one day it was discovered that he couldnt swim  he was standing at the edge of the swimming tank explaining the breast stroke to the boys in the water  he lost his balance and fell in he was drowned  or no he wasnt drowned i rememberhe was rescued by some of the pupils whom he had taught to swim  after he was resuscitated by the boysit was one of the things he had taught themthe school dismissed him  then some of the boys who were sorry for him taught him how to swim and he got a new job as a swimming master in another place  but this time he was an utter failure he swam well but they said he couldnt teach  so his friends looked about to get him a new job this was just at the time when the bicycle craze came in they soon found the man a position as an instructor in bicycle riding as he had never been on a bicycle in his life he made an admirable teacher he stood fast on the ground and said now then all you need is confidence  then one day he got afraid that he might be found out so he went out to a quiet place and got on a bicycle at the top of a slope to learn to ride it the bicycle ran away with him but for the skill and daring of one of his pupils who saw him and rode after him he would have been killed  this story as the reader sees is endless suffice it to say that the man i speak of is now in an aviation school teaching people to fly they say he is one of the best aviators that ever walked  according to all the legends and story books the principal factor in success is perseverance personally i think there is nothing in it if anything the truth lies the other way  there is an old motto that runs if at first you dont succeed try try again this is nonsense it ought to read if at first you dont succeed quit quit at once  if you cant do a thing more or less the first time you try you will never do it try something else while there is yet time  let me illustrate this with a story  i remember long years ago at a little school that i attended in the country we had a schoolmaster who used perpetually to write on the blackboard in a copperplate hand the motto that i have just quoted     if at first you dont succeed     try try again  he wore plain clothes and had a hard determined face he was studying for some sort of preliminary medical examination and was saving money for a medical course every now and then he went away to the city and tried the examination and he always failed each time he came back he would write up on the blackboard     try try again  and always he looked grimmer and more determined than before the strange thing was that with all his industry and determination he would break out every now and then into drunkenness and lie round the tavern at the crossroads and the school would be shut for two days then he came back more fiercely resolute than ever even children could see that the mans life was a fight it was like the battle between good and evil in miltons epics  well after he had tried it four times the schoolmaster at last passed the examination and he went away to the city in a suit of store clothes with eight hundred dollars that he had saved up to study medicine now it happened that he had a brother who was not a bit like himself but was a sort of neerdowell always hardup and sponging on other people and never working  and when the schoolmaster came to the city and his brother knew that he had eight hundred dollars he came to him and got him drinking and persuaded him to hand over the eight hundred dollars and to let him put it into the louisiana state lottery in those days the louisiana lottery had not yet been forbidden the use of the mails and you could buy a ticket for anything from one dollar up the grand prize was two hundred thousand dollars and the seconds were a hundred thousand each  so the brother persuaded the schoolmaster to put the money in he said he had a system for buying only the tickets with prime numbers that wont divide by anything and that it must win he said it was a mathematical certainty and he figured it out with the schoolmaster in the back room of a saloon with a box of dominoes on the table to show the plan of it he told the schoolmaster that he himself would only take ten per cent of what they made as a commission for showing the system and the schoolmaster could have the rest  so in a mad moment the schoolmaster handed over his roll of money and that was the last he ever saw of it  the next morning when he was up he was fierce with rage and remorse for what he had done he could not go back to the school and he had no money to go forward so he stayed where he was in the little hotel where he had got drunk and went on drinking he looked so fierce and unkempt that in the hotel they were afraid of him and the bartenders watched him out of the corners of their eyes wondering what he would do because they knew that there was only one end possible and they waited for it to come and presently it came one of the bartenders went up to the schoolmasters room to bring up a letter and he found him lying on the bed with his face grey as ashes and his eyes looking up at the ceiling he was stone dead life had beaten him  and the strange thing was that the letter that the bartender carried up that morning was from the management of the louisiana lottery it contained a draft on new york signed by the treasurer of the state of louisiana for two hundred thousand dollars the schoolmaster had won the grand prize  the above story i am afraid is a little gloomy i put it down merely for the moral it contained and i became so absorbed in telling it that i almost forgot what the moral was that it was meant to convey but i think the idea is that if the schoolmaster had long before abandoned the study of medicine for which he was not fitted and gone in let us say for playing the banjo he might have become endman in a minstrel show yes that was it  let me pass on to other elements in success  i suppose that anybody will admit that the peculiar quality that is called initiativethe ability to act promptly on ones own judgementis a factor of the highest importance  i have seen this illustrated two or three times in a very striking fashion  i knew in torontoit is long years agoa singularly bright young man whose name was robinson he had had some training in the iron and steel business and when i knew him was on the look out for an opening  i met him one day in a great hurry with a valise in his hand  where are you going i asked  over to england he said there is a firm in liverpool that have advertised that they want an agent here and im going over to apply for the job  cant you do it by letter i asked  thats just it said robinson with a chuckle all the other men will apply by letter ill go right over myself and get there as soon or sooner than the letters ill be the man on the spot and ill get the job  he was quite right he went over to liverpool and was back in a fortnight with english clothes and a big salary  but i cannot recommend his story to my friends in fact it should not be told too freely it is apt to be dangerous  i remember once telling this story of robinson to a young man called tomlinson who was out of a job tomlinson had a head two sizes too big and a face like a bun he had lost three jobs in a bank and two in a brokers office but he knew his work and on paper he looked a good man  i told him about robinson to encourage him and the story made a great impression  say that was a great scheme eh he kept repeating he had no command of words and always said the same thing over and over  a few days later i met tomlinson in the street with a valise in his hand  where are you going i asked  im off to mexico he answered theyre advertising for a canadian teller for a bank in tuscapulco ive sent my credentials down and im going to follow them right up in person in a thing like this the personal element is everything  so tomlinson went down to mexico and he travelled by sea to mexico city and then with a mule train to tuscapulco but the mails with his credentials went by land and got there two days ahead of him  when tomlinson got to tuscapulco he went into the bank and he spoke to the junior manager and told him what he came for im awfully sorry the junior manager said im afraid that this post has just been filled then he went into an inner room to talk with the manager the tellership that you wanted a canadian for he asked didnt you say that you have a man already  yes said the manager a brilliant young fellow from toronto his name is tomlinson i have his credentials herea firstclass man ive wired him to come right along at our expense and well keep the job open for him ten days  theres a young man outside said the junior who wants to apply for the job  outside exclaimed the manager how did he get here  came in on the mule train this morning says he can do the work and wants the job  whats he like asked the manager  the junior shook his head  pretty dusty looking customer he said shifty looking  same old story murmured the manager its odd how these fellows drift down here isnt it up to something crooked at home i suppose understands the working of a bank eh i guess he understands it a little too well for my taste no no he continued tapping the papers that lay on the table now that weve got a firstclass man like tomlinson lets hang on to him we can easily wait ten days and the cost of the journey is nothing to the bank as compared with getting a man of tomlinsons stamp and by the way you might telephone to the chief of police and get him to see to it that this loafer gets out of town straight off  so the chief of police shut up tomlinson in the calaboose and then sent him down to mexico city under a guard by the time the police were done with him he was dead broke and it took him four months to get back to toronto when he got there the place in mexico had been filled long ago  but i can imagine that some of my readers might suggest that i have hitherto been dealing only with success in a very limited way and that more interest would lie in discussing how the really great fortunes are made  everybody feels an instinctive interest in knowing how our great captains of industry our financiers and railroad magnates made their money  here the explanation is really a very simple one there is in fact only one way to amass a huge fortune in business or railway management one must begin at the bottom one must mount the ladder from the lowest rung but this lowest rung is everything any man who can stand upon it with his foot well poised his head erect his arms braced and his eye directed upward will inevitably mount to the top  but after alli say this as a kind of afterthought in conclusionwhy bother with success at all i have observed that the successful people get very little real enjoyment out of life in fact the contrary is true if i had to choosewith an eye to having a really pleasant lifebetween success and ruin i should prefer ruin every time i have several friends who are completely ruinedsome two or three timesin a large way of course and i find that if i want to get a really good dinner where the champagne is just as it ought to be and where hospitality is unhindered by mean thoughts of expense i can get it best at the house of a ruined man     xvii in dry toronto  a local study of a universal topic  noteour readersour numerous readerswho live in equatorial africa may read this under the title in dry timbucto those who live in central america will kindly call it in dry tehauntepec  it may have been for aught i know the change from a wet to a dry atmosphere i am told that biologically such things profoundly affect the human system  at any rate i found it impossible that nighti was on the train from montreal to torontoto fall asleep  a peculiar wakefulness seemed to have seized upon me which appeared moreover to afflict the other passengers as well in the darkness of the car i could distinctly hear them groaning at intervals  are they ill i asked through the curtains of the porter as he passed  no sir he said theyre not ill those is the toronto passengers  all in this car i asked  all except that genlman you may have heard singing in the smoking compartment hes booked through to chicago  but as is usual in such cases sleep came at last with unusual heaviness i seemed obliterated from the world till all of a sudden i found myself as it were up and dressed and seated in the observation car at the back of the train awaiting my arrival  is this toronto i asked of the pullman conductor as i peered through the window of the car  the conductor rubbed the pane with his finger and looked out  i think so he said  do we stop here i asked  i think we do this morning he answered i think i heard the conductor say that they have a lot of milk cans to put off here this morning ill just go and find out sir  stop here broke in an irasciblelooking gentleman in a grey tweed suit who was sitting in the next chair to mine do they stop here i should say they did indeed dont you know he added turning to the pullman conductor that any train is compelled to stop here theres a bylaw a municipal bylaw of the city of toronto compelling every train to stop  i didnt know it said the conductor humbly  do you mean to say continued the irascible gentleman that you have never read the bylaws of the city of toronto  no sir said the conductor  the ignorance of these fellows said the man in grey tweed swinging his chair round again towards me we ought to have a bylaw to compel them to read the bylaws i must start an agitation for it at once here he took out a little red notebook and wrote something in it murmuring we need a new agitation anyway  presently he shut the book up with a snap i noticed that there was a sort of peculiar alacrity in everything he did  you sir he said have of course read our municipal bylaws  oh yes i answered splendid arent they they read like a romance  you are most flattering to our city said the irascible gentleman with a bow yet you sir i take it are not from toronto  no i answered as humbly as i could im from montreal  ah said the gentleman as he sat back and took a thorough look at me from montreal are you drunk  no i replied i dont think so  but you are suffering for a drink said my new acquaintance eagerly you need it eh you feel already a kind of craving eh what  no i answered the fact is its rather early in the morning  quite so broke in the irascible gentleman but i understand that in montreal all the saloons are open at seven and even at that hour are crowded sir crowded  i shook my head  i think that has been exaggerated i said in fact we always try to avoid crowding and jostling as far as possible it is generally understood as a matter of politeness that the first place in the line is given to the clergy the board of trade and the heads of the universities  is it conceivable said the gentleman in grey one moment please till i make a note all clergyi think you said all did you notdrunk at seven in the morning deplorable but here we are at the union stationcommodious is it not justly admired in fact all over the known world observe he continued as we alighted from the train and made our way into the station the upstairs and the downstairs connected by flights of stairs quite unique and most convenient if you dont meet your friends downstairs all you have to do is to look upstairs if they are not there you simply come down again but stop you are going to walk up the street ill go with you  at the outer door of the stationjust as i had remembered itstood a group of hotel busmen and porters  but how changed  they were like men blasted by a great sorrow one with his back turned was leaning against a post his head buried on his arm  prince george hotel he groaned at intervals prince george hotel  another was bending over a little handrail his head sunk his arms almost trailing to the ground  king edward he sobbed king edward  a third seated on a stool looked feebly up with tears visible in his eyes  walker house he moaned firstclass accommodation for then he broke down and cried  take this handbag i said to one of the men to the prince george  the man ceased his groaning for a moment and turned to me with something like passion  why do you come to us he protested why not go to one of the others go to him he added as he stirred with his foot a miserable being who lay huddled on the ground and murmured at intervals queens queens hotel  but my new friend who stood at my elbow came to my rescue  take his bags he said youve got to you know the bylaw take it or ill call a policeman you know me my names narrowpath im on the council  the man touched his hat and took the bag with a murmured apology  come along said my companion whom i now perceived to be a person of dignity and civic importance ill walk up with you and show you the city as we go  we had hardly got well upon the street before i realized the enormous change that total prohibition had effected everywhere were the bright smiling faces of working people laughing and singing at their tasks and early though it was cracking jokes and asking one another riddles as they worked  i noticed one man evidently a city employe in a rough white suit busily cleaning the street with a broom and singing to himself how does the little busy bee improve the shining hour another employe who was handling a little hose was singing little drops of water little grains of sand tra la la la la la prohibitions grand  why do they sing i asked are they crazy  sing said mr narrowpath they cant help it they havent had a drink of whisky for four months  a coal cart went by with a driver no longer grimy and smudged but neatly dressed with a high white collar and a white silk tie  my companion pointed at him as he passed  hasnt had a glass of beer for four months he said  notice the difference that mans work is now a pleasure to him he used to spend all his evenings sitting round in the back parlours of the saloons beside the stove now what do you think he does  i have no idea  loads up his cart with coal and goes for a driveout in the country ah sir you who live still under the curse of the whisky traffic little know what a pleasure work itself becomes when drink and all that goes with it is eliminated do you see that man on the other side of the street with the tool bag  yes i said a plumber is he not  exactly a plumber used to drink heavilycouldnt keep a job more than a week now you cant drag him from his work came to my house to fix a pipe under the kitchen sinkwouldnt quit at six oclock got in under the sink and begged to be allowed to staysaid he hated to go home we had to drag him out with a rope but here we are at your hotel  we entered  but how changed the place seemed  our feet echoed on the flagstones of the deserted rotunda  at the office desk sat a clerk silent and melancholy reading the bible he put a marker in the book and closed it murmuring leviticus two  then he turned to us  can i have a room i asked on the first floor  a tear welled up into the clerks eye  you can have the whole first floor he said and he added with a half sob and the second too if you like  i could not help contrasting his manner with what it was in the old days when the mere mention of a room used to throw him into a fit of passion and when he used to tell me that i could have a cot on the roof till tuesday and after that perhaps a bed in the stable  things had changed indeed  can i get breakfast in the grill room i inquired of the melancholy clerk  he shook his head sadly  there is no grill room he answered what would you like  oh some sort of eggs i said and  the clerk reached down below his desk and handed me a hardboiled egg with the shell off  heres your egg he said and theres ice water there at the end of the desk  he sat back in his chair and went on reading  you dont understand said mr narrowpath who still stood at my elbow all that elaborate grill room breakfast business was just a mere relic of the drinking dayssheer waste of time and loss of efficiency go on and eat your egg eaten it now dont you feel efficient what more do you want comfort you say my dear sir more men have been ruined by comfortgreat heavens comfort the most dangerous deadly drug that ever undermined the human race but here drink your water now youre ready to go and do your business if you have any  but i protested its still only halfpast seven in the morningno offices will be open  open exclaimed mr narrowpath why they all open at daybreak now  i had it is true a certain amount of business before me though of no very intricate or elaborate kinda few simple arrangements with the head of a publishing house such as it falls to my lot to make every now and then yet in the old and unregenerate days it used to take all day to do it the wicked thing that we used to call a comfortable breakfast in the hotel grill room somehow carried one on to about ten oclock in the morning breakfast brought with it the need of a cigar for digestions sake and with that for very restfulness a certain perusal of the toronto globe properly corrected and rectified by a look through the toronto mail after that it had been my practice to stroll along to my publishers office at about eleventhirty transact my business over a cigar with the genial gentleman at the head of it and then accept his invitation to lunch with the feeling that a man who has put in a hard and strenuous mornings work is entitled to a few hours of relaxation  i am inclined to think that in those reprehensible bygone times many other people did their business in this same way  i dont think i said to mr narrowpath musingly that my publisher will be up as early as this hes a comfortable sort of man  nonsense said mr narrowpath not at work at halfpast seven in toronto the things absurd where is the office richmond street come along ill go with you ive always a great liking for attending to other peoples business  i see you have i said  its our way here said mr narrowpath with a wave of his hand every mans business as we see it is everybody elses business come along youll be surprised how quickly your business will be done  mr narrowpath was right  my publishers office as we entered it seemed a changed place activity and efficiency were stamped all over it my good friend the publisher was not only there but there with his coat off inordinately busy bawling ordersevidently meant for a printing roomthrough a speaking tube yes he was shouting put whisky in black letter capitals old english double size set it up to look attractive with the legend made in toronto in long clear type underneath  excuse me he said as he broke off for a moment weve a lot of stuff going through the press this morninga big distillery catalogue that we are rushing through were doing all we can mr narrowpath he continued speaking with the deference due to a member of the city council to boom toronto as a whisky centre  quite right quite right said my companion rubbing his hands  and now professor added the publisher speaking with rapidity your contract is all hereonly needs signing i wont keep you more than a momentwrite your name here miss sniggins will you please witness this so help you god hows everything in montreal good morning  pretty quick wasnt it said mr narrowpath as we stood in the street again  wonderful i said feeling almost dazed why i shall be able to catch the morning train back again to montreal  precisely just what everybody finds business done in no time men who used to spend whole days here clear out now in fifteen minutes i knew a man whose business efficiency has so increased under our new regime that he says he wouldnt spend more than five minutes in toronto if he were paid to  but what is this i asked as we were brought to a pause in our walk at a street crossing by a great block of vehicles what are all these drays surely those look like barrels of whisky  so they are said mr narrowpath proudly export whisky fine sight isnt it must be whattwentytwentyfiveloads of it this place sir mark my words is going to prove with its new energy and enterprise one of the greatest seats of the distillery business in fact the whisky capital of the north  but i thought i interrupted much puzzled that whisky was prohibited here since last september  export whiskyexport my dear sir corrected mr narrowpath we dont interfere we have never so far as i know proposed to interfere with any mans right to make and export whisky that sir is a plain matter of business morality doesnt enter into it  i see i answered but will you please tell me what is the meaning of this other crowd of drays coming in the opposite direction surely those are beer barrels are they not  in a sense they are admitted mr narrowpath that is they are import beer it comes in from some other province it was i imagine made in this city our breweries sir are second to none but the sin of selling ithere mr narrowpath raised his hat from his head and stood for a moment in a reverential attituderests on the heads of others  the press of vehicles had now thinned out and we moved on my guide still explaining in some detail the distinction between business principles and moral principles between whisky as a curse and whisky as a source of profit which i found myself unable to comprehend  at length i ventured to interrupt  yet it seems almost a pity i said that with all this beer and whisky around an unregenerate sinner like myself should be prohibited from getting a drink  a drink exclaimed mr narrowpath well i should say so come right in here you can have anything you want  we stepped through a street door into a large long room  why i exclaimed in surprise this is a bar  nonsense said my friend the bar in this province is forbidden weve done with the foul thing for ever this is an import shipping companys delivery office  but this long counter  its not a counter its a desk  and that bartender in his white jacket  tut tut hes not a bartender hes an import goods delivery clerk  whatll you have gentlemen said the import clerk polishing a glass as he spoke  two whisky and sodas said my friend long ones  the import clerk mixed the drinks and set them on the desk  i was about to take one but he interrupted  one minute sir he said  then he took up a desk telephone that stood beside him and i heard him calling up montreal hullo montreal is that montreal well say ive just received an offer here for two whisky and sodas at sixty cents shall i close with it all right gentlemen montreal has effected the sale there you are  dreadful isnt it said mr narrowpath the sunken depraved condition of your city of montreal actually selling whisky deplorable and with that he buried his face in the bubbles of the whisky and soda  mr narrowpath i said would you mind telling me something i fear i am a little confused after what i have seen here as to what your new legislation has been you have not then i understand prohibited the making of whisky  oh no we see no harm in that  nor the sale of it  certainly not said mr narrowpath not if sold properly  nor the drinking of it  oh no that least of all we attach no harm whatever under our law to the mere drinking of whisky  would you tell me then i asked since you have not forbidden the making nor the selling nor the buying nor the drinking of whisky just what it is that you have prohibited what is the difference between montreal and toronto  mr narrowpath put down his glass on the desk in front of him he gazed at me with openmouthed astonishment  toronto he gasped montreal and toronto the difference between montreal and toronto my dear sirtorontotoronto  i stood waiting for him to explain but as i did so i seemed to become aware that a voice not mr narrowpaths but a voice close at my ear was repeating torontotorontotoronto  i sat up with a startstill in my berth in the pullman carwith the voice of the porter calling through the curtains toronto toronto  so it had only been a dream i pulled up the blind and looked out of the window and there was the good old city with the bright sun sparkling on its church spires and on the bay spread out at its feet it looked quite unchanged just the same pleasant old place as cheerful as selfconceited as kindly as hospitable as quarrelsome as wholesome as moral and as loyal and as disagreeable as it always was  porter i said is it true that there is prohibition here now  the porter shook his head  i aint heard of it he said     xviii merry christmas  my dear young friend said father time as he laid his hand gently upon my shoulder you are entirely wrong  then i looked up over my shoulder from the table at which i was sitting and i saw him  but i had known or felt for at least the last halfhour that he was standing somewhere near me  you have had i do not doubt good reader more than once that strange uncanny feeling that there is some one unseen standing beside you in a darkened room let us say with a dying fire when the night has grown late and the october wind sounds low outside and when through the thin curtain that we call reality the unseen world starts for a moment clear upon our dreaming sense  you have had it yes i know you have never mind telling me about it stop i dont want to hear about that strange presentiment you had the night your aunt eliza broke her leg dont lets bother with your experience i want to tell mine  you are quite mistaken my dear young friend repeated father time quite wrong  young friend i said my mind as ones mind is apt to in such a case running to an unimportant detail why do you call me young  your pardon he answered gentlyhe had a gentle way with him had father time the fault is in my failing eyes i took you at first sight for something under a hundred  under a hundred i expostulated well i should think so  your pardon again said time the fault is in my failing memory i forgot you seldom pass that nowadays do you your life is very short of late  i heard him breathe a wistful hollow sigh very ancient and dim he seemed as he stood beside me but i did not turn to look upon him i had no need to i knew his form in the inner and clearer sight of things as well as every human being knows by innate instinct the unseen face and form of father time  i could hear him murmuring beside me shortshort your life is short till the sound of it seemed to mingle with the measured ticking of a clock somewhere in the silent house  then i remembered what he had said  how do you know that i am wrong i asked and how can you tell what i was thinking  you said it out loud answered father time but it wouldnt have mattered anyway you said that christmas was all played out and done with  yes i admitted thats what i said  and what makes you think that he questioned stooping so it seemed to me still further over my shoulder  why i answered the trouble is this ive been sitting here for hours sitting till goodness only knows how far into the night trying to think out something to write for a christmas story and it wont go it cant be donenot in these awful days  a christmas story  yes you see father time i explained glad with a foolish little vanity of my trade to be able to tell him something that i thought enlightening all the christmas stuffstories and jokes and picturesis all done you know in october  i thought it would have surprised him but i was mistaken  dear me he said not till october what a rush how well i remember in ancient egyptas i think you call itseeing them getting out their christmas things all cut in hieroglyphics always two or three years ahead  two or three years i exclaimed  pooh said time that was nothing why in babylon they used to get their christmas jokes readyall baked in claya whole solar eclipse ahead of christmas they said i think that the public preferred them so  egypt i said babylon but surely father time there was no christmas in those days i thought  my dear boy he interrupted gravely dont you know that there has always been christmas  i was silent father time had moved across the room and stood beside the fireplace leaning on the mantelpiece the little wreaths of smoke from the fading fire seemed to mingle with his shadowy outline  well he said presently what is it that is wrong with christmas  why i answered all the romance the joy the beauty of it has gone crushed and killed by the greed of commerce and the horrors of war i am not as you thought i was a hundred years old but i can conjure up as anybody can a picture of christmas in the good old days of a hundred years ago the quaint oldfashioned houses standing deep among the evergreens with the light twinkling from the windows on the snow the warmth and comfort within the great fire roaring on the hearth the merry guests grouped about its blaze and the little children with their eyes dancing in the christmas firelight waiting for father christmas in his fine mummery of red and white and cotton wool to hand the presents from the yuletide tree i can see it i added as if it were yesterday  it was but yesterday said father time and his voice seemed to soften with the memory of bygone years i remember it well  ah i continued that was christmas indeed give me back such days as those with the old good cheer the old stage coaches and the gabled inns and the warm red wine the snapdragon and the christmastree and ill believe again in christmas yes in father christmas himself  believe in him said time quietly you may well do that he happens to be standing outside in the street at this moment  outside i exclaimed why dont he come in  hes afraid to said father time hes frightened and he darent come in unless you ask him may i call him in  i signified assent and father time went to the window for a moment and beckoned into the darkened street then i heard footsteps clumsy and hesitant they seemed upon the stairs and in a moment a figure stood framed in the doorwaythe figure of father christmas he stood shuffling his feet a timid apologetic look upon his face  how changed he was  i had known in my minds eye from childhood up the face and form of father christmas as well as that of old time himself everybody knows or once knew hima jolly little rounded man with a great muffler wound about him a packet of toys upon his back and with such merry twinkling eyes and rosy cheeks as are only given by the touch of the driving snow and the rude fun of the north wind why there was once a time not yet so long ago when the very sound of his sleighbells sent the blood running warm to the heart  but now how changed  all draggled with the mud and rain he stood as if no house had sheltered him these three years past his old red jersey was tattered in a dozen places his muffler frayed and ravelled  the bundle of toys that he dragged with him in a net seemed wet and worn till the cardboard boxes gaped asunder there were boxes among them i vow that he must have been carrying these three past years  but most of all i noted the change that had come over the face of father christmas the old brave look of cheery confidence was gone the smile that had beamed responsive to the laughing eyes of countless children around unnumbered christmastrees was there no more and in the place of it there showed a look of timid apology of apprehensiveness as of one who has asked in vain the warmth and shelter of a human homesuch a look as the harsh cruelty of this world has stamped upon the faces of its outcasts  so stood father christmas shuffling upon the threshold fumbling his poor tattered hat in his hand  shall i come in he said his eyes appealingly on father time  come said time he turned to speak to me your room is dark turn up the lights hes used to light bright light and plenty of it the dark has frightened him these three years past  i turned up the lights and the bright glare revealed all the more cruelly the tattered figure before us  father christmas advanced a timid step across the floor then he paused as if in sudden fear  is this floor mined he said  no no said time soothingly and to me he added in a murmured whisper hes afraid he was blown up in a mine in no mans land between the trenches at christmastime in 1914 it broke his nerve  may i put my toys on that machine gun asked father christmas timidly it will help to keep them dry  it is not a machine gun said time gently see it is only a pile of books upon the sofa and to me he whispered they turned a machine gun on him in the streets of warsaw he thinks he sees them everywhere since then  its all right father christmas i said speaking as cheerily as i could while i rose and stirred the fire into a blaze there are no machine guns here and there are no mines this is but the house of a poor writer  ah said father christmas lowering his tattered hat still further and attempting something of a humble bow a writer are you hans andersen perhaps  not quite i answered  but a great writer i do not doubt said the old man with a humble courtesy that he had learned it well may be centuries ago in the yuletide season of his northern home the world owes much to its great books i carry some of the greatest with me always i have them here  he began fumbling among the limp and tattered packages that he carried look the house that jack builta marvellous deep thing sirand this the babes in the wood will you take it sir a poor present but a present stillnot so long ago i gave them in thousands every christmastime none seem to want them now  he looked appealingly towards father time as the weak may look towards the strong for help and guidance  none want them now he repeated and i could see the tears start in his eyes why is it so has the world forgotten its sympathy with the lost children wandering in the wood  all the world i heard time murmur with a sigh is wandering in the wood but out loud he spoke to father christmas in cheery admonition tut tut good christmas he said you must cheer up here sit in this chair the biggest one sobeside the fire let us stir it to a blaze more wood thats better and listen good old friend to the wind outsidealmost a christmas wind is it not merry and boisterous enough for all the evil times it stirs among  old christmas seated himself beside the fire his hands outstretched towards the flames something of his oldtime cheeriness seemed to flicker across his features as he warmed himself at the blaze  thats better he murmured i was cold sir cold chilled to the bone of old i never felt it so no matter what the wind the world seemed warm about me why is it not so now  you see said time speaking low in a whisper for my ear alone how sunk and broken he is will you not help  gladly i answered if i can  all can said father time every one of us  meantime christmas had turned towards me a questioning eye in which however there seemed to revive some little gleam of merriment  have you perhaps he asked half timidly schnapps  schnapps i repeated  ay schnapps a glass of it to drink your health might warm my heart again i think  ah i said something to drink  his one failing whispered time if it is one forgive it him he was used to it for centuries give it him if you have it  i keep a little in the house i said reluctantly perhaps in case of illness  tut tut said father time as something as near as could be to a smile passed over his shadowy face in case of illness they used to say that in ancient babylon here let me pour it for him drink father christmas drink  marvellous it was to see the old man smack his lips as he drank his glass of liquor neat after the fashion of old norway  marvellous too to see the way in which with the warmth of the fire and the generous glow of the spirits his face changed and brightened till the oldtime cheerfulness beamed again upon it  he looked about him as it were with a new and growing interest  a pleasant room he said and what better sir than the wind without and a brave fire within  then his eye fell upon the mantelpiece where lay among the litter of books and pipes a little toy horse  ah said father christmas almost gayly children in the house  one i answered the sweetest boy in all the world  ill be bound he is said father christmas and he broke now into a merry laugh that did ones heart good to hear they all are lord bless me the number that i have seen and each and every oneand quite right toothe sweetest child in all the world and how old do you say two and a half all but two months except a week the very sweetest age of all ill bet you say eh what they all do  and the old man broke again into such a jolly chuckling of laughter that his snowwhite locks shook upon his head  but stop a bit he added this horse is broken tut tut a hind leg nearly off this wont do  he had the toy in his lap in a moment mending it it was wonderful to see for all his age how deft his fingers were  time he said and it was amusing to note that his voice had assumed almost an authoritative tone reach me that piece of string thats right here hold your finger across the knot there now then a bit of beeswax what no beeswax tut tut how illsupplied your houses are today how can you mend toys sir without beeswax still it will stand up now  i tried to murmur by best thanks  but father christmas waved my gratitude aside  nonsense he said thats nothing thats my life perhaps the little boy would like a book too i have them here in the packet here sir jack and the bean stalk most profound thing i read it to myself often still how damp it is pray sir will you let me dry my books before your fire  only too willingly i said how wet and torn they are  father christmas had risen from his chair and was fumbling among his tattered packages taking from them his childrens books all limp and draggled from the rain and wind  all wet and torn he murmured and his voice sank again into sadness i have carried them these three years past look these were for little children in belgium and in serbia can i get them to them think you  time gently shook his head  but presently perhaps said father christmas if i dry and mend them look some of them were inscribed already this one see you was written with fathers love why has it never come to him is it rain or tears upon the page  he stood bowed over his little books his hands trembling as he turned the pages then he looked up the old fear upon his face again  that sound he said listen it is gunsi hear them  no no i said it is nothing only a car passing in the street below  listen he said hear that againvoices crying  no no i answered not voices only the night wind among the trees  my childrens voices he exclaimed i hear them everywherethey come to me in every windand i see them as i wander in the night and stormmy childrentorn and dying in the trenchesbeaten into the groundi hear them crying from the hospitalseach one to me still as i knew him once a little child time time he cried reaching out his arms in appeal give me back my children  they do not die in vain time murmured gently  but christmas only moaned in answer  give me back my children  then he sank down upon his pile of books and toys his head buried in his arms  you see said time his heart is breaking and will you not help him if you can  only too gladly i replied but what is there to do  this said father time listen  he stood before me grave and solemn a shadowy figure but half seen though he was close beside me the firelight had died down and through the curtained windows there came already the first dim brightening of dawn  the world that once you knew said father time seems broken and destroyed about you you must not let them knowthe children the cruelty and the horror and the hate that racks the world todaykeep it from them some day he will knowhere time pointed to the prostrate form of father christmasthat his children that once were have not died in vain that from their sacrifice shall come a nobler better world for all to live in a world where countless happy children shall hold bright their memory for ever but for the children of today save and spare them all you can from the evil hate and horror of the war later they will know and understand not yet give them back their merry christmas and its kind thoughts and its christmas charity till later on there shall be with it again peace upon earth good will towards men  his voice ceased it seemed to vanish as it were in the sighing of the wind  i looked up father time and christmas had vanished from the room the fire was low and the day was breaking visibly outside  let us begin i murmured i will mend this broken horse   end
