just speak your mind  father hart              put it away my colleen god spreads the heavens above us like great wings and gives a little round of deeds and days and then come the wrecked angels and

flattered edenes heart with merry words my colleen i have seen some other girls restless and ill at ease but years went by and they grew like their neighbours and were glad in minding children working

excellent old way through love and through the care of children to the hour for bidding fate and time and change goodbye      a knock at the door maire bruin opens it and then takes a sod of     turf out of the hearth in the tongs and passes it through the door and     closes the door and remains standing by it  maire bruin  a little queer old man in a green coat who asked a burning sod to light

come faeries take me out of this dull house let me have all the freedom i have lost work when i will and idle when i will faeries came take me out of this dull world for i would ride with you upon the wind run on the top of the dishevelled tide and dance upon the mountains like a flame  father hart  you cannot know the meaning of your words  maire bruin  father i am right weary of four tongues a tongue that is too crafty and too wise a tongue that is too godly and too grave a tongue that is more bitter than the tide and a kind tongue too full of drowsy love of drowsy love and my captivity      shawn bruin comes over to her and leads her to the settle  shawn bruin  do not blame me i often lie awake thinking that all things trouble your bright head how beautiful it issuch broad pale brows under a cloudy blossoming of hair sit down beside me herethese are too old and have forgotten they were ever young  maire bruin  o you are the great doorpost of this house and i the red nasturtium climbing up      she takes shawns hand but looks shyly at the priest and lets it     go  father hart  good daughter take his handby love alone god binds us to himself and to the hearth and shuts us from the waste beyond his peace from maddening freedom and bewildering light  shawn bruin  would that the world were mine to give it you with every quiet hearth and barren waste the maddening freedom of its woods and tides and the bewildering lights upon its hills  maire bruin  then i would take and break it in my hands to see you smile watching it crumble away  shawn bruin  then i would mould a world of fire and dew with no one bitter grave or over wise and nothing marred or old to do you wrong and crowd the enraptured quiet of the sky with candles burning to your lonely face  maire bruin  your looks are all the candles that i need  shawn bruin  once a fly dancing in a beam o the sun or the light wind blowing out of the dawn could fill your heart with dreams none other knew but now the indissoluble sacrament has mixed your heart that was most proud and cold with my warm heart for ever and sun and moor must fade and heaven be rolled up like a scroll but your white spirit still walk by my spirit for not a power in earth and heaven and hell can break this bond binding heart unto heart      a voice sings in the distance  maire bruin  did you hear something call o guard me close because i have said wicked things tonight  a voice close to the door  the wind blows out of the gates of the day   the wind blows over the lonely of heart and the lonely of heart is withered away   while the faeries dance in a place apart shaking their milkwhite feet in a ring   tossing their milkwhite arms in the air for they hear the wind laugh and murmur and sing   of a land where even the old are fair and even the wise are merry of tongue   but i heard a reed of coolaney say when the wind has laughed and murmured and sung   the lonely of heart must wither away  maurteen bruin  i am right happy and would make all else be happy too i hear a child outside and will go bring her in out of the cold      he opens the door a child dressed in a green jacket with a red     cap comes into

bridget bruin  she is the child of gentle people look at her white hands and at her pretty dress ive brought you some new milk but wait awhile and i will put it by the fire to warm for things well fitted for poor folk like us would never please a highborn child like you  the child  old mother my old mother the green dawn brightens above while you blow up the fire and evening finds you spreading the white cloth the young may lie in bed and dream and hope but you work on because your heart is old  bridget bruin  the young are idle  the child              old father you are wise and all the years have gathered in your heart to whisper of the wonders that are gone the young must sigh through many a dream and hope but you are wise because your heart is old  maurteen bruin  o who would

sip  the child              put on my shoes old mother for i would like to dance now i have dined the reeds are dancing by coolaney lake and i would like to dance until the reeds and the loud wind the white wave on the shore and all the stars have danced themselves to sleep      bridget having put on her shoes she gets off the old mans knees     and is about to dance but suddenly sees the crucifix and shrieks and     covers her eyes  what is that ugly thing on the black cross  father hart  you cannot know how naughty your words are that is our blessed lord  the child  hide it away  bridget bruin  i have begun to be afraid again  the child  hide it away  maurteen bruin  that would be wickedness  bridget bruin  that would be sacrilege  the child              the tortured thing hide it

be tender with all budding things our maker let no thought of calvary trouble the morning stars in their first song      puts the crucifix in the inner room  the child  o what a nice smooth floor to dance upon the wind is blowing on the waving reeds the wind is blowing on the heart of man      she dances swaying about like the reeds  maire to shawn bruin  just now when she came near i thought i heard other small steps beating upon the floor and a faint music blowing in the wind invisible pipes giving her feet the time  shawn bruin  i heard no step but hers  maire bruin              look to the bolt because the unholy powers are abroad  maurteen bruin to the child  come over here and if you promise me not to talk wickedly of holy things ill give you something  the child  bring it me old father      maurteen bruin goes into the next room  father hart  i will have queen cakes when you come to me      maurteen bruin returns and lays a piece of money on the table the     child makes a gesture of refusal  maurteen bruin  it will buy lots of toys see how it glitters  the child  come tell me do you love me  maurteen bruin  i love you  the child  ah but you love this fireside  father hart  i love you  the child  but you love him above  bridget bruin  she is blaspheming  the child to maire  and do you likewise love me  maire bruin  i dont know  the child  you love that great tall fellow over there yet i could make you ride upon the winds run on the top of the dishevelled tide and dance upon the mountains like a flame  maire bruin  queen of the angels and kind saints defend us some dreadful fate has fallen before she came the wind cried out and took the primroses and i gave milk and fire and when she came she made you hide the blessed crucifix she wears too the green jacket and red cap of the unholy creatures of the raths  father hart  you fear because of her wild pretty prates she knows no better       to the child child how old are you  the child  my own dear people live a long long time so i am young but measure by your years and i am older than the eagle cock who blinks and blinks on ballydawley hill and hes the oldest thing under the moon at times i merely care to dance and dance at times grow wiser than the eagle cock  father hart  what are you  the child              i am of the faery people i sent my messengers for milk and fire and then i heard one call to me and came      they all except maire bruin gather about the priest for     protection maire bruin stays on the settle as if in a trance of     terror the child takes primroses from the great bowl and begins to     strew them between herself and the priest and about maire bruin     during the following dialogue shawn bruin goes more than once to     the brink of the primroses but shrinks back to the others timidly  father hart  i will confront this mighty spirit alone      they cling to him and hold him back  the child while she strews the primroses  no one whose heart is heavy with human tears can cross these little cressets of the wood  father hart  be not afraid the father is with us and all the nine angelic hierarchies the holy martyrs and the innocents the adoring magi in their coats of mail and he who died and rose on the third day and mary with her seven times wounded heart  the child ceases strewing the primroses and kneels upon the settle beside maire and puts her arms about her neck  cry daughter to the angels and the saints  the child  you shall go with me newlymarried bride and gaze upon a merrier multitude whitearmed nuala and ardroe the wise feacra of the hurtling foam and him who is the ruler of the western host finvarra and their land of hearts desire where beauty has no ebb decay no flood but joy is wisdom time an endless song i kiss you and the world begins to fade  father hart  daughter i call you unto home and love  the child  stay and come with me newlymarried bride for if you hear him you grow like the rest bear children cook be mindful of the churn and wrangle over butter fowl and eggs and sit at last there old and bitter of tongue watching the white stars war upon your hopes  father hart  daughter i point you out the way to heaven  the child  but i can lead you newlymarried bride where nobody gets old and crafty and wise where nobody gets old and godly and grave where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue and where kind tongues bring no captivity for we are only true to the far lights we follow singing over valley and hill  father hart  by the dear name of the one crucified i bid you maire bruin come to me  the child  i keep you in the name of your own heart      she leaves the settle and stooping takes up a mass of primroses and     kisses them       we have great power tonight dear golden folk for he took down and hid the crucifix and my invisible brethren fill the house i hear their footsteps going up and down o they shall soon rule all the hearts of men and own all lands last night they merrily danced about his chapel belfrey to maire come away i hear my brethren bidding us away  father hart  i will go fetch the crucifix again      they hang about him in terror and prevent him from moving  bridget bruin  the enchanted flowers will kill us if you go  maurteen bruin  they turn the flowers to little twisted flames  shawn bruin  the little twisted flames burn up the heart  the child  i hear them call us newlymarried bride  maire bruin  i will go with you  father hart  she is lost alas  the child standing by the door  then follow but the heavy body of clay and clinging mortal hope must fall from you for we who ride the winds run on the waves and dance upon the mountains are more light than dewdrops on the banners of the dawn  maire bruin  then take my soul      shawn bruin goes over to her  shawn bruin              beloved do not leave me what will my life be if you go with her remember when i met you by the well and took your hand in mine and spoke of love  maire bruin  dear face dear voice  the child  come newlymarried bride  maire bruin  i always loved her worldand yetand yet i think that i would stay if i could stay  sinks into his arms  the child from the door  white bird white bird come with me little bird  maire bruin  she calls my soul  the child  come with me little bird  maire bruin  i can hear songs and dancing  shawn bruin  stay with me  maire bruin  dear i would stayand yet and yet  the child              white bird come little bird with crest of gold  maire bruin very softly  and yet  the child  come little bird with silver feet  shawn bruin  dead dead  father hart  thus do the evil spirits snatch their prey almost out of the very hand of god and day by day their power is more and more and men and women leave old paths for pride comes knocking with thin knuckles on the heart  a voice sings outside  the wind blows out of the gates of the day   the wind blows over the lonely of heart and the lonely of heart is withered away   while the faeries dance in a place apart shaking their milkwhite feet in a ring   tossing their milkwhite arms in the air for they hear the wind laugh and murmur and sing   of a land where even the old are fair and even the wise are merry of tongue   but i heard a reed of coolaney say when the wind has laughed and murmured and sung   the lonely of heart must wither away      the song is taken up by many voices who sing loudly as if in     triumph some of the voices seem to come from within the house
