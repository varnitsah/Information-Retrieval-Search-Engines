bribery and corruption   chapter xvii  utter failure   chapter xviii  the mistress of trimley deen     chapter i  on the way to the river  for reasons of my own i excused myself from accompanying my stepmother to a dinnerparty given in our neighborhood in my present humor i preferred being aloneand as a means of getting through my idle time i was quite content to be occupied in catching insects  provided with a brush and a mixture of rum and treacle i went into fordwitch wood to set the snare familiar to hunters of moths which we call sugaring the trees  the summer evening was hot and still the time was between dusk and dark after ten years of absence in foreign parts i perceived changes in the outskirts of the wood which warned me not to enter it too confidently when i might find a difficulty in seeing my way remaining among the outermost trees i painted the trunks with my treacherous mixturewhich allured the insects of the night and stupefied them when they settled on its rank surface the snare being set i waited to see the intoxication of the moths  a time passed dull and dreary the mysterious assemblage of trees was blacker than the blackening sky of millions of leaves over my head none pleased my ear in the airless calm with their rustling summer song  the first flying creatures dimly visible by moments under the gloomy sky were enemies whom i well knew by experience many a fine insect specimen have i lost when the bats were near me in search of their evening meal  what had happened before in other woods happened now the first moth that i had snared was a large one and a specimen well worth securing as i stretched out my hand to take it the apparition of a flying shadow passed swift and noiseless between me and the tree in less than an instant the insect was snatched away when my fingers were within an inch of it the bat had begun his supper and the man and the mixture had provided it for him  out of five moths caught i became the victim of clever theft in the case of three the other two of no great value as specimens i was just quick enough to secure under other circumstances my patience as a collector would still have been a match for the dexterity of the bats but on that eveninga memorable evening when i look back at it nowmy spirits were depressed and i was easily discouraged my favorite studies of the insectworld seemed to have lost their value in my estimation in the silence and the darkness i lay down under a tree and let my mind dwell on myself and on my new life to come   i am gerard roylake son and only child of the late gerard roylake of trimley deen  at twentytwo years of age my fathers death had placed me in possession of his large landed property on my arrival from germany only a few hours since the servants innocently vexed me when i drove up to the door i heard them say to each other here is the young squire my father used to be called the old squire i shrank from being reminded of himnot as other sons in my position might have said because it renewed my sorrow for his death there was no sorrow in me to be renewed it is a shocking confession to make my heart remained unmoved when i thought of the father whom i had lost  our mothers have the most sacred of all claims on our gratitude and our love they have nourished us with their blood they have risked their lives in bringing us into the world they have preserved and guided our helpless infancy with divine patience and love what claim equally strong and equally tender does the other parent establish on his offspring what motive does the instinct of his young children find for preferring their father before any other person who may be a familiar object in their daily lives they love himnaturally and rightly love himbecause he lives in their remembrance if he is a good man as the first the best the dearest of their friends  my father was a bad man he was my mothers worst enemy and he was never my friend  the little that i know of the world tells me that it is not the common lot in life of women to marry the object of their first love a sense of duty had compelled my mother to part with the man who had won her heart in the first days of her maidenhood and my father had discovered it after his marriage his insane jealousy foully wronged the truest wife the most longsuffering woman that ever lived i have no patience to write of it for ten miserable years she suffered her martyrdom she lived through it dear angel sweet suffering soul for my sake at her death my father was able to gratify his hatred of the son whom he had never believed to be his own child under pretence of preferring the foreign system of teaching he sent me to a school in france my education having been so far completed i was next transferred to a german university never again did i see the place of my birth never did i get a letter from home until the family lawyer wrote from trimley deen requesting me to assume possession of my house and lands under the entail  i should not even have known that my father had taken a second wife but for some friend or enemyi never discovered the personwho sent me a newspaper containing an announcement of the marriage  when we saw each other for the first time my stepmother and i met necessarily as strangers we were elaborately polite and we each made a meritorious effort to appear at our ease on her side she found herself confronted by a young man the new master of the house who looked more like a foreigner than an englishmanwho when he was congratulated in view of the approaching season on the admirable preservation of his partridges and pheasants betrayed an utter want of interest in the subject and who showed no sense of shame in acknowledging that his principal amusements were derived from reading books and collecting insects how i must have disappointed mrs roylake and how considerately she hid from me the effect that i had produced  turning next to my own impressions i discovered in my newlyfound relative a little lighteyed lighthaired elegant woman trim and bright and smiling dressed to perfection clever to her fingers ends skilled in making herself agreeableand yet in spite of these undeniable fascinations perfectly incomprehensible to me after my experience of foreign society i was incapable of understanding the extraordinary importance which my stepmother seemed to attach to rank and riches entirely for their own sakes when she described my unknown neighbors from one end of the county to the other she took it for granted that i must be interested in them on account of their titles and their fortunes she held me up to my own face as a kind of idol to myself without producing any better reason than might be found in my inheritance of an income of sixteen thousand pounds and when i expressed in excusing myself for not accompanying her uninvited to the dinnerparty a perfectly rational doubt whether i might prove to be a welcome guest mrs roylake held up her delicate little hands in unutterable astonishment my dear gerard in your position she appeared to think that this settled the question i submitted in silence the truth is i was beginning already to despair of my prospects kind as my stepmother was and agreeable as she was what chance could i see of establishing any true sympathy between us and if my neighbors resembled her in their ways of thinking what hope could i feel of finding new friends in england to replace the friends in germany whom i had lost a stranger among my own country people with the everyday habits and everyday pleasures of my youthful life left behind mewithout plans or hopes to interest me in looking at the futureit is surely not wonderful that my spirits had sunk to their lowest ebb and that i even failed to appreciate with sufficient gratitude the fortunate accident of my birth  perhaps the journey to england had fatigued me or perhaps the controlling influences of the dark and silent night proved irresistible this only is certain my solitary meditations under the tree ended in sleep  i was awakened by a light falling on my face  the moon had risen in the outward part of the wood beyond which i had not advanced the pure and welcome light penetrated easily through the scattered trees i got up and looked about me a path into the wood now showed itself broader and better kept than any path that i could remember in the days of my boyhood the moon showed it to me plainly and my curiosity was aroused  following the new track i found that it led to a little glade which i at once recognized the place was changed in one respect only a neglected waterspring had been cleared of brambles and stones and had been provided with a drinking cup a rustic seat and a latin motto on a marble slab the spring at once reminded me of a greater body of watera river at some little distance farther on which ran between the trees on one side and the desolate open country on the other ascending from the glade i found myself in one of the narrow woodland paths familiar to me in the bygone time  unless my memory was at fault this was the way which led to an old watermill on the riverbank the image of the great turning wheel which halffrightened halffascinated me when i was a child now presented itself to my memory for the first time after an interval of many years in my present frame of mind the old scene appealed to me with the irresistible influence of an old friend i said to myself shall i walk on and try if i can find the river and the mill again this perfectly trifling question to decide presented to me nevertheless fantastic difficulties so absurd that they might have been difficulties encountered in a dream to my own astonishment i hesitatedwalked back again along the path by which i had advancedreconsidered my decision without knowing whyand turning in the opposite direction set my face towards the river once more i wonder how my life would have ended if i had gone the other way    chapter ii  the river introduces us  i stood alone on the bank of the ugliest stream in england  the moonlight pouring its unclouded radiance over open space failed to throw a beauty not their own on those sluggish waters broad and muddy their stealthy current flowed onward to the sea without a rock to diversify without a bubble to break the sullen surface on the side from which i was looking at the river the neglected trees grew so close together that they were undermining their own lives and poisoning each other on the opposite bank a rank growth of gigantic bulrushes hid the ground beyond except where it rose in hillocks and showed its surface of desert sand spotted here and there by mean patches of health a repellent river in itself a repellent river in its surroundings a repellent river even in its name it was called the loke neither popular tradition nor antiquarian research could explain what the name meant or could tell when the name had been given we call it the loke they do say no fish can live in it and it dirties the clean salt water when it runs into the sea such was the character of the river in the estimation of the people who knew it best but i was pleased to see the loke again the ugly river like the woodland glade looked at me with the face of an old friend  on my right hand side rose the venerable timbers of the watermill  the wheel was motionless at that time of night and the whole structure lookedas remembered objects will look when we see them again after a long intervalsmaller than i had supposed it to be otherwise i could discover no change in the mill but the wooden cottage attached to it had felt the devastating march of time a portion of the decrepit building still stood revealed in its wretched old age propped partly by beams which reached from the thatched roof to the ground and partly by the wall of a new cottage attached presenting in yellow brickwork a hideous modern contrast to all that was left of its ancient neighbor  had the miller whom i remembered died and were these changes the work of his successor i thought of asking the question and tried the door it was fastened the windows were all dark excepting one which i discovered in the upper storey at the farther side of the new building here there was a dim light burning it was impossible to disturb a person who for all i knew to the contrary might be going to bed i turned back to the loke proposing to extend my walk by a mile or a little more to a village that i remembered on the bank of the river  i had not advanced far when the stillness around me was disturbed by an intermittent sound of splashing in the water pausing to listen i heard next the working of oars in their rowlocks after another interval a boat appeared turning a projection in the bank and rowed by a woman pulling steadily against the stream  as the boat approached me in the moonlight this person corrected my first impression and revealed herself as a young girl so far as i could perceive she was a stranger to me who could the girl be alone on the river at that time of night idly curious i followed the boat instead of pursuing my way to the village to see whether she would stop at the mill or pass it  she stopped at the mill secured the boat and stepped on shore  taking a key from her pocket she was about to open the door of the cottage when i advanced and spoke to her as far from recognizing her as ever i found myself nevertheless thinking of an odd outspoken child living at the mill in past years who had been one of my poor mothers favorites at our village school i ran the risk of offending her by bluntly expressing the thought which was then in my mind  is it possible that you are cristel toller i said  the question seemed to amuse her why shouldnt i be cristel toller she asked  you were a little girl i explained when i saw you last you are so altered nowand so improvedthat i should never have guessed you might be the daughter of giles toller of the mill if i had not seen you opening the cottage door  she acknowledged my compliment by a curtsey which reminded me again of the village school thank you young man she said smartly i wonder who you are  try if you can recollect me i suggested  may i take a long look at you  as long as you like  she studied my face with a mental effort to remember me which gathered her pretty eyebrows together quaintly in a frown  theres something in his eyes she remarked not speaking to me but to herself which doesnt seem to be quite strange but i dont know his voice and i dont know his beard she considered a little and addressed herself directly to me once more now i look at you again you seem to be a gentleman are you one  i hope so  then youre not making game of me  my dear i am only trying if you can remember gerard roylake  while in charge of the boat the millers daughter had been rowing with bared arms beautiful dusky arms at once delicate and strong thus far she had forgotten to cover them up the moment mentioned my name she started back as if i had frightened herpulled her sleeves down in a hurryand hid the objects of my admiration as an act of homage to myself her verbal apologies followed  you used to be such a sweetspoken pretty little boy she said how should i know you again with a big voice and all that hair on your face it seemed to strike her on a sudden that she had been too familiar oh lord i heard her say to herself half the county belongs to him she tried another apology and hit this time on the conventional form i beg your pardon sir welcome back to your own country sir i wish you goodnight sir  she attempted to escape into the cottage i followed her to the threshold of the door surely its not time to go to bed yet i ventured to say  she was still on her good behavior to her landlord not if you object to it sir she answered  this recognition of my authority was irresistible cristel had laid me under an obligation to her good influence for which i felt sincerely gratefulshe had made me laugh for the first time since my return to england  we neednt say goodnight just yet i suggested i want to hear a little more about you shall i come in  she stepped out of the doorway even more rapidly than she had stepped into it i might have been mistaken but i thought cristel seemed to be actually alarmed by my proposal we walked up and down the riverbank on every occasion when we approached the cottage i detected her in stealing a look at the ugly modern part of it there could be no mistake this time i saw doubt i saw anxiety in her face what was going on at the mill i made some domestic inquiries beginning with her father was the miller alive and well  oh yes sir father gets thinner as he gets olderthats all  did he send you out by yourself at this late hour in the boat  they were waiting for a sack of flour down there she replied pointing in the direction of the riverside village father isnt as quick as he used to be hes often late over his work now  was there no one to give giles toller the help that he must need at his age do you and your father really live alone in this solitary place i said  a change of expression appeared in her bright brown eyes which roused my curiosity i also observed that she evaded a direct reply what makes you doubt sir if father and i live alone she asked  i pointed to the new cottage that ugly building i answered seems to give you more room than you wantunless there is somebody else living at the mill  i had no intention of trying to force the reply from her which she had hitherto withheld but she appeared to put that interpretation on what i had said if you will have it she burst out there is somebody else living with us  a man who helps your father  no a man who pays my fathers rent  i was quite unprepared for such a reply as this cristel had surprised me to begin with her father was wellconnected as we say in england his younger brother had made a fortune in commerce and had vainly offered him the means of retiring from the mill with a sufficient income then again giles toller was known to have saved money his domestic expenses made no heavy demand on his purse his german wife whose christian name was now borne by his daughter had died long since his sons were no burden on him they had never lived at the mill in my remembrance with all these reasons against his taking a stranger into his house he had nevertheless if my interpretation of cristels answer was the right one let his spare rooms to a lodger mr toller cant possibly be in want of money i said  the more money father has the more he wants thats the reason she added bitterly why he asked for plenty of room when the cottage was built and why we have got a lodger  is the lodger a gentleman  i dont know is a man a gentleman if he keeps a servant oh dont trouble to think about it sir it isnt worth thinking about  this was plain speaking at last you dont seem to like the lodger i said  i hate him  why  she turned on me with a look of angry amazementnot undeserved i must own on my partwhich showed her dark beauty in the perfection of its luster and its power to my eyes she was at the moment irresistibly charming i daresay i was blind to the defects in her face my good german tutor used to lament that there was too much of my boyhood still left in me honestly admiring her i let my favorable opinion express itself a little too plainly what a splendid creature you are i burst out cristel did her duty to herself and to me she passed over my little explosion of nonsense without taking the smallest notice of it  master gerard she beganand checked herself please to excuse me sir you have set my head running on old times what i want to say is you were not so inquisitive when you were a young gentleman in short jackets please behave as you used to behave then and dont say anything more about our lodger i hate him because i hate him there  ignorant as i was of the natures of women i understood her at last cristels opinion of the lodger was evidently the exact opposite of the lodgers opinion of cristel when i add that this discovery did decidedly operate as a relief to my mind the impression produced on me by the millers daughter is stated without exaggeration and without reserve  goodnight she repeated for the last time i held out my hand is it quite right sir she modestly objected for such as me to shake hands with such as you  she did it nevertheless and dropping my hand cast a farewell look at the mysterious object of her interestthe new cottage her variable humor changed on the instant apparently in a state of unendurable irritation she stamped on the ground just what i didnt want to happen she said to herself    chapter iii  he shows himself  i too looked at the cottage and made a discovery that surprised me at one of the upper windows  if i could be sure that the moon had not deceived me the most beautiful face that i had ever seen was looking down on usand it was the face of a man by the uncertain light i could discern the perfection of form in the features and the expression of power which made it impossible to mistake the stranger for a woman although his hair grew long and he was without either moustache or beard he was watching us intently he neither moved nor spoke when we looked up at him  evidently the lodger i whispered to cristel what a handsome man  she tossed her head contemptuously my expression of admiration seemed to have irritated her  i didnt want him to see you she said the lodger persecutes me with his attentions hes impudent enough to be jealous of me  she spoke without even attempting to lower her voice i endeavored to warn her hes at the window still i said in tones discreetly lowered he can hear everything you are saying  not one word of it mr gerard  what do you mean  the man is deaf dont look at him again dont speak to me again go homepray go home  without further explanation she abruptly entered the cottage and shut the door  as i turned into the path which led through the wood i heard a voice behind me it said stop sir i stopped directly standing in the shadow cast by the outermost line of trees which i had that moment reached in the moonlight that i had left behind me i saw again the man whom i had discovered at the window his figure tall and slim his movements graceful and easy were in harmony with his beautiful face he lifted his long finelyshaped hands and clasped them with a frantic gesture of entreaty  for gods sake he said dont be offended with me  his voice startled me even more than his words i had never heard anything like it before low dull and muffled it neither rose nor fell it spoke slowly and deliberately without laying the slightest emphasis on any one of the words that it uttered in the astonishment of the moment i forgot what cristel had told me i answered him as i should have answered any other unknown person who had spoken to me  what do you want  his hands dropped his head sunk on his breast you are speaking sir to a miserable creature who cant hear you i am deaf  i stepped nearer to him intending to raise my voice in pity for his infirmity he shuddered and signed to me to keep back  dont come close to my ear dont shout as he spoke strong excitement flashed at me in his eyes without producing the slightest change in his voice i dont deny he resumed that i can hear sometimes when people take that way with me they hurt when they do it their voices go through my nerves as a knife might go through my flesh i live at the mill sir i have a great favour to ask will you come and speak to me in my roomfor five minutes only  i hesitated any other man in my place would i think have done the same receiving such an invitation as this from a stranger whose pitiable infirmity seemed to place him beyond the pale of social intercourse  he must have guessed what was passing in my mind he tried me again in words which might have proved persuasive had they been uttered in the customary variety of tone  i cant help being a stranger to you i cant help being deaf youre a young man you look more merciful and more patient than young men in general wont you hear what i have to say wont you tell me what i want to know  how were we to communicate did he by any chance suppose that i had learnt the finger alphabet i touched my fingers and shook my head as a means of dissipating his delusion if it existed  he instantly understood me  even if you knew the finger alphabet he said it would be of no use i have been too miserable to learn itmy deafness only came on me a little more than a year since pardon me if i am obliged to give you troublei ask persons who pity me to write their answers when i speak to them come to my room and you will find what you wanta candle to write by  was his will as compared with mine the stronger will of the two and was it helped insensibly to myself by his advantages of personal appearance i can only confess that his apology presented a picture of misery to my mind which shook my resolution to refuse him his ready penetration discovered this change in his favour he at once took advantage of it five minutes of your time is all i ask for he said wont you indulge a man who sees his fellowcreatures all talking happily round him and feels dead and buried among them  the very exaggeration of his language had its effect on my mind it revealed to me the horrible isolation among humanity of the deaf as i had never understood it yet discretion is i am sorry to say not one of the strong points in my character i committed one more among the many foolish actions of my life i signed to the stranger to lead the way back to the mill    chapter iv  he explains himself  giles tollers miserly nature had offered to his lodger shelter from wind and rain and the furniture absolutely necessary to make a bedroom habitableand nothing more there was no carpet on the floor no paper on the walls no ceiling to hide the rafters of the roof the chair that i sat on was the one chair in the room the man whose guest i had rashly consented to be found a seat on his bed upon his table i saw pens and pencils paper and ink and a battered brass candlestick with a common tallow candle in it his changes of clothing were flung on the bed his money was left on the unpainted wooden chimneypiece his wretched little morsel of lookingglass propped up near the money had been turned with its face to the wall he perceived that the odd position of this last object had attracted my notice  vanity and i have parted company he explained i shrink from myself when i look at myself now the ugliest man livingif he has got his hearingis a more agreeable man in society than i am does this wretched place disgust you  he pushed a pencil and some sheets of writingpaper across the table to me i wrote my reply the place makes me sorry for you  he shook his head your sympathy is thrown away on me a man who has lost his social relations with his fellowcreatures doesnt care how he lodges or where he lives when he has found solitude he has found all he wants for the rest of his days shall we introduce ourselves it wont be easy for me to set the example  i used the pencil again why not  because you will expect me to give you my name i cant do it i have ceased to bear my family name and being out of society what need have i for an assumed name as for my christian name its so detestably ugly that i hate the sight and sound of it here they know me as the lodger will you have that or will you have an appropriate nickname i come of a mixed breed and im likely after what has happened to me to turn out a worthless fellow call me the cur oh you neednt start thats as accurate a description of me as any other whats your name  i wrote it for him his face darkened when he found out who i was  young personally attractive and a great landowner he said i saw you just now talking familiarly with cristel toller i didnt like that at the time i like it less than ever now  my pencil asked him without ceremony what he meant  he was ready with his reply i mean this you owe something to the good luck which has placed you where you are keep your familiarity for ladies in your own rank of life  this to a young man like me was unendurable insolence i had hitherto refrained from taking him at his own bitter word in the matter of nickname in the irritation of the moment i now first resolved to adopt his suggestion seriously the next slip of paper that i handed to him administered the smartest rebuff that my dull brains could discover on the spur of the moment the cur is requested to keep his advice till he is asked for it  for the first time something like a smile showed itself faintly on his lipsand represented the only effect which my severity had produced he still followed his own train of thought as resolutely and as impertinently as ever  i havent seen you talking to cristel before tonight have you been meeting her in secret  in justice to the girl i felt that i ought to set him right so far taking up the pencil again i told this strange man that i had just returned to england after an absence of many years in foreign countriesthat i had known cristel when we were both childrenand that i had met her purely by accident when he had detected us talking outside the cottage seeing me pause after advancing to that point in the writing of my reply he held out his hand impatiently for the paper i signed him to wait and added a last sentence understand this i will answer no more questionsi have done with the subject  he read what i had written with the closest attention but his inveterate suspicion of me was not set at rest even yet  are you likely to come this way again he asked  i pointed to the final lines of my writing and got up to go  this assertion of my will against his roused him he stopped me at the doornot by a motion of his hand but by the mastery of his look the dim candlelight afforded me no help in determining the color of his eyes dark large and finely set in his head there was a sinister passion in them at that moment which held me in spite of myself still as monotonous as ever his voice in some degree expressed the frenzy that was in him by suddenly rising in its pitch when he spoke to me next  mr roylake i love her mr roylake i am determined to marry her any man who comes between me and that cruel girlah shes as hard as one of her fathers millstones its the misery of my life its the joy of my life to love heri tell you young sir any man who comes between cristel and me does it at his peril remember that  i had no wish to give offencebut his threatening me in this manner was so absurd that i gave way to the impression of the moment and laughed he stepped up to me with such an expression of demoniacal rage and hatred in his face that he became absolutely ugly in an instant  i amuse you do i he said you dont know the man youre trifling with you had better know me you shall know me he turned away and walked up and down the wretched little room deep in thought i dont want this matter between us to end badly he said interrupting his meditationsthen returning to them againand then once more addressing me youre young youre thoughtless but you dont look like a bad fellow i wonder whether i can trust you not one man in a thousand would do it never mind im the one man in ten thousand who does it mr gerard roylake im going to trust you  with this incoherent expression of a resolution unknown to me he unlocked a shabby trunk hidden in a corner and took from it a small portfolio  men of your age he resumed seldom look below the surface learn that valuable habit sirand begin by looking below the surface of me he forced the portfolio into my hand once more his beautiful eyes held me with their irresistible influence they looked at me with an expression of sad and solemn warning discover for yourself he said what devils my deafness has set loose in me and let no eyes but yours see that horrid sight you will find me here tomorrow and you will decide by that time whether you make an enemy of me or not  he threw open the door and bowed as graciously as if he had been a sovereign dismissing a subject  was he mad  i hesitated to adopt that conclusion there is no denying it the deaf man had found his own strange and tortuous way to my interest in spite of myself i might even have been in some danger of allowing him to make a friend of me if i had not been restrained by the fears for cristel which his language and his manner amply justified to my mind although i was far from foreseeing the catastrophe that really did happen i felt that i had returned to my own country at a critical time in the life of the millers daughter my friendly interference might be of serious importance to cristels peace of mindperhaps even to her personal safety as well  eager to discover what the contents of the portfolio might tell me i hurried back to trimley deen my stepmother had not yet returned from the dinnerparty as one of the results of my ten years banishment from home i was obliged to ask the servant to show me the way to my own room in my own house the windows looked out on a view of fordwitch wood as i opened the leaves which were to reveal to me the secret soul of the man whom i had so strangely met the fading moonlight vanished and the distant trees were lost in the gloom of a starless night    chapter v  he betrays himself  the confession was entitled memoirs of a miserable man it began abruptly in these words   i  i acknowledge at the outset that misfortune has had an effect on me which frail humanity is for the most part anxious to conceal under the influence of suffering i have become of enormous importance to myself in this frame of mind i naturally enjoy painting my own portrait in words let me add that they must be written words because it is a painful effort to me since i lost my hearing to speak to anyone continuously for any length of time  i have also to confess that my brains are not so completely under my own command as i could wish  for instance i possess considerable skill for an amateur as a painter in water colors but i can only produce a work of art when irresistible impulse urges me to express my thoughts in form and color the same obstacle to regular exertion stands in my way if i am using my pen i can only write when the fit takes mesometimes at night when i ought to be asleep sometimes at meals when i ought to be handling my knife and fork sometimes out of doors when i meet with inquisitive strangers who stare at me as for paper the first stray morsel of anything that i can write upon will do provided i snatch it up in time to catch my ideas as they fly  my method being now explained i proceed to the deliberate act of selfbetrayal which i contemplate in producing this picture of myself   ii  i divide my life into two epochsrespectively entitled before my deafness and after my deafness or suppose i define the melancholy change in my fortunes more sharply still by contrasting with each other my days of prosperity and my days of disaster of these alternatives i hardly know which to choose it doesnt matter the one thing needful is to go on  in any case then i have to record that i passed a happy childhoodthanks to my good mother her generous nature had known adversity and had not been deteriorated by undeserved trials born of slaveparents she had not reached her eighteenth year when she was sold by auction in the southern states of america the person who bought her she never would tell me who he was freed her by a codicil added to his will on his deathbed my father met with her a few years afterwards in american societyfell as i have heard madly in love with herand married her in defiance of the wishes of his family he was quite right no better wife and mother ever lived the one vestige of good feeling that i still possess lives in my empty heart when i dwell at times on the memory of my mother  my good fortune followed me when i was sent to school  our head master was more nearly a perfect human being than any other man that i have ever met with even the worsttempered boys among us ended in loving him under his encouragement and especially to please him i won every prize that industry intelligence and good conduct could obtain and i rose at an unusually early age to be the head boy in the first class when i was old enough to be removed to the university and when the dreadful day of parting arrived i fainted under the agony of leaving the teacherno the dear friendwhom i devotedly loved there must surely have been some good in me at that time what has become of it now  the years followed each otherand i was fortunes spoilt child still  under adverse circumstances my sociable disposition my delight in the society of young people of my own age might have exposed me to serious dangers in my new sphere of action happily for me my father consulted a wise friend before he sent me to cambridge i was entered at one of the smaller colleges and i fell at starting among the right set of men good examples were all round me we formed a little club of steady students our pleasures were innocent we were too proud and too poor to get into debt i look back on my career at cambridge as i look back on my career at school and wonder what has become of my better self   iii  during my last year at cambridge my father died  the profession which he had intended that i should follow was the bar i believed myself to be quite unfit for the sort of training imperatively required by the law and my mother agreed with me when i left the university my own choice of a profession pointed to the medical art and to that particular branch of it called surgery after three years of unremitting study at one of the great london hospitals i started in practice for myself once more my persistent luck was faithful to me at the outset of my new career  the winter of that year was remarkable for alternate extremes of frost and thaw accidents to passengers in the streets were numerous and one of them happened close to my own door a gentleman slipped on the icy pavement and broke his leg on sending news of the accident to his house i found that my chancepatient was a nobleman  my lord was so well satisfied with my services that he refused to be attended by any of my elders and betters in the profession little did i think at the time that i had received the last of the favours which fortune was to bestow on me i enjoyed the confidence and goodwill of a man possessing boundless social influence and i was received most kindly by the ladies of his family in one word at the time when my professional prospects justified the brightest hopes that i could form sudden death deprived me of the dearest and truest of all friendsi suffered the one dreadful loss which it is impossible to replace the loss of my mother we had parted at night when she was to all appearance in the enjoyment of her customary health the next morning she was found dead in her bed   iv  keen observers who read these lines will remark that i have said nothing about the male members of my family and that i have even passed over my father with the briefest possible allusion to his death  this curious reticence on my part is simply attributable to pure ignorance until affliction lay heavy on me my father my uncle and my grandfather were hardly better known to me in their true characters than if they had been strangers passing in the street how i contrived to become more intimately acquainted with my ancestors i am now to reveal  in the absence of any instructions to guide me after my mothers death i was left to use my own discretion in examining the papers which she had left behind her reading her letters carefully before i decided what to keep and what to destroy i discovered a packet protected by an unbroken seal and bearing an inscription addressed abruptly to my mother in these words  for fear of accidents my dear we will mention no names in this place the sight of my handwriting will remind you of my devotion to your interests in the past and will satisfy you that i am to be trusted in the service that i now offer to my good sisterfriend in the fewest words let me tell you that i have heard of the circumstances under which your marriage has taken place your origin has unfortunately become known to the members of your husbands family their pride has been deeply wounded and the women especially regard you with feelings of malignant hatred i have good reason for fearing that they may try to excuse their inhuman way of speaking of you by making public the calamity of your slavebirth what deplorable influence might be exercised on your husbands mind by such an exposure as this i will not stop to inquire it will be more to the purpose to say that i am able to offer you a sure means of protecting yourselfthrough information which i have unexpectedly obtained and the source of which i am obliged to keep secret if you are ever threatened by your enemies open the packet which i have now sealed up and you will command the silence of the bitterest man or woman who longs to injure you i may add that absolute proof accompanies every assertion which my packet contains keep it carefully as long as you liveand god grant you may never have occasion to break the seal  such was the inscription copied exactly word for word  i cannot even guess who my mothers devoted friend may have been neither can i doubt that she would have destroyed the packet but for the circumstance of her sudden death  after hesitating a littlei hardly know whyi summoned my resolution and broke the seal of the horror with which i read the contents of the packet i shall say nothing who ever yet sympathized with the sorrows and sufferings of strangers let me merely announce that i knew my ancestors at last and that i am now able to present them in their true characters as follows   v  my grandfather was tried on a charge of committing willful murderwas found guilty on the clearest evidenceand died on the scaffold by the hangmans hands  his two sons abandoned the family name and left the family residence they were nevertheless not unworthy representatives of their atrocious father as will presently appear  my uncle a captain in the army was discovered at the hazard table playing with loaded dice before this abject scoundrel could be turned out of his regiment he was killed in a duel by one of his brother officers whom he had cheated  my father when he was little more than a lad deserted a poor girl who had trusted him under a promise of marriage friendless and hopeless she drowned herself and her child his was the most infamous in the list of the family crimesand he escaped without answering to a court of law or a court of honor for what he had done  some of us come of one breed and some of another there is the breed from which i drew the breath of life what do you think of me now   vi  i looked back over the past years of my existence from the time of my earliest recollections to the miserable day when i opened the sealed packet  what wholesome influences had preserved me so far from moral contamination by the vile blood that ran in my veins there were two answers to that question which in some degree quieted my mind in the first place resembling my good mother physically i might hope to have resembled her morally in the second place the happy accidents of my career had preserved me from temptation at more than one critical period of my life on the other hand in the ordinary course of nature not one half of that life had yet elapsed what trials might the future have in store for me and what protection against them would the better part of my nature be powerful enough to afford  while i was still troubled by these doubts the measure of my disasters was filled by an attack of illness which threatened me with death my medical advisers succeeded in saving my lifeand left me to pay the penalty of their triumph by the loss of one of my senses  at an early period of my convalescence i noticed one day with languid surprise that the voices of the doctors when they asked me how i had slept and if i felt better sounded singularly dull and distant a few hours later i observed that they stooped close over me when they had something important to say on the same evening my day nurse and my night nurse happened to be in the room together to my surprise they had become so wonderfully quiet in their movements that they opened the door or stirred the fire without making the slightest noise i intended to ask them what it meant i had even begun to put the question when i was startled by another discovery relating this time to myself i was certain that i had spokenand yet i had not heard myself speak as well as my weakness would let me i called to the nurses in my loudest tones has anything happened to my voice i asked the two women consulted together looking at me with pity in their eyes one of them took the responsibility on herself she put her lips close to my ear the horrid words struck me with a sense of physical pain your illness has left you in a sad state sir you are deaf   vii  as soon as i was able to leave my bed wellmeaning people in and out of the medical profession combined to torment me with the best intentions  one famous aural surgeon after another came to me and quoted his experience of cases in which the disease that had struck me down had affected the sense of hearing in other unhappy persons they had submitted to surgical treatment generally with cheering results i submitted in my turn all that skill could do for me was done and without effect my deafness steadily increased my case was pronounced to be hopeless the great authorities retired  judicious friends who had been waiting for their opportunity undertook the moral management of me next  i was advised to cultivate cheerfulness to go into society to encourage kind people who tried to make me hear what was going on to be on my guard against morbid depression to check myself when the sense of my own horrible isolation drove me away to my room and last but by no means least to beware of letting my vanity disincline me to use an eartrumpet  i did my best honestly did my best to profit by the suggestions that were offered to menot because i believed in the wisdom of my friends but because i dreaded the effect of selfimposed solitude on my nature since the fatal day when i had opened the sealed packet i was on my guard against the inherited evil lying dormant for all i knew to the contrary in my fathers son impelled by that horrid dread i suffered my daily martyrdom with a courage that astonishes me when i think of it now  what the selfinflicted torture of the deaf is none but the deaf can understand  when benevolent persons did their best to communicate to me what was clever or amusing while conversation was going on in my presence i was secretly angry with them for making my infirmity conspicuous and directing the general attention to me when other friends saw in my face that i was not grateful to them and gave up the attempt to help me i suspected them of talking of me contemptuously and amusing themselves by making my misfortune the subject of coarse jokes  even when i deserved encouragement by honestly trying to atone for my bad behavior i committed mistakes arising out of my helpless position which prejudiced people against me sometimes i asked questions which appeared to be so trivial to ladies and gentlemen happy in the possession of a sense of hearing that they evidently thought me imbecile as well as deaf sometimes seeing the company enjoying an interesting story or a good joke i ignorantly appealed to the most incompetent person present to tell me what had been saidwith this result that he lost the thread of the story or missed the point of the joke and blamed my unlucky interference as the cause of it  these mortifications and many more i suffered patiently until little by little my last reserves of endurance felt the cruel strain on them and failed me my friends detected a change in my manner which alarmed them they took me away from london to try the renovating purity of country air  so far as any curative influence over the state of my mind was concerned the experiment proved to be a failure  i had secretly arrived at the conclusion that my deafness was increasing and that my friends knew it and were concealing it from me determined to put my suspicions to the test i took long solitary walks in the neighborhood of my country home and tried to hear the new sounds about me i was deaf to everythingwith the one exception of the music of the birds  how long did i hear the little cheering songsters who comforted me  i am unable to measure the interval that elapsed my memory fails me i only know that the time came when i could see the skylark in the heavens but could no longer hear its joyous notes in a few weeks more the nightingale and even the loud thrush became silent birds to my doomed ears my last effort to resist my own deafness was made at my bedroom window for some time i still heard faintly and more faintly the shrill twittering just above me under the eaves of the house when this last poor enjoyment came to an endwhen i listened eagerly desperately and heard nothing think of it nothingi gave up the struggle persuasions arguments entreaties were entirely without effect on me reckless what came of it i retired to the one fit place for meto the solitude in which i have buried myself ever since   viii  with some difficulty i discovered the lonely habitation of which was in search  no language can describe the heavenly composure of mind that came to me when i first found myself alone living the deathinlife of deafness apart from creaturesno longer my fellowcreatureswho could hear apart also from those privileged victims of hysterical impulse who wrote me loveletters and offered to console the poor beautiful deaf man by marrying him through the distorting medium of such sufferings as i have described women and meneven young womenwere repellent to me alike ungratefully impatient of the admiration excited by my personal advantages savagely irritated by tender looks and flattering compliments i only consented take lodgings on condition that there should be no young women living under the same roof with me if this confession of morbid feeling looks like vanity i can only say that appearances lie i write in sober sadness determined to present my character with photographic accuracy as a true likeness  what were my habits in solitude how did i get through the weary and wakeful hours of the day  living by myself i became as i have already acknowledged important to myselfand as a necessary consequence i enjoyed registering my own daily doings let passages copied from my journal reveal how i got through the day   ix  extracts from a deaf mans diary  mondaysix weeks today since i first occupied my present retreat  my landlord and landlady are two hideous old people they look as if they disliked me on the rare occasions when we meet so much the better they dont remind me of my deafness by trying to talk and they keep as much as possible out of my way this morning after breakfast i altered the arrangement of my booksand then i made my fourth attempt in the last ten days to read some of my favorite authors no my taste has apparently changed since the time when i could hear i closed one volume after another caring nothing for what used to be deeply interesting to me  reckless and savagewith a burning head and a cold hearti went out to look about me  after two hours of walking and thinking i found that i had wandered to our county town the rain began to fall heavily just as i happened to be passing a booksellers shop after some hesitationfor i hate exposing my deafness to strangersi asked leave to take shelter and looked at the books  among them was a collection of celebrated trials i thought of my grandfather consulted the index and finding his name there bought the work the shopman as i could guess from his actions and looks proposed sending the parcel to me i insisted on taking it away the sky had cleared and i was eager to read the details of my grandfathers crime   tuesdaysat up late last night reading my new book my favorite poets novelists and historians have failed to interest me i devoured the trials with breathless delight beginning of course with the murder in which i felt a family interest prepared to find my grandfather a ruffian i confess i was surprised by the discovery that he was also a fool the officers of justice had no merit in tracing the crime to him his own stupidity delivered him into their hands i read the evidence twice over and put myself in his position and saw the means plainly by which he might have set discovery at defiance  in the preface to the trials i found an allusion in terms of praise to a work of the same kind published in the french language i wrote to london at once and ordered the book   wednesdayis there some mysterious influence in the silent solitude of my life that is hardening my nature is there something unnatural in the existence of a man who never hears a sound is there a moral sense that suffers when a bodily sense is lost  these questions have been suggested to me by an incident that happened this morning  looking out of window i saw a brutal carter on the road before the house beating an overloaded horse a year since i should have interfered to protect the horse without a moments hesitation if the wretch had been insolent i should have seized his whip and applied the heavy handle of it to his own shoulders in past days i have been more than once fined by a magistrate privately in sympathy with my offence for assaults committed by me in the interests of helpless animals what did i feel now nothing but a selfish sense of uneasiness at having been accidentally witness of an act which disturbed my composure i turned away regretting that i had gone to the window and looked out  this was not an agreeable train of thought to follow what could i do i was answered by the impulse which commands me to paint  i sharpened my pencils and opened my box of colors and determined to produce a work of art to my astonishment the brutal figure of the carter forced its way into my memory again and again it without in the least knowing why as if the one chance of getting rid of this curious incubus was to put the persistent image of the man on paper it was done mechanically and yet done so well that i was encouraged to add to the picture i put in next the poor beaten horse another good likeness and then i introduced a lifelike portrait of myself giving the man the sound thrashing that he had deserved strange to say this representation of what i ought to have done relieved my mind as if i had actually done it i looked at the preeminent figure of myself and felt good and turned to my trials and read them over again and liked them better than ever   thursdaythe bookseller has found a secondhand copy of the french trials and has sent them to me as he expresses it on approval  i more than approvei admire and i more than admirei imitate these criminal stories are told with a dramatic power which has impelled me to try if i can rival the clever french narrative i found a promising subject by putting myself in my grandfathers place and tracing the means by which it had occurred to me that he might have escaped the discovery of his crime  i cannot remember having read any novel with a tenth part of the interest that absorbed me in constructing my imaginary train of circumstances so completely did the reality of the narrative impress itself on my mind that i felt as if the murder that i was relating had been a crime committed by myself it was my own ingenuity that hid the dead body and removed the traces of bloodand my own selfcontrol that presented me as an innocent person when the victim was missing and i was asked among other respectable people to say whether i thought he was living or dead   a whole week has passedand has been occupied by my new literary pursuit  my inexhaustible imagination invents plots and conspiracies of which i am the happy hero i set traps which invariably catch my enemies i place myself in positions which are entirely new to me yesterday for instance i invented a method of spiriting away a young person whose disappearance was of considerable importance under the circumstances and succeeded in completely bewildering her father her friends and the police not a trace of her could they find if i ever have occasion to do in reality what i only suppose myself to do in these exercises of ingenuity what a dangerous man i may yet prove to be  this morning i rose planning to amuse myself with a new narrative when the ideal world in which i am now living became a world annihilated by collision with the sordid interests of real life  in plainer words i received a written message from my landlord which has annoyed meand not without good cause this tiresome person finds himself unexpectedly obliged to give up possession of his house the circumstances are not worth relating the result is importanti am compelled to find new lodgings where am i to go  i left it to chance that is to say i looked at the railway timetable and took a ticket for the first place of which the name happened to catch my eye arrived at my destination i found myself in a dirty manufacturing town with an ugly river running through it  after a little reflection i turned my back on the town and followed the course of the river in search of shelter and solitude on one or the other of its banks an hour of walking brought me to an oddlooking cottage half old and half new attached to a watermill a bill in one of the windows announced that rooms were to be let and a look round revealed a thick wood on my left hand and a wilderness of sand and heath on my right so far as appearances went here was the very place for me  i knocked at the door and was admitted by a little lean slylooking old man he showed me the roomsone for myself and one for my servant wretched as they were the loneliness of the situation recommended them to me i made no objections and i consented to pay the rent that was asked the one thing that remained to be done in the interests of my tranquillity was to ascertain if any other persons lived the cottage besides my new landlord he wrote his answer to the question nobody but my daughter with serious misgivings i inquired if his daughter was young he wrote two fatal figures 18  here was a discovery which disarranged all my plans just as i had formed them the prospect of having a girl in the house at the age associated with my late disagreeable experience of the sensitive sex was more than my irritable temper could endure i saw the old man going to the window to take down the bill turning in a rage to stop him i was suddenly brought to a standstill by the appearance of a person who had just entered the room  was this the formidable obstacle to my tranquillity which had prevented me from taking the rooms that i had chosen yes i knew the millers daughter intuitively delirium possessed me my eyes devoured her my heart beat as if it would burst out of my bosom the old man approached me he nodded and grinned and pointed to her did he claim his parental interest in her did he mean that she belonged to him no she belonged to me she might be his daughter she was my fate  i dont know what it was in the girl that took me by storm nothing in her look or her manner expressed the slightest interest in me that famous beauty of mine which had worked such ravages in the hearts of other young women seemed not even to attract her notice when her father put his hand to his ear and told her as i guessed that i was deaf there was no pity in her splendid brown eyes they expressed a momentary curiosity and nothing more possibly she had a hard heart or perhaps she took a dislike to me at first sight it made no difference to my mind either way was she the most beautiful creature i had ever seen not even that excuse was to be made for me i have met with women of her dark complexion who were beyond dispute her superiors in beauty and have looked at them with indifference add to this that i am one of the men whom women offend if they are not perfectly welldressed the millers daughter was badly dressed her magnificent figure was profaned by the wretchedlymade gown that she wore i forgave the profanation in spite of the protest of my own better taste i resigned myself to her gown is it possible adequately to describe such infatuation as this quite possible i have only to acknowledge that i took the rooms at the cottageand there is the state of my mind exposed without mercy  how will it end    chapter vi  the return of the portfolio  with that serious question the last of the leaves entrusted to me by the lodger at the mill came to an end  i betray no confidence in presenting this copy of his confession time has passed since i first read it and changes have occurred in the interval which leave me free to exercise my own discretion and to let the autobiography speak for itself  if i am asked what impression of the writer those extraordinary pages produced on me i feel at a loss how to reply  not one impression but many impressions troubled and confused my mind certain passages in the confession inclined me to believe that the writer was mad but i altered my opinion at the next leaf and set him down as a man with a bitter humor disposed to make merry over his own bad qualities at one time his tone in writing of his early life and his allusions to his mother won my sympathy and respect at another time the picture of himself in his later years and the defiant manner in which he presented it almost made me regret that he had not died of the illness which had struck him deaf in this state of uncertainty i may claim the merit of having arrived so far as my own future conduct was concerned at one positive conclusion as strangers he and i had first met as strangers i was determined we should remain  having made up my mind so far the next thing to do with the clock on the mantelpiece striking midnight was to go to bed  i slept badly the events that had happened since my arrival in england had excited me i suppose now and then in the wakeful hours of the night i thought of cristel with some anxiety taking the logers exaggerated language for what it was really worth the poor girl as i was still inclined to fear might have serious reason to regret that he had ever entered her fathers cottage  at the breakfast table my stepmother and i met again  mrs roylakein an exquisite morning dress with her smile in perfect orderinformed me that she was dying with curiosity she had heard from the servants that i had not returned to the house until past ten oclock on the previous night and she was absolutely bewildered by the discovery what could her dear gerard have been doing out in the dark by himself for all that time  for some part of the time i answered i was catching moths in fordwitch wood  what an extraordinary occupation for a young man well and what did you do after that  i walked on through the wood and renewed my old associations with the river and the mill  mrs roylakes fascinating smile disappeared when i mentioned the mill she suddenly became a cold ladyi might even say a stiff lady  i cant congratulate you on the first visit you have paid in our neighborhood she said of course that bold girl contrived to attract your notice  i replied that i had met with the bold girl purely by accident on her side as well as on mine and then i started a new topic was it a pleasant dinnerparty last night i askedas if the subject really interested me i had not been quite four and twenty hours in england yet and i was becoming a humbug already  my stepmother was her charming self again the moment my question had passed my lips societyprovided it was not society at the millwas always attractive as a topic of conversation your absence was the only drawback she answered i have asked the two ladies my lord has an engagement to dine here today without ceremony they are most anxious to meet you my dear gerard you look surprised surely you know who the ladies are  i was obliged to acknowledge my ignorance  mrs roylake was shocked at any rate she resumed you have heard of their father lord uppercliff  i made another shameful confession either i had forgotten lord uppercliff during my long absence abroad or i had never heard of him  mrs roylake was disgusted and this is a foreign education she exclaimed thank heaven you have returned to your own country we will drive out after luncheon and pay a round of visits when this prospect was placed before me i remembered having read in books of sensitive persons receiving impressions which made their blood run cold i now found myself one of those persons for the first time in my life in the meanwhile mrs roylake continued i must tell youexcuse me for laughing it seems so very absurd that you should not know who lord uppercliffs daughters arei must tell you that lady rachel is the eldest she is married to the honorable captain millbay of the navy now away in his ship a person of extraordinary strength of mind i dont mean the captain i mean lady rachel i admire her intellect but her political and social opinions i must always view with regret her younger sister lady lenanot married gerard remember thatis simply the most charming girl in england if you dont fall in love with her you will be the only young man in the county who has resisted lady lena poor sir georgeshe refused him last week you really must have heard of sir george our member of parliament conservative of course quite brokenhearted about lady lena gone away to america to shoot bears you seem to be restless what are you fidgeting about ah i know you want to smoke after breakfast well i wont be in your way go out on the terrace your poor father always took his cigar on the terrace they say smoking leads to meditation i leave you to meditate on lady lena dont forgetluncheon at one oclock and the carriage at two  she smiled and kissed her hand and fluttered out of the room charming perfectly charming and yet i was ungrateful enough to wish myself back in germany again  i lit my cigar but not on the terrace leaving the house i took the way once more that led to fordwitch wood what would mrs roylake have said if she had discovered that i was going back to the mill there was no other alternative the portfolio was a trust confided to me the sooner i returned it to the writer of the confessionthe sooner i told him plainly the conclusion at which i had arrivedthe more at ease my mind would be  the sluggish river looked muddier than ever the new cottage looked uglier than ever exposed to the searching ordeal of sunlight i knocked at the door on the ancient side of the building  cristels fathershall i confess i had hoped that it might be cristel herselflet me in in bygone days i dimly remembered him as old and small and withered advancing years had wasted him away in the interval until his white millers clothes hung about him in empty folds his fleshless face would have looked like the face of a mummy but for the restless brightness of his little watchful black eyes he stared at me in momentary perplexity and suddenly recovering himself asked me to walk in  are you the young master sir ah yes yes i thought so my girl cristy said she saw the young master last night thank you kindly sir im pretty well considering how ive fallen away in my flesh i have got a fine appetite but somehow or other my meals dont show on me you will excuse my receiving you in the kitchen sir its the best room we have did cristy tell you how badly we are off here for repairs you being our landlord we look to you to help us we are falling to pieces as it were on this old side of the house theres first drains  he proceeded to reckon up the repairs counting with his fleshless thumb on his skinny fingers when he was interrupted by a curious succession of sounds which began with whining and ended with scratching at the cottage door  in a minute after the door was opened from without a brown dog of the companionable retriever breed ran in and fawned upon old toller cristel followed from the kitchen garden with a basket of vegetables on her arm unlike the river and the cottage she gained by being revealed in the brilliant sunlight i now saw in their full beauty the luster of her brown eyes the warm rosiness of her dark complexion the delightful vivacity of expression which was the crowning charm of her face she paused confusedly in the doorway and tried to resist me when i insisted on relieving her of the basket  mr gerard she protested you are treating me as if i was a young lady what would they say at the great house if they knew you had done that  my answer would no doubt have assumed the form of a foolish compliment if her father had not spared her that infliction he returned to the allimportant question the question of repairs  you see sir its no use speaking to the bailiff saving your presence hes a miser with his masters money he says all right and he does nothing theres first as i told you just now the truly dreadful state of the drains  i tried to stop him by promising to speak to the bailiff myself on hearing this good news mr tollers gratitude became ungovernable he was more eager than ever and more eloquent than ever in returning to the repairs  and then sir theres the oven they do call bread the staff of life its a burnt staff at one time and a clammy staff at another in our domestic experience satisfy yourself sir do please cross the kitchen and look with your own eyes at the state the scandalous state of the oven  his daughter interfered and stopped him at the critical moment when he was actually offering his arm to conduct me in state across the kitchen cristel had just put her pretty brown hand over his mouth and said oh father do pray be quiet when we were all three disturbed by another interruption  a second door communicating as i concluded from its position with the new cottage was suddenly opened in the instant before the person behind it appeared the dog looked that waystarted up frightenedand took refuge under the table at the next moment the deaf lodger walked into the room it was he beyond all doubt who had frightened the dog forewarned by instinct of his appearance  what i had read of his writing disposed me now that i saw the man by daylight to find something devilish in the expression of his face no strong as it was my prejudice failed to make any discoveries that presented him at a disadvantage his personal attractions triumphed in the clear searching light i now perceived that his eyes were of that deeply dark blue which is commonly and falsely described as resembling the color of the violet to my thinking they were so entirely beautiful that they had no right to be in a mans face i might have felt the same objection to the pale delicacy of his complexion to the soft profusion of his reddishbrown hair to his finely shaped sensitive lips but for two marked peculiarities in him which would have shown me to be wrongthat is to say the expression of power about his head and the signs of masculine resolution presented by his mouth and chin  on entering the room the first person and the only person who attracted his attention was cristel  he bowed smiled possessed himself abruptly of her hand and kissed it she tried to withdraw it from his grasp and met with an obstinate resistance his gallantry addressed her in sweet words and his voice destroyed their charm by the dreary monotony of the tone in which he spoke on this lovely day cristel nature pleads for me your heart feels the sunshine and softens towards the poor deaf man who worships you ah my dear its useless to say no my affliction is my happiness when you say cruel things to me i live in my fools paradise i dont hear you he tried to draw her nearer to him come my angel let me kiss you  she made a second attempt to release herself and this time she wrenched her hand out of his grasp with a strength for which he was not prepared  that fiercest anger which turns the face pale was the anger that had possession of cristel as she took refuge with her father you asked me to bear with that man she said because he paid you a good rent i tell you this father my patience is coming to an end either he must go or i must go make up your mind to choose between your money and me  old toller astonished me he seemed to have caught the infection of his daughters anger placed between cristel and his money he really acted as if he preferred cristel he hobbled up to his lodger and shook his infirm fists and screamed at the highest pitch of his old cracked voice let her be or i wont have you here no longer you deaf adder let her be  the sensitive nerves of the deaf man shrank as those shrill tones pierced them if you want to speak to me write it he said with rage and suffering in every line of his face he tore from his pocket his little book filled with blank leaves and threw it at tollers head write he repeated if you murder me with your screeching again look out for your skinny throatill throttle you  cristel picked up the book she was gratefully sensible of her fathers interference he shall know what you said to him she promised the old man ill write it myself  she took the pencil from its sheath in the leather binding of the book controlling himself the lover whom she hated advanced towards her with a persuasive smile  have you forgiven me he asked have you been speaking kindly of me i think i see it in your face there are some deaf people who can tell what is said by looking at the speakers lips i am too stupid or too impatient or too wicked to be able to do that write it for me dear and make me happy for the day  cristel was not attending to him she was speaking to me i hope sir you dont think that father and i are to blame for what has happened this morning she said he looked where she was lookingand discovered for the first time that i was in the room  he had alluded to his wickedness a moment since when his face turned my way i thought it bore witness to his knowledge of his own character  why didnt you come to my side of the house he said to me what am i to understand sir by seeing you here  cristel dropped his book on the table and hurried to me in breathless surprise he speaks as if he knew you she cried what does it mean  only that i met him last night i explained after leaving you  did you know him before that  no he was a perfect stranger to me  he picked up his book from the table and took his pencil out of cristels hand while we were speaking i want my answer he said handing me the book and the pencil i gave him his answer  you find me here because i dont wish to return to your side of the house  is that the impression he asked produced by what i allowed you to read  i replied by a sign in the affirmative he inquired next if i had brought his portfolio with me i put it at once into his hand  in some way unknown to me i had apparently roused his suspicions he opened the portfolio and counted the loose leaves of writing in it carefully while he was absorbed in this occupation old tollers eccentricity assumed a new form his little restless black eyes followed the movements of his lodgers fingers as they turned over leaf after leaf of the manuscript with such eager curiosity and interest that i looked at him in surprise finding that he had attracted my notice he showed no signs of embarrassmenthe seized the opportunity of asking for information  did my gentleman trust you sir with all that writing he began  yes  did he want you to read it  he did  whats it all about sir  confronted by this cool inquiry i informed mr toller that the demands of curiosity had their limits and that he had reached them on this ground i declined to answer any more questions mr toller went on with his questions immediately  do you notice sir that he seems to set a deal of store by his writings perhaps you can say what the value of them may be  i shook my head it wont do mr toller  he tried againi declare it positively he tried again youll excuse me sir ive never seen his portfolio before am i right if i think you know where he keeps it  spare your breath mr toller once more it wont do  cristel joined us amazed at his pertinacity why are you so anxious father to know about that portfolio she asked  her father seemed to have reasons of his own for following my example and declining to answer questions more polite however than i had been he left his resolution to be inferred his daughter was answered by a few general remarks setting forth the advantage to the landlord of having a lodger who had lost one of senses  you see theres something convenient my dear in the circumstance of that nicelooking gentleman over there being deaf we can talk about him before his face just as comfortably as if it was behind his back isnt that so mr gerard dont you see it yourself cristy for instance i say it without fear in his presence tis the act of a fool to be fumbling over writings when theres nothing in them thats not well known to himself alreadyunless indeed they are worth money which i dont doubt is no secret to you mr gerard eh i beg your pardon sir did you speak no i beg your pardon again yes yes cristy im noticing him hes done with his writings suppose i offer to put them away for him you can see in his face he finds the tale of them correct hes coming this way whats he going to do next  he was going to establish a claim on my gratitude by relieving me of giles toller  i have something to say to mr roylake he announced with a haughty look at his landlord mind i dont forget your screaming at me just now and i intend to know what you meant by it that will do get out of the way  the old fellow received his dismissal with a low bow and left the kitchen with a look at the lodger which revealed unless i was entirely mistaken a sly sense of triumph what did it mean  the deaf man addressed me with a cold and distant manner we must understand each other he said will you follow me to my side of the cottage i shook my head very well he resumed we will have it out here when i trusted you with my confession last night i left you to decide after reading it whether you would make an enemy of me or not you remember that i nodded my head then i now ask you mr roylake which are weenemies or friends  i took the pencil and wrote my reply  neither enemies nor friends we are strangers from this time forth  some internal struggle produced a change in his facevisible for one moment hidden from me in a moment more i think you will regret the decision at which you have arrived he said that and saluted me with his grandly gracious bow as he turned away he perceived cristel at the other end of the room and eagerly joined her  the only happy moments i have are my moments passed in your presence he said i shall trouble you no more for today give me a little comfort to take back with me to my solitude i didnt notice that there were other persons present when i asked leave to kiss you may i hope that you forgive me  he held out his hand it was not taken he waited a little in the vain hope that she would relent she turned away from him  a spasm of pain distorted his handsome face he opened the door that led to his side of the cottagepausedand looked back at cristel she took no notice of him as he moved again to the door and left us the hysterical passion in him forced its way outwardhe burst into tears  the dog sprang up from his refuge under the table and shook himself joyfully cristel breathed again freely and joined me at my end of the room shall i make another acknowledgment of weakness i began to fear that we might all of us even including the dog have been a little hard on the poor deaf wretch who had gone away in such bitter distress i communicated this view of the matter to cristel she failed to see it as i did  the dog laid his head on her lap asking to be caressed she patted him while she answered me  i agree with this old friend mr gerard we were both of us frightened on the very first day when the person you are pitying came to lodge with us i have got to hate him since that timeperhaps to despise him but the dog has never changed he feels and knows there is something dreadful in that man one of these days poor ponto may turn out to be rightmay i ask you something sir  of course  you wont think i am presuming on your kindness  you ought to know me better than that cristel  the truth is sir i have been a little startled by what i saw in our lodgers face when he asked if you were his enemy or his friend i know he is thought to be handsomebut mr gerard those beautiful eyes of his sometimes tell tales and i have seen his pretty complexion change to a color that turned him into an ugly man will you tell me what you wrote when you answered him  i repeated what i had written word for word it failed to satisfy her  he is very vain she said and you may have wounded his vanity by treating him like a stranger after he had given you his writings to read and invited you to his room but i thought i saw something much worse than mortification in his face shall i be taking a liberty if i ask how it was you got acquainted with him last night  she was evidently in earnest i saw that i must answer her without reserve and i was a little afraid of being myself open to a suspicion of vanity if i mentioned the distrust which i had innocently excited in the mind of my new acquaintance in this state of embarrassment i took a young mans way out of the difficulty and spoke lightly of a serious thing  i became acquainted with your deaf lodger cristel under ridiculous circumstances he saw us talking last night and did me the honor to be jealous of me  i had expected to see her blush to my surprise she turned pale and vehemently remonstrated  dont laugh sir theres nothing to be amused at in what you have just told me you didnt go into his room last night oh what made you do that  i described his successful appeal to my compassionnot very willingly for it made me look as i thought like a weak person little by little she extracted from me the rest how he objected to find a young man especially in my social position talking to cristel how he insisted on my respecting his claims and engaging not to see her again how when i refused to do this he gave me his confession to read so that i might find out what a formidable man i was setting at defiance how i had not been in the least alarmed and had treated him as cristel had just heard on the footing of a perfect stranger  theres the whole story i concluded like a scene in a play isnt it  she protested once more against the light tone that i persisted in assuming  i tell you again sir this is no laughing matter you have roused his jealousy you had better have roused the fury of a wild beast knowing what you know of him why did you stay here when he came in and oh why did i humiliate him in your presence leave us mr gerardpray pray leave us and dont come near this place again till father has got rid of him  did she think i was to be so easily frightened as that my sense of my own importance was up in arms at the bare suspicion of it  my dear child i said grandly do you really suppose i am afraid of that poor wretch am i to give up the pleasure of seeing you because a mad fellow is simple enough to think you will marry him absurd cristelabsurd  the poor girl wrung her hands in despair  oh sir dont distress me by talking in that way do please remember who you are and who i am if i was the miserable means of your coming to any harmi cant bear even to speak of it pray dont think me bold i dont know how to express myself you ought never to have come here you ought to go you must go  driven by strong impulse she ran to the place in which i had left my hat and brought it to me and opened the door with a look of entreaty which it was impossible to resist it would have been an act of downright cruelty to persist in opposing her i wouldnt distress you cristel for the whole world i saidand left her to conclude that i had felt the influence of her entreaties in the right way she tried to thank me the tears rose in her eyesshe signed to me to leave her poor soul as if she felt ashamed of herself i was shocked i was grieved i was more than ever secretly resolved to go back to her when we said goodbyei have been told that i did wrong i meant no harmi kissed her  having traversed the short distance between the cottage and the wood i remembered that i had left my walkingstick behind me and returned to get it  cristel was leaving the kitchen i saw her at the door which communicated with the lodgers side of the cottage her back was turned towards me astonishment held me silent she opened the door passed through it and closed it behind her  going to that man after she had repelled his advances in my presence going to the enemy against whom she had warned me after i had first been persuaded to leave her angry thoughts theseand surely thoughts unworthy of me if it had been the case of another man i should have said he was jealous jealous of the millers daughterin my position absurd contemptible but i was still in such a vile temper that i determined to let cristel know she had been discovered taking one of my visiting cards i wrote on it i came back for my stick and saw you go to him after i had pinned this spiteful little message to the door so that she might see it when she returned i suffered a disappointment i was not half so well satisfied with myself as i had anticipated    chapter vii  the best society  leaving the cottage for the second time i was met at the door by a fat man of solemn appearance dressed in black who respectfully touched his hat my angry humor acknowledged the harmless strangers salute by a rude inquiry what the devil do you want instead of resenting this uncivil language he indirectly reproved me by becoming more respectful than ever  my mistress desires me to tell you sir that luncheon is waiting i was in the presence of a thoroughbred english servantand i had failed to discover it until he spoke of his mistress i had also by keeping luncheon waiting treated an english institution with contempt and worse even than this as a misfortune which personally affected me my stepmother evidently knew that i had paid another visit to the mill  i hurried along the woodland path followed by the fat domestic in black not used apparently to force his legs into rapid motion he articulated with the greatest difficulty in answering my next question how did you know where to find me  mrs roylake ordered inquiries to be made sir the head gardener there his small reserves of breath failed him  the head gardener saw me  yes sir  when  hours ago sirwhen you went into tollers cottage  i troubled my fat friend with no more questions  returning to the house and making polite apologies i discovered one more among mrs roylakes many accomplishments she possessed two smilesa sugary smile with which i was already acquainted and an acid smile which she apparently reserved for special occasions it made its appearance when i led her to the luncheon table  dont let me detain you my stepmother began  wont you give me some luncheon i inquired  dear me havnt you lunched already  where should i lunch my dear lady i thought this would induce the sugary smile to show itself i was wrong  where mrs roylake repeated with your friends at the mill of course very inhospitable not to offer you lunch when are we to have flour cheaper  i began to get sulky all i said was i dont know  curious mrs roylake observed you not only dont get luncheon among your friends you dont even get information to know a miller and not to know the price of flour is ignorance presented in one of its most pitiable aspects and how is miss toller looking perfectly charming  i was angry by this time you have exactly described her i said mrs roylake began to get angry on her side  surely a little coarse and vulgar she suggested reverting to poor cristel  would you like to judge for yourself i asked i shall be happy mrs roylake to take you to the mill  my stepmothers knowledge of the world implied considerable acquaintancehow obtained i do not pretend to knowwith the characters of men discovering that she was in danger of overstepping the limits of my patience she drew back with a skill which performed the retrograde movement without permitting it to betray itself  we have carried our little joke my dear gerard far enough she said  i fancy your residence in germany has rather blunted your native english sense of humor you dont suppose i hope and trust that i am so insensible to our relative positions as to think of interfering in your choice of friends or associates if you are not aware of it already let me remind you that this house is now yours not mine i live heregladly live here my dear boyby your indulgence fortified i am sure by your regard for your excellent fathers wishes as expressed in his will  i stopped her there she had got the better of me with a dexterity which i see now but which i was not clever enough to appreciate at time in a burst of generosity i entreated her to consider trimley deen as her house and never to mention such a shocking subject as my authority again  after this need i say that the most amiable of women took me out in her carriage and introduced me to some of the best society in england  if i could only remember all the new friends to whom i made my bow as well as the conversation in which we indulged i might write a few pages here interesting in a high degree to persons with wellbalanced minds unhappily so far as my own impressions were concerned the best society proved to be always the same society every house that we entered was in the same beautiful order every mistress of the house was dressed in the best taste every master of the house had the same sensible remarks to make on conservative prospects at the coming election every young gentleman wanted to know how my game preserves had been looked after in my absence every young lady said how nice it must have been mr roylake to find yourself again at trimley deen has anybody ever suffered as i suffered during that round of visits under the desire to yawn and the effort to suppress it is there any sympathetic soul who can understand me when i say that i would have given a hundred pounds for a gag and for the privilege of using it to stop my stepmothers pleasant chat in the carriage following on our friends pleasant chat in the drawingroom finally when we got home and when mrs roylake kindly promised me another round of visits and more charming people in the neighborhood to see will any good christian forgive me if i own that i took advantage of being alone to damn the neighborhood and to feel relieved by it  now that i was no longer obliged to listen to polite strangers my thoughts reverted to cristel and to the suspicions that she had roused in me  recovering its influence in the interval that had passed my better nature sharply reproached me i had presumed to blame cristel with nothing to justify me but my own perverted view of her motives how did i know that she had not opened that door and gone to that side of the cottage with a perfectly harmless object in view i was really anxious if i could find the right way to do it to make amends for an act of injustice of which i felt ashamed if i am asked why i was as eager to set myself right with a millers daughter as if she had been a young lady in the higher ranks of life i can only reply that no such view of our relative positions as this ever occurred to me a strange state of mind no doubt what was the right explanation of it  the right explanation presented itself at a later time when troubles had quickened my intellect and when i could estimate the powerful influence of circumstances at its true value  i had returned to england to fill a prominent place in my own little world without relations whom i loved without friends whose society i could enjoy hopeful ardent eager for the enjoyment of life i had brought with me to my own country the social habits and the free range of thought of a foreign university and as a matter of course i failed to feel any sympathy with the societynew to mein which my lot had been cast beset by these disadvantages i had met with a girl possessed of remarkable personal attractions and associated with my earliest remembrances of my own happy life and of my mothers kindnessa girl at once simple and spirited unspoilt by the world and the worlds ways and placed in a position of peril due to the power of her own beauty which added to the interest that she naturally inspired estimating these circumstances at their true value did a state of mind which rendered me insensible to the distinctions that separate the classes in england stand in any need of explanation as i thoughtand think stillit explained itself   my stepmother and i parted on the garden terrace which ran along the pleasant southern side of the house  the habits that i had contracted among my student friends in germany made tobacco and beer necessary accompaniments to the process of thinking i had nearly exhausted my cigar my jug and my thoughts when i saw two men approaching me from the end of the terrace  as they came nearer i recognized in one of the men my fat domestic in black he stopped the person who was accompanying him and came on to me by himself  will you see that man sir waiting behind me  who is he  i dont know sir he says he has got a letter to give you and he must put it in your own hands i think myself hes a beggar hes excessively insolenthe insists on seeing you shall i tell him to go  the servant evidently expected me to say yes he was disappointed my curiosity was roused i said i would see the insolent stranger  as he approached me the man certainly did not look like a beggar poor he might be judging by his dress the upper part of him was clothed in an old shooting jacket of velveteen his legs presented a pair of trousers once black now turning brown with age both garments were too long for him and both were kept scrupulously clean he was a short man thickly and strongly made impenetrable composure appeared on his ugly face his eyes were sunk deep in his head his nose had evidently been broken and not successfully mended his grey hair when he took off his hat on addressing me was cut short and showed his low forehead and his bull neck an englishman of the last generation would as i have since been informed have set him down as a retired prizefighter thanks to my ignorance of the pugilistic glories of my native country i was totally at a loss what to make of him  have i the honor of speaking to mr roylake he asked his quiet steady manner prepossessed me in his favour it showed no servile reverence for the accident of birth on the one hand and no insolent assertion of independence on the other when i had told him that my name was roylake he searched one of the large pockets of his shooting jacket produced a letter and silently offered it to me  before i took the letterseeing that he was a stranger and that he mentioned no name known to mei thought it desirable to make some inquiry  is it a letter of your own writing i asked  no sir  who sends you with it  he was apparently a man of few words my master was the guarded answer that this odd servant returned  i became as inquisitive as old toller himself  who is your master i went on  the reply staggered me speaking as quietly and respectfully as ever he said i cant tell you sir  do you mean that you are forbidden to tell me  no sir  then what do you mean  i mean that i dont know my masters name  i instantly took the letter from him and looked at the address for once in a way i had jumped at a conclusion and i had proved to be right the handwriting on the letter and the handwriting of the confession which i had read overnight were one and the same  are you to wait for an answer i asked as i opened the envelope  i am to wait sir if you tell me to do so  the letter was a long one after running my eye over the first sentences i surprised myself by acting discreetly you neednt wait i said i will send a reply the man of few words raised his shabby hat turned about in silence and left me    chapter viii  the deaf lodger  the letter was superscribed private and confidential it was written in these words   siryou will do me grievous wrong if you suppose that i am trying to force myself on your acquaintance my object in writing is to prevent you if i can from misinterpreting my language and my conduct on the only two occasions when we happen to have met  i am conscious that you must have thought me rude and ungratefulperhaps even a little madwhen i returned your kindness last night in honoring me with a visit by using language which has justified you in treating me as a stranger  fortunately for myself i gave you my autobiography to read after what you now know of me i may hope that your sense of justice will make some allowance for a man tried i had almost written cursed by such suffering as mine  there are other deaf persons as i have heard who set me a good example  they feel the consolations of religion their sweet tempers find relief even under the loss of the most precious of all the senses they mix with society submitting to their dreadful isolation and preserving unimpaired sympathy with their happier fellowcreatures who can hear i am not one of those persons with sorrow i say iti never have submitted i never can submit to my hard fate  let me not omit to ask your indulgence for my behavior when we met at the cottage this morning  what unfavorable impression i may have produced on you i dare not inquire so little capable am i of concealing the vile feelings which sometimes get the better of me that miss cristel observe that i mention her with respect appears to have felt positive alarm on your account when she looked at me  i may tell you in confidence that this charming person came to my side of the cottage as soon as you had taken your departure to intercede with me in your favour if your wicked mind is planning to do evil to mr roylake she wrote in my book either you will promise me to give it up or i will never allow you to see me again i will even leave home secretly to be out of your way in that strong language she expressedhow shall i refer to itshall i say the sisterly interest that she felt in your welfare   i laid down the letter for a moment if i had not already reproached myself for having misjudged cristeland if i had not in that way done her some little justice in my own better thoughtsi should never have recovered my selfrespect after reading the deaf mans letter the good girl the dear good girl yes that was how i thought of her under the windows of my stepmothers boudoirwhile mrs roylake for all i knew to the contrary might be looking down at me and when lady lena the noble and beautiful was coming to dinner  the letter concluded as follows   to return to myself i gave miss cristel the promise on which she had insisted and then naturally enough i inquired into her motive for interfering in your favour  she frankly admitted that she was interested in you first in grateful remembrance of old times when you and your mother had been always good to her secondly because she had found you as kind and as friendly as ever now that you were a man and had become the greatest landowner in the county there was the explanation i had asked for at my service and on that she left me  did i believe her when i was meditating on our interview alone in my room or did i suspect you of having robbed me of the only consolation that makes my life endurable  no such unworthy suspicion as this was admitted to my mind with all my heart i believe her and with perfect sincerity i trust you  if your knowledge of me has failed to convince you that there is any such thing as a better side to my nature you will no doubt conclude that this letter is a trick of mine to throw you off your guard and you will continue to distrust me as obstinately as ever in that case i will merely remind you that my letter is private and confidential and i will not ask you to send me a reply  i remain sir yours as you may receive me   the deaf lodger   i wonder what another man in my position would have done when he had read this letter would he have seen in it nothing to justify some respect and some kindly feeling towards the writer could he have reconciled it to his conscience to leave the afflicted man who had trusted him without a word of reply  for my part do not forget what a young man i was in those days i made up my mind to reply in the friendliest mannerthat is to say in person  after consulting my watch i satisfied myself that i could go to the mill and get back again before the hour fixed for our late dinnersupper we should have called it in germany for the second time that day and without any hesitation i took the road that led to fordwitch wood  crossing the glade i encountered a stout young woman filling a can with water from the spring she curtseyed on seeing me i asked if she belonged to the village  the reply informed me that i had taken another of my servants for a stranger the stout nymph of the spring was my kitchenmaid and she was fetching the water which we drank at the house and theres no water sir like yours for all the country round furnished with these stores of information i went my way and the kitchenmaid went hers she spoke of course of having seen her new master on returning to the servants hall in this manner as i afterwards heard the discovery of me at the spring and my departure by the path that led to the mill reached mrs roylakes earsthe medium of information being the ladys own maid so far fordwitch wood seemed to be a place to avoid in the interests of my domestic tranquillity  arriving at the cottage i found the lodger standing by the open window at which i had first seen him  but on this occasion his personal appearance had undergone a singular process of transformation the lower part of his face from his nostrils to his chin was hidden by a white handkerchief tied round it he had removed the stopper from a strangely shaped bottle and was absorbed in watching some interesting condition in a dusky liquid that it contained to attract his attention by speaking was of course out of the question i could only wait until he happened to look my way  my patience was not severely tried he soon replaced the stopper in the bottle and looking up from it saw me with his free hand he quickly removed the handkerchief and spoke  let me ask you to wait in the boathouse he said i will come to you directly he pointed round the corner of the new cottage indicating of course the side of it that was farthest from the old building  following his directions i first passed the door that he used in leaving or returning to his room and then gained the bank of the river on my right hand rose the mill building with its big waterwheeland above it a little higher up the stream i recognized the boathouse built out in the water on piles and approached by a wooden pier  no structure of this elaborate and expensive sort would have been set up by my father for the millers convenience the boathouse had been built many years since by a rich retired tradesman with a mania for aquatic pursuits our ugly river had not answered his expectations and our neighborhood had abstained from returning his visits when he left us with his wherries and canoes and outriggers the miller took possession of the abandoned boathouse its the sort of fixture that dont pay nohow old toller remarked suppose you remove ittheres a waste of money suppose you knock it to piecesis it worth a rich gentlemans while to sell a cartload of firewood neither of these alternatives having been adopted and nobody wanting an empty boathouse the clumsy mill boat hitherto tied to a stake and exposed to the worst that the weather could do to injure it was now snugly sheltered under a roof with empty lockers once occupied by aquatic luxuries gaping on either side of it  i was looking out on the river and thinking of all that had happened since my first meeting with cristel by moonlight when the voice of the deaf man made itself discordantly heard behind me  let me apologize for receiving you here he said and let me trouble you with one more of my confessions like other unfortunate deaf people i suffer from nervous irritability sometimes we restlessly change our places of abode and sometimes as in my case we take refuge in variety of occupation you remember the ideal narratives of crime which i was so fond of writing at one time  i gave the affirmative answer in the usual way  well he went on my literary inventions have ceased to interest me i have latterly resumed the chemical studies associated with that happy time in my life when i was entering on the medical profession unluckily for you i have been trying an experiment today which makes such an abominable smell in my room that i dare not ask you to enter it the fumes are not only disagreeable but in some degree dangerous you saw me at the window perhaps with my nose and mouth protected before i opened the bottle  i repeated the affirmative sign he produced his little book of blank leaves and opened it ready for use  may i hope he said that your visit is intended as a favorable reply to my letter  i took the pencil and answered him in these terms  your letter has satisfied me that i was mistaken in treating you like a stranger i have come here to express my regret at having failed to do you justice pray be assured that i believe in your better nature and that i accept your letter in the spirit in which you have written it  he read my reply and suddenly looked at me  never had i seen his beautiful eyes so brightly soft so irresistibly tender as they appeared now he held out his hand to me it is one of my small merits to be in the popular phrase as good as my word i took his hand well knowing that the action committed me to accepting his friendship  in relating the events which form this narrative i look back at the chain as i add to it link by linksometimes with surprise sometimes with interest and sometimes with the discovery that i have omitted a circumstance which it is necessary to replace but i search my memory in vain while i dwell on the lines that i have just written for a recollection of some attendant event which might have warned me of the peril towards which i was advancing blindfold my remembrance presents us as standing together with clasped hands but nothing in the slightest degree ominous is associated with the picture there was no sinister chill communicated from his hand to mine no shocking accident happened close by us in the river not even a passing cloud obscured the sunlight shining in its gayest glory over our heads  after having shaken hands neither he nor i had apparently anything more to say a little embarrassed i turned to the boathouse window and looked out trifling as the action was my companion noticed it  do you like that muddy river he asked  i took the pencil again old associations make even the ugly loke interesting to me  he sighed as he read those words i wish mr roylake i could say the same your interesting river frightens me  it was needless to ask for the pencil again my puzzled face begged for an explanation  when you were in my room he said you may have noticed a second window which looks out on the loke i have got into a bad habit of sitting by that window on moonlight nights i watch the flow of the stream and it seems to associate itself with the flow of my thoughts nothing remarkable so farwhile i am awake but later when i get to sleep dreams come to me all of them sir without exception connect cristel with the river look at the stealthy current that makes no sound in my last nights sleep it made itself heard it was flowing in my ears with a watermusic of its own no longer my deaf ears i heard in my dream as well as you can hear yes the same watermusic singing over and over again the same horrid song fool fool no cristel for you bid her goodbye bid her goodbye i saw her floating away from me on those hideous waters the cruel current held me back when i tried to follow her i struggled and screamed and shivered and cried i woke up with a start that shook me to pieces and cursed your interesting river dont write to me about it again dont look at it again why did you bring up the subject i beg your pardon i had no right to say that let me be polite let me be hospitable i beg to invite you to come and see me when my room is purified from its pestilent smell i can only offer you a cup of tea oh that river that river what devil set me talking about it im not mad mr roylake only wretched when may i expect you choose your own evening next week  who could help pitying him compared with my sound sweet dreamless sleep what dreadful nights were his  i accepted his invitation as a matter of course when we had completed our arrangements it was time for me to think of returning to trimley deen moving towards the door i accidentally directed his attention to the pier by which the boathouse was approached  his face instantly reminded me of cristels description of him when he was strongly and evilly moved i too saw his beautiful eves tell tales and his pretty complexion change to a color which turned him into an ugly man he seized my arm and pointed to the pier at the end of it which joined the riverbank pray accept my excuses i cant answer for my temper if that wretch comes near me with this apology he hurried away and sly giles toller having patiently waited until the coast was clear accosted me with his best bow and said beautiful weather isnt it sir  i had no remarks to make on the weather but i was interested in discovering what had happened at the cottage  you have mortally offended the gentleman who has just left me i said what have you done  mr toller had purposes of his own to serve and kept those purposes as usual exclusively in view he presented deaf ears to me now  i dont think i ever remember such wonderful weather sir in my time and im an old fellow as i neednt tell you being at the mill just now i saw you in the boathouse and came to pay my respects would you be so good as to look at this slip of paper mr gerard if you will kindly ask what it is you will in a manner help me  i knew but too well what it was the repairs again i said resignedly hand it over you obstinate old man  mr toller was so tickled by my discovery and by the cheering prospect consequent on seeing his list of repairs safe in my pocket that he laughed until i really thought he would shake his lean little body to pieces by way of bringing his merriment to an end i assumed a look of severity and insisted on knowing how he had offended the lodger my venerable tenant trembling for his repairs drifted into a question of personal experience and seemed to anticipate that it might improve my temper  when you have a woman about the house mr gerard you may have noticed that shes an everlasting expense to youespecially when shes a young one isnt that so  i inquired if he applied this remark to his daughter  thats it sir im talking of cristy when her backs up there isnt her equal in england for strong language my gentleman has misbehaved himself in some way since you were with us this morning sir how i dont quite understand all i can tell you is ive given him notice to quit a clear loss of money to me every week and cristys responsible for it yes sir ive been worked up to it by my girl if cristys mother had asked me to get rid of a paying lodger i should have told her to go to we wont say where sir youll know where when youre married yourself the upshot of it is that i have offended my gentleman for the sake of my girl which last is a luxury i cant afford unless i let the rooms again if you hear of a tenant say what a good landlord i am and what sweet pretty rooms ive got to let  i led the way to the bank of the river before mr toller could make any more requests  we passed the side of the old cottage the door was open and i saw cristel employed in the kitchen  my watch told me that i had still two or three minutes to spare and my guilty remembrance of the message that i had pinned to the door suggested an immediate expression of regret i approached cristel with a petition for pardon on my lips she looked distrustfully at the door of communication with the new cottage as if she expected to see it opened from the other side  not now she saidand went on sadly with her household work  may i see you tomorrow i asked  it had better not be here sir was the only reply she made  i offered to meet her at any other place which she might appoint cristel persisted in leaving it to me she spoke absently as if she was thinking all the time of something else i could propose no better place at the moment than the spring in fordwitch wood she consented to meet me there on the next day if seven oclock in the morning would not be too early for me my german habits had accustomed me to early rising she heard me tell her thisand looked again at the lodgers doorand abruptly wished me good evening  her polite father was shocked at this unceremonious method of dismissing the great man who had only to say the word and stop the repairs where are your manners cristy he asked indignantly before he could say another word i was out of the cottage  as i passed the spring on my way home i thought of my two appointments on that evening my meeting with the daughter of the lord on the next morning my meeting with the daughter of the miller lady lena at dinner cristel before breakfast if mrs roylake found out that social contrast what would she say i was a merry young fool i burst out laughing    chapter ix  mrs roylakes game first move  the dinner at trimley deen has left in my memory little that i can distinctly recall only a faintlymarked vision of lady lena rewards me for doing my best to remember her a tall slim graceful person dressed in white with a simplicity which is the perfection of art presents to my admiration gentle blue eyes a pale complexion delicately touched with color a wellcarried head crowned by lovely light brown hair so far time helps the reviving past to come to life againand permits nothing more i cannot say that i now remember the voice once so musical in my ears or that i am able to repeat the easy unaffected talk which once interested me or that i see again in my thoughts the perfect charm of manner which delighted everybody not forgetting myself my unworthy self i might say for i was the only young man honored by an introduction to lady lena who stopped at admiration and never made use of opportunity to approach love  on the other hand i distinctly recollect what my stepmother and i said to each other when our guests had wished us goodnight  if i am asked to account for this i can only reply that the conspiracy to lead me into proposing marriage to lady lena first showed itself on the occasion to which i have referred in her eagerness to reach her ends mrs roylake failed to handle the fine weapons of deception as cleverly as usual even i with my small experience of worldly women discovered the object that she had in view  i had retired to the seclusion of the smokingroom and was already encircled by the clouds which float on the heaven of tobacco when i heard a rustling of silk outside and saw the smile of mrs roylake beginning to captivate me through the open door  if you throw away your cigar cried this amiable person you will drive me out of the room dear gerard i like your smoke  my fat man in black coming in at the moment to bring me some soda water looked at his mistress with an expression of amazement and horror which told me that he now saw mrs roylake in the smokingroom for the first time i involved myself in new clouds if i suffocated my stepmother her own polite equivocation would justify the act she settled herself opposite to me in an armchair the agonies that she must have suffered in preventing her face from expressing emotions of disgust i dare not attempt to imagine even at this distance of time  now gerard let us talk about the two ladies what do you think of my friend lady rachel  i dont like your friend lady rachel  you astonish me why  i think shes a false woman  heavens what a thing to say of a ladyand that lady my friend her politics may very reasonably have surprised you but surely her vigorous intellect ought to have challenged your admiration you cant deny that  i was not clever enough to be able to deny it but i was bold enough to say that lady rachel seemed to me to be a woman who talked for the sake of producing effect she expressed opinions as i ventured to declare which in her position i did not believe she could honestly entertain  mrs roylake entered a vigorous protest she assured me that i was completely mistaken lady rachel she said is the most perfectly candid person in the whole circle of my acquaintance  with the best intentions on my part this was more than i could patiently endure  isnt she the daughter of a nobleman i asked doesnt she owe her rank and her splendor and the respect that people show to her to the fortunate circumstance of her birth and yet she talks as if she was a red republican you yourself heard her say that she was a thorough radical and hoped she might live to see the house of lords abolished oh i heard her and what is more i listened so attentively to such sentiments as these from a lady with a title that i can repeat word for word what she said next we havnt deserved our own titles we havnt earned our own incomes and we legislate for the country without having been trusted by the country in short we are a set of impostors and the time is coming when we shall be found out do you believe she really meant that all as false as false can bethats what i say of it  there i stopped privately admiring my own eloquence  quite a mistake on my part my eloquence had done just what mrs roylake wished me to do she wanted an opportunity of dropping lady rachel and taking up lady lena with a producible reason which forbade the imputation of a personal motive on her part i had furnished her with the reason thus far i cannot deny it my stepmother was equal to herself  really gerard you are so violent in your opinions that i am sorry i spoke of lady rachel shall i find you equally prejudiced and equally severe if i change the subject to dear lady lena oh dont say you think she is false too  here mrs roylake made her first mistake she overacted her part and when it was too late she arrived i suspect at that conclusion herself  if you havnt seen that i sincerely admire lady lena i said as smartly as i could the sooner you disfigure yourself with a pair of spectacles my dear lady the better she is very pretty perfectly unaffected and if i may presume to judge delightfully wellbred and welldressed  my stepmothers face actually brightened with pleasure reflecting on it now i am strongly disposed to think that she had not allowed her feelings to express themselves so unreservedly since the time when she was a girl after all mrs roylake was paying her stepson a compliment in trying to entrap him into a splendid marriage it was my duty to think kindly of my ambitious relative i did my duty  you really like my sweet lena she said i am so glad what were you talking about with her she made you exert all your powers of conversation and she seemed to be deeply interested  more overacting another mistake and i could see through it with no english subject which we could discuss in common lady lenas ready tact alluded to my past life mrs roylake had told her that i was educated at a german university she had heard vaguely of students with long hair who wore hessian boots and fought duels and she appealed to my experience to tell her something more i did my best to interest her with very indifferent success and was undeservedly rewarded by a patient attention which presented the unselfish refinements of courtesy under their most perfect form  but let me do my stepmother justice she contrived to bend me to her will before she left the smokingroomi am sure i dont know how  you have entertained the charming daughters at dinner she reminded me and the least you can do after that is to pay your respects to their noble father in your position my dear boy you cannot neglect our english customs without producing the worst possible impression  in two words i found myself pledged under pretence of visiting my lord to improve my acquaintance with lady lena on the next day  and pray be careful mrs roylake proceeded still braving the atmosphere of the smokingroom not to look surprised if you find lord uppercliffs house presenting rather a poor appearance just now  i was dying for another cigar and i entirely misunderstood the words of warning which had just been addressed to me i tried to bring our interview to a close by making a generous proposal  does he want money i asked ill lend him some with the greatest pleasure  mrs roylakes horror expressed itself in a little thin wiry scream  oh gerard what people you must have lived among what shocking ignorance of my lords enormous fortune he and his family have only just returned to their country seat after a long absenceparliament you know and foreign baths and so onand their english establishment is not yet complete i dont know what mistake you may not make next do listen to what i want to say to you  listening i must acknowledge with an absent mind my attention was suddenly seized by mrs roylakewithout the slightest conscious effort towards that end on the part of the lady herself  the first words that startled me in her flow of speech were these  and i must not forget to tell you of poor lord uppercliffs misfortune he had a fall some time since and broke his leg as i think he was so unwise as to let a plausible young surgeon set the broken bone anyway the end of it is that my lord slightly limps when he walks and pray remember that he hates to see it noticed lady rachel doesnt agree with me in attributing her fathers lameness to his surgeons want of experience between ourselves the man seems to have interested her very handsome very clever very agreeable and the manners of a gentleman when his medical services came to an end he was quite an acquisition at their parties in londonwith one drawback he mysteriously disappeared and has never been heard of since ask lady lena about it she will give you all the details without her elder sisters bias in favour of the handsome young man what a pretty compliment you are paying me you really look as if i had interested you  knowing what i knew i was unquestionably interested  although the recent return of lord uppercliff and his daughter to their country home had as yet allowed no opportunity of a meeting out of doors between the deaf lodger and the friends whom he had lost sight ofno doubt at the time of his serious illnessstill the inevitable discovery might happen on any day what result would follow and what would be the effect on lady rachel when she met with the fascinating young surgeon and discovered the terrible change in him    chapter x  warned  we were alone in the glade by the side of the spring at that early hour there were no interruptions to dread but cristel was ill at ease she seemed to be eager to get back to the cottage as soon as possible  father tells me she began abruptly he saw you at the boathouse and it seemed to him that you were behaving yourself like a friend to that terrible man  i reminded her of my having expressed the fear that we had been needlessly hard on him and i added that he had written a letter which confirmed me in that opinion she looked not only disappointed but even alarmed  i had hoped she said sadly that father was mistaken  so little mistaken i assured her that i am going to drink tea with the man who seems to frighten you i hope he will ask you to meet  she recoiled from the bare idea of an invitation  will you hear what i want to tell you she said earnestly you may alter your opinion if you know what i have been foolish enough to do when you saw me go to the other side of the cottage  dear cristel i know what i owe to your kind interest in me on that occasion before i could say a word of apology for having wronged her by my suspicions she insisted on an explanation of what i had just said  did he mention it in his letter she asked  i owned that i had obtained my information in this way and i declared that he had expressed his admiration of her and his belief in her in terms which made it a subject of regret to me not to be able to show what he had written  cristel forgot her fear of our being interrupted her dismay expressed itself in a cry that rang through the wood  you even believe in his letter she exclaimed mr gerard his writing in that way to you about me is a proof that he lies and ill make you see it if you were anybody else but yourself i would leave you to your fate yes your fate she passionately repeated oh forgive me sir im behaving disrespectfully i beg your pardon no no let me go on when i spoke to him in your best interests as i did most truly believe i never suspected what mischief i had done till i looked in his face then i saw how he hated you and how vilely he was thinking in secret of me  pure delusion how could i allow it to go on i interrupted her  my dear you have quite mistaken him as i have already said he sincerely respects youand he owns that he misjudged me when he and i first met  what is that in his letter too its worse even than i feared again and again and again i say itshe stamped on the ground in the fervor of her convictionhe hates you with the hatred that never forgives and never forgets you think him a good man do you suppose i would have begged and prayed of my father to send him away without having reasons that justified me mr gerard you force me to tell you what my unlucky visit did put into his head yes he does believebelieves firmlythat you have forgotten what is due to your rank that i have been wicked enough to forget it too and that you are going to take me away from him say what he may and write what he may he is deceiving you for his own wicked ends if you go to drink tea with him god only knows what cause you may have to regret it forgive me for being so violent sir i have done now you have made me very wretched but you are too good and kind to mean it goodbye  i took her hand i pressed it tenderly i was touched deeply touched  no let me write honestly her eyes betrayed her her voice betrayed her while she said her parting words what i saw what i heard was no longer within the limits of doubt the sweet girls interest in my welfare was not the merely friendly interest which she herself believed it to be and i said just now that i was touched cant lies i loved her more dearly than i had ever loved her yet there is the truthstripped of poor prudery and the mean fear of being called vain  what i might have said to her if the opportunity had offered itself may be easily imagined before i could open my lips a man appeared on the path which led from the mill to the springthe man whom cristel had secretly suspected of a design to follow her  i felt her hand trembling in my hand and gave it a little encouraging squeeze let us judge him i suggested by what he says and does on finding us together  without an attempt at concealment on his part he advanced towards us briskly smiling and waving his hand  what mr roylake you have already found out the virtues of your wonderful spring and you are drinking the water before breakfast i have often done it myself when i was not too lazy to get up and this charming girl he went on turning to cristel has she been trying the virtues of the spring by your advice she wont listen to me or i should have recommended it long since see me set the example  he took a silver mug from his pocket and descended the few steps that led to the spring allowing for the dreadful deaf monotony in his voice no man could have been more innocently joyous and agreeable while he was taking his morning draught i appealed to cristels better sense  is this the hypocrite who is deceiving me for his own wicked ends i asked does he look like the jealous monster who is plotting my destruction and who will succeed if i am fool enough to accept his invitation  poor dear she was as obstinate as ever think over what i have said to youthink for your own sake was her only reply  and a little for your sake i ventured to add  she ran away from me taking the path which would lead her home again the deaf man and i were left together he looked after her until she was out of sight then he produced his book of blank leaves but instead of handing it to me as usual he began to write in it himself  i have something to say to you he explained  it was only possible while the book was in his possession to remind him that i could hear and that he could speak by using the language of signs i touched my lips and pointed to him i touched my ear and pointed to myself  yes he said understanding me with his customary quickness but i want you to remember as well as to hear when i have filled this leaf i shall beg you to keep it about you and to refer to it from time to time  he wrote on steadily until he had filled both sides of the slip of paper  quite a little letter he said pray read it  this is what i read  you must have seen for yourself that i was incapable of insulting you and miss cristel by an outbreak of jealousy when i found you together just now only remember that we all have our weaknesses and that it is my hard lot to be in a state of contest with the inherited evil which is the calamity of my life with your encouragement i may resist temptation in the future and keep the better part of me in authority over my thoughts and actions but be on your guard and advise miss cristel to be on her guard against false appearances as we all know they lie like truth consider me pity me i ask no more  straightforward and manly and modesti appeal to any unprejudiced mind whether i should not have committed a mean action if i had placed an evil construction on this  am i understood he asked  i signed to him to give me his book and relieved him of anxiety in these words  if i had failed to understand you i should have felt ashamed of myself may i show what you have written to cristel  he smiled more sweetly and pleasantly than i had seen him smile yet  if you wish it he answered i leave it entirely to you thank youand good morning  having advanced a few steps on his way to the cottage he paused and reminded me of the teadrinking dont forget tomorrow evening at seven oclock    chapter xi  warned again  the breakfast hour had not yet arrived when i got home i went into the garden to refresh my eyesa little weary of the solemn uniformity of color in fordwitch woodby looking at the flowers  reaching the terrace in the first place i heard below me a mans voice speaking in tones of angry authority and using language which expressed an intention of turning somebody out of the garden i at once descended the steps which led to the flowerbeds the man in authority proved to be one of my gardeners and the man threatened with instant expulsion was the oddlydressed servant of the friend whom i had just left  the poor fellows ugly face presented a picture of shame and contrition the moment i showed myself he piteously entreated me to look over it and to forgive him  wait a little i said let me see if i have anything to forgive i turned to the gardener what is your complaint of this man  hes a trespasser on your grounds sir and his impudence to say the least of it is such as i never met with before  what harm has he done  harm sir  yesharm has he been picking the flowers  the gardener looked round him longing to refer me to the necessary evidence and failing to discover it anywhere the wretched trespasser took heart of grace and said a word in his own defence  nobody ever knew me to misbehave myself in a gentlemans garden he said i own sir to having taken a peep at the flowers over the wall  and they tempted you to look a little closer at them  thats the truth sir  so you are fond of flowers  yes sir i once failed in business as a nurserymanbut i dont blame the flowers  the delightful simplicity of this was lost on the gardener i heard the brute mutter to himself gammon for once i asserted my authority over my servant  understand this i said to him i dont confine the enjoyment of my garden to myself and my friends any wellbehaved persons are welcome to come here and look at the flowers remember that now you may go  having issued these instructions i next addressed myself to my friend in the shabby shooting jacket telling him to roam wherever he liked and to stay as long as he pleased instead of thanking me and using his liberty he hesitated and looked thoroughly ill at ease  whats the matter now i asked  im afraid you dont know sir who it is you are so kind to ive been something else in my time besides a nurseryman  what have you been  a prizefighter  if he expected me to exhibit indignation or contempt he was disappointed my ignorance treated him as civilly as ever  what is a prizefighter i inquired  the unfortunate pugilist looked at me in speechless bewilderment i told him that i had been brought up among foreigners and that i had never even seen an english newspaper for the last ten years this explanation seemed to encourage the man of few words it set him talking freely at last he delivered a treatise on the art of prizefighting and he did something else which i found more amusinghe told me his name to my small sense of humor his name so to speak completed this delightfully odd man it was gloody as to the list of his misfortunes the endless length of it became so unendurably droll that we both indulged in unfeeling fits of laughter over the sorrows of gloody the first lucky accident of the poor fellows life had been literally the discovery of him by his present master  this event interested me i said i should like to hear how it had happened  gloody modestly described himself as one of the starving lot sir that looks out for small errands i got my first dinner for three days by carrying a gentlemans portmanteau for him and he if you please was afterwards my master he lived alone bless you he was as deaf then as he is now he says to me if you bawl in my ears ill knock you down i thought to myself you wouldnt say that master if you knew how i was employed twenty years ago he took me into his service sir because i was ugly im so handsome myself he says i want a contrast of something ugly about me you may have noticed that hes a bitter oneand bitterly enough he sometimes behaved to me but theres a good side to him he gives me his old clothes and sometimes he speaks almost as kindly to me as you do but for him i believe i should have perished of starvation  he suddenly checked himself whether he was afraid of wearying me or whether some painful recollection had occurred to him it was of course impossible to say  the ugly face to which he owed his first poor little morsel of prosperity became overclouded by care and doubt bursting into expressions of gratitude which i had certainly not deservedexpressions so evidently sincere that they bore witness to constant illusage suffered in the course of his hard lifehe left me with a headlong haste of movement driven away as i fancied by an unquiet mind  i watched him retreating along the path and saw him stop abruptly still with his back to me his deep strong voice travelled farther than he supposed i heard him say to himself what an infernal rascal i am he waited a little and turned my way again slowly and reluctantly he came back to me as he approached i saw the man who had lived by the public exhibition of his courage looking at me with fear plainly visible in the change of his color and the expression of his face  anything wrong i inquired  nothing wrong sir might i be so bold as to ask  we waited a little i gave him time to collect his thoughts perhaps the silence confused him anyhow i was obliged to help him to get on  what do you wish to ask of me i said  i wished to speak sir  he stopped again  about what i asked  about tomorrow evening  well  he burst out with it at last are you coming to drink tea with my master  of course i am coming mr gloody do you know that you rather surprise me  i hope no offence sir  nonsense it seems odd my good fellow that your master shouldnt have told you i was coming to drink tea with him isnt it your business to get the things ready  he shifted from one foot to another and looked as if he wished himself out of my way at a later time of my life i have observed that these are signs by which an honest man is apt to confess that he has told or is going to tell a lie as it was i only noticed that he answered confusedly  i cant quite say mr roylake that my master didnt mention the thing to me  but you failed to understand himis that it  well sir if i want to ask him anything i have to write it im slow at writing and bad at writing and he isnt always patient however as you reminded me just now i have got to get the things ready to cut it short perhaps i might say that i didnt quite expect the teaparty would come off  why shouldnt it come off  well sir you might have some other engagement  was this a hint or only an excuse in either case it was high time if he still refused to speak out that i should set him the example  you have given me some curious information i said on the subject of fighting with the fists and you have made me understand the difference between fair hitting and foul hitting are you hitting fair now very likely i am mistakenbut you seem to me to be trying to prevent my accepting your masters invitation  he pulled off his hat in a hurry  i beg your pardon sir i wont detain you any longer if you will allow me ill take my leave  dont go mr gloody without telling me whether i am right or wrong is there really some objection to my coming to tea tomorrow  quite a mistake sir he said still in a hurry ive led you wrong without meaning itbeing an ignorant man and not knowing how to express myself dont think me ungrateful mr roylake after your kindness to me id go through fire and water for youi would  his sunken eyes moistened his big voice faltered i let him leave me in mercy to the strong feeling which i had innocently roused but i shook hands with him first yielding to one of my headlong impulses yes and doing a very indiscreet thing wait a littleand we shall see    chapter xii  warned for the last time  my loyalty towards the afflicted man whose friendly advances i had seen good reason to return was in no sense shaken his undeserved misfortunes his manly appeal to me at the spring his hopeless attachment to the beautiful girl whose aversion towards him i had unhappily encouraged all pleaded with me in his favour i had accepted his invitation and i had no other engagement to claim me it would have been an act of meanness amounting to a confession of fear if i had sent an excuse still while cristels entreaties and cristels influence had failed to shake me gloodys strange language and gloodys incomprehensible conduct had troubled my mind i felt vaguely uneasy irritated by my own depression of spirits if i had been a philosopher i should have recognized the symptoms of a very common attack of a very widelyspread moral malady the meanest of all human infirmities is also the most universal and the name of it is selfesteem  it is perhaps only right to add that my patience had been tried by the progress of domestic events which affected lady lena and myselfviewed as victims  calling with my stepmother at lord uppercliffs house later in the day i perceived that lady rachel and mrs roylake found or made an opportunity of talking together confidentially in a corner and once or twice i caught them looking at lady lena and at me even lord uppercliff perhaps not yet taken into their confidence noticed the proceedings of the two ladies and seemed to be at a loss to understand them  when mrs roylake and i were together again on our way home i was prepared to hear the praise of lady lena followed by a delicate examination into the state of my heart neither of these anticipations was realized once more my clever stepmother had puzzled me  mrs roylake talked as fluently as ever exhausting one commonplace subject after another without the slightest allusion to my lords daughter to my matrimonial prospects or to my visits at the mill i was secretly annoyed feeling that my stepmothers singular indifference to domestic interests of paramount importance at other times must have some object in view entirely beyond the reach of my penetration if i had dared to commit such an act of rudeness i should have jumped out of the carriage and have told mrs roylake that i meant to walk home  the day was sunday i loitered about the garden listening to the distant churchbell ringing for the afternoon service without any cause that i knew of to account for it i was so restless that nothing i could do attracted me or quieted me  returning to the house i tried to occupy myself with my collection of insects sadly neglected of late useless my own moths failed to interest me  i went back to the garden passing the open window of one of the lower rooms which looked out on the terrace i saw mrs roylake reading a book in sadcolored binding she was yawning over it fearfully when she discovered that i was looking at her equal to any emergency this remarkable woman instantly handed to me a second and similar volume the most precious sermons gerard that have been written in our time i looked at the book i opened the book i recovered my presence of mind and handed it back if a female humbug was on one side of the window a male humbug was on the other please keep it for me till the evening i said i am going for a walk  which way did i turn my steps  men will wonder what possessed mewomen will think it a proceeding that did me crediti took the familiar road which led to the gloomy wood and the guilty river the longing in me to see cristel again was more than i could resist not because i was in love with her only because i had left her in distress  beyond the spring and within a short distance of the river i saw a lady advancing towards me on the path which led from the mill  brisk smiling tripping along like a young girl behold the mockrepublican known in our neighborhood as lady rachel she held out both hands to me but for her petticoats i should have thought i had met with a jolly young man  i have been wandering in your glorious wood mr roylake anything to escape the respectable classes on sunday patronizing piety on the way to afternoon church i must positively make a sketch of the cottage by the milli mean of course the picturesque side of it that fine girl of tollers was standing at the door she is really handsomer than ever are you going to see her you wicked man which do you admirethat gypsy complexion or lenas lovely skin both i have no doubt at your age goodbye  when we had left each other i thought of the absent captain in the navy who was lady rachels husband he was a perfect strangerbut i put myself in his place and felt that i too should have gone to sea  old toller was alone in his kitchen evidently annoyed and angry  we are all at sixes and sevens mr gerard ive had another row with that deafdevilmy new name for him and i think its rather clever he swears sir that he wont go at the end of his weeks notice says if i think im likely to get rid of him before he has married cristy im mistaken threatens if any man attempts to take her away hell shoot her and shoot the man and shoot himself aha old as i am if he believes hes going to have it all his own way hes mistaken ill be even with him you mark my words ill be even with him  that old tollerthe most exasperating of men judged by a quick temperhad irritated my friend into speaking rashly was plain enough nevertheless i felt some anxiety jealous anxiety i am afraid about cristel after looking round the kitchen again i asked where she was  sitting forlorn in her bedroom crying her father told me i went out for a walk by the river and i sat down and being sunday i fell asleep when i woke and got home again just now that was how i found her i dont like to hear my girl crying shes as good as gold and better no sir our deafdevil is not to blame for this he has given cristy no reason to complain of him she says so herselfand she never told a lie yet  but mr toller i objected something must have happened to distress her has she not told you what it is  not she obstinate about it leaves me to guess its clear to my mind mr gerard that somebody has got at her in my absence and said something to upset her you will ask me who the person is i cant say i have found that out yet  but you mean to try  yes i mean to try  he answered me with little of the energy which generally distinguished him perhaps he was fatigued or perhaps he had something else to think of i offered a suggestion  when we are in want of help i said we sometimes find it nearer than we had ventured to expectat our own doors  the ancient miller rose at that hint like a fish at a fly  gloody he cried  find him at once mr toller  he hobbled to the doorand looked round at me ive got burdens on my mind he explained or i should have thought of it too having done justice to his own abilities he bustled out in less than a minute he was back again in a state of breathless triumph gloody has seen the person he announced and what do you think sir its a woman  i beckoned to gloody waiting modestly at the door to come in and tell me what he had discovered  i saw her outside sirrapping at the door here with her parasol that was the servants report  her parasol not being acquainted with the development of dress among female servants in england i asked if she was a lady there seemed to be no doubt of it in the mans mind she was also as gloody supposed a person whom he had never seen before  how is it you are not sure of that i said  well sir she was waiting to be let in and i was behind her coming out of the wood  who let her in  miss cristel his face brightened with an expression of interest when he mentioned the millers daughter he went on with his story without wanting questions to help him miss cristel looked like a person surprised at seeing a strangerwhat i should call a free and easy stranger she walked in sir as if the place belonged to her  i am not suspicious by nature as i hope and believe but i began to be reminded of lady rachel already  did you notice the ladys dress i asked  a woman who had seen her would have been able to describe every morsel of her dress from head to foot the man had only observed her hat and all he could say was that he thought it a smartish one  any particular color i went on  not that i know of dark green i think  any ornament in it  yes a purple feather  the hat i had seen on the head of that hateful woman was now sufficiently describedfor a man sly old toller leaving gloody unnoticed and keeping his eye on me saw the signs of conviction in my face and said with his customary audacity who is she  i followed at my humble distance the example of sir walter scott when inquisitive people asked him if he was the author of the waverley novels in plain english i denied all knowledge of the stranger wearing the green hat but i was naturally desirous of discovering next what lady rachel had said and i asked to speak with cristel her farseeing father might or might not have perceived a chance of listening to our conversation he led me to the door of his daughters room and stood close by when i knocked softly and begged that she would come out  the tone of the poor girls voiceanswering forgive me sir i cant do itconvicted the shesocialist as i thought of merciless conduct of some sort assuming this conclusion to be the right one i determined then and there that lady rachel should not pass the doors of trimley deen again if her bosomfriend resented that wise act of severity by leaving the house i should submit with resignation and should remember the circumstance with pleasure  i am afraid you are ill cristel was all i could find to say under the double disadvantage of speaking through a door and having a father listening at my side  oh no mr gerard not ill a little low in my mind thats all i dont mean to be rude sirpray be kinder to me than ever pray let me be  i said i would return on the next day and left the room with a sore heart  old toller highly approved of my conduct he rubbed his fleshless hands and whispered youll get it out of cristy tomorrow and ill help you  i found gloody waiting for me outside the cottage he was anxious about miss cristel his only excuse he told me being the fear that she might be ill having set him at ease in that particular i said you seem to be interested in miss cristel  his answer raised him a step higher in my estimation  how can i help it sir  an odd man with a personal appearance that might excite a prejudice against him in some minds i failed to see it myself in that light it struck me as i walked home that cristel might have made many a worse friend than the retired prizefighter  a change in my manner was of course remarked by mrs roylakes ready observation i told her that i had been annoyed and offered no other explanation wonderful to relate she showed no curiosity and no surprise more wonderful still at every fair opportunity that offered she kept out of my way  my next days engagement being for seven oclock in the evening i put mrs roylakes selfcontrol to a new test with prefatory excuses i informed her that i should not be able to dine at home as usual impossible as it was that she could have been prepared to hear this her presence of mind was equal to the occasion i left the house followed by my stepmothers best wishes for a pleasant evening  hoping to speak with cristel alone i had arranged to reach the cottage before seven oclock  on the rivermargin of the wood i was confronted by a wild gleam of beauty in the familiar view for which previous experience had not prepared me am i wrong in believing that all scenery no matter how magnificent or how homely it may be derives a splendor not its own from favouring conditions of light and shade our gloomy trees and our repellent river presented an aspect superbly transfigured under the shadows of the towering clouds the fantastic wreaths of the mist and the lurid reddening of the sun as it stooped to its setting lovely interfusions of sobered color rested faded returned again on the upper leaves of the foliage as they lightly moved the mist rolling capriciously over the waters revealed the grandly deliberate course of the flowing current while it dimmed the turbid earthy yellow that discolored and degraded the stream under the full glare of day while my eyes followed the successive transformations of the view as the hour advanced tender and solemn influences breathed their balm over my mind days happy days that were past revived again i walked hand in hand with my mother among the scenes that were round me and learnt from her to be grateful for the beauty of the earth with a heart that felt it we were tracing our way along our favorite woodland path and we found a companion of tender years hiding from us she showed herself blushing hesitating offering a nosegay of wild flowers my mother whispered to mei thanked the little millgirl and gave her a kiss did i feel the childs breath in my daydream still fluttering on my cheek was i conscious of her touch i started trembled returned reluctantly to my present self a visible hand touched my arm as i turned suddenly a living breath played on my face the child had faded into a vanishing shade the perfected woman who had grown from her had stolen on me unawares and was asking me to pardon her mr gerard you were lost in your thoughts i spoke and you never heard me  i looked at her in silence  was this the dear cristel so well known to me or was it a mockery of her that had taken her place  i hope i have not offended you she said  you have surprised me i answered something must have happened since i saw you last what is it  nothing  i advanced a step and drew her closer to me a dark flush discolored her face an overpowering brilliancy flashed from her eyes there was an hysterical defiance in her manner are you excited are you angry are you trying to startle me by acting a part i urged those questions on her one after another and i was loudly and confidently answered  i dare say i am excited mr gerard by the honor that has been done me you are going to keep your engagement of course well your friend your favorite friend has invited me to meet you no thats not quite true i invited myselfthe deaf gentleman submitted  why did you invite yourself  because a teaparty is not complete without a woman  her manner was as strangely altered as her looks that she was beside herself for the moment i clearly saw that she had answered me unreservedly it was impossible to believe i began to feel angry when i ought to have made allowances for her  is this lady rachels doing i said  what do you know of lady rachel sir  i know that she has visited you and spoken to you  do you know what she has said  i can guess  mr gerard dont abuse that good and kind lady she deserves your gratitude as well as mine  her manner had become quieter her face was more composed her expression almost recovered its natural charm while she spoke of lady rachel i was stupefied  try sir to forget it and forgive it she resumed gently if i have misbehaved myself i dont rightly know what i am saying or doing  i pointed to the new side of the cottage behind us  is the cause there i asked  no no indeed i have not seen him i have not heard from him his servant often brings me messages not one message today  have you seen gloody today  oh yes theres one thing if i may make so bold i should like to know mr gloody is as good to me as good can be we see each other continually living in the same place but you are different and he tells me himself he has only seen you twice what have you done mr gerard to make him like you so well in that short time  i told her that he had been found in my garden looking at the flowers as he had done no harm i said i wouldnt allow the servant to turn him out and i walked round the flowerbeds with him little enough to deserve such gratitude as the poor fellow expressedand felt i dont doubt it  i had intended to say no more than this but the remembrance of gloodys mysterious prevarication and of the uneasiness which i had undoubtedly felt when i thought of it afterwards led me i cannot pretend to say how into associating cristels agitation with something which this man might have said to her i was on the point of putting the question when she held up her hand and said hush  the wind was blowing towards us from the riverside village to which i have already alluded i am not sure whether i have mentioned that the name of the place was kylam it was situated behind a promontory of the riverbank clothed thickly with trees and was not visible from the mill in the present direction of the wind we could hear the striking of the church clock cristel counted the strokes  seven she said are you determined to keep your engagement  she had repeatedin an unsteady voice and with a sudden change in her color to palenessthe strange question put to me by gloody in his case i had failed to trace the motive i tried to discover it now  tell me why i ought to break my engagement i said  remember what i told you at the spring she answered you are deceived by a false friend who lies to you and hates you  the man she was speaking of turned the corner of the new cottage he waved his hand gaily and approached us along the road  go she said your guardian angel has forgotten you its too late now  instead of letting me precede her as i had anticipated she ran on before memade a sign to the deaf man as she passed him not to stop herand disappeared through the open door of her fathers side of the cottage  i was left to decide for myself what should i have done if i had been twenty years older  say that my moral courage would have risen superior to the poorest of all fears the fear of appearing to be afraid and that i should have made my excuses to my host of the eveninghow would my moral courage have answered him if he had asked for an explanation useless to speculate on it had i possessed the wisdom of middle life his book of leaves would not have told him in my own handwriting that i believed in his better nature and accepted his friendly letter in the spirit in which he had written  explain it who cani knew that i was going to drink tea with him and yet i was unwilling to advance a few steps and meet him on the road  i find a new bond of union between us he said as he joined me we both feel that he pointed to the grandly darkening view the two men who could have painted the mystery of those growing shadows and fading lights lie in the graves of rembrandt and turner shall we go to tea  on our way to his room we stopped at the millers door  will you inquire he said if miss cristel is ready  i went in old toller was in the kitchen smoking his pipe without appearing to enjoy it  whats come to my girl he asked the moment he saw me yesterday she was in her room crying today shes in her room praying  the warnings which i had neglected rose in judgment against me i was silent i was awed before i recovered myself cristel entered the kitchen her father whispered look at her  of the excitement which had disturbedi had almost said profanedher beautiful face not a vestige remained pale composed resolute she said i am ready and led the way out  the man whom she hated offered his arm she took it    chapter xiii  the claret jug  i perceived but one change in the lodgers miserable room since i had seen it last  a second table was set against one of the walls our boiling water for the tea was kept there in a silver kettle heated by a spiritlamp i next observed a delicate little china vase which held the tea and a finelydesigned glass claret jug with a silver cover other men possessing that beautiful object would have thought it worthy of the purest bordeaux wine which the arts of modern adulteration permit us to drink this man had filled the claret jug with water  all my valuable property ostentatiously exposed to view he said in his bitterly facetious manner my landlords property matches it on the big table  the big table presented a coarse earthenware teapot cups and saucers with pieces chipped out of them a cracked milk jug a tumbler which served as a sugar basin and an old vegetable dish honored by holding delicate french sweetmeats for the first time since it had left the shop  my deaf friend in boisterously good spirits pointed backwards and forwards between the precious and the worthless objects on the two tables as if he saw a prospect that delighted him  i dont believe the man lives he said who enjoys contrast as i dowhat do you want now  this question was addressed to gloody who had just entered the room he touched the earthenware teapot his master answered let it alone  i make the tea at other times the man persisted looking at me  what does he say write it down for me mr roylake i beg you will write it down  there was anger in his eyes as he made that request i took his book and wrote the wordsharmless words surely he read them and turned savagely to his unfortunate servant  in the days when you were a ruffian in the prizering did the other mens fists beat all the brains out of your head do you think you can make tea that is fit for mr roylake to drink  he pointed to an open door communicating with another bedroom gloodys eyes rested steadily on cristel she failed to notice him being occupied at the moment in replacing the pin of a brooch which had slipped out of her dress the man withdrew into the second bedroom and softly closed the door  our host recovered his good humor he took a wooden stool and seated himself by cristel  borrowed furniture he said as well as borrowed teathings what a debt of obligation i owe to your excellent father how quiet you are dear girl do you regret having followed the impulse which made you kindly offer to drink tea with us he suddenly turned to me another proof mr roylake of the sisterly interest that she feels in you she cant hear of your coming to my room without wanting to be with you ah you possess the mysterious attractions which fascinate the sex one of these days some woman will love you as never man was loved yet he addressed himself again to cristel still out of spirits i dare say you are tired of waiting for your tea no you have had tea already its gloodys fault he ought to have told me that seven oclock was too late for you the poor devil deserved that you should take no notice of him when he looked at you just now are you one of the few women who dislike an ugly man women in general i can tell you prefer ugly men a handsome man matches them on their own ground and they dont like that we are so fond of our ugly husbands they set us off to such advantage oh i dont report what they say i speak the language in which they thinkmr roylake does it strike you that the cur is a sad cynic bytheby do you call me the cur as i suggested when you speak of me to other peopleto miss cristel for instance my charming young friends you both look shocked you both shake your heads perhaps i am in one of my tolerant humors today i see nothing disgraceful in being a cur he is a dog who represents different breeds very well the english are a people who represent different breeds saxons normans danes the consequence in one case is a great nation the consequence in the other case is the cleverest member of the whole dog familyas you may find out for yourself if you will only teach him hahow i am running on my guests try to slip in a word or two and cant find their opportunity enjoyment miss cristel excitement mr roylake for more than a year past i have not luxuriated in the pleasures of society i feel the social glow i love the human family i never never never was such a good man as i am now let vile slang express my emotions isnt it jolly  cristel and i stopped him at the same moment we instinctively lifted our hands to our ears  in his delirium of high spirits he had burst through the invariable monotony of his articulation without the slightest gradation of sound his voice broke suddenly into a screech prolonged in its own discord until it became perfectly unendurable to hear the effect that he had produced upon us was not lost on him his head sank on his breast horrid shudderings shook him without mercy he said to himself not to us  i had forgotten i was deaf  there was a whole world of misery in those simple words cristel kept her place unmoved i rose and put my hand kindly on his shoulder it was the best way i could devise of assuring him of my sympathy  he looked up at me in silence  his book of leaves was on the table he did once more what he had already done at the spring instead of using the book as usual he wrote in it himself and then handed it to me  let me spare your nerves a repetition of my deaf discord sight smell touch tastei would give them all to be able to hear in reminding me of that vain aspiration my infirmity revenges itself my deafness is not accustomed to be forgotten well i can be silently useful i can make the tea  he rose and taking the teapot with him went to the table that had been placed against the wall in that position his back was turned towards us  at the same time i felt his book gently taken out of my hand cristel had been reading while i read over my shoulder she wrote on the next blank leaf shall i make the tea  now she said to me notice what happens  following him she touched his arm and presented her request he shook his head in token of refusal she came back to her place by me  you expected that i said  yes  why did you ask me to notice his refusal  because i may want to remind you that he wouldnt let me make the tea  mysteries my dear  yes mysteries  not to be mentioned more particularly  i will mention one of them more particularly after the tea has been made you may possibly feel me touch your knee under the table  i was fool enough to smile at this and wise enough afterwards to see in her face that i had made a mistake  what is your touch intended to mean i asked  it means wait she said  my sense of humor was by this time completely held in check that some surprise was in store for me and that cristel was resolved not to take me into her confidence were conclusions at which i naturally arrived i felt and surely not without good cause a little annoyed the lodger came back to us with the tea made as he put the teapot on the table he apologized to cristel  dont think me rude in refusing your kind offer if there is one thing i know i can do better than anybody else that thing is making tea do you take sugar and milk mr roylake  i made the affirmative sign he poured out the tea when he had filled two cups the supply was exhausted cristel and i noticed this he saw it and at once gratified our curiosity  it is a rule he said with masters in the art of making tea that one infusion ought never to be used twice if we want any more we will make more and if you feel inclined to join us miss cristel we will fill the third cup  what was there in this i wondered to make her turn pale and why after what he had just said did i see her eyes willingly rest on him for the first time in my experience entirely at a loss to understand her i resignedly stirred my tea on the point of tasting it next felt her hand on my knee under the table  bewildered as i was i obeyed my instructions and went on stirring my tea our host smiled  your sugar takes a long time to melt he saidand drank his tea as he emptied the cup the touch was taken off me i followed his example  in spite of his boasting the tea was the worst i ever tasted i should have thrown it out of the window if they had offered us such nasty stuff at trimley deen when i set down my cup he asked facetiously if i wished him to brew any more my negative answer was a masterpiece of strong expression in the language of signs  instead of sending for gloody to clear the table he moved away the objects near him so as to leave an empty space at his disposal  i ought perhaps to have hesitated before i asked you to spend the evening with me he said speaking with a gentleness and amiability of manner strongly in contrast with his behavior up to this time it is my misfortune as you both well know to be a check on conversation i dare say you have asked yourselves how is he going to amuse us after tea if you will allow me i propose to amuse you by exhibiting the dexterity of my fingers and thumbs before i was deaf i should have preferred the piano for this purpose as it is an inferior accomplishment must serve my turn  he opened a cupboard in the wall close by the second table and returned with a pack of cards  cristel imitated the action of dealing cards for a game no he said that is not the amusement which i have in view allow me to present myself in a new character i am no longer the lodger and no longer the cur my new name is more honorable stilli am the conjurer  he shuffled the pack by pouring it backwards and forwards from one hand to the other in a cascade of cards the wonderful ease with which he did it prepared me for something worth seeing cristels admiration of his dexterity expressed itself by a prolonged clapping of hands and a strange uneasy laugh as his excitement subsided her agitation broke out i saw the flush again on her face and the fiery brightness in her eyes once when his attention was engaged she stole a look at the door by which gloody had left the room did this indicate another of the mysteries which by her own confession she had in preparation for me my late experience had not inclined me favorably towards mysteries i devoted my whole attention to the conjurer  whether he chose the easiest examples of skill in sleight of hand is more than i know i can only say that i never was more completely mystified by any professor of legerdemain on the public platform after the performance of each trick he asked leave to time himself by looking at his watch being anxious to discover if he had lost his customary quickness of execution through recent neglect of the necessary practice  of cristels conduct while he was amusing us i can only say that it justified mrs roylakes spiteful description of her as a bold girl the more cleverly the tricks were performed the more they seemed to annoy and provoke her  i hate being puzzled she said addressing herself of course to me yes yes his fingers are quicker than my eyesi have heard that explanation before when he has done one of his tricks i want to know how he does it conjurers are people who ask riddles and when one cant guess them refuse to say what the answer is its as bad as calling me a fool to suppose that i like being deceived ah she cried with a shocking insolence of look and manner if our friend could only hear what i am saying  he had paused while she was speaking observing her attentively your face doesnt encourage me he said with a patience and courtesy of manner which it was impossible not to admire i am coming gradually to my greatest triumph and i think i can surprise and please you  he timed his last trick and returned to the table placed against the wall  excuse me for a moment he resumed i am suffering as usual after drinking tea i so delight in it that the temptation tonight was more than i could resist tea disagrees with my weak stomach it always produces thirst  what nonsense he talks cristel exclaimed all mere fancy he reminds me of the old song called the nervous man do you know it mr roylake  in spite of my efforts to prevent her she burst out with the first verse of a stupid comic song spared by his deafness from this infliction of vulgarity our host filled a tumbler from the water in the claret jug and drank it  as he set the tumbler down we were startled by an accident in the next room the floor was suddenly shaken by the sound of a heavy fall the fall was followed by a groan which instantly brought me to my feet  although his infirmity made him unconscious of the groan my friend felt the vibration of the floor and saw me start up from my chair he looked even more alarmed than i was judging by the ghastly change that i saw in his color and he reached the door of the second room as soon as i did it is needless to say that i allowed him to enter first  on the point of following him i felt myself roughly pulled back when i turned round and saw cristel i did really and truly believe that she was mad the furious impatience in her eyes the frenzied strength of her grasp on my arm would have led most other men to form the same conclusion  come she cried no not a word there isnt a moment to lose she dragged me across the room to the table on which the claret jug stood she filled the tumbler from it as he had filled the tumbler the material of which the jug had been made was so solid crystal not glass as i had supposed that the filling of the two tumblers emptied it cristel held the water out to me gasping for breath trembling as if she saw some frightful reptile before her instead of myself  drink it she said if you value your life  i should of course have found it perfectly easy to obey her strange as her language was if i had been in full possession of myself between distress and alarm my mind i suppose had lost its balance with or without a cause i hesitated  she crossed the room and threw open the window which looked out on the river  you shant die alone she said if you dont drink it ill throw myself out  i drank from the tumbler to the last drop  it was not water  it had a taste which i can compare to no drink and to no medicine known to me i thought of the other strange taste peculiar to the tea at last the tremendous truth forced itself on my mind the man in whom my boyish generosity had so faithfully believed had attempted my life  cristel took the tumbler from me my poor angel clasped her free arm round my neck and pressed her lips in an ecstasy of joy on my cheek the next instant she seized the claret jug and dashed it into pieces on the floor get the jug from his washhandstand she said when i gave it to her she poured some of the water upon the broken fragments of crystal scattered on the floor i had put the jug back in its place and was returning to cristel when the poisoner showed himself entering from the servants room  dont be alarmed he said gloodys name ought to be glutton an attack of giddiness thoroughly well deserved i have relieved him you remember mr roylake that i was once a surgeon  the broken claret jug caught his eye  we have all read of men who were petrified by terror of the few persons who have really witnessed that spectacle i am one the utter stillness of him was really terrible to see cristel wrote in his book an excuse no doubt prepared beforehand that fall in the next room frightened me and i felt faint i went to get some water from the jug you drank out of and it slipped from my hand  she placed those words under his eyesshe might just as well have shown them to the dog a dead man erect on his feetso he looked to our eyes so he still looked when i took cristels arm and led her out of that dreadful presence  take me into the air she whispered  a burst of tears relieved her after the unutterable suspense that she had so bravely endured when she was in some degree composed again we walked gently up and down for a minute or two in the cool night air dont speak to me she said as we stopped before her fathers door i am not fit for it yet i know what you feel i pressed her to my heart and let the embrace speak for me she yielded to it faintly sighing tomorrow i whispered she bent her head and left me  walking home through the wood i became aware little by little that my thoughts were not under the customary control over and over again i tried to review the events of that terrible evening and failed fragments of other memories presented themselvesand then deserted me nonsense absolute nonsense found its way into my mind next and rose in idiotic words to my lips i grew too lazy even to talk to myself i strayed from the path the mossy earth began to rise and sink under my feet like the waters in a groundswell at sea i stood still in a state of idiotwonder the ground suddenly rose right up to my face i remember no more  my first conscious exercise of my senses when i revived came to me by way of my ears leaden weights seemed to close my eyes to fetter my movements to silence my tongue to paralyze my touch but i heard a wailing voice speaking close to me so close that it might have been my own voice i distinguished the words i knew the tones  oh my master my lord who am i that i should liveand you die and you die  was it her warm young breath that quickened me with its vigorous life i only know that the revival of my sense of touch did certainly spring from the contact of her lips pressed to mine in the reckless abandonment of grief without hope her cry of joy when my first sigh told her that i was still a living creature ran through me like an electric shock i opened my eyes i held out my hand i tried to help her when she raised my head and set me against the tree under which i had been stretched helpless with an effort i could call her by her name even that exhausted me my mind was so weak that i should have believed her if she had declared herself to be a spirit seen in a dream keeping watch over me in the wood  wiser than i was she snatched up my hat ran on before me and was lost in the darkness  an interval an unendurable interval passed she returned having filled my hat from the spring but for the exquisite coolness of the water falling on my face trickling down my throat i should have lost my senses again in a few minutes more i could take that dear hand and hold it to me as if i was holding to my life we could only see each other obscurely and in that very circumstance as we confessed to each other afterwards we found the needful composure before we could speak  cristel what does it mean  poison she answered and he has suffered too  to my astonishment there was no anger in her tone she spoke of him as quietly as if she had been alluding to an innocent man  do you mean that he has been at deaths door like me  yes thank godor i should never have found you here poor old gloody came to us in search of help my masters in a swoon and i cant bring him to directly i heard that i remembered that you had drunk what he had drunk what had happened to him must have happened to you dont ask me how long it was before i found you and what i felt when i did find you i do so want to enjoy my happiness only let me see you safely home and i ask no more  she helped me to rise with the encouraging words which she might have used to a child she put my arm in hers and led me carefully along through the wood as if i had been an old man  cristel had saved my lifebut she would hear of no allusion to it she knew how the poisoner had plotted to get rid of mebut nothing that i could say induced her to tell me how she had made the discovery in view of trimley deen my guardian angel dropped my arm  go on she said and let me see the servant let you in before i run home  if she had not been once more wiser than i was i should have taken her with me to the house i should have positively refused to let her go back by herself nothing that i could say or do had the slightest effect on her resolution does the man live who could have taken leave of her calmly in my place she tore herself away from me with a sigh of bitterness that was dreadful to hear  oh my darling i said do i distress you  horribly she answered but you are not to blame  those were her farewell words i called after her i tried to follow her she was lost to me in the darkness    chapter xiv  gloody settles the account  a night of fever a night when i did slumber for a few minutes of horrid dreamsthis was what i might have expected and this is what really happened the fresh morning air flowing through my open window cooled and composed me the mercy of sleep found me when i woke and looked at my watch i was a new man the hour was noon  i rang my bell the servant announced that a man was waiting to see me the same man sir who was found in the garden looking at your flowers i at once gave directions to have him shown up into my bedroom the delay of dressing was more than i had patience to encounter unless i was completely mistaken here was the very person whom i wanted to enlighten me  gloody showed himself at the door with a face ominously wretched as well as ugly i instantly thought of cristel  if you bring me bad news i said dont keep me waiting for it  its nothing that need trouble you sir im dismissed from my masters servicethats all  it was plainly not all relieved even by that guarded reply i pointed to a chair by the bedside  do you believe that i mean well by you i asked  i do sir with all my heart  then sit down gloody and make a clean breast of it  he lifted his enormous fist by way of emphasizing his answer  i was within a hairs breadth sir of striking him if i hadnt kept my temper i might have killed him  what did he do  flew into a furious rage i dont complain of that i daresay i deserved it please to excuse my getting up again i cant look you in the face and tell you of it he walked away to the window even a poor devil like me does sometimes feel it when he is insulted mr roylake he kicked me say no more about it sir i would never have mentioned it if i hadnt had something else to tell you only i dont know how in this difficulty he came back to my bedside look here sir what i say isthat kick has wiped out the debt of thanks i owe him yes i say the account between us two is settled now on both sides in two words sir if you mean to charge him before the magistrates with attempting your life ill take my bible oath he did attempt it and you may call me as your witness there now its out  what his master had no doubt inferred was what i saw plainly too cristel had saved my life and had been directed how to do it by the poor fellow who had suffered in my cause  we will wait a little before we talk of setting the law in force i said in the meantime gloody i want you to tell me what you would tell the magistrate if i called you as a witness  he considered a little the magistrate would put questions to mewouldnt he sir very good you put questions to me and ill answer them to the best of my ability  the investigation that followed was far too long and too wearisome to be related here if i give the substance of it i shall have done enough  sometimes when he was awake and supposed that he was alonesometimes when he was asleep and dreamingthe cur had betrayed himself it was a paltry vengeance i own to gratify a malicious pleasureas i did nowin thinking of him and speaking of him by the degrading name which his morbid humility had suggested but are the demands of a mans dignity always paid in the ready money of prompt submission anyway it appeared that gloody had heard enough in the sleeping moments and the solitary moments of his master to give him some idea of the jealous hatred with which the cur regarded me he had done his best to warn me without actually betraying the man who had rescued him from starvation or the workhouseand he had failed  but his resolution to do me good service in return for my kindness to him far from being shaken was confirmed by circumstances  when his master returned to the chemical studies which have been already mentioned gloody was employed as assistant to the extent of his limited capacity for making himself useful he had no reason to suppose that i was the object of any of the experiments until the day before the teaparty then he saw the dog enticed into the new cottage and apparently killed by the administration of poison of some sort after an interval a dose of another kind was poured down the poor creatures throat and he began to revive a lapse of a quarter of an hour followed the last dose was repeated and the dog soon sprang to his feet again as lively as ever gloody was thereupon told to set the animal free and was informed at the same time that he would be instantly dismissed if he mentioned to any living creature what he had just seen  by what process he arrived at the suspicion that my safety might be threatened by the experiment on the dog he was entirely unable to explain  it was borne in on my mind sir and thats all i can tell you he said i didnt dare speak to you about it you wouldnt have believed me or if you did believe me you might have sent for the police the one way of putting a stop to murdering mischief if murdering mischief it might be was to trust miss cristel that she was fond of youi dont mean any offence siri pretty well guessed that she was true as steel and not easily frightened i didnt need to guess i knew it  gloody had done his best to prepare cristel for the terrible confidence which he had determined to repose in her and had not succeeded what the poor girl must have suffered i could but too readily understand on recalling the startling changes in her look and manner when we met at the rivermargin of the wood she was pledged to secrecy under penalty of ruining the man who was trying to save me and to her presence of mind was trusted the whole responsibility of preserving my life what a situation for a girl of eighteen  we made it out between us sir in two ways gloody proceeded first and foremost she was to invite herself to tea and being at the table she was to watch my master whatever she saw him drink she was to insist on your drinking it too you heard me ask leave to make the tea  yes  well that was one of the signals agreed on between us when he sent me away we were certain of what he had it in his mind to do  and when you looked at miss cristel and she was too busy with her brooch to notice you was that another signal  it was sir when she handled her silver ornament she told me that i might depend on her to forget nothing and to be afraid of nothing  i remembered the quiet firmness in her face after the prayer that she had said in her own room her steady resolution no longer surprised me  did you wonder sir what possessed her gloody went on when she burst out singing that was a signal to me we wanted him out of our way while you were made to drink what he had drunk out of the jug  how did you know that he would not drink the whole contents of the jug  you forget sir that i had seen the dog revived by two doses given with a space of time between them  i ought to have remembered this after what he had already told me my intelligence brightened a little as i went on  and your accident in the next room was planned of course i said do you think he saw through it i should say no judging by his looks he turned pale when he felt the floor shaken by your fall for once in a way he was honesthonestly frightened  i noticed the same thing sir when he picked me up off the floor a man who can change his complexion at will is a man we havnt heard of yet mr roylake  i had been dressing for some time past longing to see cristel it is needless to say  is there anything more i asked that i ought to know  only one thing mr roylake that i can think of gloody replied im afraid its miss cristels turn next  what do you mean  while the deaf man lodges at the cottage he means mischief and his eye is on miss cristel early this morning sir i happened to be at the boathouse somebody i leave you to guess who it is has stolen the oars  i was dressed by this time and so eager to get to the cottage that i had already opened my door what i had just heard brought me back into the room as a matter of course we both suspected the same person of stealing the oars had we any proof to justify us  gloody at once acknowledged that we had no proof i happened to look at the boat he said and i missed the oars oh yes i searched the boathouse no oars no oars  and nothing more that you have forgotten and ought to tell me  nothing sir  i left gloody to wait my return being careful to place him under the protection of the upper servantswho would see that he was treated with respect by the household generally    chapter xv  the millers hospitality  on the way to tollers cottage my fears for cristel weighed heavily on my mind  that the man who had tried to poison me was capable of committing any other outrage provided he saw a prospect of escaping with impunity no sane person could hesitate to conclude but the cause of my alarm was not to be traced to this conviction it was a doubt that made me tremble  after what i had myself seen and what gloody had told me could i hope to match my penetration or the penetration of any person about me whom i could trust against the fathomless cunning the satanic wickedness of the villain who was still an inmate with cristel under her fathers roof  i have spoken of his fathomless cunning and his satanic wickedness the manner in which the crime had been prepared and carried out would justify stronger expressions still such was the deliberate opinion of the lawyer whom i privately consulted under circumstances still to be related  let us arrive at a just appreciation of the dangerous scoundrel whom we have to deal with this gentleman said his preliminary experiment with the dog his resolution to make suspicion an impossibility by drinking from the same tea which he had made ready for you his skilled preparation of an antidote the color of which might court appearances by imitating waterare there many poisoners clever enough to provide themselves beforehand with such a defence as this how are you to set the circumstances in their true light on your side you may say that you threw out the calculations on which he had relied for securing his own safety by drinking his second dose of the antidote while he was out of the room and you can appeal to the faintingfits from which you and he suffered on the same evening as a proof that the action of the poison was partially successful in your case and in his because you and he were insufficiently protected by half doses only of the antidote a bench of jesuits would understand these refinements a bench of british magistrates would look at each other and say where is the medical evidence no mr roylake we must wait you cant even turn him out of the cottage before he has had the customary notice to quit the one thing to take care ofin case some other suspicions of ours turn out to be well foundedis that our man shall not give us the slip one of my clerks and one of your gamekeepers shall keep watch on his lodgings turn and turn about till his time is up go where he may after that he shall not escape us   i may now take up the chain of events again  on reaching tollers cottage i was distressed but hardly surprised to hear that cristel exhausted after a wakeful night still kept her bed in the hope of getting some sleep i was so anxious to know if she was at rest that her father went upstairs to look at her  i followed himand saw ponto watching on the mat outside her door did this indicate a wise distrust of the cur a guardian i can trust sir the old man whispered while im at the mill  he looked into cristels room and permitted me to look over his shoulder my poor darling was peacefully asleep judging by the millers manner which was as cool and composed as usual i gathered that cristel had wisely kept him in ignorance of what had happened on the previous evening  the inquiry which i had next in my mind was forestalled by old toller  our deafdevil mr gerard has done a thing this morning which puzzles me he began and i should like to hear what you think of it for the first time since we have had him here he has opened his door to a visitor andwhat a surprise for youits the other devil with the hat and feather who got at my cristy and made her cry  that this meeting would be only too likely to happen in due course of time i had never doubted that it had happened now confirmed me in my resolution to keep guard over cristel at the cottage till the cur left it  i asked of course how those two enemies of mine had first seen each other  she was just going to knock at our door mr gerard when she happened to look up there he was airing himself at his window as usual do you think she was too much staggered at the sight of him to speak at any rate he got the start of her wait till i come down says heand there he was almost as soon as he said it they went into his place together and for best part of an hour they were in each others company every man has his failings i dont deny that im a little inquisitive by nature between ourselves i got under the open window and listened at a great disadvantage i neednt tell you for she was obliged to write what she had to say but he talked i was too late for the cream of it i only heard him wish her goodbye if your ladyship telegraphs this morning says he when will the man come to me now what do you say to that  more than i have time to say now mr toller can you find me a messenger to take a note to trimley deen  we have no messengers in this lonesome place sir  very well then i must take my own message you will see me again as soon as i can get back  mr tollers ready curiosity was roused in a moment  perhaps you wish to have a look at the repairs he suggested in his most insinuating manner  i wish to see what her ladyships telegram brings forth i said and mean to be here when the man arrives  my venerable tenant was delighted turn him inside out sir and get at his secrets ill help you  returning to trimley deen i ordered the ponychaise to be got ready and a small portmanteau to be packedspeaking in the hall the sound of my voice brought mrs roylake out of the morningroom she was followed by lady rachel if i could only have heard their private conference i should have seen the dangerous side of the curs character under a new aspect  gerard cried my stepmother what did i hear just now you cant be going back to germany  certainly not i answered  going to stay with some friends perhaps lady rachel suggested i wonder whether i know them  it was spitefully donebut in respect of tone and manner done to perfection  the ponychaise drew up at the door this was another of the rare occasions in my life on which i acted discreetly it was necessary for me to say something i said good morning  nothing had happened at the cottage during the interval of my absence clever as he was old toller had never suspected that i should return to him with luggage in the character of a selfinvited guest his jaw dropped and his wicked little eyes appealed to the sky merciful providence what have i done to deserve this there as i read him was the thought in the millers mind expressed in my best english  have you got a spare bed in the house i asked  mr toller forgot the respect due to the person who could stop the repairs at a moments notice he answered in the tone of a man who had been grossly insulted no  but for the anxieties that oppressed me i should have only perceived the humorous side of old tollers outbreak of temper he had chosen his time badly and he got a serious reply  understand this i said either you receive me civillyor you make up your mind to find a flourmill on some other property than mine  this had its effect the millers servility more than equalled his insolence with profuse apologies he offered me his own bedroom i preferred a large oldfashioned armchair which stood in a corner of the kitchen listening in a state of profound bewildermentlonging to put inquisitive questions and afraid to do sotoller silently appealed to my compassion i had nothing to conceal i mentioned my motive without intending it i had wounded him in one of his most tender places the place occupied by his good opinion of himself he said with sulky submission  much obliged mr gerard my girl is safe under my protection leave it to me sirleave it to me  i had just reminded old toller of his age and of the infirmities which age brings with it when his daughterpale and languid with signs of recent tears in her eyesentered the kitchen when i approached her she trembled and drew back apparently designing to leave the room her father stopped her mr gerard has something to tell you he said im off to the mill he took up his hat and left us  submitting sadly she let me take her in my arms and try to cheer her but when i alluded to what i owed to her admirable devotion and courage she entreated me to be silent dont bring it all back she cried shuddering at the remembrances which i had awakened father said you had something to tell me what is it  i repeated in language more gentle and more considerate what i had already said to her father she took my hand and kissed it gratefully you have your mothers face and your mothers heart she said you are always good you are never selfish but it mustnt be how can i let you suffer the discomfort of staying here indeed i am in no danger you are alarming yourself without a cause  how can you be sure of that i asked  she looked reluctantly at the door of communication  must i speak of him  only to tell me i pleaded whether you have seen him since last night  she had both seen him and heard from him on reaching home he opened that door she told me and threw on the floor one of the leaves out of his book after doing that he relieved me from the sight of him  show me the leaf cristel  father has got it i thought he was asleep in the armchair he snatched it out of my hand it isnt worth reading  she turned pale nevertheless when she replied in those terms i could see that i was disturbing her when i asked if she remembered what the cur had written but our position was far too serious to be trifled with i suppose he threatened you i said trying to lead her on what did he say  he said if any attempt was made to remove me out of his reach after what had happened that evening my father would find him on the watch day and night and would regret it to the end of his life the wretch thinks me cruel enough to have told my father of the horrors we went through you know that he has dismissed his poor old servant was i wrong in advising gloody to go to you  you were quite right he is at my houseand i should like to keep him at trimley deen but i am afraid he and the other servants might not get on well together  will you let him come here  she spoke earnestly reminding me that i had thought it wrong to leave her father at his age without someone to help him  if an accident separated me from him she went on he would be left alone in this wretched place  what accident are you thinking of i asked is there something going on cristel that i dont know of  had i startled her or had i offended her  can we tell what may or may not happen to us in the time to come she asked abruptly i dont like to think of my father being left without a creature to take care of him gloody is so good and so true and they always get on well together if you have nothing better in view for him  my dear i have nothing half so good in view and gloody i am sure will think so too i privately resolved to insure a favorable reception for the poor fellow by making him the millers partner bank notes in tollers pocket what a place reserved for gloody in tollers estimation  but i confess that cristels allusion to a possible accident rather oppressed my mind situated as we were at that time what we talked of next has slipped from my memory i only recollect that she made an excuse to go back to her room and that nothing i could say or do availed to restore her customary cheerfulness  as the twilight was beginning to fade we heard the sound of a carriage the new man had arrived in a fly from the station before bedtime he made his appearance in the kitchen to receive the domestic instructions of which a stranger stood in need a quiet man and a civil man even my prejudiced examination could discover nothing in him that looked suspicious i saw a welltrained servantand i saw nothing more  old toller made a last attempt to persuade me that it was not worth a gentlemans while to accept his hospitality and found me immovable i was equally obstinate when cristel asked leave to make up a bed for me in the countinghouse at the mill  with the purpose that i had in view if i accepted her proposal i might as well have been at trimley deen  left alone i placed the armchair and another chair for my feet across the door of communication that done i examined a little door behind the stairs used i believe for domestic purposes which opened on a narrow pathway running along the riverside of the house it was properly locked i have only to add that nothing happened during the night  the next day showed no alteration for the better in cristel she made an excuse when i proposed to take her out with me for a walk her fathers business kept him away from the cottage and thus gave me many opportunities of speaking to her in private i was so uneasy or so recklessi hardly know whichthat i no longer left it to be merely inferred that i had resolved to propose marriage to her  my sweet girl you are so wretched and so unlike yourself in this place that i entreat you to leave it come with me to london and let me make you safe and happy as my wife  oh mr roylake  why do you call me mr roylake have i done anything to offend you there seems to be some estrangement between us do you believe that i love you  i wish i could doubt it she answered  why  you know why  cristel have i made some dreadful mistake the truth i want the truth do you love me  a low cry of misery burst from her was she mastered by love or by despair she threw herself on my breast i kissed her she murmured oh dont tempt me dont tempt me again and again i kissed her ah i broke out in the ecstasy of my sense of relief i know that you love me now  yes she said simply and sadly i do love you  my selfish passion asked for more even than this  prove it by being my wife i answered  she put me back from her firmly and gently  i will prove it gerard by not letting you disgrace yourself  with those horrible wordsput into her mouth beyond all doubt by the woman who had interfered between usshe left me the long hours of the day passed i saw her no more  people who are unable to imagine what i suffered are not the people to whom i now address myself after all the years that have passedafter age and contact with the world have hardened meit is still a trial to my selfcontrol to look back to that day events i can remember with composure to events therefore let me return  no communication of any sort reached us from the cur towards evening i saw him pacing up and down on the road before the cottage and speaking to his new servant the man listening attentively had the masters book of leaves in his hand and wrote in it from time to time as replies were wanted from him he was probably receiving instructions the curs discretion was a bad sign i should have felt more at ease if he had tried to annoy cristel or to insult me  towards bedtime old tollers sense of hospitality exhibited marked improvement he was honored and happy to have me under his poor roofa roof by the way which was also in need of repairsbut he protested against my encountering the needless hardship of sleeping in a chair when a bed could be set up for me in the countinghouse not what youre used to mr gerard empty barrels and samples of flour and accountbooks smelling strong of leather instead of velvet curtains and painted ceilings but better than a chair sirbetter than a chair  i was as obstinate as ever with thanks i insisted on the chair  feverish anxious oppressed in my breathingwith nerves unstrung as a doctor would have put iti disturbed the order of the household towards twelve oclock by interfering with old toller in the act of locking up the housedoor  let me get a breath of fresh air i said to him or there will be no sleep for me tonight  he opened the door with a resignation to circumstances so exemplary that it claimed some return i promised to be back in a quarter of an hour old toller stifled a yawn i call that truly considerate he saidand stifled another yawn dear old man  stepping into the road i first examined the curs part of the cottage not a sound was audible inside not a creature was visible outside the usual dim light was burning behind the window that looked out on the road nothing absolutely nothing that was suspicious could i either hear or see  i walked on by what we called the upper bank of the river leading from the village of kylam the night was cloudy and close now the moonlight reached the earth at intervals now again it was veiled in darkness the trees at this part of the wood so encroached on the bank of the stream as considerably to narrow and darken the path seeing a possibility of walking into the river if i went on much farther i turned back again in the more open direction of kylam and kept on briskly as i reckon for about five minutes more  i had just stopped to look at my watch when i saw something dark floating towards me urged by the slow current of the river as it came nearer i thought i recognized the millboat  it was one of the dark intervals when the moon was overcast i was sufficiently interested to follow the boat on the chance that a return of the moonlight might show me who could possibly be in it after no very long interval the yellow light for which i was waiting poured through the lifting clouds  the millboat beyond all doubtand nobody in it the empty inside of the boat was perfectly visible to me even if i had felt inclined to do so it would have been useless to jump into the water and swim to the boat there were no oars in it and therefore no means of taking it back to the mill the one thing i could do was to run to old toller and tell him that his boat was adrift  on my way to the cottage i thought i heard a sound like the shutting of a door i was probably mistaken in expectation of my return the door was secured by the latch only and the miller looking out of his bedroom window said dont forget to lock it sir the keys inside  i followed my instructions and ascended the stairs surprised to hear me in that part of the house he came out on the landing in his nightgown  what is it he asked  nothing very serious i said the boats adrift i suppose it will run on shore somewhere  it will do that mr gerard everybody along the river knows the boat he held up his lean trembling hand old fingers dont always tie fast knots  he went back into his bed it was opposite the window and the window being at the side of the old cottage looked out on the great open space above the river when the moonlight appeared it shone straight into his eyes i offered to pull down the blind  thank you kindly sir please to let it be i wake often in the night and i like to see the heavens when i open my eyes  something touched me behind it was the dog like his noble and beautiful race ponto knew his friends he licked my hand and then he walked out through the bedroom door instead of taking his usual place on the mat before cristels room he smelt for a moment under the doorwhined softlyand walked up and down the landing  whats the matter with the dog i asked  restless tonight said old toller dogs are restless sometimes lie down he called through the doorway  the dog obeyed but only for a moment he whined at the door againand then once more he walked up and down the landing  i went to the bedside the old man was just going to sleep i shook him by the shoulder  theres something wrong i said come out and look at ponto  he grumbledbut he came out better get the whip he said  before you do that i answered knock at your daughters door  and wake her he asked in amazement  i knocked at the door myself there was no reply i knocked again with the same result  open the door i said or i will do it myself  he obeyed me the room was empty and the bed had not been slept in  standing helpless on the threshold of the door i looked into the empty room hearing nothing but my heart thumping heavily seeing nothing but the bed with the clothes on it undisturbed  the sudden growling of the dog shook me back if i may say so into the possession of myself he was looking through the balusters that guarded the landing the head of a man appeared slowly ascending the stairs acting mechanically i held the dog back thinking mechanically i waited for the man the face of the new servant showed itself the dog frightened him he spoke in tones that trembled standing still on the stairs  my master has sent me sir  a voice below interrupted him come back i heard the cur say ill do it myself toller where is toller  the enraged dog barking furiously struggled to get away from me i dragged himthe good honest creature who was incapable of concealments and treacheriesinto his masters room in the moment before i closed the door again i saw toller down on his knees with his arms laid helplessly on the windowsill staring up at the sky as if he had gone mad there was no time for questions i drove poor ponto back into the room and shut the door  on the landing i found myself face to face with the cur  you he said  i lifted my hand the servant ran between us for gods sake control yourself sir we mean no harm its only to tell mr toller that his boat is missing  mr toller knows it already i said no honest man would touch your master if he could help it i warn him to go and i make him understand me by a sign i pointed down the stairs and turned my head to look at him  he was no longer before me his face hideously distorted by rage and terror showed itself at the door of cristels empty room he rushed out on me his voice rose to the detestable screech which i had heard once already  where have you hidden her give her back to meor you die he drew a pistol out of the breastpocket of his coat i seized the weapon by the barrel and snatched it away from him as the charge exploded harmlessly between us i struck him on the head with the buttend of the pistol he dropped on the landing  the door of tollers room opened behind me he stood speechless the report of the pistol had terrified him in the instant when i looked at the old man i saw through the window of his room a rocket soar into the sky from behind the promontory between us and kylam  some cry of surprise must i suppose have escaped me toller suddenly looked round towards the window just as the last fiery particles of the rocket were floating slowly downwards against the black clouds  i had barely time enough to see this before a trembling hand was laid on my shoulder from behind the servant white with terror pointed to his master  have you killed him the man said  the same question must have been in the mind of the dog he was quiet now doubtfully reluctantly he was smelling at the prostrate human creature i knelt down and put my hand on the wretchs heart ponto finding us both on a level together gave me the dogs kiss i returned the caress with my free hand the servant saw me with my attention divided in this way between the animal and the man  damn it sir he burst out indignantly isnt a christian of more importance than a dog  a christianbut i was in no humor to waste words are you strong enough to carry him to his own side of the house i asked  i wont touch him if hes dead  he is not dead take him away  all this time my mind was preoccupied by the extraordinary appearance of the rocket rising from the neighborhood of a lonely little village between midnight and one in the morning how i connected that mysterious signal with a possibility of tracing cristel it is useless to inquire that was the thought in me when i led my lost darlings father back to his room without stopping to explain myself i reminded him that the cottage was quiet again and told him to wait my return  in the kitchen i overtook the servant and his burden the door of communication by which they had entered was still open  lock that door i said  lock it yourself he answered ill have nothing to do with this business he passed through the doorway and along the passage and ascended his masters stairs  it struck me directly that the man had suggested a sure way of protecting toller during my absence the millers own door was already secured i took the key so as to be able to let myself in againthen passed through the door of communicationfastened itand put the key in my pocket the third door by which the cur entered his lodgings was of course at my disposal i had just closed it when i discovered that i had a companion ponto had followed me  i felt at once that the dogs superior powers of divination might be of use on such an errand as mine was we set out together for kylam  wildly hurriedwithout any fixed idea in my mindi ran to kylam for the greater part of the way it was now very dark on a sandy creek below the village i came in contact with something solid enough to hurt me for the moment it was the stranded boat  a smoker generally has matches about him helped by my little shortlived lights i examined the interior of the boat there was absolutely nothing in it but a strip of old tarpaulinused as i guessed to protect the boat or something that it carried in rainy weather  the village population had long since been in bed silence and darkness mercilessly defied me to discover anything for a while i waited encouraging the dog to circle round me and exercise his sense of smell any suspicious person or object he would have certainly discovered nothingnot even the fallen stick of the rocketrewarded our patience determined to leave nothing untried i groped rather than found my way to the village ale house and succeeded at last in rousing the landlord he hailed me from the window naturally enough in no friendly voice i called out my name within my own little limits it was the name of a celebrated person the landlord opened his door directly eager to answer my questions if he could do it nothing in the least out of the common way had happened at kylam no strangers had been seen in or near the place the stranded boat had not been discovered and the crashing flight of the rocket into the air had failed to disturb the soundlysleeping villagers  on my melancholy way back fatigue of bodyand far worse fatigue of mindforced me to take a few minutes rest  the dimlyflowing river was at my feet the river on which i had seen cristel again for the first time since we were children thus far the dreadful loss of her had been a calamity held away from me in some degree by events which had imperatively taken possession of my mind in the darkness and the stillness the misery of having lost her was free to crush me my head dropped on the neck of the dog nestling close at my side oh ponto i said to him shes gone nobody could see me nobody could despise mei burst out crying    chapter xvi  bribery and corruption  twice i looked into tollers room during the remainder of the night and found him sleeping when the sun rose i could endure the delay no longer i woke him  what is it he asked peevishly  you must be the last person who saw cristel i answered i want to know all that you can tell me  his anger completely mastered him he burst out with a furious reply  its you twoyou my landlord and him my lodgerwho have driven cristy away from her home she said she would go and she has gone get out of my place sir you ought to be ashamed to look at me  it was useless to reason with him and it was of vital importance to lose no time in instituting a search after the reception i had met with i took care to restore the key of the door leading into the new cottage before i left him it was his key and the poor distracted old man might charge me with taking away his property next  as i set forth on my way home i found the new manservant on the lookout  his first words showed that he was acting under orders he asked if i had found the young lady and he next informed me that his master had revived some hours since and bore no malice this outrageous assertion suddenly fired me with suspicion i believed that the cur had been acting a part when he threatened me with his pistol and that he was answerable for the disappearance of cristel my first impulse now was to get the help of a lawyer  the men at my stables were just stirring when i got home in ten minutes more i was driving to our town  the substance of the professional opinion which i received has been already stated in these pages  one among my answers to the many questions which my legal adviser put to me led him to a conclusion that made my heart ache he was of opinion that my brief absence while i was taking that fatal breath of air on the banks of the river had offered to cristel her opportunity of getting away without discovery her old father the lawyer said was no doubt in his bed and you yourself found nobody watching in the neighborhood of the cottage  employ me in some way i burst out i cant endure my life if im not helping to trace cristel  he was most kind i understand he said try what you can get those two ladies to tell youand you may help us materially  mrs roylake was nearest to me i appealed to her womanly sympathies and was answered by tears i made another attempt i said i was willing to believe that she meant well and that i should be sorry to offend her she got up and indignantly left the room  i went to lady rachel next  she was at home but the servant returned to me with an excuse her ladyship was particularly engaged i sent a message upstairs asking when i might hope to be received the servant was charged with the delivery of another excuse her ladyship would write after waiting at home for hours i was foolish enough to write on my side and how could i help it to express myself strongly the shesocialists reply is easy to remember dear mr roylake when you have recovered your temper you will hear from me again  even my stepmother gained by comparison with this  to rest and do nothing was to exercise a control over myself of which i was perfectly incapable i went back to the cottage having no hopeful prospect in any other quarter i persisted in believing that toller must have seen something or heard something that might either help me or suggest an idea to my legal adviser  on entering the kitchen i found the door of communication wide open and the new servant established in the large armchair  im waiting for my master sir  he had got over his fright and had recovered his temper the respectful side of him was turned to me again  your master is with mr toller  yes sir  what i felt amply justified the lawyer in having exacted a promise from me to keep carefully out of the curs presence you might knock him on the head again mr roylake and might hit a little too hard next time  but i had an idea of my own i said as if speaking to myself i would give a five pound note to know what is going on upstairs  i shall be glad to earn it sir the fellow said if i make a clean breast of what i know already and if i tell you tomorrow what i can find outwill it be worth the money  i began to feel degraded in my own estimation but i nodded to him for all that  i am the innocent cause sir of what happened last night he coolly resumed we kept a lookout on the road and saw you though you didnt see us but my master never suspected you for reasons which he kept to himself of making use of the boat i reminded him that one of us had better have an eye on the slip of pathway between the cottage and the river this led to his sending me to the boathouseand you know what happened afterwards my master as i suppose is pumping mr toller thats all sir for tonight when may i have the honor of expecting you tomorrow morning  i appointed an hour and left the place  as i entered the wood again i found a man on the watch he touched his hat and said im the clerk sir your gamekeeper is wanted for his own duties tonight he will relieve me in the morning  i went home with my mind in a ferment of doubt if i could believe the servant the cur was as innocent of the abduction of cristel as i was but could i trust the servant  the events of the next morning altered the whole complexion of affairs fatally for the worse  arriving at the cottage i found a man prostate on the road dead drunkand the curs servant looking at him  may i ask something the man said have you been having my master watched  yes  bad news in that case sir your man there is a drunken vagabond and my master has gone to london by the first train  when i had recovered the shock i denied for the sake of my own credit that the brute on the road could be a servant of mine  why not sir  do you think i should have been kept in ignorance of it if my gamekeeper had been a drunkard his fellow servants would have warned me  the man smiled im afraid sir you dont know much about servants its a point of honor among us never to tell tales of each other to our masters  i began to wish that i had never left germany the one course to take now was to tell the lawyer what had happened i turned away to get back and drive at once to the town the servant remembered what i had forgottenthe five pound note  wait and hear my report sir he suggested  the report informed me first that mr toller was at the mill and had been there for some time past secondly that the cur had been alone for a while on mr tollers side of the cottage in mr toilers absencefor what purpose his servant had not discovered thirdly that the cur had returned to his room in a hurry and had packed a few things in his travellingbag fourthly that he had ordered the servant to follow with his luggage in a fly which he would send from the railway station and to wait at the london terminus for further orders fifthly and lastly that it was impossible to say whether the drunkenness of the gamekeeper was due to his own habits or to temptation privately offered by the very person whose movements he had been appointed to watch  i paid the money the man pocketed it and paid me a compliment in return i wish i was your servant sir    chapter xvii  utter failure  my lawyer took a serious view of the disaster that had overtaken us he would trust nobody but his head clerk to act in my interests after the servant had been followed to the london terminus and when it became a question of matching ourselves against the deadly cunning of the man who had escaped us  provided with money and with a letter to the police authorities in london the head clerk went to the station i accompanied him to point out the servant without being allowed to show myself and then returned to wait for telegraphic information at the lawyers office  this was the first report transmitted by the telegram  the cur had been found waiting for his servant at the terminus and the two had been easily followed to the railway hotel close by the clerk had sent his letter of introduction to the policehad consulted with picked men who joined him at the hotelhad given the necessary instructionsand would return to us by the last train in the evening  in two days the second telegram arrived  our man had been traced to the thames yacht club in albemarle streethad consulted a yachting list in the halland had then travelled to the isle of wight there he had made inquiries at the squadron yacht club and the victoria yacht cluband had returned to london and the railway hotel  the third telegram announced the utter destruction of all our hopes as far as marseilles the cur had been followed successfully and in that city the detective officers had lost sight of him  my legal adviser insisted on having the men sent to him to explain themselves nothing came of it but one more repetition of an old discovery when the detective police force encounters intelligence instead of stupidity in seven cases out of ten the detective police force is beaten  there were still two persons at our disposal lady rachel might help us as i believed if she chose to do it as for old toller i suggested on reflection that the lawyer should examine him the lawyer declined to waste any more of my money i called again on lady rachel this time i was let in i found the noble lady smoking a cigarette and reading a french novel  this is going to be a disagreeable interview she said let us get it over mr roylake as soon as possible tell me what you wantand speak as freely as if you were in the company of a man  i obeyed her to the letter and i got these replies  yes i did have a talk in your best interests with miss toller she is as sensible as she is charming and as good as she is sensible we entirely agreed that the sacrifice must be on her side and that it was due to her own selfrespect to prevent a gentleman of your rank from ruining himself by marrying a millers daughter  the next reply was equally free from the smallest atom of sympathy on lady rachels part  you are quite rightyour deaf man was at his window when i went by we recognized each other and had a long talk if i remember correctly he said you knew of his reasons for concealing his name i gave my promise being a matter of perfect indifference to me to conceal it too one thing led to another and i discovered that you were his hated rival in the affections of miss toller i proved worthy of his confidence in me that is to say i told him that mrs roylake and i would be only too glad as representing your interests if he succeeded in winning the young lady i asked if he had any plans he said one of his plans had failed what it was and how it had failed he did not mention i asked if he could devise nothing else he said yes if i was not a poor man in my place you would have offered as i did to find the money if the plan was approved of he produced some manuscript story of an abduction of a lady which he had written to amuse himself the point of it was that the lover successfully carried away the lady by means of a boat while the furious fathers attention was absorbed in watching the high road it seemed to me to be a new idea if you think you can carry it out i said send your estimate of expenses to me and mrs roylake and we will subscribe we received the estimate but the plan has failed and the man is off i am quite certain myself that miss toller has done what she promised to do wherever she may be now she has sacrificed herself for your sake when you have got over it you will marry my sister i wish you good morning  between lady rachels hard insolence and mrs roylakes sentimental hypocrisy i was in such a state of irritation that i left trimley deen the next morning to find forgetfulness as i rashly supposed in the gay world of london  i had been trying my experiment for something like three weeks and was beginning to get heartily weary of it when i received a letter from the lawyer   dear siryour odd tenant old mr toller has died suddenly of rupture of a bloodvessel on the brain as the doctor thinks there is to be an inquest as i need hardly tell you what do you say to having the report of the proceedings largely copied in the newspapers if it catches his daughters eye important results may follow   to speculate in this way on the impulse which might take its rise in my poor girls griefto surprise her as it were at her fathers graverevolted me i directed the lawyer to take no steps whatever in the matter and to pay the poor old fellows funeral expenses on my account he had died intestate the law took care of his money until his daughter appeared and the mill being my property i gave to tollers surviving partnerour good gloody  and what did i do next i went away travelling one of the wretchedest men who ever carried his misery with him to foreign countries go where i might on the continent of europe the dreadful idea pursued me that cristel might be dead    chapter xviii  the mistress of trimley deen  three weary months had passed when a new idea was put into my head by an englishman whom i met at trieste he advised turning my back on europe and trying the effect of scenes of life that would be new to me i hired a vessel and sailed out of the civilized world when i next stood on terra firma my feet were on the lovely beach of one of the pacific islands  what i suffered i have not told yet and do not design to tell the bitterness of those days hid itself from view at the timeand shall keep its concealment still even if i could dwell on my sorrows with the eloquence of a practised writer some obstinate inner reluctance would persist in holding me dumb  more than a year had passed before i returned to trimley deen and alarmed my stepmother by looking like a foreign sailor  the irregular nature of my later travels had made it impossible to forward the few letters that had arrived for me they were neatly laid out on the library table  the second letter that i took up bore the postmark of genoa i opened it and discovered that the  no i cannot write of him by that mean name and his own name is still unknown to me let me call himand oh dont think that i am deceived againlet me call him the penitent  the letter had been addressed to me from his deathbed and had been written under dictation it contained an extraordinary enclosurea small torn fragment of paper with writing on it  read the poor morsel that i send to you first the letter began my time on earth is short you will save me explanations which may be too much for my strength  on one side of the fragment i found these words   cruise to the mediterranean for my wifes health if cristel isnt afraid of passing some months at sea  on the other side there was a fragment of conclusion   thoroughly understand all ready write word what night and what  loving brother stephen toller  i instantly remembered the millers rich brother thinking of him for the first time since he had been in my mind for a moment on the night of my meeting with cristel on the fourteenth page of this narrative tollers brother will be found briefly alluded to in a few lines  i returned eagerly to the letter thus it was continued   that bit of torn paper i found under the bed while i was secretly searching mr tollers room i had previously suspected you from my own examination of his face when he refused to humor my deafness by writing what i asked him to tell me i suspected mr toller next you will see in the fragment what i sawthat toller the brother had a yacht and was going to the mediterranean and that toller the miller had written asking him to favour cristels escape the rest cristel herself can tell you  i know you had me followed at marseilles i got tired of it and gave your men the slip at every port in the mediterranean i inquired for the yacht and heard nothing of her they must have changed their minds on board and gone somewhere else i refer you to cristel again  arrived at genoa on my way back to england i met with a skilled italian surgeon he declared that he could restore my hearingbut he warned me that i was in a weak state of health and he refused to answer for the result of the operation without hesitating for a moment i told him to operate i would have given fifty lives for one exquisite week of perfect hearing i have had three weeks of perfect hearing otherwise i have had a life of enjoyment before i die  it is useless to ask your pardon my conduct was too infamous for that will you remember the family taint developed by a deaf mans isolation among his fellowcreatures but i had some days when my mothers sweet nature tried to make itself felt in me and did not wholly fail i am going to my mother now her spirit has been with me ever since my hearing was restored her spirit said to me last night atone my son give the man whom you have wronged the woman whom he loves i had found out the uncles address in england which i now enclose at one of the yacht clubs i had intended to go to the house and welcome her on her return you must go instead of me you will see that lovely face when i am in my grave goodbye roylake the cold hand that touches us all sooner or later is very near to me be merciful to the next scoundrel you meet for the sake of the cur   i say there was good in that suffering man and i thank god i was not quite wrong about him after all arriving at mr stephen tollers country seat by the earliest train that would take me there i found a last trial of endurance in store for me cristel was away with her uncle visiting some friends  cristels aunt received me with kindness which i can never forget we have noticed lately that cristel was in depressed spirits no uncommon thing mrs stephen toller continued looking at me with a gentle smile since a parting which i know you must have felt deeply too no mr roylake she is not engaged to be marriedand she will never be married unless you forgive her ah you forgive her because you love her she thought of writing to tell you her motives when she visited her fathers grave on our return to england but i was unable to obtain your address perhaps i may speak for her now  i knew how lady rachels interference had appealed to cristels sense of duty and sense of selfrespect i had heard from her own lips that she distrusted herself if she allowed me to press her but she had successfully concealed from me the terror with which she regarded her rejected lover and the influence over her which her father had exercised always mindful of his own interests the miller knew that he would be the person blamed if he allowed his daughter to marry me they will say i did it with an eye to my soninlaws money and gentlefolks may ruin a man who lives by selling flour that was how he expressed himself in a letter to his brother  the whole of the correspondence was shown to me by mrs stephen toller  after alluding to his wealthy brothers desire that he should retire from business the miller continued as follows   what you are ready to do for me i want you to do for cristy she is in danger in more ways than one and i am obliged to get her away from my house as if i was a smuggler and my girl contraband goods i am a bad hand at writing so i leave cristy to tell you the particulars will you receive her brother stephen and take care of her and do it as soon as possible   mr stephen tollers cordial reply mentioned that his vessel was ready to sail and would pass the mouth of the loke on her southward voyage his brother caught at the idea thus suggested  i have alluded to giles tollers sly look to his lodger when i returned the manuscript of the confession the old mans unscrupulous curiosity had already applied a second key to the cupboard in the lodgers room there he had found the criminal stories mentioned in the journalincluding the story of abduction referred to by lady rachel this gave him the very idea which his lodger had already relied on for carrying cristel away by the river under the influence of course of a soporific drug while her father was keeping watch on the road the secreting of the oars with this purpose in view had failed as a measure of security the millers knowledge of the stream and his daughters ready courage had suggested the idea of letting the boat drift with cristel hidden in it two of the yachts crew hidden among the trees watched the progress of the boat until it rounded the promontory and struck the shore there the yachts boat was waiting the rocket was fired to reassure her father and cristel was rowed to the mouth of the river and safely received on board the yacht thus with his good brothers help the miller had made the river his guilty accomplice in the abduction of his own child  when i had read the correspondence we spoke again of cristel  to save time mrs stephen toller said i will write to my husband today by a mounted messenger he shall only tell cristel that you have come back to england and you shall arrange to meet her in our grounds when she returns i am a childless woman mr roylakeand i love her as i should have loved a daughter of my own where improvement in external matters only has seemed to be possible it has been my delight to improve her your stepmother and lady rachel will acknowledge even from their point of view that there is a mistress who is worthy of her position at trimley deen   when cristel returned the next day she found that her uncle had deserted her and suddenly discovered a man in the shrubbery what that man said and did and what the result of it was may be inferred if i relate a remarkable event mrs roylake has retired from the domestic superintendence of trimley deen
