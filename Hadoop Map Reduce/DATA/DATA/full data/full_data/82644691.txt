wyllard comes home          342       masters of the wheatlands  chapter i  sally creighton   the frost outside was bitter and the prairie which rolled back from landers in long undulations to the far horizon gleamed white beneath the moon but there was warmth and brightness in stukelys wooden barn the barn stood at one end of the little desolate settlement where the trail that came up from the railroad thirty miles away forked off into two wavy ribands melting into a waste of snow landers consisted then of five or six frame houses and stores a hotel of the same material several sod stables and a few birchlog barns and its inhabitants considered it one of the most promising places in western canada that however is the land of promise a promise which is in due time usually fulfilled and the men of landers were for the most part shrewdly practical optimists they made the most of a somewhat grim and frugal present and staked all they had to givethe few dollars they had brought in with them and their powers of enduring toilupon the roseate future  stukely had given them and their scattered neighbors who had driven there across several leagues of prairie a supper in his barn a big rusty stove brought in for the occasion stood in the center of the barn floor its pipe glowed in places a dull red and now and then stukely wondered uneasily whether it was charring a larger hole through the shingles of the roof on one side of the stove the floor had been cleared on the other benches empty barrels and tables were huddled together and such of the guests as were not dancing at the moment sat upon the various substitutes for chairs a keg of hard ontario cider had been provided for the refreshment of the guests and it was open to anybody to ladle up what he wanted with a tin dipper a haze of tobacco smoke drifted in thin blue wisps beneath the big nickeled lamps and in addition to the reek of it the place was filled with the smell of hot iron which an overdriven stove gives out and the subtle odors of old skin coats  the guests however were accustomed to an atmosphere of that kind and it did not trouble them for the most part they were lean spare straight of limb and bronzed by frost and snowblink for though scarcely half of them were canadian born the prairie as a rule swiftly sets its stamp upon the newcomer also there was something in the way they held themselves and put their feet down that suggested health and vigor and in the case of most of them a certain alertness and decision of character some were from english cities a few from those of canada and some from the bush of ontario but there was a similarity among them for which the cut and tightness of their store clothing did not altogether account they lived well though plainly and toiled out in the open unusually hard their eyes were steady their bronzed skin was clear and their laughter had a wholesome ring  a fieryhaired scot a highlander sat upon a barrelhead sawing at a fiddle and the shrill scream of it filled the barn to tone he did not aspire but he played with caledonian nerve and swing and kept the snapping time it was mad harsh music of the kind that sets the blood tingling causes the feet to move in rhythm though the exhilarating effect of it was rather spoiled by the efforts of the little french canadian who had another fiddle and struck clanging chords from the lower strings  in the cleared space they were dancing what was presumably a quadrille though it bore almost as great a resemblance to a scottish country dance or indeed to one of the measures of rural france which was however characteristic of the present country  the englishman has set no distinguishable impress upon the prairie it has absorbed him with his reserve and sturdy industry and apparently the canadian from the cities is also lost in it too for his is the leaven that works through the mass slowly and unobtrusively while the scot and the habitant of french extraction have given the life of it color and individuality extremes meet and fuse on the wide white levels of the west  an englishman however was the life of that dance and he was physically a larger man than most of the rest for as a rule the colonial born run to wiry hardness rather than to solidity of frame gregory hawtrey was tall and thick of shoulder though the rest of him was in fine modeling and he had a pleasant face of the english blueeyed type just then it was shining with boyish merriment and indeed an irresponsible gayety was a salient characteristic of the man one would have called him handsome though his mouth was a trifle slack and though a certain assurance in his manner just fell short of swagger he was the kind of man one likes at first sight but for all that not the kind his hardbitten neighbors would have chosen to stand by them through the strain of drought and frost in adverse seasons  as it happened the grim hardfaced sager who had come there from michigan was just then talking about him to stukely  kind of tone about that manguess he once had the goldleaf on him quite thick and it hasnt all worn off yet said sager seen more englishmen like him and some folks from noo york too when i took parties bass fishing way back yonder  he waved his hand vaguely as though to indicate the american republic and stukely agreed with him they were right as far as they went for hawtrey undoubtedly possessed a grace of manner which however somehow failed to reach distinction it was perhaps just a little too apparent and lacked the strengthening feature of restraint  i wonder remarked stukely reflectively what those kind of fellows done before they came out here  he had expressed a curiosity which is now and then to be met with on the prairie but sager the charitable grinned  oh he responded i guess quite a few done no more than make their folks on the other side tired of them and thats why they sent them out to you some of them get paid so much on condition that they dont come back again sayand he glanced toward the dancersdick creightons sally seems quite stuck on hawtrey by the way shes looking at him  stukely assented he was a somewhat primitive person as was sally creighton for that matter and he did not suppose that she would have been greatly offended had she overheard his observations  well he said ive thought that too if she wants him shell get him shes a smart girlsally  there were not many women presentperhaps one to every two of the men which was rather a large proportion in that country and their garments were not at all costly or beautiful the fabrics were for the most part the cheapest obtainable and the wearers had fashioned their gowns with their own fingers in the scanty interludes between washing and baking and mending their husbands or fathers clothes the faces of the women were a trifle sallow and had lost their freshness in the dry heat of the stove their hands were hard and reddened and in figure most of them were thin and spare one could have fancied that in a land where everybody toiled strenuously their burden was heavier than the mens one or two of the women clearly had been accustomed to a smoother life but there was nothing to suggest that they looked back to it with regret as a matter of fact they looked forward working for the future and there was patient courage in their smiling eyes  creightons sally who was then tripping through the measure on hawtreys arm was native born she was young and straightstraighter in outline than the women of the citieswith a suppleness which was less suggestive of the willow than a rather highlytempered spring she moved with a large vigor which barely fell short of grace her eyes snapped when she smiled at hawtrey and her hair which was of a ruddy brown had fiery gleams in it anyone would have called her comely and there were indeed no women in stukelys barn to compare with her in that respect a fact that she recognized  oh yes said sager reflectively shell get him sure if she sets her mind on it and theres no denying that they make a handsome pair ive nothing against hawtrey either a straight man a hustler and smart at handling a team still its kind of curious that while the mans never been stuck for the stamps like the rest of us hes made nothing very much of his homestead yet now theres bob and jake and jasper came in after he did with half the money and they thrash out four bushels of hard wheat for hawtreys three  stukely made a little gesture of concurrence for he dimly realized the significance of his companions speech it is results which count in that country where the one thing demanded is practical efficiency and the man of simple steadfast purpose usually goes the farthest hawtrey had graces which won him friends boldness of conception and the power of application but he had somehow failed to accomplish as much as his neighbors did after all there must be a good deal to be said for the man who raises four bushels of good wheat where his comrade with equal facilities raises three  in the meanwhile hawtrey was talking to sally and it was not astonishing that they talked of farming which is the standard topic on that strip of prairie  so youre not going to break that new piece this spring she asked  no answered hawtrey id want another team anyway and i cant raise the money its hard to get out here  plenty under the sod declared sally who was essentially practical thats where we get ours but you have to put the breaker in and turn it over youand she flashed a quick glance at himgot most of yours from england wont they send you any more  hawtreys eyes twinkled as he shook his head im afraid they wont he replied you see ive put the screw on them rather hard the last few years  how did you do that sally inquired told them you were thinking of coming home again  there was a certain wryness in the young mans smile for though hawtrey had cast no particular slur upon the familys credit he had signally failed to enhance it and he was quite aware that his english relatives did not greatly desire his presence in the old country  my dear he said you really shouldnt hit a fellow in the eye that way  as it happened he did not see the girls face just then or he might have noticed a momentary change in its expression gregory hawtrey was a little casual in speech but so far most of the young women upon whom he bestowed an epithet indicative of affection had attached no significance to it they had wisely decided that he did not mean anything  the scottish fiddlers voice broke in  can ye no watch the music noo its paddybash he cried  his french canadian comrade waved his fiddlebow protestingly  paddybashy vla la belle chose he exclaimed with ineffable contempt and broke in upon the ranting melody with a succession of harsh crashing chords  then began a contest as to which could drown the others instrument and the snapping time grew faster until the dancers gasped and men who wore long boots encouraged them with cries and stamped a staccato accompaniment upon the benches or on the floor it was savage rasping music but one player infused into it the ebullient nerve of france and the other was from the misty land where the fiddler learns the witchery of the clanging reel and the swing of the strathspey it is doubtless not high art but there is probably no music in the world that fires the blood like this and turns the sober dance to rhythmic riot perhaps too amid the prairie snow it gains something that gives it a closer compelling grip  hawtrey was breathless when it ceased and sallys eyes flashed with the effulgence of the northern night when her partner found her a restingplace upon an upturned barrel  no she declared i wont have any cider she turned and glanced at him imperiously youre not going for any more either  it was no doubt not the speech a welltrained english maiden would have made but though hawtrey smiled rather curiously it fell inoffensively from sallys lips though it is not always set down to their credit the brownfaced hardhanded men as a rule live very abstemiously in that country and as it happened hawtrey who certainly showed no sign of it had already consumed rather more cider than anybody else he made a little bow of submission and sally resumed their conversation where it had broken off  we could let you have our oxteam to do that breaking with she volunteered youve had sproatly living with you all winter why dont you make him stay and work out his keep  hawtrey laughed sally he said do you think anybody could make sproatly work  it would be hard the girl admitted and then looked up at him with a little glint in her eyes still id put a move on him if you sent him along to me  she was a capable young woman but hawtrey was dubious concerning her ability to accomplish such a task sproatly was an englishman of good education though his appearance seldom suggested it most of the summer he drove about the prairie in a wagon vending cheap oleographs and patent medicines and during the winter contrived to obtain free quarters from his bachelor acquaintances it is a hospitable country but there were men round landers who when they went away to work in faroff lumber camps as they sometimes did nailed up their doors and windows to prevent sproatly from getting in  does he never do anything sally added  no hawtrey assured her at least never when he can help it he had however started something shortly before i left him you see the house has needed cleaning the last month or two and we tossed up for who should do it it fell to sproatly who didnt seem quite pleased but he got as far as firing the chairs and tables out into the snow then he sat down for a smoke and he was looking at them through the window when i drove away  ah commented sally you want somebody to keep the house straight and look after you didnt you know any nice girls back there in the old country  she spoke naturally and there was nothing to show that the girls heart beat a little more rapidly than usual as she watched hawtrey his face however grew a trifle graver for she had touched upon a momentous question to such men as he living in spartan simplicity upon the prairie there are a good many of them welltrained wellconnected young englishmen and others like them from canadian cities they naturally look for some grace of culture or refinement in the woman they would marry and there are few women of the station to which they once belonged who could face the loneliness and unassisted drudgery that must be borne by the small wheatgrowers wife there were also reasons why this question had been troubling hawtrey in particular of late  oh yes of course i knew nice girls in england one or two he answered im not quite sure however that girls of that kind would find things even moderately comfortable here  a certain reflectiveness in his tone which seemed to indicate that he had already given the matter some consideration jarred upon sally moreover she had an ample share of the western farmers pride which firmly declines to believe that there is any land to compare with the one the plow is slowly wresting from the wide white levels of the prairie  we make out well enough she asserted with a snap in her eyes  hawtrey made an expressive gesture oh yes he admitted its in you all you want in order to beat the wilderness and turn it into a garden is an ax a span of oxen and a breaker plow you ought to be proud of your energy still you see our folks back yonder arent quite the same as you  sally partly understood him ah she replied they want more and perhaps theyre used to having more than we have but isnt that in one way their misfortune is it what folks want or what they can do that makes them of use to anybody else  there was a hard truth in her suggestion but hawtrey who seldom occupied himself with matters of that kind smiled  oh he said i dont know but after all it wouldnt be worth while for us to raise wheat here unless there were folks back east to eat it and if some of them only eat in the shape of dainty cakes that doesnt affect the question anyway there will be but another dance or two and i was wondering whether i could drive you home ive got wyllards ontario sleigh  sally glanced at him rather sharply she had halfexpected this offer and it is possible would have judiciously led him up to it if he had not made it now as she saw that he really wished to drive her home she was glad that she had not deliberately encouraged the invitation  yes she answered softly i think you could  then said hawtrey if youll wait ten minutes ill be back with the team     chapter ii  sally takes charge   the night was clear and bitterly cold when hawtrey and sally creighton drove away from stukelys barn winter had lingered unusually long that year and the prairie gleamed dimly white with the sledge trail cutting athwart it a smear of bluegray in the foreground it wasfor landers lay behind them with the snow among the stubble belts that engirdled itan empty wilderness that the mettlesome team swung across and during the first few minutes the cold struck through the horses with a sting like the thrust of steel a half moon coppery red with frost hung low above the snowcovered earth and there was no sound but the crunch beneath the runners and the beat of hoofs that rang dully through the silence like a roll of muffled drums  sleighs like the one that hawtrey drove are not common on the prairie where the farmer generally uses the humble bobsled when the snow lies unusually long it had been made for use in montreal and bought back east by a friend of hawtreys who was possessed of some means which is a somewhat unusual thing in the case of a western wheatgrower this man also had bought the teamthe fastest he could obtainand when the warmth came back to the horses hawtrey and the girl became conscious of the exhilaration of the swift and easy motion the sleigh was light and narrow and hawtrey who drew the thick drivingrobe higher about sally did not immediately draw the mittened hand he had used back again the girl did not resent the fact that it still rested behind her shoulder nor did hawtrey attach any particular significance to the fact he was a man who usually acted on impulse how far sally understood him did not appear but she came of folk who had waged a stubborn battle with the wilderness and there was a vein of grim tenacity in her  she was however conscious that there was something beneath her feet which forced her if she was to sit comfortably rather close against her companion and it seemed expedient to point it out  cant you move a little i cant get my feet fixed right she said  hawtrey looked down at her with a smile im afraid i cant unless i get right outside arent you happy there  it was the kind of speech he was in the habit of making but there was rather more color in the girls face than the stinging night air brought there and she glanced at the bottom of the sleigh  its a sack of some kind isnt it she asked  yes hawtrey answered its a couple of threebushel bags some special seed lorton sent to winnipeg for ormond brought them out from the railroad i promised id take them along to him  you should have told me its most a league round by lortons place sally returned with reproach in her voice  that wont take long with this team have you any great objections to another fifteen minutes drive with me  sally looked up at him and the moonlight was on her face which was unusually pretty in the radiance of the brilliant night  no she admitted i havent any  she spoke demurely but there was a perceptible something in her voice which might have warned the man had he been in the habit of taking warning from anything which however was not the case it was one of his weaknesses that he seldom thought about what he did until he was compelled to face the consequences and it was perhaps to his credit that he had after all done very little harm for there was hot blood in him  well he responded im not going to grumble about those extra three miles but you were asking what land i meant to break this spring what put that into your mind  our folks sally replied candidly they were talking about you  this again was significant but hawtrey did not notice it  ive no doubt they said i ought to tackle the new quarter section he suggested  yes assented sally why dont you do it last fall you thrashed out quite a big harvest  i certainly did there however didnt seem to be many dollars left over when id faced the bills  the girl made a little gesture of impatience oh bob and jake and jasper sowed on less backsetting she said and theyre buying new teams and plows cant you do what they do though i guess they dont go off for weeks to winnipeg  the man was silent he had an incentive for hard work about which she was ignorant and he had certainly done much but the long iron winter when there was nothing that could be done had proved too severe a test for him it was very dreary sitting alone evening after evening beside the stove and the company of the somnolent sproatly was not cheerful now and then his pleasureloving nature had revolted from the barrenness of his lot when stiff and cold he drove home from an odd visit to a neighbor and arriving in the dark found the stove had burned out and water had frozen hard inside the house these were things his neighbors patiently endured but hawtrey had fled for life and brightness to winnipeg  sally glanced up at him with a little nod you take hold with a good grip everybody allows that she observed the trouble is you let things go afterwards you dont stay with it  yes assented hawtrey i believe you have hit it sally thats very much whats the matter with me  then said the girl with quiet insistence wont you try  a faint flush crept into hawtreys face sally was less than halftaught and unacquainted with anything beyond the simple strenuous life of the prairie her greatest accomplishments consisted of some skill in bakery and the handling of halfbroken teams but she had once or twice given him what he recognized as excellent advice there was something incongruous in the situation but as usual he preferred to regard it whimsically  i suppose ill have to if you insist if ever im the grasping owner of the biggest farm in this district ill blame you he answered  sally said nothing further on that subject and some time later the sleigh went skimming down among the birches in a shallow ravine hawtrey pulled the horses up when they reached the bottom of the ravine and glanced up at a shapeless cluster of buildings that showed black amid the trees  lorton wont be back until tomorrow but i promised to pitch the bags into his granary he said if i hump them up the trail here it will save us driving round through the bluff  he got down and though the bags were heavy with sallys assistance he managed to hoist the first of them on to his shoulders then he staggered with it up the steep foottrail that climbed the slope he was more or less accustomed to carrying bags of grain between store and wagon but his mittened hands were numbed and his joints were stiff with cold sally noticed that he floundered rather wildly in another moment or two however he vanished into the gloom among the trees and she sat listening to the uneven crunch of his footsteps in the snow until there was a sudden crash of broken branches and a sound as of something falling heavily down a declivity then there was another crash and stillness again  sally gasped and clenched her mittened hands hard upon the reins as she remembered that lortons bytrail skirted the edge of a very steep bank but she lost neither her collectedness nor her nerve presence of mind in the face of an emergency is probably as much a question of experience as of temperament and like other women in that country she had seen men struck down by halftrained horses crushed by collapsing strawpiles and once or twice gashed by mower blades this was no doubt why she remembered that the impatient team would probably move on if she left the sleigh and therefore drove the horses to the first of the birches before she got down then she knotted the reins about a branch and called out sharply  no answer came out of the shadows and her heart beat unpleasantly fast as she plunged in among the trees keeping below the narrow trail that went slanting up the side of the declivity until she stopped with another gasp when she reached a spot where a ray of moonlight filtered down a limp figure in an old skin coat lay almost at her feet and she dropped on her knees beside it in the snow hawtreys face showed an unpleasant grayishwhite in the faint silvery light  gregory she cried hoarsely  the man opened his eyes and blinked at her in a halfdazed manner fell down he said think i felt my leg goand my sides stabbing me go for somebody  sally glanced round and noticed that the grain bag lay burst open not far away she fancied that he had clung to it after he lost his footing which explained why he had fallen so heavily but that was not a point of any consequence now there was nobody who could help her within two leagues of the spot and it was evident that she could not leave him there to freeze then she noticed that the trees grew rather farther apart just there and rising swiftly she ran back to bring the team the ascent was steep and she had to urge the horses with sharp cries and blows from her mittened hand among shadowy tree trunks and through snapping undergrowth before she reached the spot where hawtrey lay he looked up at her when at last the horses stood close beside him  you cant turn them here he told her faintly  sally was never sure how she managed it for the sleigh drove against the slender trunks and the fiery beasts terrified by the snapping of the undergrowth were almost unmanageable but at last they were facing the descent again and she stooped and twined her arms about the shoulders of hawtrey who now lay almost against the sleigh  its going to hurt gregory but i have got to get you in she warned him  then she gasped for hawtrey was a man of full stature and it was a heavy lift she could not raise him wholly and he cried out once when his injured leg trailed in the snow still with the most strenuous effort she had ever made she moved him a yard or so and then staggering fell with her side against the sleigh she felt faint with the pain of it but with another desperate lift she drew him into the sleigh and let him sink down gently upon the bag that still lay there his eyes had shut again and he said nothing now  it required only another moment or two to wrap the thick drivingrobe about him and after that with one hand still beneath his neck she glanced down it was clear that he was quite unconscious of her presence and stooping swiftly she kissed his gray face she settled herself in the drivingseat with only a blanket coat to shelter her from the cold and the horses went cautiously down the slope she did not urge them until they reached the level for the trail that wound up out of the ravine was difficult but when the wide white expanse once more stretched away before them she laid the biting whip across their backs  that was quite sufficient they were fiery animals and when they broke into a furious gallop the rush of night wind struck her tingling cheeks like a lash of wires all power of feeling went out of her hands her arms grew stiff and heavy and she was glad that the trail led smooth and straight to the horizon hawtrey who had moved a little lay helpless across her feet he did not answer when she spoke to him  the team went far at the gallop a fine mist of snow beat against the sleigh but the girl leaning forward a tense figure with nerveless hands clenched upon the reins saw nothing but the bluegray riband of trail that steadily unrolled itself before her at length a blurred mass which she knew to be a birch bluff grew out of the white waste and presently a cluster of darker smudges shot up into the shape of a loghouse sod stables and strawpile granary a minute or two later she pulled the team up with an effort and a man who flung the door of the house open came out into the moonlight he stopped and gazed at her in astonishment  miss creighton he said  dont stand there cried sally take the near horses head and lead them right up to the door  whats the matter the man asked stupidly  lead the team up ordered sally jump if you can  it was supposed that sproatly had never moved with much expedition in his life but that night he sprang towards the horses at a commanding wave of the girls hand he started when he saw his comrade lying in the bottom of the sleigh but sally disregarded his hurried questions  help me to get him out she said when he stopped the team keep his right leg as straight as you can i dont want to lift him we must slide him in  they did it somehow though the girl was breathless before their task was finished and the perspiration started from the man then sally turned to sproatly  get into the sleigh and dont spare the team she said drive over to watsons and bring him along you can tell him your partners broke his leg and some of his ribs start right now  sproatly did her bidding and when the door closed behind him she flung off her blanket coat and thrust plenty of wood into the stove she looked for some coffee in the cupboard and put on a kettle after which she sat down on the floor by hawtreys side he lay still with the thick drivingrobe beneath him and though the color was creeping back into his face his eyes were shut and he was apparently quite unconscious of her presence for the first time she was aware of a distressful faintness which as she had come suddenly out of the stinging frost into the little overheated room that reeked with tobacco smoke and a stale smell of cooking was not astonishing she mastered her dizziness however and presently seeing that hawtrey did not move glanced about her with some curiosity for it was the first time she had entered his house  the room was scantily furnished and though very few of the bachelor farmers in that country live luxuriously she fancied that sproatly who had evidently very rudimentary ideas on the subject of housecleaning had not brought back all the sundries he had thrown out into the snow it contained a table a carpenters bench and a couple of chairs there were still smears of dust upon the uncovered floor the birchlog walls had been rudely paneled halfway up but the halfseasoned boards had cracked with the heat and exuded streaks of resin to which the grime and dust had clung a pail which contained potato peelings stood amid a litter of old longboots and broken harness against one wall the floor was black and thick with grease all round the rusty stove a pile of unwashed dishes and cooking utensils stood upon the table and the lamp above her head had blackened the boarded ceiling  sally noticed it all with disgust and then seeing that hawtrey had opened his eyes she made a cup of coffee and persuaded him to drink it after that he smiled at her  thanks he said feebly wheres sproatly my side stabs me  sally raised one hand youre not to say a word she cautioned sproatlys gone for watson and hell soon fix you up now lie quite still and shut your eyes again  hawtrey obeyed her injunction to lie still but his eyes were not more than halfclosed and she could not resist the temptation to see what he would do if she went away she had half risen when he stretched out a hand and felt for her dress and she sank down again with a curious softness in her face then he let his eyes close altogether as if satisfied and by and by she gently laid her hand on his  he did not appear to notice it and though she did not know whether he was asleep or unconscious she sat beside him watching him with compassion in her eyes there was no sound but the snapping of the birch billets in the rusty stove she was anxious but not unduly so for she knew that men who live as the prairie farmers do usually more or less readily recover from such injuries as had befallen him it would not be very long before assistance arrived for it was understood that the man for whom she had sent sproatly had almost completed a medical course in an eastern city before he became a prairie farmer why he had suddenly changed his profession was a point he did not explain and as he had always shown himself willing to do what he could when any of his neighbors met with an accident nobody troubled him about the matter  by and by sproatly brought watson to the homestead and he was busy with hawtrey for some time then they got him to bed and watson came back to the room where sally was anxiously waiting  hawtreys idea about his injuries is more or less correct but well have no great trouble in pulling him round he said the one point thats worrying me is the looking after him one couldnt expect him to thrive upon slabs of burnt salt pork and sproatlys bread  ill do what i can said sproatly indignantly  you replied watson it would be criminal to leave you in charge of a sick man  sally quietly put on her blanket coat if you can stay a few hours ill be back soon after its light she said she turned to sproatly you can wash up those dishes on the table and get a brush and sweep this room out if its not quite neat tomorrow youll do it again  sproatly grinned as she went out a few moments later the girl drove away through the bitter frost     chapter iii  wyllard assents   sally who returned with her mother passed a fortnight at hawtreys homestead before watson decided that his patient could be entrusted to sproatlys care afterwards she went back twice a week to make sure that sproatly in whom she had no confidence was discharging his duties satisfactorily with baskets of dainties for the invalid she had driven over one afternoon when hawtrey whose bones were knitting well lay talking to another man in his little sleepingroom  there was no furniture in the room except the wooden bunk in which he lay and a deerhide lounge chair he had made the stovepipe from the kitchen led across part of one corner and then up again into the room beneath the roof above it had been one of sproatlys duties since the accident to rise and renew the fire soon after midnight and when sally arrived he was outside the house whipsawing birchlogs and splitting them an occupation he profoundly disliked  spring had come suddenly as it usually does on the prairie and the snow was melting fast under a brilliant sun the bright rays that streamed in through the window struck athwart the glimmering dust motes in the little bare room and fell pleasantly warm upon the man who sat in the deerhide chair he was a year or two older than hawtrey though he had scarcely reached thirty he was a man of average height and somewhat spare of figure his manner was tranquil and his lean bronzed face attractive he held a pipe in his hand and was looking at hawtrey with quiet contemplative eyes that were his most noticeable feature though it was difficult to say whether their color was gray or hazelbrown for they were singularly clear and there was something which suggested steadfastness in their unwavering gaze the man wore long boots trousers of old blue duck and a jacket of soft deerskin such as the blackfeet dress so expertly and there was nothing about him to suggest that he was a man of varied experience and of some importance in that country  harry wyllard was nativeborn in his young days he had assisted his father in the working of a little manitoban farm when the great grain province was still for the most part a wilderness a prosperous relative on the pacific slope had sent him to toronto university where after a session or two he had become involved in a difference of opinion with the authorities though the matter was never made quite clear it was generally believed that wyllard had quietly borne the blame of a comrades action for there was a vein of eccentric generosity in the lad in any case he left toronto and the relative who was largely interested in the fur business next sent him north to the behring sea the business was then a hazardous one for the skin buyers and pelagic sealers had trouble with the alaskan representatives of american trading companies upon whose preserves they poached as well as with the commanders of the gunboats sent up north to protect the seals  mens lives were staked against the value of a fur edicts were lightly contravened and now and then a schooner barely escaped into the smothering fog with skins looted on forbidden beaches it was a perilous life and a strenuous one for every white mans hand was against the traders there were rangers in fog and gale and the reefs that lay in the tideways of almost uncharted waters but wyllard made the most of his chance he kept the peace with jealous skippers who resented the presence of a man they might command as mate but whose views they were forced to listen to when he spoke as supercargo he won the goodwill of seabred indians and drove a good trade with them he not infrequently brought his boat loaded with reeking skins back first to the plunging schooner  he fell into trouble again when they were hanging off the eastern isles under double reefs watching for the russians seals a boats crew from another schooner had been cast ashore and as the men were in peril of falling into the russians hands wyllard led a reckless expedition to rescue them he succeeded in so far that the wrecked sailors were taken off the beach through a tumult of breaking surf but as the relief crews pulled seaward the fog shut down on them and one boat manned by three men never reached the schooners the vessels blew horns all night and crept along the smoking beach next day though the surf made landing impossible then a sudden gale drove them off the shore and as it was evident that their comrades must have perished they reluctantly sailed for other fishing grounds as one result of this wyllard broke with his prosperous relative when he went back to vancouver  after that he helped to strengthen railroad bridges among the mountains of british columbia he worked in logging camps and shoveled in the mines and as it happened met hawtrey who tempted by high wages had spent a winter in the mountain province wyllards father who had taken up virgin soil in assiniboia died soon after wyllard went back to him and a few months later the relative in vancouver also died somewhat to wyllards astonishment his kinsman bequeathed him a considerable property most of the proceeds of which he sank in acres of virgin prairie willow range was now one of the largest farms between winnipeg and the rockies  the legs getting along satisfactorily wyllard inquired at length  hawtrey who appeared unusually thoughtful admitted that it was  anyway its singularly unfortunate that im disabled just now he added theres the plowing to begin in a week or two and besides that i was thinking of getting married  wyllard was somewhat astonished at this announcement for one thing he was more or less acquainted with the state of his friends finances during the next moment or two he glanced meditatively through the open door into the adjoining room where sally creighton was busy beside the stove the sleeves of the girls light bodice were rolled up well above the elbow and she had pretty round arms which were just then partly immersed in dough  i dont think theres a nicer or more capable girl in this part of assiniboia he remarked  oh yes agreed hawtrey anybody would admit that still since you seem so sure of it why dont you marry her yourself  wyllard looked at his comrade curiously well he said there are several reasons that dont affect miss sally and only concern myself besides its highly improbable that shed have me before he looked up again he paused to light his pipe which had gone out since it evidently isnt sally have i met the lady he asked  you havent shes in england  its four years isnt it since you were over there  hawtrey lay silent a minute and then made a little confidential gesture  id better tell you all about the thing he said our folks were people of some little standing in the county in fact as they were far from rich they had just standing enough to embarrass them in most respects they were ultraconventional with oldfashioned ideas and though there was no open break im afraid i didnt get on with them quite as well as i should have done which is why i came out to canada they started me on the land decently and twice when wed harvested frost and horsesickness they sent along the draft i asked them for that is one reason why im not going to worry them though id very much like another now you see there are two girls as well as reggie whos reading for the bar  i dont think you have mentioned the lady yet  shes a connection of some friends of ours her mother so far as i understand it married beneath hera man her family didnt like the father and mother died and agatha who was brought up by the fathers relations was often at the grange a little oldfashioned halfruinous place a mile or two from where we live in the north of england the grange belongs to her mothers folks but i think there was still a feud between them and her fathers people who had her trained to earn her living we saw a good deal of each other and fell in love as boy and girl will well when i went back one winter after id been here two years agatha was at the grange again and we decided then that i was to bring her out as soon as i had a home to offer her  hawtrey broke off for a moment and there was a trace of embarrassment in his manner when he went on again perhaps i ought to have managed it sooner he added still things never seem to go quite as one would like with me and you can understand that a dainty delicate girl reared in comfort in england would find it rough out here  wyllard glanced round the bare room in which he sat and into the other which was also furnished in a remarkably primitive manner  yes he assented i can quite realize that  well said hawtrey its a thing that has been worrying me a good deal of late because as a matter of fact im not much farther forward than i was four years ago in the meanwhile agatha who has some talent for music was in a firstclass masters hands afterwards she gave lessons and got odd singing engagements a week ago i had a letter from her in which she said that her throat was giving out  he stopped again for a moment with trouble in his face and then fumbling under his pillow produced a letter which he carefully folded  were rather good friends he observed you can read that part of it  wyllard took the letter and a suggestion of quickening interest crept into his eyes as he read then he looked up at hawtrey  its a brave letterthe kind a brave girl would write he commented still its evident that shes anxious  for a moment or two there was silence which was broken only by sally clattering about the stove  dissimilar in character as they were the two men were firm friends and there had been a day when as they worked upon a dizzy railroad trestle hawtrey had held wyllard fast when a plank slipped away he had thought nothing of the matter but wyllard was one who remembered things of that kind  now said hawtrey after a long pause you see my trouble this place isnt fit for her and i couldnt even go across for some time yet but her fathers folks have died off and theres nothing to be expected from her mothers relatives any way she cant be left to face the blow alone its unthinkable well theres only one course open to me and thats to raise as much money on a mortgage as i can fit the place out with fixings brought from winnipeg and sow a double acreage with borrowed capital ill send for her as soon as i can get the house made a little more comfortable  wyllard sat silent a moment or two and then leaned forward in his chair  no he objected there are two other and wiser courses tell the girl what things are like here and just how you stand shed face it bravely theres no doubt of that  hawtrey looked at him sharply i believe she would but considering that you have never seen her i dont quite know why you should be sure of it  wyllard smiled the girl who wrote that letter wouldnt flinch  well said hawtrey you can mention the second course  ill let you have 1000 at bank interestwhich is less than any landbroker would charge youwithout a mortgage  again hawtrey showed a certain embarrassment no he replied im afraid it cant be done i had a kind of claim upon my people though it must be admitted that ive worked it off but i cant quite bring myself to borrow money from my friends  wyllard who saw that he meant it made a gesture of resignation then you must let the girl make the most of it but keep out of the hands of the mortgage man by the way i havent told you that ive decided to make a trip to the old country we had a bonanza crop last season and martial could run the range for a month or two after all my father was born yonder and i cant help feeling now and then that i should have made an effort to trace up that young englishmans relatives and tell them what became of him  the one you struck in british columbia you have mentioned him but so far as i remember you never gave me any particulars about the thing  wyllard seemed to hesitate which was not a habit of his  there is he said not much to tell i struck the lad sitting down played out upon a trail that led over a big divide it was clear that he couldnt get any further and there wasnt a settlement within a good many leagues of the spot we were up in the ranges prospecting then well we made camp and gave him supperhe couldnt eat very muchand afterwards he told me what brought him there it seemed to me he had always been weedy in the chest but he had been working waistdeep in an icy creek building a dam at a mine until his lungs had given out the mining boss was a hard case and had no mercy on him but the lad who had had a rough time in the mountain province stayed with it until he played out altogether  wyllards face hardened as he mentioned the mining boss and a curious little sparkle crept into his eyes but after a pause he proceeded quietly  we did what we could for the boy in fact it rather broke up the prospecting trip but he was too far gone he hung for a week or two and one of us brought a doctor out from the settlements but the day before we broke camp jake and i buried him  hawtrey made a sign of comprehension he was reasonably well acquainted with his comrades character and fancied he knew who had brought the doctor out he knew also that wyllard had been earning his living as a railroad navvy or chopper then and in view of the cost of provisions brought by packhorse into the remoter bush the reason why he had abandoned his prospecting trip after spending a week or two taking care of the sick lad was clear enough  you never learned his name hawtrey asked  i didnt answered wyllard i went back to the mine but several things suggested that the name upon the payroll wasnt his real one he began a broken message the night he died but the hemorrhage cut him off in the middle of it the wish that i should tell his people somehow was in his eyes  wyllard broke off for a moment with the deprecatory gesture which in connection with the story was very expressive  i have never done it but how could i all i know is that he was a delicately brought up young englishman and the only clew i have is a watch with a london makers name on it and a girls photograph ive a very curious notion that i shall meet that girl some day  hawtrey who made no comment lay still for a minute or two but his face suggested that he was considering something  harry he said presently i shall not be fit for a journey for quite a while yet and if i went over to england i couldnt get the plowing done and the crop in which if im going to be married is absolutely necessary  there was no doubt about the truth of the statement for the small western farmer has very seldom a balance in hand and for that matter is not infrequently in debt to the nearest storekeeper he must as a rule secure a harvest or abandon his holding since as soon as the crop is thrashed the bills pour in wyllard made a sign of assent  well hawtrey went on if youre going to england you could go as my deputy you could make agatha understand what things are like here and bring her out to me ill arrange for the wedding to be soon as she arrives  wyllard was not a conventional person but he pointed out several objections hawtrey overruled them however and eventually wyllard reluctantly assented  as it happens mrs hastings is going over too and if she comes back about the same time the thing might be managed he said i believe shes in winnipeg just now but ill write to her by the way have you a photograph of agatha  i havent hawtrey answered she gave me one but somehow it got mislaid on housecleaning thats rather an admission isnt it  it occurred to wyllard that it certainly was in fact it struck him as a very curious thing that hawtrey should have lost the picture which the girl with whom he was in love had given him he sat silent for a moment or two and then stood up  when i hear from mrs hastings ill drive around again candidly the thing has somewhat astonished me i always had a fancy it would be sally  hawtrey laughed sally he replied were firstrate friends but i never had the faintest notion of marrying her  wyllard went out to harness his team and he did not notice that sally who had approached the door with a tray in her hands a moment or two earlier drew back before him softly when he had crossed the room she set down the tray and with her cheeks burning leaned upon the table then feeling that she could not stay in the stoveheated room she went out and stood in the slushy snow one of her hands was tightly closed and all the color had vanished from her cheeks however she contrived to give hawtrey his supper by and by and soon afterwards drove away     chapter iv  a crisis   while wyllard made arrangements for his journey and sally creighton went very quietly about her work on the lonely prairie farm it happened one evening that miss winifred rawlinson sat uneasily expectant far back under the gallery of a concerthall in an english manufacturing town in her back seat miss rawlinson could not hear very well but it was the cheapest place she could obtain and economy was of some little importance to her besides by craning her neck a little to avoid the hat of the strikingly dressed young woman in front of her she could at least see the stage the programme which she held in one hand announced that miss agatha ismay would sing a certain aria from a great composers oratorio miss rawlinson leaned further forward in her chair when a girl of about her own age which was twentyfour slowly advanced to the center of the stage  the girl on the stage was a tall wellmade brownhaired girl with a quiet grace of movement and a comely face she was attired in a long trailing dress of a shimmering cornstraw tint agatha ismay had sung at unimportant concerts with marked success but that evening there was something very like shrinking in her eyes  a crash of chords from the piano melted into a rippling prelude and winifred breathed easier when her friend began to sing the voice was sweet and excellently trained and there was a deep stillness of appreciation when the clear notes thrilled through the closelypacked hall no one could doubt that the first part of the aria was a success for halfsubdued applause broke out when the voice sank into silence and for a few moments the piano rippled on alone but it seemed to winifred that there was a look of tension in the singers face and she grew uneasy for she understood the cause for it  the last bit of the second parts rather trying remarked a young man behind her theres an awkward jump at two full tones that was too much for our soprano when we tried it at the choral union miss ismays voice is very true in intonation but i dont suppose most of the audience would notice it if she shirked a little and left that high sharp out  winifred had little knowledge of music but she was sufficiently acquainted with her friends character to be certain that agatha would not attempt to leave out the sharp in question this was one reason why she sat rigidly still when the clear voice rang out again it rose from note to note full and even but she could see the singers face and there was no doubt whatever that agatha was making a strenuous effort nobody else however seemed to notice it for winifred flung a swift glance around and then fixed her eyes upon the dominant figure in the cornstraw dress the sweet voice was still rising and the interested listener hoped that the accompanist would force the tone to cover it a little and put on the loud pedal the pianist however was gazing at his music and played on until with startling suddenness the climax came  the voice sank a full tone rose and hoarsely trailed off into silence again then the accompanist glanced over his shoulder and struck a ringing chord while he waited for a sign there was a curious stirring in the audience the girl in the shimmering dress stood quite still for a moment with a spot of crimson in her cheek and a halfdazed look in her eyes then turning swiftly she moved off the stage  winifred rose with a gasp and turned upon the young man next her who looked up inquiringly  yes she said sharply cant you let me pass im going out  it was about halfpast nine when she reached the wet street a fine rain drove into her face and she had rather more than a mile to walk without an escort but that was a matter which caused her no concern she was a selfreliant young woman and accustomed to going about unattended she was quite aware that the scene she had just witnessed would bring about a crisis in her own and her friends affairs for all that she was unpleasantly conscious of the leak in one shabby boot when she stepped down from the sidewalk to cross the street and when she opened her umbrella beneath a gas lamp she pursed up her mouth there were holes in the umbrella near where the ribs ran into the ferrule she had not noticed them before she however resolutely plodded on through the drizzle until three young fellows who came with linked arms down the pavement of a quieter street barred her way one wore his hat on one side the one nearest the curb flourished a little cane and the third smiled at her fatuously  oh my he jeered wheres dear jemima off to in such a hurry  winifred drew herself up she was little and determined and it must be admitted not quite unaccustomed to that kind of thing  will you let me pass she asked angrily theres a policeman at the next turning  there really is said one of the youths the dook has another engagement dream of me olivia  a beat of heavy feet drew nearer and the three roysterers disappeared in the direction of a flaming musichall where the second house was probably beginning winifred who had stepped into the gutter to avoid the roysterer with the cane turned as a stalwart bluecoated figure moved towards her  thank you officer she said theyve gone  the policeman merely raised a hand as if in comprehension and plodded back to his post winifred went on until she let herself into a house in a quiet street and ascending to the second floor entered a simply furnished room which however contained a piano and a table on which a typewriter stood amid a litter of papers the girl took off her waterproof and sat down in a low chair beside the little fire she was not a handsome girl and it was evident that she did not trouble herself greatly about her attire her face was too thin and her figure too slight and spare but there was usually even when she was anxious as she certainly was that night a shrewdly whimsical twinkle in her eyes and though her lips were set her expression was compassionate  she was not the person to sit still very long and in a minute or two she rose to place a little kettle on the fire she took a few scones a coffeepot and a tin of condensed milk from a cupboard when she had spread them out upon a table she discovered that there was some of the condensed milk upon her fingers and it must be admitted that she sucked them they were little stubby fingers which somehow looked capable  it must have been four oclock when i had that bun and a cup of tea she remarked half aloud  she glanced at the table longingly for she occasionally found it necessary to place a certain check upon a healthy appetite the practice of such selfdenial is unfortunately not a very unusual thing in the case of many young women who work hard in the great cities  i must wait for agatha she said with a resolute shake of the head crossing the room toward the typewriter table she stopped to glance at a little framed photograph that stood upon the mantel it was a portrait of gregory hawtrey taken years before and she apostrophized it with quiet scorn  now youre wanted youre naturally away out yonder she declared accusingly youre like the rest of themdespicable  this seemed to relieve her feelings and she sat down before the typewriter which clicked and rattled for several minutes under her stubby fingers the clicking ceased with sudden abruptness and she prodded the carriage of the machine viciously with a hairpin as this appeared unavailing she used her forefinger and when at length it slid along the rod with a clash there was a smear of grimy oil upon her cheek and her nose the machine gave no further trouble and she endeavored to make up some of the time that she had spent at the concert it was necessary that it should be made up but she was conscious that she was putting off an evil moment  at last the door opened and agatha ismay wrapped in a long cloak came in she permitted winifred to take her wrap from her and then sank down into a chair there was a strained look in her eyes and her face was very weary  youre working late again she observed  winifred nodded its the men who loaf my dear she replied when you undertake the transcription of an authors scrawl at ninepence the thousand words you have to work hard especially when as it is in this case the things practically unreadable besides the woman in it makes me lose my temper if id had a man of the kind described to deal with id have thrashed him  she was talking at random partly to conceal her anxiety and partly with the charitable purpose of giving her companion time to approach the subject that must be mentioned but she rather overdid her effort to appear at ease agatha looked at her sharply  winny she said you know youve been there  winifred turned towards her quietly for she could face a crisis  yes she confessed i have but youre not going to talk about it until you have had supper dont move until i make the coffee  she was genuinely hungry but while she satisfied her own appetite she took care that her companion who did not seem inclined to eat made a simple meal then she put the plates into a cupboard and sat down facing agatha  well she said you have broken down exactly as that throat specialist said you would the first question is how long it will be before you can go on again  agatha laughed a little harsh laugh i didnt tell you everything at the time ive broken down for good she answered  there was a moment of tense silence and then agatha made a dejected gesture the specialist warned me that this might happen if i went on singing but what could i do i couldnt cancel my engagements without telling people why the physician said i must go to norway and give my throat and chest a rest  they looked at each other and there was in their eyes the halfbitter halfweary smile of those to whom the cure prescribed is ludicrously impossible it was winifred who spoke first  then she commented we have to face the situation and its not an encouraging one our joint earnings just keep us here in decencywe wont say comfortand theyre evidently to be subject to a big reduction it strikes me as a rather curious coincidence that a letter from that man in canada and one from your prosperous friends in the country arrived just before you went out  she saw the look in agathas eyes and spread her hands out  yes she admitted i hid them it seemed to me that you had quite enough upon your mind this evening i dont know whether the letters are likely to throw any fresh light upon the question what were going to do  she produced the letters from a drawer in her table and agatha straightened herself suddenly in her chair when she had opened the first of them  oh she cried he wants me to go out to him  winifreds face set hard for a moment but it relaxed again and she contrived to hide her dismay  then she suggested i suppose youll certainly go after all hes probably not worse to live with than most of them  miss rawlinson was occasionally a little bitter but like others of her kind she had been compelled to compete in an overcrowded market with harddriven men she was however sincerely attached to her friend and she smiled when she saw the flash in agathas eyes  oh she added you neednt try to wither me with your indignation no doubt hes precisely what he ought to be and i dare say it will ease your feelings if you talk about him again at least it will help you to formulate your reasons for going out to him ill listen patiently and try not to be uncharitable  agatha fell in with the suggestion it was a relief to talk and she had a certain respect which she would not always admit for her friends shrewdness she meant to go but she desired to ascertain how a less interested person would regard the course that she had decided on  i have known gregory since i was a girl she said  winifred pursed up her lips i understood you met him at the grange and you were only there for a few weeks once a year she replied after all that isnt a very great deal it seems he fell in love with you which is perhaps comprehensible what i dont quite know the reason for is why you fell in love with him  ah responded agatha you have never seen gregory  i havent admitted winifred sourly i have however seen his picture one must admit that hes reasonably goodlooking in fact ive seen quite an assortment of photographs but its perhaps significant that the last was taken some years ago  agatha smiled can a photograph show the clean sanguine temperament of a man his impulsive generosity and cheerful optimism  miss rawlinson rose and critically surveyed the photograph on the mantel  i dont want to be discouraging but after studying that one im compelled to admit that it cant no doubt its the artists fault but im willing to admit that a young girl would be rather apt to credit a man with a face like that with qualities he didnt possess she sat down again with a thoughtful expression the fact is you set him up on a pedestal and burned incense to him when you were not old enough to know any better and when he came home for a few weeks four years ago you promised to marry him now it seems hes ready at last and wants you to go out to the new country perhaps it doesnt affect the question but if id promised to marry a man in canada hed certainly have to come for me isnt there a certain risk in the thing  a risk  winifred nodded yes she said rather a serious one four years is a long time and the man may have changed in a new country where life is so different it must be a thing theyre rather apt to do  a faint halfcompassionate halftolerant smile crept into agathas eyes the mere idea that the sunnytempered brilliant young man to whom she had given her heart could have changed or degenerated in any way seemed absurd to her winifred however went on again  theres another point she said if hes still the same which isnt likely there has certainly been a change in you you have learned to see things more clearly and have acquired a different standard from the one you had then one cant help growing and as one grows one looks for more one is no longer pleased with the same things its inevitable  she broke off for a moment and her voice became gentler  well she added ive done my duty in trying to point this out to you and now theres only another thing to say since youre clearly bent on going im going with you  agatha looked astonished but there was a suggestion of relief in her expression for the two had been firm friends and had faced a good deal together  oh she exclaimed that gets over the one difficulty  winifred made a little whimsical gesture  im not quite sure that it does the difficulty will probably be when i arrive in canada but im a rather capable person and i believe they dont pay ninepence a thousand words in winnipeg besides i could keep the books at a store or a hotel and at the very worst gregory could perhaps find a husband for me women i hear are held in some estimation in that country perhaps theres a man out there who would treat decently even a little plain vixenishtempered person with a turnedup nose  crossing the room again she banged the cover down on the typewriter and then turned to agatha with a suggestion of haziness in her eyes  anyway im very tired of this country it would be intolerable when you went away  agatha stretched out a hand and drew the girl down beside her she no longer feared adverse fortune and loneliness and she was filled with a gentle compassion for she knew how hard a fight winifred had made and part at least of what she had borne  my dear she said we will go together  then she opened the second letter which she had forgotten while they talked  they want me to stay at the grange for a few weeks she announced and smiled an hour ago i felt crushed and beatenand now though my voice has probably gone for good i dont seem to mind isnt it curious that both these letters should have come to sweep my troubles away tonight  no answered winifred its distinctly naturaljust what one would have expected you wrote to the man in canada soon after youd seen the specialist and his answer was bound to arrive in the next few days  but i certainly didnt write the folks at the grange  winifreds eyes twinkled as it happens i did two days ago i ventured to point out their duty to them and they were rather nice about it in another letter  with a little sigh of contentment agatha stretched herself out in the low chair well she said it probably wouldnt have the least effect if i scolded you i believe im horribly worn out winny and it will be a relief unspeakable to get away if i can arrange to give up those pupils ill go tomorrow  winifred made no answer kneeling with one elbow resting on the arm of agathas chair she gazed straight in front of her both of the girls were very weary of the long grim struggle and now a change was close at hand     chapter v  the old country   it was a still clear evening of spring when wyllard unstrapping the rücksack from his shoulders sat down beside a frothing stream in a dale of northern england on his arrival in london a week or two earlier he had found awaiting him a letter from mrs hastings who was then in paris in which she said that she could not at the moment say when she would go home again but that she expected to advise him shortly  after answering the letter wyllard started north and obtaining agathas address from miss rawlinson went on again to a certain little town which encircled by towering fells stands beside a lake in the north country he had already recognized that his mission was rather a delicate one and he decided that it would be advisable to wait until he heard from mrs hastings before calling upon miss ismay there remained the question what to do with the next few days a conversation with several pedestrian tourists whom he met at his hotel and a glance at a map of the hilltracks decided him remembering that he had on several occasions kept the trail in canada for close on forty miles he bought a swiss pattern rücksack and set out on foot through the fells  incidentally he saw scenery that gave him a new conception of the old country he astonished his new friends the tourists who volunteered to show him the way over what they considered a difficult pass to their great astonishment the brownfaced stranger who wore ordinary tightfitting american attire and rather pointed american shoes went up the mountainside apparently without an effort and for the credit of the clubs to which they belonged it was incumbent on them to keep pace with him they did not know that he had carried bags of flour and mining tools over very much higher passes close up to the limit of eternal snow but they did know that he set them a difficult pace and after two days climbing they were relieved to part company with him  a professional guide who overtook them recognized the capabilities of the man when he noticed the way in which he lifted his feet and how he set them down this the guide decided was a man accustomed to walking among the heather but he was wrong for it was the trick the bushman learns when he plods through leagues of undergrowth and fallen branches or the tall grass of the swamps and it is a memorable experience to make a days journey with such a man for the first hour the thing seems easy as the pace is never forced but the speed never slackens and as the hours go by the novice who flounders and stumbles grows horribly weary of trying to keep up with the steady persistent swing  wyllard had traveled since morning along a ridge of fells when he sat down beside the water and contentedly filled his pipe on the one hand a wall of crags high above was growing black against the evening light and the stream clear as crystal came boiling down among great boulders but the young man had wandered through many a grander and more savage scene of rocky desolation and it impressed him less than the green valley in front of him he had never seen anything like that either on the pacific slope or in western canada  early as it was in the season the meadows between rock and water were green as emerald and the hedgerows just flushed with verdure were clipped and trimmed as if their owner loved them there was not a dead tree in the larch copse which dipped to the stream and all its feathery tassels were sprinkled with tiny flecks of crimson and wondrous green great oaks dotted the meadows each one perfect in symmetry it seemed that the men who held this land cared for single trees the sleek tame cattle that rubbed their necks on the level hedgetop and gazed at him ruminatively were very different from the wild longhorned creatures whose furious stampede he had now and then headed off riding hard while the roar of hoofs rang through the dustcloud that floated like a sea fog across the sunscorched prairie here in the quiet vale all was peace and tranquillity  wyllard noticed the pale primroses that pushed their yellow flowers up among the withered leaves and he took account of the faint blue sheen beneath the beech trunks not far away there was a vein of artistic feeling in him and the elusive beauty of these things curiously appealed to him he had seen the riotous sensuous blaze of flowers kissed by pacific breezes and the burnished gold of wheat that rolled in milelong waves but it seemed to him that the wild things of the english north were after all more wonderful they harmonized with the countrys deep peacefulness their beauty was chaste fairylike and ethereal  by and by a wood pigeon cooed softly somewhere in the shadows and a brown thrush perched on a bare oak bough began to sing the broken repeated melody went curiously well with the rippling murmur of sliding water and wyllard though he could not remember ever having done anything of that sort before leaned back with a smile to listen his life had been a strenuous one passed for the most part in the drivingseat of great plows that rent their ample furrows through virgin prairie guiding the clinking binders through the wheat under a blazing sun or driving the plunging dories through the clammy fog over short slopping seas now however the tranquillity of the english valley stole in on him and he began to understand how the love of that welltrimmed land clung to the men out west who spoke of it tenderly as the old country  then for he was in an unusually susceptible mood he took from his pocket a little deerhide case artistically made by a blackfoot indian and removed from it the faded photograph of an english girl he had obtained the photograph from the lad who had died among the ranges of the pacific slope and it had been his companion in many a desolate camp and on many a weary journey the face was delicately modeled and there was a freshness in it which is seldom seen outside the old country but what pleased him most was the serenity in the clear innocent eyes  he was not in love with the picturehe would probably have smiled at the notionbut he had a curious feeling that he would meet the girl some day and that it would then be a privilege merely to speak to her this was after all not so extravagant a fancy as it might appear for romance the mother of chivalry and many graces still finds shelter in the hearts of men who dwell in the wide spaces of the newer lands shrewd and practical as these men are they see visions now and then and what is more with bleeding hands and toil incredible prove them to be realities  by and by wyllard put the photograph back into his pocket and filled his pipe again it was almost dark before he had smoked it out the thrush had gone and only the ripple of the water broke the silence until he heard footsteps on the stones behind him looking around he saw a young woman moving towards the river he watched her with a quiet interest for his perceptions were sharper than usual and it seemed to him that she was very much in harmony with what he thought of as the keytone of the place she was tall and shapely and she moved with grace when poised upon a shelf of rock as if considering the easiest way to the water she stopped for a moment her figure fell into reposeful lines but that was after all only what he had expected for he had halfconsciously studied the englishwomen whom he had met in the west  the western women usually moved and certainly spoke with an almost superfluous vivacity and alertness there was in them a feverish activity which contrasted with the english deliberation which had sometimes exasperated him now he felt that this slowness of movement was born of the tranquillity of the welltrimmed land and he realized that it would have troubled his sense of fitness if this girl had clattered down across the stones hurriedly and noisily  at first he could not see her face but when she went on a little further it became evident that she desired to cross the river and was regarding the row of stepping stones somewhat dubiously one or two had fallen over or had been washed away by a flood for there were several wide gaps between them through which the stream frothed whitely as soon as wyllard noticed her hesitation he rose and moved towards her  you want to get across he asked  she was still glancing at the water and although he was sure that she had not seen him or heard his approach she turned towards him quietly then a momentary sense of astonishment held him in an embarrassed scrutiny for it was her picture at which he had gazed scarcely half an hour before and he would have recognized the face anywhere  yes she answered it is rather a long way around by the bridge but some of the stones seem to have disappeared since i last came this way  she spoke as wyllard had expected softly and quietly because he was first of all a man of action wyllard forthwith waded into the river then he turned and held out his hand to her  it isnt a very long step you ought to manage it he said  the girl favored him with a swift glance of uncertainty at first she had supposed him to be one of the walking tourists or climbers who usually invaded the valleys at easter but they were for the most part young men from the cities and this strangers face was darkened by the sun there was also an indefinite suggestion of strength in the poise of his lean symmetrical figure which could only have come from strenuous labor in the open air she noticed that while the average englishman would have asked permission to help her or would have deprecated the offer this stranger did nothing of the kind he stood with the water frothing about his ankles holding out his hand  she had no hesitation about accepting wyllards aid and while he waded through the river she stepped lightly from stone to stone until she came to a wide gap where the stream was deep she stopped a moment gazing at the foaming water until the mans hand tightened on her fingers and she felt his other hand rest upon her waist  now he assured her i wont let you fall  she was on the other side of the gap in another moment wondering uneasily why she had obeyed the compelling pressure but glad to see that the strangers face was perfectly unmoved and that he was evidently quite unconscious of having done anything unusual she crossed without mishap when they stood on the shingle he dropped her hand  thank you she said im afraid you got rather wet  the man laughed and he had a pleasant laugh oh he replied im used to it there was a little silence and he asked isnt there a village with a hotel in it a mile or two from here  yes the girl answered this is the way the path goes up to the highroad through the larch wood  she turned into the path and though she had not expected him to accompany her the man walked beside her still she did not resent it his manner was deferential and she liked his face while there was after all no reason why he should stay behind when he was going the same way he walked beside her silently for several minutes as they went on through the gloom of the larches where a sweet resinous odor crept into the still evening air and then he looked up as they came to a towering pine  have you many of those trees over here he asked  a light dawned upon the girl for though he had spoken without a perceptible accent she had been slightly puzzled by something in his speech and appearance  i believe theyre not uncommon you are an american  wyllard laughed no he replied i was born in western canada but i think im as english as you are in some respects though i never quite realized it until tonight it isnt exactly because my father came from this country either  the girl was astonished at this answer and still more at the indefinite something in his manner which seemed to indicate that he expected her to understand as indeed she did her only dowry had been an expensive education and she remembered that the influence of the isle she lived in had in turn fastened on saxons norsemen normans and made them englishmen what was more so far as she had read those who had gone out south or westwards had carried that influence with them and under all their surface changes and sometimes their grievances against the motherland were in the great essentials wholly english still  but she remarked at random how can you be sure that im english  it was quite dark in among the trees but she fancied there was a smile in her companions eyes  oh he answered simply you couldnt be anything else  she accepted this as a compliment though she knew that it had not been his intention to flatter her his general attitude since she had met him scarcely suggested such a lack of good taste she was becoming mildly interested in the stranger but she possessed several essentially english characteristics and it did not appear advisable to encourage him too much she said nothing further and it was he who spoke first  i wonder he said if you knew a young lad who went out to canada a few years ago his name was pattinsonhenry pattinson  no the girl answered quickly i certainly did not but the name is not an uncommon one there are a good many pattinsons in the north  wyllard was not surprised by this answer he had reasons for believing that the name under which the lad he had befriended had enrolled himself was not the correct one it would of course have been easy to describe the boy but wyllard was shrewd and noticing that there was now a restraint in the girls manner he could not speak prematurely he was aware that most of the english are characterized by a certain reserve and apt to retire into their shells if pressed too hard he did not however mean to let this girl elude him altogether  it really doesnt matter he responded i shall no doubt get upon his trail in due time  they reached the highroad a minute or two later and the girl turned to him  thank you again she said if you go straight on you will come to the village in about a quarter of an hour  she turned away and left him standing with his soft hat in his hand he stood quite still for almost a minute after she had gone when he reached the inn its oldworld simplicity delighted him it was built with thick walls of slate and roofed with ponderous flags in canada where the frost was arctic they used thin cedar shingles the room in which his meal was spread was paneled with oak that had turned black with age great roughhewn beams of four times the size that anybody would have used for the purpose in the west supported the low ceiling there was a fire in the wide hearth and the ruddy gleam of burnished copper utensils pierced the shadows the room was large but there was only a single candle upon the table he liked the gloomy interior and he felt that a garish light would somehow be out of harmony  by and by his hostess appeared to clear the things away she was a little withered old woman with shrewd kindly eyes and a russet tinge in her cheeks  theres a good light and company in the sittingroom she said weve three young men staying with us theyve been up the pike  id sooner stay here if i may replied wyllard i dont quite know yet if ill go on tomorrow one can get through to langley dale by the hause as i think you call it  the wrinkled dame said that pedestrians often went that way  there are some prosperous folkspeople of stationliving round here wyllard asked casually  theres the vicar i dont know that hes what youd call prosperous then theres mr martindale of rushyholme and little of the ghyll  has any of them a daughter of about twentyfour years of age wyllard described the girl he had met to the best of his ability  it was evident that the landlady did not recognize the description but she thought a moment  no she answered theres nobody like that but i did hear that theyd a young lady staying at the vicarage  she changed the subject abruptly and wyllard once more decided that the english did not like questions  youre a stranger sir she inquired  i am said wyllard ive some business to attend to further on but i came along on foot to see the fells and im glad i did its a great and wonderful country youre living in that is he added gravely when you get outside the towns there are things in some of the cities that most make one ill  he stood up that trays too heavy for you wont you let me carry it  the landlady was plainly amazed at his words but she made it clear that she desired no assistance when she went out wyllard who sat down again took out the photograph he gazed at it steadfastly  theres rather more than mere prettiness there but i dont know that i want to keep it now he reflected its way behind the original she has grown since it was takenjust as one would expect that girl to grow  he lighted his pipe and smoked thoughtfully until he arrived at a decision  one cant force the running in this country they dont like it he said ill lie by a day or two and keep an eye on that vicarage  in the meanwhile his hostess was discussing him with a niece  im sure i dont know what that man is she informed the younger woman he has got the manners of a gentleman but he walks like a fell shepherd and his hands are like a navvys a mans hands now and then tell you a good deal about him besides of all things he wanted to carry his tray away said it was too heavy for me  oh replied her niece hes an american theres no accounting for them     chapter vi  her picture   wyllard stayed at the inn three days without seeing anything more of the girl whom he had met beside the stream although he diligently watched for her he had long felt it was his duty to communicate with the relatives of the lad that he had befriended and the fact that he had found the girls photograph in the young englishmans possession made it appear highly probable that she could assist him in tracing the family apart from this he could not quite analyze his motives for desiring to see more of the englishwoman though he was conscious of the desire her picture had been a companion to him in his wanderings and now and then he had found a certain solace in gazing at it now that he had seen her in the flesh he was willing to admit that he had never met any woman who had made such an impression on him  it was of course possible for him to call at the vicarage but though he meant to adopt that course as a last resort there were certain objections to it he did not know the girls name and there was nobody to say a word for him so far as his experience went the english were apt to be reticent and reserved to a stranger it seemed to him that although the girl might give him the information which he required their acquaintance probably would terminate then and there she would he decided be less likely to stand upon her guard if he could contrive to meet her casually without prearrangement  on the fourth day fortune favored him for he came upon her endeavoring to open a tottering gate where a stony hill track led off from the smooth white road as it happened he had received a letter from mrs hastings that morning fixing the date of her departure and it was necessary for him to discharge the duty with which hawtrey had saddled him as soon as possible the grange where he understood miss ismay was then staying lay thirty miles away across the fells and he had decided to start early on the morrow that being the case it was clear that he must make the most of this opportunity but he realized that it would be advisable to proceed circumspectly saying nothing he set his shoulder to the gate and lifting it on its decrepit hinges swung it open  thank you said the girl remembering that the words were the last that she had said to him she smiled as she added it is the second time you have appeared when i was in difficulties  in spite of his resolution to proceed cautiously a twinkle crept into wyllards eyes and suggested that the fact she had mentioned was not so much of a coincidence as it probably appeared she saw the look that told her what he was thinking and was about to pass on when he stopped her with a gesture  the fact is i have been looking out for you the last three days he confessed  he feared the girl had taken alarm at this candid statement and spread his hands out deprecatingly wont you hear me out he added theres a matter i must put before you but i wont keep you long  the girl was a little puzzled and naturally curious it struck her as strange that his admission should have aroused in her very little indignation but she felt that it would be unreasonable to suspect this man of anything that savored of impertinence his manner was reassuring and she liked his face  well she said inquiringly  wyllard waved his hand toward a big oak trunk that lay just inside the gate  if youll sit down ill get through as quick as i can he promised in the first place i am as i told you a canadian who has come over partly to see the country and partly to carry out one or two missions in regard to one of them i believe you can help me  the girls face expressed a natural astonishment  i could help you  wyllard nodded ill explain my reasons for believing it later on he said in the meanwhile i asked you a question the other night which ill now try to make more explicit were you ever acquainted with a young englishman who went to canada from this country several years ago he was about twenty then and had dark hair and dark eyes that of course isnt an unusual thing but there was a rather curious white mark on his left temple if he was ever a friend of yours that scar ought to fix it  oh cried the girl that must have been lance radcliffe i was with him when the scar was madeever so long ago we heard that he was dead but you said his name was pattinson  i did declared wyllard gravely still i wasnt quite sure about the name being right hes certainly dead i buried him  his companion made an abrupt movement and he saw the sudden softening of her eyes there was however only a gentle pity in her face and nothing in her manner suggested the deeper feeling that he had half expected  then she said i am sure that his father would like to meet you there was some trouble between themi dont know which was wrongand lance went out to canada and never wrote major radcliffe tried to trace him through a vancouver banker and only found that he had died in the hands of a stranger who had done all that was possible for him she turned to wyllard with a look which set his heart beating faster than usual you are that man  yes said wyllard simply i did what i could for him it didnt amount to very much he was too far gone  briefly he repeated the story that he had told to hawtrey and when he had finished her face was soft again for what he said had stirred her curiously  but she commented he had no claim on you  wyllard lifted one hand with a motion that disclaimed all right to commendation he was dying in the bush wasnt that enough  the girl made no answer for a moment or two she had earned her living for several years and she was to some extent acquainted with the grim realities of life she did not know that while there are hard men in canada the small farmers and ranchers of the westand perhaps above all the fearless free lances who build railroads and grapple with giant trees in the forests of the pacific slopeare as a rule distinguished by a splendid charity with them the sick or wornout stranger is seldom turned away watching the stranger covertly she understood that this man whom she had seen for the first time three days before had done exactly what she would have expected of him  i saw a great deal of lance radcliffewhen i was younger she said his people still live at garside scar close by dufton holme i presume you will call on them  wyllard said that he purposed doing so as he had a watch and one or two other mementos that they might like to have and she told him how to reach dufton holme by a roundabout railway journey  there is one point that rather puzzles me she said after she had made it plain how he was to find the radcliffe family how did you know that i could tell you anything about him  wyllard thrust his hand into his pocket and took out a little leather case  you are by no means a stranger to me he remarked as he handed her the photograph this is your picture i found it among the dead lads things  the girl who started visibly flashed a keen glance at him it was evident that he had not intended to produce any dramatic effect she flushed a little  i never knew he had it she asserted perhaps he got it from his sister she paused and then as if impelled to make the fact quite clear added i certainly never gave it to him  wyllard smiled gravely for he recognized that while she was clearly grieved to hear of young radcliffes death she could have had no particular tenderness for the unfortunate lad  well he said perhaps he took it in the first place for the mere beauty of it and it afterwards became a companionsomething that connected him with the old country it appealed in one of those ways to me  again she flashed a sharp glance at him but he went on unheeding  when i found it i meant to keep it merely as a clew and so that it could be given up to his relatives some day he added then i fell into the habit of looking at it in my lonely camp in the bush at night and when i sat beside the stove while the snow lay deep upon the prairie there was something in your eyes that seemed to encourage me  to encourage you  yes wyllard assented gravely i think that expresses it when i camped in the bush of the pacific slope we were either out on the gold trailand we generally came back ragged and unsuccessful after spending several months wages which we could badly spareor i was going from one wooden town to another without a dollar in my pocket and wondering how i was to obtain one when i got there for a time it wasnt much more cheerful on the prairie twice in succession the harvest failed perhaps lance radcliffe felt as i did  the girl cut him short why didnt you mention the photograph at once  wyllard smiled at her oh he explained i didnt want to be precipitateyou english folk dont seem to like that i thinkand he seemed to consideri wanted to make sure you wouldnt be repelled by what might look like colonial brusquerie you see you have been over snowbarred divides and through great shadowy forests with me weve camped among the boulders by lonely lakes and gone down frothing rapids i felti cant tell you whythat i was bound to meet you some day  his frankness was startling but the girl showed neither astonishment nor resentment she felt certain that this stranger was not posing or speaking for effect it did not occur to wyllard that he might have gone too far and for a moment or two he leaned against the gate while she looked at him with what he thought of as her gracious english calm  pale sunshine fell upon them though the larches beside the road were rustling beneath a cold wind and the song of the river came up brokenly out of the valley an odor of fresh grass floated about them and the dry cold smell of the english spring was in the air across the valley dim ghosts of hills lighted by evanescent gleams rose out of the east wind grayness with shadowy grandeur  then wyllard aroused himself i wonder if i ought to write major radcliffe and tell him what my object is before i call he said it would make the thing a little easier  the girl rose yes she assented that would perhaps be wiser she glanced at the photograph which was still in her hand it has served its purpose i scarcely think it would be of any great interest to major radcliffe  she saw his face change as she made it evident that she did not mean to give the portrait back to him there was at least one excellent reason why she would not have her picture in a strange mans hands  thank you she said for the story i am glad we have met but im afraid i have already kept my friends waiting for me  she turned away and it occurred to wyllard that he had made a very indifferent use of the opportunity since she had neither asked his name nor told him hers it was however evident that he could not well run after her and demand her name and he decided that he could in all probability obtain it from major radcliffe still he regretted his lack of adroitness as he walked back to the inn where he wrote two letters when he had consulted a map and his landlady dufton holme he discovered was a small village within a mile or two of the grange where as miss rawlinson had informed him agatha ismay was then staying one letter was addressed to her and he formally asked permission to call upon her with a message from george hawtrey the other was to major radcliffe and in both he said that an answer would reach him at the inn which his landlady had informed him was to be found not far from both of the houses he intended to visit  he set out on foot next morning and after climbing a steep pass followed a winding track across a waste of empty moor until he struck a smooth white road which led past a rockgirt lake and into a deep valley it was six oclock in the morning when he started and three in the afternoon when he reached the inn where he found an answer to one of the letters awaiting him it was from major radcliffe who desired an interview with him as soon as possible  within an hour he was on his way to the majors house where a grayhaired man whose yellow skin suggested long exposure to a tropical sun and a little withered lady were waiting for him they received him graciously but there was an indefinite something in their manner and bearing which wyllard who had read a great deal recognized though he had never been brought into actual contact with it until then he felt that he could not have expected to come across such people anywhere but in england unless it was at the headquarters of a british battalion in india  he told his story tersely softening unpleasant details and making little of what he had done the grayhaired man listened gravely with an unmoved face though a trace of moisture crept into the little ladys eyes there was silence for a moment or two when he had finished and then major radcliffe whose manner was very quiet turned to him  you have laid me under an obligation which i could never wipe out even if i wished it he said it was my only son you buried out there in canada  he broke off for a moment and his quietness was more marked than ever when he went on again  as you have no doubt surmised we quarreled he said he was extravagant and carelessat least i thought that thenbut now it seems to me that i was unduly hard on him his motherand he turned to the little lady with an inclination that pleased wyllard curiouslywas sure of it at the time in any case i took the wrong way and he went out to canada i made that at least easy for himand i have been sorry ever since  he paused again with a little expressive gesture it seems due to him and you that i should tell you this when no word reached us i had inquiries made through a banker who discovering that he had registered at a hotel as pattinson at length traced him to a british columbian silver mine he had however left the mine shortly before my correspondent learned that he had been employed there and all that the banker could tell me was that an unknown prospector had nursed my boy until he died  wyllard took out a watch and the clasp of a workmans belt from his pocket and laid them gently on mrs radcliffes knee he saw her eyes fill and turned his head away  i feel that you may blame me for not writing sooner but it was only a very little while ago that i was able to trace you and then it was only by a very curiouscoincidence he explained presently  he did not consider it advisable to mention the photograph it seemed to him that the girl would not like it nor though he was greatly tempted did he care to make inquiries concerning her just then in another moment or two the major spoke again  if i can make your stay here pleasanter in any way i should be delighted he said if you will take up your quarters with us i will send down to the inn for your things  wyllard excused himself but when mr radcliffe urged him to dine with them on the following evening he hesitated  the one difficulty is that i dont know yet whether i shall be engaged then he said as it happens ive a message for miss ismay and i wrote offering to call upon her at any convenient hour so far i have heard nothing from her  shes away mrs radcliffe informed him they have probably sent your letter on to her i had a note from her yesterday however and expect her here tomorrow you have met some friends of hers in canada  gregory hawtrey said wyllard i have promised to call upon his people too  he saw major radcliffe glance at his wife and he noticed a faint gleam in mrs radcliffes eyes  well she observed if you promise to come i will send word over to agatha  wyllard agreed to this and went away a few minutes later he noticed the tact and consideration with which his new friends had refrained from indicating any sign of the curiosity they naturally felt for mrs radcliffes face had suggested that she understood the situation which was beginning to appear a little more difficult to him it was it seemed his task to explain delicately to a girl brought up among such people what she must be prepared to face as a farmers wife in western canada he was not sure that this task would be easy in itself but it was rendered much more difficult by the fact that hawtrey would expect him to accomplish it without unduly daunting her her letter certainly had suggested courage but after all it was the courage of ignorance and he had now some notion of the life of ease and refinement her english friends enjoyed he was beginning to feel sorry for agatha ismay     chapter vii  agatha does not flinch   the next evening wyllard sat with mrs radcliffe in a big lowceilinged room at garside scar he looked about him with quiet interest he had now and then passed a day or two in huge western hotels but he had never seen anything quite like that room the sheer physical comfort of its arrangements appealed to him but after all he was not one who had ever studied his bodily ease very much and what he regarded as the chaste refinement of its adornment had a deeper effect than a mere appeal to the material side of his nature though he had lived for the most part in the bush and on the prairie he had somehow acquired an artistic susceptibility  the furniture was old and perhaps a trifle shabby but it was of beautiful design curtains carpets and tinted walls formed a harmony of soft coloring and there were scattered here and there dainty works of art little statuettes from italy and wonderful indian ivory and silver work a row of low stoneribbed windows pierced the front of the room looking out he saw the trim garden lying in the warm evening light immediately beneath the windows ran a broad graveled terrace which was evidently raked smooth every day and a row of urns in which hyacinths bloomed stood upon its pillared wall from the middle of the terrace a wide stairway led down to the wonderful velvet lawn which was dotted with clumps of cupressus with golden gleams in it and beyond the lawn clipped yews rose smooth and solid as a rampart of stone  it all impressed him curiouslythe order and beauty of it the signs of loving care it gave him a key he fancied to the lives of the cultured english people for there was no sign of strain and fret and stress and hurry here everything it seemed went smoothly with rhythmic regularity and though it is possible that many englishmen would have regarded garside scar as a very secondrate country house and would have seen in major radcliffe and his wife nothing more than a somewhat prosy old soldier and a withered lady oldfashioned in her dress and views this westerner had what was perhaps a clearer vision wyllard could imagine the major standing fast at any cost upon some minute point of honor and it seemed to him that mrs radcliffe with all the graces of an earlier age and the smell of the english lavender upon her garments might have stepped down from some old picture then he remembered that after all englishwomen lived somewhat coarsely in the georgian days and that he had met in western canada hardhanded men grimed with dust and sweat who also could stand fast by a point of honor though the fact did not occur to him he had for that matter done it more than once himself  he recalled his wandering thoughts as his hostess smiled at him  you are interested in all you see she asked frankly  yes said wyllard in fact id like to spend some hours here and look at everything id begin at the pictures and work right around  mrs radcliffes smile suggested that she was not displeased  but you have been in london  i have said wyllard i had one or two letters to persons there and they did all they could to entertain me still their places were different they hadnt thecharmof yours its something which i think could exist only in these still valleys and in cathedral closes it strikes me more because it is something ive never been accustomed to  mrs radcliffe was interested and fancied that she partly understood his attitude  your life is necessarily different from ours she suggested  wyllard smiled its so different that you couldnt realize it its all strain and effort from early sunrise until after dusk at night bodily strain of aching muscles and mental stress in adverse seasons we scarcely think of comfort and never dream of artistic luxury the money we make is sunk again in seed and extra teams and plows  after all a good many people are driven rather hard by the love of money here  no wyllard rejoined gravely thats not it exactly at least not with the most of us its rather the pride of wresting another quartersection from the prairie takingour ownby labor breaking the wilderness youand he added this as if to explain that he could hardly expect her quite to grasp his viewshave never been out west  his hostess laughed i have stayed down in the plains through the hot season in stifling cantonments and have once or twice been in indian cholera camps besides i have seen my husband sitting haggard and worn with fever in his saddle holding back a clamorous crowd that surged about him halfmad with religious fury there were hindus and moslems to be kept from flying at each others throats and at a tactless word or sign of wavering either party would have pulled him down  youll have to forgive mewyllards gesture was deprecatory though his eyes twinkled the notion that were the only ones who really work or at least do anything worth while is rather a favorite one out west no doubt its a delusion i should have known that all of us are born like that  mrs radcliffe forgave him readily if only for the all of us which struck her as especially fortunate a few minutes later there were voices in the hall and then the door opened and the girl whom he had met at the stepping stones came in she was dressed in trailing garments which became her wonderfully and he noticed now the shapely delicacy of her hands and the fine ivory pallor of her skin mrs radcliffe turned to him  i had better present you formally to miss ismay she said agatha this is mr wyllard who i understand has brought you a message from canada  there was no doubt that wyllard was blankly astonished and for a moment the girl was clearly startled too  you was all she said  she held out her hand before she turned to speak to mrs radcliffe it was a relief to both when dinner was announced  wyllard sat next to his hostess and was not sorry that he was called upon to take part only in casual general conversation he thought once or twice that miss ismay was unobtrusively studying him it was nearly an hour after the dinner when mrs radcliffe left them alone in the drawingroom  you have no doubt a good deal to talk about and you neednt join us until youre ready she said the major always reads the london papers after dinner  agatha sat in a low chair near the hearth and it occurred to wyllard who took a place opposite her that she was too delicate and dainty too overcultivated in fact to marry hawtrey this was rather curious since he had hitherto regarded his comrade as a typical welleducated englishman but it now seemed to him that there was a certain streak of coarseness in gregory the man it suddenly flashed upon him was selfindulgent and the careless ease of manner which he had once liked was too much in evidence  agatha turned to him  i understand that gregory is recovering rapidly she said  wyllard assured her that hawtrey was convalescing and agatha said quietly he wants me to go out to him  wyllard felt that if a girl of that sort had promised to marry him he would not have sent for her but would have come in person if he had been compelled to pledge his last possessions or crawl to the tideway on his hands and knees for all that he was ready to defend his friend  im afraid its necessary he said gregory was quite unfit for such a journey when i left and he must be ready to commence the seasons campaign with the first of the spring our summer is short you see and with our onecrop farming its indispensable to get the seed in early in fact he will be badly behind as it is  this was not particularly tactful since without intending it he made it evident that he felt his comrade had been to some extent remiss but agatha smiled  oh she replied i understand you neednt labor with excuses but doesnt the same thing apply to you  it certainly did now however things have become a little easier my holding is larger than gregorys and i have a foreman who can look after it for me  gregory said that you were a great friend of his  wyllard seized this opportunity he was a great friend of mine and i like to think it means the same thing in fact its reasonably certain that he saved my life for me  ah exclaimed agatha that is a thing he didnt mention how did it come about  wyllard was glad to tell the story he was anxious to say all he honestly could in hawtreys favor  we were at work on a railroad trestlea towering wooden bridge in british columbia it stretched across a deep ravine with great boulders and there was a stream in the bottom of it he stood high up on a staging close beneath the rails a fast freight a huge general produce train came down the track with one of the new big locomotives hauling it and when the cars went banging by above us we could hardly hold on to the bridge the construction foreman was a hustler and we had to get the spikes in i was swinging the hammer when i felt the plank beneath me slip the train it seems had jarred loose the bolt around which we had our lashings for a moment i felt that i was going down into the gorge and then gregory leaned out and grabbed me he had only one free hand to do it with and when he felt my weight one foot swung out from the stringer he had sprung to it seemed certain that i would pull him with me too we hung like that for a spacei dont quite know how long  he paused for a moment apparently feeling the stress of it again and there was a faint thrill in his voice when he went on  it was then he said i knew just what kind of man gregory hawtrey was anybody else would have let me go but he held on i got my hand on some of the framing and he swung me on to the stringer  he saw the gleam in agathas eyes oh she cried that is just what he must have done he was like that alwaysimpulsive splendidly generous  wyllard felt that he had succeeded though he knew that there were men on the prairie who called his comrade slackly careless instead of impulsive agatha spoke again  but gregory wasnt a carpenter she said  in those days when money was scarce we had to be whatever we could there wasnt much specialization of handicrafts out there then the farmer whose crop was ruined took up the railroad shovel or borrowed a saw from somebody and set about building houses or anything else that was wanted  of course replied agatha besides he was always wonderfully quick he could learn any game by just watching it a while he did all he undertook brilliantly  it occurred to wyllard that gregory had at least made no great success of farming but that occupation as practiced on the prairie demands a great deal more than quickness and what some call brilliancy from the man who undertakes it he must as they say out there possess the capacity for staying with itthe grim courage to hold fast the tighter under each crushing blow when the grain shrivels under the harvest frost or when the ragged ice hurtling before a roaring blast does the reaping it was however evident that this girl had an unquestioning faith in gregory hawtrey and once more wyllard felt compassionate towards her he wondered if she would have retained her confidence had hawtrey spent those four years in england instead of canada for it was clear from the contrast between her and her picture that she had grown in many ways since she had given her promise to her lover he had said what he could in hawtreys favor but now he felt that something was due to the girl  gregory told me to explain what things are like out there he said i think it is because they are so different from what you are accustomed to that he has waited so long he wanted to make them as easy as possible for you and now he would like you to realize what is before you  he was surprised at the girls quick comprehension for she glanced around the luxurious room with a faint smile  you look on me as part ofthis i mean it seems to you that i fit in with my surroundings and would be in harmony only with them  yes answered wyllard gravely i think you fit in with them excellently  agatha laughed well she said i was once to a certain extent accustomed to something similar though after all one could hardly compare the grange with garside scar still that was some time ago and i have earned my living for several years now that counts for something doesnt it  she glanced down at her dress for instance this is the result of a great deal of selfdenial though the cost of it was partly worked off in music lessons and the stuff was almost the cheapest i could get i sang at concertsand it was part of my stock in trade after all why should you think me capable only of living in luxury  i didnt go quite that far  she laughed again then is canada such a very dreadful place i have heard of other englishwomen going out there as farmers wives do they all live unhappily  no replied wyllard at least they show no sign of it and some of them and the cityborn canadians are i think the salt of this earth probably its easy to be calm and gracious in such a place as thisthough naturally i dont know since ive never tried itbut when a woman who toils from sunrise to sunset most of the year keeps her sweetness and serenity its a very different and much finer thing but ill try to answer the other question the prairie isnt dreadful its a land of sunshine and clear skies heat and coldand we have them bothdont worry one there theres optimism in the crystal air its not beautiful like these valleys but it has its beauty it is vast and silent and though our homesteads are crude and new once you pass the breaking its primevally old that gets hold of one somehow its wonderful after sunset in the early spring when the little cold wind is like wine and it runs white to the horizon with the smoky red on the rim of it melting into transcendental green when the wheat rolls across the foreground in ocher and burnished copper waves it is more wonderful still one sees the fulfillment of the promise and takes courage  then asked agatha who had scarcely suspected him of such appreciation of nature what is there to shrink from  in the case of a small farmers wife the constant neverslackening strain theres no hired assistance she must clean the house and wash and cook though its not unusual for the men to wash the plates  the girl evidently was not much impressed for she laughed  does gregory wash the plates she asked  wyllards eyes twinkled when sproatly wont he said still in a general way they do it only once a week  ah observed agatha i can imagine gregory hating it as a matter of fact i like him for it  then the farmers wife must bake and mend her husbands clothes indeed its not unusual for her to mend for the hired man too besides that there are always odds and ends of tasks but the time when you feel the strain most is in the winter then you sit at night shivering as a rule beside the stove in an almost empty logwalled room reading a book you have probably read three or four times before outside the frost is arctic you can hear the roofing shingles crackle now and then and you wake up when the fire burns low theres no life no company rarely a new face and if you go to a dance or a supper somewhere perhaps once a month you ride back on a bobsled and are frozen almost stiff beneath the robes  still interposed agatha that does not last  the man understood her oh he said one makes progressthat is if one can stand the strainbut as the one way of doing it is to sow for a larger harvest and break fresh sod every year there can be no slackening in the meanwhile every dollar must be guarded and plowed into the soil again  he broke off feeling that he had done all that could reasonably be expected of him and agatha asked one question  a woman who didnt slacken could make the struggle easier for the man couldnt she  yes wyllard assured her in every way still she would have a great deal to bear  agathas face softened ah she commented she would not grudge the effort in the case of one she loved  she looked up again with a smile i wonder she added if you really thought i should flinch  when i first heard of it i thought it quite likely then when i read your letter my doubts vanished  he saw that he had not been judicious for there was for the first time a trace of hardness in the girls expression  he showed you that she asked  one small part of it assured wyllard i want to say that when i first saw this house and how you seemed fitted to it my misgivings about gregorys decision troubled me once more nowand he made an impressive gesturethey have vanished altogether and theyll never come back again  he spoke as he felt this girl he knew would feel the strain but it seemed to him that she had strength enough to bear it cheerfully in spite of her daintiness she was one who in time of stress could be depended on he often remembered afterwards how they had sat together in the luxuriously furnished room she leaning back in her big low chair with the soft light on her delicately tinted face by and by he looked at her  its curious that i had your photograph ever so long and never thought of showing it to gregory he observed  agatha smiled i suppose it is she admitted after all except that it might have been a relief to major radcliffe if he had met you sooner the fact that you didnt show it to gregory doesnt seem of any particular consequence  wyllard was not quite sure of this he had thought about this girl often and certainly had been conscious of a curious thrill of satisfaction when he had met her at the steppingstones that feeling had suddenly disappeared when he had learned that she was his comrades promised wife he had however during the last hour or two made up his mind to think no more of her  well he declared the next thing is to arrange for mrs hastings to meet you in london or perhaps at the grange her husband is a canadian a man of education who has quite a large homestead not far from gregorys her relatives are people of station in montreal and i feel sure that youll like her  they decided that he was to ask mrs hastings to stay a few days at the grange and then he looked at the girl somewhat diffidently  she suggests going in a fortnight he said  agatha smiled at him then she said i must not keep her waiting  she rose and they went back together to join their hostess     chapter viii  the traveling companion   a gray haze thickened by the smoke of the city drove out across the water when the scarrowmania lay in the mersey with her cable hove short and the last of the floodtide gurgling against her bows a trumpeting blast of steam swept high aloft from beside her squat funnel and the splash of the slowly turning paddles of the two steam tugs that lay alongside mingled with the din it made a gangway from one of them to the scarrowmanias forward deck and a stream of frowsy humanity that had just been released from overpacked emigrant boardinghouses poured up it there were apparently representatives of all peoples and languages among that unkempt hordebritons scandinavians teutons italians russians polesand they moved on in forlorn apathy like cattle driven to the slaughter one wondered how they had raised their passage money and how many years bitter selfdenial it had cost them to provide for their transit to the land of promise  at the head of the gangway stood the steamboat doctors for the scarrowmania was taking out an unusual number of passengers and there were two of them they were immaculate in blue uniform and looked very clean and english by contrast with the mass of frowsy aliens beside them stood another official presumably acting on behalf of the dominion government though there were few restrictions imposed upon canadian immigration then nor for that matter did anybody trouble much about the comfort of the steerage passengers each steamer carried as many as she could hold  as the stream poured out of the gangway the doctor glanced at each newcomers face and then seizing him by the wrist uncovered it then he looked at the official who made a sign and the man moved on since this took him two or three seconds one could have fancied that he either possessed peculiar powers or that the test was a somewhat inefficient one  a group of firstclass passengers leaning on the thwartship rails close by looked on with complacent satisfaction or halfcontemptuous pity among them stood mrs hastings miss winifred rawlinson and agatha it was noticed that wyllard with a pipe in his hand sat on a hatch forward near the head of the gangway agatha drew mrs hastings attention to it  whatever is mr wyllard doing there she asked  mrs hastings who was wrapped in furs to protect her from the sting in the east wind smiled at her  that she answered is more than i can tell you but harry wyllard seems to find an interest in what other folks would consider most unpromising things and what is more to the purpose he is rather addicted to taking a hand in them it is a habit that costs him something now and then  agatha asked nothing further she was interested in wyllard but she was at the moment more interested in the faces of those who swarmed on board she wondered what the emigrants had endured in the lands that had cast them out and what they might still have to bear it seemed to her that the murmur of their harsh voices went up in a great protest an inarticulate cry of sorrow while she looked on the doctor held back a longhaired man who shuffling in broken boots was following a haggard woman the physician drew him aside and after he had consulted with the other official two seamen hustled the man towards a second gangway that led to the tug the woman raised a wild despairing cry she blocked the passage and a quartermaster drove her expostulating in an agony of terror forward among the rest nobody appeared concerned about this aliens tragedy except one man and agatha was not surprised when wyllard rose and quietly laid his hand upon the officials shoulder  a parley appeared to follow somebody gave an order and when the alien was led back again the womans cries subsided agatha looked at mrs hastings and once more a smile crept into the older womans eyes  yes said mrs hastings i guessed he would feel that he had to interfere that is a man who cant see any one in trouble she added with a little whimsical sigh he had a bonanza harvest last fall anyway  they moved aft soon afterwards and the scarrowmania was smoothly sliding seawards with the first of the ebb when agatha met wyllard he glanced at the lancashire sandhills which were fading into a pale ocher gleam amid the haze over the starboard hand and then at the long row of painted buoys that moved back to them  youre off at last the sad gray weather is dropping fast astern he said out yonder the skies are clear  thank you replied agatha im to apply that as i like as a matter of fact however our days werent always gray but what was the trouble when those steerage people came on board  wyllards manner she noticed was free alike from the complacent selfsatisfaction which occasionally characterizes the philanthropist and from any affectation of diffidence  well he answered there was something wrong with that womans husband nothing infectious i believe but they didnt seem to consider him a desirable citizen they make a warning example of somebody with a physical infirmity now and then the man they decided must be put ashore again in the meanwhile somebody else had hustled the woman forward and it looked as if they would take her on without him the tug was almost ready to cast off  how dreadful said agatha but what did you do  merely promised to guarantee the cost of his passage back if they would refer his case to the immigration people at the other end it is scarcely likely that theyll make trouble as a rule they only throw out folks who are certain to become a charge on the community  but if he really had any infirmity mightnt it lead to that  no wyllard responded dryly i would engage to give him a fair start if it was necessary you wouldnt have had that woman landed in montreal helpless and alone while the man was sent back again to starve in poland  he saw a curious gleam in agathas eyes and added in a deprecating manner you see ive now and then limped without a dollar into a british columbian mining town  the girl was touched with compassion but there was another matter that must be mentioned though she felt that the time was inopportune  miss rawlinson who had only a secondclass ticket insists upon being told how it is that she has been transferred to the saloon  wyllards eyes twinkled but she noticed that he was wholly free from embarrassment which was not quite the case with her  well he said thats a matter i must leave you to handle anyway she cant go secondclass now one or two of the steerage exchanged when they saw their quarters for which i dont blame them and they have filled up every room  you havent answered the question  wyllard waved his hand miss rawlinson is your bridesmaid and im gregorys best man it seems to me its my business to do everything just as he would like it done  he left her a moment later and though she did not know how she was to explain the matter to miss rawlinson who was of an independent nature it occurred to her that he at least had found a rather graceful way out of the difficulty the more she saw of this western farmer the more she liked him  it was after dinner when she next met him and the wind had changed the scarrowmania was steaming headon into a glorious northwest breeze the shrouds sang chainguy and stanchion and whatever caught the wind set up a deeptoned throbbing and ahead ranks of little whitetopped seas rolled out of the night a halfmoon blurred now and then by wisps of flying cloud hung low above them and odd spouts of spray that gleamed in the silvery light leaped up about the dipping bows wyllard was leaning on the rail when agatha stopped beside him she glanced towards the lighted windows of the smokingroom not far away  how is it you are not in there she asked noticing that he held a cigar in his hand  i was answered wyllard its rather full and it seemed that they didnt want me theyre busy playing cards and the stakes are rather high in a general way a steamboats smokingroom is less of a mens lounge than a gambling club  and you object to cards  oh no wyllard replied with a smile they merely make me tired and when i feel i want some excitement for my money i get it another way that one seems tame to me  what sort of excitement do you like  the man laughed there are a good many that appeal to me once it was collecting sealskins off other peoples beaches and there was zest enough in that in view of the probability of the dory turning over or a gunboat dropping on to you then there was a good deal of very genuine excitement to be got out of placermining in british columbia especially when there was frost in the ranges and you had to thaw out your giantpowder shallow alluvial workings have a way of caving in when you least expect it of them after all however i think i like the prairie farming best  is that exciting  yes returned wyllard if you do it in one way the golds therethat youre sure ofpiled up by nature during i dont know how many thousand years but you have to stake high if you want to get much of it out one needs costly laborteamsno end of thembreakers and big gangplows the farmer who has nerve enough drills his last dollar into the soil in spring but if he means to succeed it costs him more than that he must give the sweat of his tensest effort the uttermost toil of his bodyall in fact that has been given him then he must shut his eyes tight to the hazards against him or look at them without waveringthe drought the hail the harvest frost i mean if his teams fall sick or the season goes against him he must work double tides still it now and then happens that things go right and the red wheat rolls ripe right back across the prairie i dont know that any man could want a keener thrill than the one he feels when he drives in the binders  agatha had imagination and she could realize something of the toil the hazard and the exultation of that victory  you have felt it often she inquired  twice we helped to fill a big elevator wyllard answered but ive been very near defeat  the girl looked at him thoughtfully it seemed that he possessed the power of acquisition as well as a wide generosity that came into play when by strenuous effort success had been attained so far as her experience went these were things that did not invariably accompany each other  and when the harvest comes up to your expectations you give your money away she asked with a lifting of her brows  wyllard laughed you shouldnt deduce too much from a single instance besides that poles case hasnt cost me anything yet  mrs hastings joined them and when wyllard strolled away the women passed some time leaning on the rails and looking at the groups of shadowy figures on the forward deck the attitude of the steerage passengers was dejected and melancholy but one cluster had gathered around a man who stood upon the hatch  oh he declared youll have no trouble canadas a great country for a poor man he can sleep beneath a bush all summer if he cant strike anything he likes  this did not appear particularly encouraging but the orator went on been over for a trip to the old country and im glad im going back again went out with nothing except a good discharge and they made me sergeant of canadian militia after that i was armorer to a rifle club theres places a blame long way behind the dominion and i struck one of them when we went with roberts to afghanistan it was on that trip i and a pathan rolled all down a hill him trying to get his knife arm loose and me jabbing his breastbone with my bayonet before i got it into him i drove it through to the socket you want to make quite sure of a pathan  miss rawlinson winced at this oh she cried what a horrible man  it was most as tough as when you went after riel and stole the scotchmans furs suggested a canadian  the sergeant let the jibe go by he said louiss bucks could shoot we had them corraled in a pit and every time one of the boys from montreal broke cover he got a bullet into him did any of you ever hear a dropped man squeal  agatha had heard sufficient and she and her companions turned away but as they moved across the deck the sergeants voice followed her  oh yes he said a grand country for a poor man in the summer he can sleep beneath a bush  for some reason this eulogy haunted agatha when she retired to her stateroom that night and she wondered what awaited all those aliens in the new land it occurred to her that in some respects she was situated very much as they were for the first time vague misgivings crept into her mind as she realized that she had cut herself adrift from all to which she had been accustomed she felt suddenly depressed and lonely  the depression had however almost vanished when awakening rather early next morning she went up on deck a red sun hung over the tumbling seas that ran into the hazy east astern the waves rolled up in crested phalanxes that gleamed green and incandescent white ahead the scarrowmania plunged through them with a spray cloud flying about her dipping bows she was a small oldfashioned boat and because she carried 3000 tons of railway iron she rolled distressfully her tall spars swayed athwart the vivid blueness of the morning sky with the rhythmic regularity of a pendulum the girl was not troubled by any sense of seasickness the keen northwester that sang amid the shrouds was wonderfully fresh and when she met wyllard crossing the saloon deck her cheeks were glowing from the sting of the spray and her eyes were bright  where have you been she asked  down there answered wyllard pointing to the black opening in the forehatch that led to the steerage quarters an acquaintance of mine whos traveling forward asked me to take a look round and im rather glad i did when ive had a word with the chief steward im going back again  you have a friend down there  i met the man for the first time yesterday and rather took to him one of your naval petty officers forcibly retired he cant live upon his pension that is why hes going out to canada now youll excuse me  i wonder ventured agatha if you would let me go back with you  wyllard looked at her curiously well he said with an air of reflection youll probably have to face a good deal that you dont like out yonder and in one way you wont suffer from a little preparatory training this however is not a case where sentimental pity is likely to relieve anybody its the real thing  i think i told you at garside scar that i havent lived altogether in luxury she replied  wyllard who made no comment disappeared and merely signed to her when he came back they reached the ladder that led down into the gloom beneath the hatch and agatha hesitated when a sour and musty odor floated up to her she went down however and a few moments later stood halfnauseated gazing at the wildest scene of confusion her eyes had ever rested on a little light came down the hatchway and a smoky lamp or two swung above her head but half the steerage deck was wrapped in shadow and out of it there rose a manyvoiced complaining flimsy unplaned fittings had wrenched away and men lay inert amid the wreckage with the remains of their last meal scattered about them there were unwashed tin plates and pannikins knives and spoons sliding up and down everywhere and the deck was foul with slops of tea and trodden bread and marmalade now and then in a wilder roll than usual a frowsy huddled object slid groaning down the slant of slimy planking but in every case the helpless passenger was fully dressed steerage passengers in fact seldom take off their clothes for one thing all their worldly possessions are as a rule secreted among their garments and for another most of those hailing from beyond the danube have never been accustomed to disrobing in the midst of the confusion two halfsick steward lads were making ineffective efforts to straighten up the mess  agatha made out that a swarm of urchins were huddled together in a helpless mass along one side of the horrible place the sergeant was haranguing them while another man whom she supposed to be the petty officer pulled them to their feet one by one a good deal of his labor was wasted for the scarrowmania was rolling viciously and as soon as a few were placed upright half of them collapsed again wyllard glanced towards the boys compassionately  i believe most of them have had nothing to eat since they came on board though it isnt the companys fault he said theres food enough served out but before we picked the breeze up the men laid hands upon it first and half of it was wasted in the scramble then it seems they pitched these youngsters out of their berths  dont they belong to anybody agatha asked is there no one to look after them  wyllard smiled i believe one of your charitable institutions is sending them out and there seems to be a clergyman who has a curate and a lay assistant to help him in charge of them the assistant wont be available while this rolling lasts and the other two very naturally prefer the saloon in a way thats comprehensible  he left her and proceeded to help the man who was dragging the urchins to their feet  get up commanded the sergeant get up and fall in dress from the left and number off the ones who can stand  it appeared that the lads had been drilled for they scrambled into a line that bent and wavered each time the scarrowmanias bows went down after that every other lad stepped forward at the word the order was left turn march and fall in on deck and when they feebly clambered up the ladder wyllard who turned to agatha pointed to a door in a bulkhead of rough white wood  it should have been locked but i fancy you can get in that way and up through another hatch he remarked the single women and women with children are in yonder and if you want to be useful theres a field for you get as many as possible up on deck  agatha left him and her face was rather white when at last she came up into the open air with about a dozen forlorn draggled women trailing helplessly after her the lads were now sitting down in a double line on deck each with a tin plate and a steaming pannikin in front of him there were at least a hundred of them and a man with a bronzed face and the stamp of command upon him was giving them the order of the voyage he was the one she had already noticed  youll turn out at the whistle at halfpast six he said shake mattresses roll up blankets and prepare for berth inspection then at the next whistle youll fall in on deck stripped to the waist for washing parade fourth files numbering even are orderlies in charge of the plates and pannikins  and announced the sergeant any insubordination will be sharply dealt with now when i was with roberts in afghanistan  wyllard who was standing close by turned to agatha  i dont think well be wanted you have probably earned your breakfast  they went back to the saloon deck and the girl smiled when he looked at her inquiringly  it was a little horrible but i hadnt so many to deal with she said do you and those others expect to bring any order out of that chaos  no answered wyllard with a little encouragement theyll do it themselves that is the english danes and germans one can trust them to evolve a workable system its in their nature you can trace most things that tend to wholesome efficiency back to the old teutonic leaven by and by theyll proceed to put some pressure on the latins slavs and jews  but is it your business to offer them that encouragement  wyllard laughed strictly speaking it isnt in the least but unnecessary chaos is hateful and any way im not the only one who doesnt seem to like it theres the petty officer and our friend the sergeant who was with roberts in afghanistan  agatha said nothing further she was a little surprised to feel that she was anxious to keep this mans good opinion though that was not exactly why she had nerved herself for the venture into the single womens quarters leaving him out altogether it seemed to her that there was something rather fine in the way that the sergeant and the petty officer who was going out almost penniless to canada had saddled themselves with the task of looking after those helpless lads it was wholly unpaid labor for which the men who preferred to remain within the safe limits of the saloon deck would presumably get the credit after all she decided there were no doubt men in every station who helped to keep the world sweet and clean and she believed that wyllard was to be counted among them he certainly differed in many ways from gregory but then gregory was unapproachable she did not remember that it was four years since she had seen hawtrey and that her ideas had been a little unformed then  in the evening mrs hastings with whom he was evidently a favorite happened to speak of wyllard and the efforts he was making in the steerage and agatha asked a question  does he often undertake this kind of thing  no mrs hastings answered with a smile any way not on so large a scale hes very far from setting up as a professional philanthropist my dear i dont remember his offering to point out duty to other folks and i dont think he goes about in search of an opportunity of benefiting humanity still when an individual case thrusts itself beneath his nose he generally does what he can  ive heard people say that the individual method only perpetuates the trouble remarked agatha  mrs hastings shook her head that she said is a subject im not well posted on but it seems to me that if other folks only adopted harry wyllards simple plan there would be considerably less need for organized charity     chapter ix  the fog   during the next two days before a moderate gale the scarrowmania shouldered her way westwards through the big whitetopped combers that rolled down upon her under a lowering sky there were no luxurious steampropelled hotels in the canadian trade at this time and loaded deep with railway metal as she was the vessel slopped in the green seas everywhere and rolled her streaming sides out almost to her bilge she shivered and rattled horribly when her single screw swung clear and the tricompound engines ran away  wyllard went down to the steerage every now and then and agatha who contrived to keep on her feet not infrequently accompanied him she was glad of his society for mrs hastings was seldom in evidence and no efforts could get miss rawlinson out of her berth the gale blew itself out at length and the evening after it moderated agatha was sitting near the head of one fiddleguarded table in the saloon waiting for dinner which the stewards had still some difficulty in bringing in wyllards place was next to hers but he had not appeared nor had the skipper who however did not invariably dine with the passengers one of the two doors which led from the foot of the branching companion stairway into either side of the saloon stood open and presently she saw wyllard standing just outside it  he beckoned to the doctor who sat at the foot of her table and the physician merely raised his brows a trifle he was a rather consequential person and it was evident to the girl that he resented being summoned by a gesture she did not think anybody else had noticed wyllard and she waited with some curiosity to see what he would do he made a sign with a lifted hand and she felt that the doctor would obey it as in fact he did though his manner was very far from conciliatory by dint of listening closely she could hear their conversation  im sorry to trouble you just now apologized wyllard and i didnt come in because that would have set everybody wondering what you were wanted for but one of those boys forward has been thrown down the ladder and has cut his head  ah said the doctor ill see to himafter dinner  its a nasty cut declared wyllard hes losing a good deal of blood  then i would suggest that you apply to my assistant  as i dont know where he is i have come to you  the doctor made a sign of impatience well he said you have told me which i think is as far as your concern in the matter goes i may add that im not accustomed to dictation on behalf of a steerage passenger  agatha saw wyllard slip between the doctor and the entrance to the saloon but she saw also the skipper appear a few paces behind them and glance at them sharply he was usually a silent man at home in the ice and the clammy fog but not a great acquisition in the saloon  something wrong down forward mr wyllard they were making a great row a little while ago the skipper said  nothing very serious wyllard answered one of the boys has cut his head  the skipper turned towards the doctor and agatha guessed that he had overheard part of the conversation dont you think you had better goat once suggested the skipper  the doctor evidently did for he disappeared and wyllard who entered the saloon with the skipper sat down at agathas side  how do you do it she asked  what returned wyllard beginning his dinner  well say persuade other folks to see things as you do  you evidently mean the skipper and i suppose you heard something of what was going on in this case im indebted to his prejudices hes one of the old typea seaman first of alland what we call bluff and you call bounce has only one effect upon men of his kind it gets their backs up  agatha thought that he did not like it either but she changed the subject  there really was a row forward she said what was the trouble over you were no doubt somewhere near the scene of it  wyllard laughed i sat upon the steerage ladder and am afraid i cheered the combatants on it was really a glorious row they hammered each other with tin plates and some of them tried to use hoopiron knives which fortunately doubled up they broke quite a few of the benches and wrecked the mess table but so far as i noticed the only one seriously hurt was a little chap who was quietly looking on  and you encouraged them  i certainly did it was a protest against dirt disorder and the slothfulness thats a plague to the community isnt physical force warranted when theres no other remedy  a grayhaired canadian looked up yes he agreed i guess it is the first man who pulled his gun in british columbia was hanged right away and theyve scarcely had to make an example of another since then though it was quite a while ago  he paused and smiled approvingly a mess of any kind worries us and we dont take long to straighten it out same feelings in the germans and scandinavians ill say that for them any way your friends swept up the steerage  they took the slavs and jews and pitched them down the second hatch on to the orlop deck things will go smoothly now our crowd is on top  your crowd said agatha  the canadian nodded thats what he meant he said there are two kinds of folks you and the rest of them are dumping into canada ones the kind that will get up and hustle break land and build new homeslog at first frame and stone afterwards they go on from a quartersection and a team of oxen to the biggest farm they can handle and every fresh furrow they cut enriches all of us the other kind want to sit down in the dirt and take life easily as theyve always done the dirt worries everybody else and weve no use for them by and by our legislature will have to wake up and stop them from getting in  he went on with his dinner but his observations left agatha thoughtful she was beginning to understand one side of wyllards character he it seemed stood for practical efficiency there was a driving force in him that made for progress and order it was apparently his mission to straighten things out some persons of his kind she reflected now and then made a good deal of avoidable trouble but there was in this man at least a halfwhimsical toleration which rendered that an unlikely thing in his particular case besides she had already recognized that she was in some respects fortunate in having such a man for her companion  her deck chair was always set out in the most sheltered and comfortable place if there was anything to be seen he almost invariably appeared with a pair of powerful glasses she was watched over her wishes were anticipated and the man was seldom obtrusively present when she felt disposed to talk to somebody else it struck her that she had thought a great deal about him during the last few days and rather less than usual about gregory which was partly the reason she did not walk up and down the deck with him as usual after dinner that evening  three or four days later the scarrowmania ran into the bank fog and burrowed through it with whistle hooting dolefully at regular intervals now and then an answering ringing of bells came out of the clammy vapor and the halfseen shape of an anchored schooner loomed up rolling wildly on gray slopes of sea once too a tiny dory half filled with lines and buoys slid by plunging on the wash flung off by the scarrowmanias bows and agatha understood that the men in her had escaped death by a hairsbreadth they were cod fishers wyllard told her and he added that there was a host of them at work somewhere in the sliding haze she imagined now and then that the fog had a depressing effect on him and that when the dory lay beneath the rail there had been an unusual look in his face  a breeze came out of the northwest with the sting of the ice in it but the fog did not lift and the scarrowmania plunged on through it with spraywet decks and the gray seas smashing about her bows it was bitterly cold and the raw wind pierced to the bone but the voyage was rapidly shortening  one evening agatha paced the deck with wyllard the girl was in a strangely unsettled mood perhaps it was merely the gloom of the sea and sky reacting upon her that caused her to look forward to the landing with a certain halfconscious shrinking they stopped by the rails presently looking out upon the tumbling seas that tipped with livid froth rolled out of the sliding haze and the dreariness of the surroundings intensified the girls depression there was something unpleasantly suggestive in the sight of the fog that hid everything for agatha had been troubled with a halfapprehensive longing to see what lay before her she noticed the lookout a lonely shapeless figure standing amid the spray that whirled about the plunging bows by and by she saw him turn and wave an arm toward the bridge behind her and she heard a hoarse cry what it meant she could not tell but in another moment the scarrowmanias whistle shrieked  a gray shape burst out of the vapor and grew with astonishing swiftness into dim tiers of slanted sailcloth swaying above a strip of hull that moved amid a broad white smear of foam it was a brig under forecourse and topsails and as the girl watched the vessel it sank to the tilted bowsprit and a big gray and white sea foamed about the bows  arent we dreadfully near she asked  wyllard did not answer he was gazing up at the bridge and once more the whistle gave a warning blast it seemed that the two vessels could hardly pass clear of each other  wyllard laid a hand upon agathas shoulder  the skippers starboarding well go around to the stern he said  his grasp was reassuring and agatha watched the straining curves of canvas and the line of halfsubmerged hull the brig rose with streaming bows swung high above the sea sank again and vanished with bewildering suddenness into a belt of driving fog  agatha was not sure that there had been any peril but it was certainly past now and she was rather puzzled by her sensations when wyllard had held her shoulder for one thing she had felt instinctively that she was safe with him she decided not to trouble herself about the reason for this and presently she looked up at him the expression that she had noticed now and then was once more in his face  i dont think you like the fog any more than i do she said  no responded wyllard with a quiet forcefulness that startled her i hate it  why  it recalls something that still gives me a very bad few minutes every once in a while it has been worrying me again tonight  i wonder said agatha simply if you would care to tell me  the man looked down on her i havent told it often but you shall hear he replied its a tale of a black failure he stretched out a hand and pointed to the ranks of tumbling seas it was very much this kind of night and we were lying reefed down off one of the russians beaches when i asked for volunteers i got themtwo boats crews of the finest seamen that ever handled oar or sealing rifle  but what did you want them for  a boat from another schooner had been cast ashore it was blowing hard as it usually does where the polar ice comes down into the behring sea theyd been shooting seals we meant to bring the men off if we could manage it  wouldnt one boat have been enough  no answered wyllard dryly we had three and i think that was one cause of the trouble there was one from the other schooner you see those seals belonged to the russians and we freelances could shoot them only off shore im not sure that the men in the wrecked boat had been fishing outside the limit  agatha did not press for further particulars and he went on  we managed to make a landing though one boat went up bottom uppermost i fancy they must have broken or lost an oar then we got the wrecked men but we had trouble while we were getting the boats off again the surf was running in savagely and the fog shut down as solid as a wall any way we pulled off and went out with a foot of water in one boat one of the rescued men took my oar when i let it go  why did you let it go  wyllard laughed in a grim fashion  my head was laid open with a sealing club he said some of the other men had their scratches but they managed to row for one thing they knew they had to they had reasons for not wanting to fall into the russians hands well we cleared the beach and once or twice as i tried to bale there was a shout somewhere near us and the loom of a vanishing boat it was all we could make out for the sea was slopping into the boat and the spray was flying everywhere if there had been only two boats we probably would have found out our misfortune and perhaps would have set it straight as it was we couldnt tell that it was the same boat that had hailed us  he broke off for a moment and then added quietly  two boats reached the schooners there was a nasty sea running then and it blew viciously hard next day there were three men in the other  ah cried agatha they were drowned  wyllard made a forceful gesture im not quite sure thats the trouble at least the boat was nowhere on the beach next day and its difficult to see how the men could have faced the sea that piled up when the gale came down in all probability they had an oar short and the boat rolled them out when a comber broke upon her in the darkness the girl saw him close one hand tight as he added if one only knew  what would have befallen them if they had reached shore  its difficult to say they could have been handed over to the russian authorities still sealers poaching up there have simply disappeared  he stopped again and glanced out at the gathering darkness now he concluded you see why i hate the fog  but you couldnt help it said agatha  well answered wyllard i asked for volunteers and the money that is now mine came out of those schooners its just possible those men are living stillsomewhere in northern asia i only know that they disappeared  he abruptly began to talk of something else and by and by agatha went down to the saloon where miss rawlinson who had not been much in evidence during the voyage presently made her appearance  arent you going into the musicroom to play for mr wyllardas usual she inquired  agatha was disconcerted she had fallen into the habit of spending half an hour or longer in the little musicroom every evening with wyllard standing near the piano but now her friends question seemed to place a significance upon the fact  no she replied i dont think i am  then the rest of them will wonder whether you have fallen out with him  fallen out with him  winifred laughed theyve naturally been watching both of you and in a general way theres only one decision they could have arrived at  agatha flushed a little but winifred went on  i dont mind admitting that if a man of that kind was to fall in love with me id black his boots for him she said she added with a rueful gesture still its most unlikely  agatha looked at her with a little glint in her eyes  he is merely gregorys deputy she said with a subconscious feeling that the word deputy was not a fortunate one in that connection i should like to point out that you can estimate a mans character by that of his friends  oh rejoined winifred then if mr wyllards strong points merely heighten gregorys virtues ive nothing more to say any way ill reserve my homage until ive seen gregory perfection among men is scarce nowadays  she turned away and left agatha thoughtful in the meanwhile mrs hastings came upon wyllard alone in the musicroom  you look quite serious she remarked  ive been thinking about miss ismay and gregory wyllard replied in fact i feel a little anxious about them  in what way  without making any reflections upon gregory i somewhat feel sorry for the girl  mrs hastings nodded as a matter of fact thats very much what i felt from the first she admitted still you see theres the important fact that shes fond of him and it should smooth out a good many difficulties anyway shes evidently rather a courageous person  wyllard sat silent a moment or two i wasnt troubling about the material difficultieslack of wealth and all that he said i was wondering if she really could be fond of him it is some years since she was much in his company  hawtrey is not a man to change  that returned wyllard is just the trouble ive no doubt hes much the same but one could fancy that miss ismay has changed a good deal since she last saw him shell look for considerably more than she was probably content with then  in any case it isnt your affair mrs hastings smiled significantly  in one sense it certainly isnt but i cant help feeling a little troubled about the thing you see gregory is quite an old friend  and the girl is going to marry him said mrs hastings raising her eyebrows  wyllard rose that reminder he said is quite uncalled for i would like to assure you of it  he went out and mrs hastings sat still in a reflective mood  if she begins to compare him with hawtrey there can be only one result she said  the fog had almost gone next morning and pale sunshine streamed down upon a a frothflecked sea a bitter wind however still came out of the hazy north and the scarrowmanias plates were crusted with ice where the highest crests of the tumbling seas reached them the spray froze and the decks grew slippery when darkness came nobody but the seamen faced the stinging cold agatha felt the engines stop late that night and when she went out next morning the decks were white and she could see dim ghosts of sliding pines through a haze of falling snow that became bewilderingly thick at times but the steamer slid on through it with whistle hooting at last toward sunset the snow cleared away and agatha stood shivering under a deckhouse she looked about her with a curiously heavy heart  a gray haze stretched across the great river which was dim and gray and odd wisps of pines rose raggedly beneath the white hills that cut against a gloomy lowering sky deckhouse boat and stanchion dripped and every now and then the silence was broken by a doleful blast of the whistle nothing moved on the still gray water there was no sign of life ashore and they seemed to be steaming into a great desolation  presently wyllard appeared from somewhere and after a glance at her face slipped his hand beneath her arm and led her down to the lighted saloon there her heart grew a little lighter once more she was conscious of the feeling that she was safe with him     chapter x  disillusion   the long train was speeding smoothly across the vast white levels of assiniboia when agatha who sat by a window looked up as the conductor strode through the car mrs hastings asked him a question and he stopped a moment  yes he said well be in clermont inside half an hour  he went on and mrs hastings smiled at agatha  were a little late and gregory will be waiting for us in the station now she announced no doubt hes got the wagon fixed up right but id like to feel sure of it theres a long drive before us and i want to reach the homestead before its dark  agatha said nothing but a faint tinge of color crept into her cheeks and mrs hastings was glad to see it for she had noticed that the girl was looking pale and haggard the strain of the last few months that she had spent in england was beginning to tell on her she had borne it courageously but a reaction had set in and the trip had been fatiguing the scarrowmania had plunged along bows under against fresh northwesterly gales most of the way across the atlantic and there is very little comfort on board a small deeplyloaded steamer when she rolls her rails in and lurches with thudding screw swung clear over big steepsided combers moreover agatha had scarcely slept during the few days and nights that she had spent in the train it takes time to become accustomed to the atmosphere of a heated sleeper and since she had landed she had been in a state of not unnatural nervous tension  she had found it difficult to preserve an outward serenity the previous day when at last the great train ran into the depôt at winnipeg where gregory had arranged to meet them it was with a thrill of expectancy and relief that she stood upon the car platform there was however no sign of gregory and though wyllard handed her a telegram from him a few minutes later the fact that he had not arrived had a depressing effect on her quiet as she usually was the girl was highly strung something had gone wrong with hawtreys wagon while he was driving in to the railroad and as the result of it he had missed the atlantic train she could not blame him for the accident but for all that his absence was an unpleasant shock  feeling that her companions eyes were upon her she turned and looking out of the window found no encouragement in what she saw the snow had gone and a vast expanse of grass ran back to the horizon but it was a dingy grayishwhite and not green as it had been in england the sky was low and gray too and the only thing that broke the dreary monotony of lifeless color was the formless darker smear of a birch bluff that rose out of the empty levels her heart throbbed unpleasantly fast as the few remaining minutes slipped away she started when a dingy mass of something that looked like buildings lifted itself above the prairie  the clermont elevators said mrs hastings well be in directly  the mass separated itself into two or three tall component blocks a huddle of little wooden houses grew into shape beneath them and a shrill whistle came ringing back above the slowing cars a willow bluff half filled with old cans and garbage flitted by a big bell began tolling and agatha rose when mrs hastings took up her furs from a seat close by after that the girl found herself standing on the platform of the car though she did not quite know how she got there for she was sensible only of the fact that in another moment or two she would greet the lover whom she had not seen for four years  though she paid no great attention to them the surroundings had a depressing effect on her there was however very little to see the mass of the great elevators that were silhouetted against a lowering sky the little cluster of houses and the sea of churnedup mire between them and the track comprised clermont there appeared to be no station except a big water tank and a rather unsightly shed about which stood a group of blurred and shapeless figures it seemed very cold and agatha shivered as she felt the raw wind strike through her  one of the figures detached itself from the rest and grew clearer the man wore an old skin coat spattered with flakes of mire and his long boots were covered with clots of mud his fur cap looked greasy and the fur had been rubbed off it in patches but while agatha noticed these things it was hawtreys face that struck her most distinctly and she became conscious of an astonishment which was mixed with vague misgivings as she gazed at it for it had subtly changed since she had last seen it the joyous sparkle that she remembered had gone out of the eyes they were harder bolder than they used to be the mouth was slackit looked almost sensualand the mans whole personality seemed to have grown coarser as she thrust the disconcerting fancies from her the car stopped  illustration she was conscious of a certain shrinking from his embrace page 107  in another moment hawtrey sprang up on the platform and his arms were about her that brought the blood to her face but she felt none of the thrill that she had expected indeed she was conscious of a certain shrinking from his embrace he must have lifted her down for when she was next aware of the presence of the friends with whom she had traveled she stood beside the track with mrs hastings a man whom she supposed to be mr hastings winifred and wyllard about her another man also was standing close by apparently waiting until they noticed him he was covered with mire his skin coat was very dilapidated and agatha thought that his boots never had been cleaned his hair which had evidently been badly cut straggled out from under his old fur cap  gregory apparently explained something to mrs hastings no he said im sorry it cant be for another week horribly unfortunate it seems theyve sent the methodist on down the line and well have to wait for the episcopalian hell be at landers for a few days  agathas cheeks flamed for she realized that it was her wedding of which they were speaking but it brought her a curious relief to hear that it had been deferred a moment or two later gregory turned to her with questions about his people in england  winifred had separated herself from the group she was standing near her baggage which had been flung out beside the track when wyllard strode up to her  feeling rather out of it i do any way he remarked since we appear superfluous we may as well make the most of the opportunity especially as it will probably save you a long drive theres a man here who wants to see you  winifred had felt forlorn a few moments earlier but the announcement wyllard made was reassuring and she brightened perceptibly as he signaled to a man who was standing a little further along the track the stranger wore rather good store clothes and his manner was brisk and wholly businesslike it was a certain relief to the girl to see that he evidently regarded her less as a personality than as a piece of commercial machinery of which apparently he had been asked to make use she had found it easier to get on with men who looked upon her as merely part of the office equipment  mr hamilton is in charge of the elevator yonder explained wyllard pointing to one of the huge buildings  then he introduced miss rawlinson  the elevator man made her the curtest of bows and proceeded to arrange matters with a rapidity which almost took her breath away  typist and stenographer he asked know anything about keeping accounts  winifred admitted that she possessed these qualifications and hamilton appeared to reflect for a moment or two  well he said in a fortnight well give you a show you can start at and he mentioned terms which rather astonished winifred if you can keep things straight we may raise you later  wont you want to see any testimonials she asked  no answered hamilton ive seen a good many and im inclined to believe some of the folks who showed them to me must have bought them he waved his hand mr wyllard assures me that youll do and thats quite enough for me  it struck winifred as curious that while agatha had written to hawtrey on her behalf it was wyllard who had secured her the opportunity for which she had longed  theres another matter she said hesitatingly when she was left with wyllard ill have to live here  wyllard smiled ive seen to that though if you dont like my arrangements you can alter them afterwards mrs sandberg will take you in shes a scotch calvinist and even if she isnt particularly amiable youll be in safe hands well consider it as fixed but youre to stay with mrs hastings for a fortnight sproatlyhe signed to the man in the skin coatwill you get miss rawlinsons baggage into your wagon  the man took off his fur cap if miss rawlinson would like to see mrs sandberg ill drive her round he suggested well catch you in a league or so gregory has a bit of patching to do on his offside trace  he might have had things straight for once grumbled wyllard halfaloud  winifred permitted sproatly to help her into his wagona high narrowbodied vehicle mounted on tall spidery wheelsbut she had to hold fast to the seat while they jolted across the track and through a sea of mire into the unpaved street of the little town she liked sproatlys voice and manner though she was far from prepossessed by his appearance two or three minutes later he stopped before a little wooden house where they were received by a tall hardfaced woman who frowned at the man  yell tak your patent medicines somewhere else im wanting none she said  sproatly grinned you neednt be afraid of them they couldnt hurt you i was talking to a winnipeg doctor whod a notion of coming out a day or two ago i told him if he did hed have to bring an ax along  then he explained that wyllard had sent miss rawlinson there and the woman favored her with a glance of careful scrutiny  weel she said ye look quiet anyway she added as if further satisfied ill make ye a cup of tea if ye can wait  sproatly assured her that they had not time to accept her hospitality the girl went into the house for a few moments and returned to the wagon with relief in her face  i think i owe mr wyllard a good deal she said  sproatly laughed youre not exactly unusual in that respect he declared as he started the horses but you had better hold tight these beasts are less than half broken  he flicked the horses with the whip and they went across the track at a gallop hurling great clods of mud left and right while the group of loungers who still stood about the station raised a shout  got any little pictures with nice motters on them asked one and another flung a piece of information after the jolting wagon  theres a swede down at brankers wants a bottle that will limber up a wooden leg he said  sproatly grinned and waved his hands to them before he turned to winifred  we have to get through before dark if possible or id stop and sell them something sure he said parts of the trail further on are simply horrible  it occurred to winifred that the road was far from good as it was for spouts of mud flew up beneath the sinking hoofs and wheels and she was already unpleasantly spattered  you think you would have succeeded making a sale she asked with amusement in her eyes  oh yes sproatly answered confidently if i couldnt plant something on to them when theyd given me a lead like that id be no use in this business at present my command of western phraseology is my fortune  you sell things then  sproatly pointed to two big boxes in the bottom of the wagon anything from cough cure to hair restorer besides a general purpose elixir thats specially prepared for me its adaptable to any complaint and season all you have to doand he lowered his voice confidentlyis to put on a different label  winifred laughed when she met his eyes  what happens to the people who buy it she inquired  most of them are bachelors and tough theyve stood their own cooking so long that they ought to be impervious to anything and if anybodys really sick i hold off and tell him to wait until he can get a doctor a sensitive conscience he added reflectively is quite a handicap in this business  you have always been in it asked winifred  no replied sproatly although you mightnt believe it i was raised with the idea that i should have my choice between the church and the bar the idea however provedimpracticablewhich is rather a pity it has seemed to me that a man who can work off cough cures and cosmetics on to healthy folks and talk a scoffer off the field ought to have made his mark in either calling  he looked at her as if for confirmation of this view but winifred who laughed again glanced at the two wagons that several miles away moved across the graywhite sweep of prairie  shall we overtake them she asked  well probably come up with gregory im not sure about wyllard  he drives faster horses  thats not quite the reason gregory has patched up one trace with a bit of string and odd bolts are rather addicted to coming out of his wagon sometimes it makes trouble ive known the team to leave him sitting on the prairie thinking of endearing names for them while they came home with the pole  does he generally let things fall into that state  sproatly was evidently on his guard  well he rejoined its certainly that kind of wagon  he flicked the team again and the jolting rendered it difficult for winifred to ask any more questions the prairie sod was soft with the thaw and big lumps of it stuck to the wheels which every now and then plunged into ruts the other vehicles had made  in the meanwhile agatha and hawtrey had found it almost impossible to sustain a conversation it was a relief to the girl to be able to sit silent and observant beside the man whom she had promised to marry the stringpatched trace still held and the wagon pole was a new one the white grass was tussocky and long and the trail here and there had been churned into quagmire hawtrey had packed the thick drivingrobe high about agatha and had slipped one arm about her waist beneath it but she was conscious that she rather suffered this than derived any satisfaction from it she strove to assure herself that she was jaded with the journey which was in fact the case and that the lowering sky and the cheerless waste they were crossing had occasioned the dejection that she felt there was not a tree upon the vast sweep of bleached grass which ran all around her to the horizon it was inexpressibly lonely a lifeless desolation with only the plowedup trail to show that man had ever traversed it the raw wind which came across the prairie set her shivering  she was forced however to admit that her weariness and the dreary surroundings did not quite explain everything gregorys first embrace had brought her no happiness and now the close pressure of his arm left her quite unmoved this was disconcerting but while she would admit no definite reason for it there was creeping upon her a vague consciousness that the man beside her was not the one of whom she had so often thought in england he seemed differentalmost in fact a strangerthough she could not exactly tell where the change in him began his laughter jarred upon her some of the things he said appeared almost inane and others were tinged with a selfconfidence that did not become him it seemed to her that he was shallow and lacking in comprehension once she found herself comparing him with another man she broke off that train of thought abruptly and once more endeavored to find the explanation in herself weariness had produced this captious hypercritical fit and by and by she would become used to him she said  hawtrey was at least not effusive for which she was thankful when they reached a smoother stretch of road he began to talk of england  i suppose you saw a good deal of my folks when you were at the grange he said  no answered agatha i saw them once or twice  ah he replied with a trace of sharpness then they were not particularly agreeable  it seemed to agatha that he was tactless in suggesting anything of the kind but she replied candidly  one could hardly go quite so far as that she told him still i couldnt help a feeling that it was rather an effort for them to be gracious to me  they did what they could to make things pleasant when they were first told of our engagement  agatha was too weary to be altogether on her guard his relatives attitude had wounded her and she answered without reflection  i have fancied that was because they never quite believed it would lead to anything  she knew this was the truth now though it was the first time the explanation had occurred to her gregorys relatives who were naturally acquainted with his character had not expected him to carry out his promise she felt that she had been injudicious in what she told him when she heard his harsh laugh  im afraid they never had a very great opinion of me he remarked  then said agatha looking up at him it will be our business to prove them wrong but i cant help feeling that you have undertaken a big responsibility gregory there must be so much that i ought to do and i know so little about your work in this country she turned and glanced with a shiver at the dim white prairie the land looks so forbidding and unyielding it must be very hard to turn it into wheat fieldsto break it in  it was merely a hint of what she felt and it was rather a pity that hawtrey who lacked imagination usually contented himself with the most obvious meaning of the spoken word things might have gone differently had he responded with comprehending sympathy  oh he said with a laugh that changed her mood youll learn and i dont suppose it will matter a great deal if you dont do it quickly somehow or other one worries through  she felt that this was insufficient though she remembered that his haphazard carelessness had once appealed to her now she realized that to undertake a thing lightheartedly was a very different matter from carrying it out successfully then it once more occurred to her that she was becoming absurdly hypercritical and she strove to talk of other things  she did not find it easy nor though he made the effort did hawtrey there was a restraint upon him for when he first saw her he had been struck by the change in the girl she was graver than he remembered her and it seemed very much more reserved he had tried and failed as he thought of it to strike any response in her he became uneasily conscious that he could not talk to her as he could to sally creighton there was something wanting in him or her but he could not at the moment tell what it was still he assured himself things would be different next day for the girl was evidently very tired  the creeping dusk settled down upon the wilderness the horizon narrowed and the stretch of grass before them grew dim the trail they now drove into grew rapidly rougher and it was quite dark when they came to the brink of a declivity still at least a league from the hastings homestead it was one of the steep ravines that seam the prairie a birch bluff rose on either side and a little creek flowed through the hollow  hawtrey swung the whip when they reached the top and the team plunged furiously down the slope he straightened himself in his seat with both hands on the reins and agatha held her breath when she felt the light vehicle tilt as the wheels on one side sank deep in a rut something seemed to crack and she saw the off horse stumble and plunge the other horse flung its head up hawtrey shouted something and there was a great smashing and snapping of undergrowth and fallen branches as they drove in among the birches the team stopped and hawtrey who sprang down floundered noisily among the undergrowth while another thud of hoofs and rattle of wheels grew louder behind them up the trail in a minute or two hawtrey came back and lifted agatha down  its the trace broken i had to make the holes with my knife and the strings torn through he explained voltigeur got it round his feet and as usual tried to bolt well make the others pull up and take you in  they went back to the trail together and reached it just as hastings reined in his team hastings got down and walked back with hawtrey to the stalled wagon it was a minute or two before they reappeared again and mrs hastings who had alighted drew hawtrey aside  i almost think it would be better if you didnt come any further tonight she said  why gregory asked sharply  i cant help thinking that agatha would prefer it for one thing shes rather jaded and wants quiet  you feel sure of that  there was something in the mans voice which suggested that he was not quite satisfied and mrs hastings was silent a moment  its good advice gregory she said shell be better able to face the situation after a nights rest  does it require much facing hawtrey asked dryly  mrs hastings turned from him with a sign of impatience of course it does anyway if youre wise youll do what i suggest and ask no more questions  then she got into the wagon and hawtrey stood still beside the trail feeling unusually thoughtful as they drove away     chapter xi  agathas decision   it was with an expectancy which was toned down by misgivings that hawtrey drove over to the homestead where agatha was staying the next afternoon the misgivings were not unnatural for he had been chilled by the girls reception of him on the previous day and her manner afterwards had he felt left something to be desired indeed when she drove away with mrs hastings he had considered himself an injured man  his efforts to mend the harness and extricate the wagon in the dark which occupied him for an hour had helped partly to drive the matter from his mind and when he reached his homestead rather late that night he went to sleep and slept soundly until sunrise hawtrey was a man who never brooded over his troubles beforehand and this was one reason why he did not always cope with them successfully when they could no longer be avoided  when he had eaten his breakfast however he became sensible of a certain pique against both mrs hastings and agatha in planning for the day he was forced to remember that he had no hired man and that there was a good deal to be done he decided that it might be well to wait until the afternoon before he called on agatha and for several hours he drove his team through the crackling stubble his doubts and irritation grew weaker as he worked and when later he drove into sight of the hastings homestead his buoyant temperament was beginning to reassert itself clear sunshine streamed down upon the prairie out of a vault of cloudless blue and he felt that any faint shadow that might have arisen between him and the girl could be readily swept away he was a little less sure of this when he saw agatha who sat near an open window in a scantily furnished matchboarded room she had not slept at all her eyes were heavy but there was a look of resolution in them which seemed out of place just then and it struck him that she had lost the freshness which had been her distinguishing charm in england  she rose when he came in and then to his astonishment drew back a pace or two when he moved impulsively towards her  no she said with a hand raised restrainingly you must hear what i have to say and try to bear with me it is a little difficult gregory but it must be said at once  gregory stood still gazing at her with consternation in his face and for a moment she looked steadily at him it was a painful moment for she was gifted with a clearness of vision which she almost longed to be delivered from she saw that the impression which had brought her a vague sense of dismay on the previous afternoon was wrong the trouble was that he had not changed at all he was what he had always been and she had merely deceived herself when she had permitted her girlish fancy to endow him with qualities and graces which he had never possessed there was however no doubt that she had still a duty toward him  he spoke first with a trace of hardness in his voice  then he rejoined wont you sit down this is naturally a littleembarrassingbut ill try to listen  agatha sank into a seat by the open window for she felt physically worn out and before her there was a task from which she shrank  gregory she began i feel that we have come near making what might prove to be a horrible mistake  we repeated hawtrey while the blood rose into his weatherdarkened face that means both of us  yes asserted agatha with a steadiness that cost her an effort  hawtrey went a step nearer to her do you want me to admit that ive made a mistake  are you quite sure you havent  she flung the question at him sharply with tense apprehension for after all if gregory was sure of himself there was only one course open to her he leaned upon the table gazing at her and as he studied her face his indignation melted and doubts crept into his mind  she looked weary and grave almost haggard and it was a fresh lighthearted girl with whom he had fallen in love in england the mark of the last two years of struggle was plain on her he tried to realize what he had looked for when he had asked her to marry him and could not get a clear conception of his vision in the back of his mind was a halfformulated idea that he had dreamed of a cheerful companion somebody to amuse him she scarcely seemed likely to be entertaining now  gregory was not a man who could face a crisis collectedly and his thoughts became confused until one idea emerged from them he had pledged himself to her and the fact laid a certain obligation upon him it was his part to overrule any fancies she might be disposed to indulge in  well he said stoutly im not going to admit anything of that kind the journey has been too much for you you havent got over it yet he lowered his voice and his face softened aggy dear ive waited four years for you  his words stirred her for they were certainly true and his gentleness had also its effect the situation was becoming more and more difficult since it seemed impossible to make him understand that he would in all probability speedily tire of her to make it clear that she could never be satisfied with him was a thing from which she shrank  how have you passed those four years she asked to gain time  for a moment his conscience smote him he remembered the trips to winnipeg and the dances to which he had escorted sally creighton it was however evident that agatha could have heard nothing of sally  i spent them in hard work i wanted to make the place comfortable for you he answered it is trueand he added this with a twinge of uneasiness as he remembered that his neighbors had done much more with less incentivethat its still very far from what i would like but things have been against me  the speech had a far stronger effect than he could have expected for agatha remembered wyllards description of what the prairie farmer had to face those four years of determined effort and patient endurance as she pictured them counted heavily against her in the mans favor it flashed upon her that after all there might have been some warrant for the view that she had held of gregorys character when he had fallen in love with her he was younger then there must have been latent possibilities in him but the years of toil had killed them and hardened him it was for her sake he had made the struggle and now it seemed unthinkable that she should renounce him because he came to her with the dust and stain of it upon him for all that she was possessed with a feeling that she would involve them both in disaster if she yielded something warned her that she must stand firm  gregory she said i seem to know that we should both be sorry afterwards if i kept my promise  hawtrey straightened himself with a smile that she recognized she had liked him for it once for it had then suggested the joyous courage of untainted youth now however it struck her as merely hinting at empty complacent assurance she hated herself for the fancy but it would not be driven away  well he replied im quite willing to face that hazard i suppose this diffidence is only natural aggy but its a little hard on me  no replied the girl with emphasis its horribly unnatural and thats why im afraid i should have come to you gladly without a misgiving feeling that nothing could hurt me if i was with you i wanted to do that gregoryi meant tobut i cant then her voice fell to a tone that had vibrant regret in it you should have made sureyou should have married me when you last came home  but id nowhere to take you the farm was only halfbroken prairie the homestead almost unhabitable  agatha winced at this it was no doubt true but it seemed horribly petty and commonplace his comprehension stopped at such details as these and he had given her no credit for the courage which would have made light of bodily discomfort  do you think that would have mattered we were both very young then and we could have faced our troubles and grown up together now were not the same you let me grow up alone  hawtrey shrugged his shoulders i havent changed he told her as she looked at him with deepseeing eyes  he contented himself with that and agatha grew more resolute there was not a spark of imagination in him scarcely even a spark of the passion which if it had been strong enough might have swept her away in spite of her shrinking he was a man of comely presence whimsical and quick as she remembered at light badinage but when there was a crisis to be grappled with he somehow failed his graces were on the surface there was no depth in him  aggy he added humbly when he should have been dominant and forceful it is only a question of a little time you will get used to me  then pleaded the girl who clutched at the chance of respite give me six months from today it isnt very much to ask gregory  gregory wrinkled his brows its a great deal he answered slowly i feel that we shall drift further and further apart if once i let you go  then you feel that we have drifted a little already  i dont know what has come over you aggy but there has been a change im what i was and i want to keep you  agatha rose and turned towards him a white face if you are wise you will not urge me now she said  hawtrey met her gaze for a moment and then made a sign of acquiescence as he turned his eyes away he recognized that this was a new agatha one whose will was stronger than his yet he was astonished that he had yielded so readily  well he agreed if it must be i can only give way to you but i must be free to come over here whenever i wish suddenly a thought struck him but you may hare to go away he added with sudden concern if i am to wait six months what are you to do in the meanwhile  agatha smiled wearily now that the respite had been granted her the question he had raised was not one that caused her any great concern  oh she answered we can think of that later i have borne enough today this has been a little hard upon me gregory  i dont think it has been particularly easy for either of us returned hawtrey with grimness anyway it seems that im only distressing you there was a baffled puzzled look in his face naturally this is so unexpected that i dont know what to say ill come back when i feel ive grasped the situation  taking one of her hands he stooped and kissed her cheek  my dear he said i only want to make it as easy as i can youll try to think of me favorably  he went out and left her sitting beside the open window a warm breeze swept into the room outside a blaze of sunshine rested on the prairie the ground about the house was torn up with wheel ruts for the wooden building rose abruptly without fence or garden from the waste of whitened grass close to the house stood a birchlog barn or stables its sides curiously ridged and furrowed where the trunks were laid on one another further away rose a long building of sod and a great shapeless yellow mound with a domed top towered behind it it was most unlike a trim english rick and agatha wondered what it could be as a matter of fact it was a not uncommon form of granary the straw from the last thrashing flung over a birchpole framing behind it ran a great breadth of kneehigh stubble blazing ocher and cadmium in the sunlight it had evidently extended further than it did for a blackened space showed where a fire had been lighted to destroy it in the big field hastings was plowing clad in blue duck he plodded behind his horses which stopped now and then when the share jarred against a patch of still frozen soil further on two other men silhouetted in blue against the whitened grass drove spans of slowly moving oxen that hauled big breaker plows and the lines of clods that lengthened behind them gleamed in the sunlight a rich chocolatebrown beyond them the wilderness ran unbroken to the horizon  agatha gazed at it all vacantly but the newness and strangeness of it reacted upon her she felt very desolate and lonely but she remembered that she must still grapple with a practical difficulty she could not stay with mrs hastings indefinitely and she had not the least notion where to go or what she was to do she was leaning back in her chair wearily with halfclosed eyes when her hostess came in and looked at her with a smile that suggested comprehension mrs hastings was thin and seemed a trifle worn but she had shrewd kindly eyes she wore a plain print dress which was dusted here and there with flour  so you have sent him away she exclaimed  it was borne in upon agatha that she could be candid with this woman who had already guessed the truth  yes she replied for six months that is we are not to decide on anything until they have passed i felt we must get used to each other it seemed best  to you did it seem best to gregory  a flush crept into agathas face though his acquiescence had been a relief to her she felt that he might have made a more vigorous protest  he gave in to me she answered  mrs hastings looked thoughtful well she observed i believe you were wise but that opens up another question what are you going to do in the meanwhile  i dont know confessed agatha apathetically i suppose i shall have to go awayto winnipeg most probably i could teach i think  how are you and gregory to get used to each other if you go away  agatha made a helpless gesture i hadnt looked at it in that light  are you very anxious to get used to him  agatha shrank from the question but there was a constraining kindliness in the older womans eyes  i darent quite think about it yet i mean to try i must try i seem to be playing an utterly contemptible selfish part but i could not marry himnow  mrs hastings crossed the room and sat down by her side  my dear she said as i told you i think you are doing right and i believe i know how you feel everybody prophesied disaster when i came out to join allen from a sheltered home in montreal and at the beginning my life here was not easy to me it was all so different and there were times when i was afraid and my heart was horribly heavy if it hadnt been for allen i think i should have given in and broken down he understood however he never failed me  agathas eyes grew misty and she turned her head away  yes she replied that would make it wonderfully easier  you must forgive me apologized mrs hastings i was tactless but i didnt mean to hurt you well one difficulty shouldnt give us very much trouble why shouldnt you stay here with me  agatha turned towards her abruptly with a look of relief in her face which faded quickly she liked this woman and she liked her husband but she remembered that she had no claim on them  oh she declared it is out of the question  wait a little im proposing to give you quite as much as you will probably care to do there are my two little girls to teach and i think they have rather taken to you i can scarcely find a minute for their lessons and as you have seen there is a piano which has only a few of the keys broken besides we have only one scandinavian maid who smashes everything that isnt made of indurated fiber and im afraid shell marry one of the boys in a month or two it was only by sending the kiddies to brandon and getting mrs creighton a neighbor of ours to look after allen who insisted on my going that i was able to get to paris with some montreal friends in any case youd have no end of duties  you are doing this out ofcharity  mrs hastings laughed a week or two ago allen wrote to some friends of his in winnipeg asking them to send me anybody  the girls eyes shone mistily oh she cried you have lifted one weight off my mind  i think observed mrs hastings the others will also be removed in due time  after that she talked cheerfully of other matters and agatha listened to her with a vague wonder at her own good fortune in falling in with such a friend  there are in that country many men and women who are unfettered by conventions they stretch out an open hand to the stranger and the outcast toil has brought them charity in place of hardness and still retaining as some of them do the culture of the cities they have outgrown all the petty bonds of caste the wheatgrower and the hiredman eat together rights are goodhumoredly conceded in place of being fought for and the sense of grievance and halfveiled suspicion common elsewhere among employes are exchanged for an efficient cooperation it must however be admitted that there are also farmers of another kind from whom the hired man has occasionally some difficulty in extracting his covenanted wages by personal violence  the two women had been talking a long time when a team and a jolting wagon swept into sight and mrs hastings rose as the man who drove pulled up his horses  its sproatly i wonder what has brought him here she remarked  the man sprang down from the wagon and walked towards the house she gazed at him almost incredulously  hes quite smart she added i dont see a single patch on that jacket and he has positively got his hair cut  is that an unusual thing in mr sproatlys case agatha inquired  yes said mrs hastings its very unusual indeed what is stranger still he has taken the old greasespotted band off his hat after clinging to it affectionately for the last twelve months  agatha thought that the soft hat which fell shapelessly over part of sproatlys face needed something to replace the discarded band but in another moment he entered the room he shook hands with them both  you are looking remarkably fresh but appearances are not invariably to be depended on and its advisable to keep the system up to par he said with a smile i suppose you dont want a tonic of any kind  i dont declared mrs hastings resolutely allen doesnt either besides didnt you get into some trouble over that tonic  it was the cough cure explained sproatly with a grin i sold a man at landers one of the largesized bottles and when he had taken some he felt a good deal better then he seems to have argued the thing out like this if one dose had relieved the cough a dozen should drive it out of him altogether and he took the lot he slept for fortyeight hours afterward and when i came across him at the settlement he attacked me with a club the fault i may point out was in his logic perhaps you would like some pictures ive a rather striking oleograph of the kaiser it must be like him for two of his subjects recognized it one hung it up in his shanty the other asked me to hold it out and then pitched a stove billet through the middle of it he however produced his dollar he said he felt so much better after what hed done that he didnt grudge it  im afraid were not worth powder and shot said mrs hastings do you ever remember our buying any tonics or pictures from you  i dont though i have felt that you ought to have done it sproatly who paused a moment turned towards agatha with a little whimsical bow the professional badinage of an unlicensed dealer in patent medicines may now and then mercifully cover a good deal of embarrassment miss ismay has brought something pleasantly characteristic of the old country along with her  his hostess disregarded the last remark then if you didnt expect to sell us anything what did you come for  for supper answered sproatly cheerfully besides that to take miss rawlinson out for a drive i told her last night it would afford me considerable pleasure to show her the prairie we could go round by landers and back  then you will probably come across her somewhere about the strawpile with the kiddies  sproatly took the hint and when he went out mrs hastings laughed  you would hardly suppose that was a young man of excellent education she exclaimed so its on winifreds account he has driven over at first i fancied it was on yours  agatha was astonished but she smiled if winifred favors him with her views about young men he will probably be rather sorry for himself he lives near you  no said mrs hastings in the summer he lives in his wagon or under it i dont know which of course if hes really taken with winifred he will have to alter that  but he has only seen her onceyou cant mean that he is serious  i really cant speak for sproatly but it would be quite in keeping with the customs of the country if he was  a minute or two later agatha saw winifred in the wagon when it reappeared from behind the strawpile and mrs hastings turned toward the window  she has gone with him she commented significantly unfortunately he has taken my kiddies too if he brings them back with no bones broken it will be a relief to me     chapter xii  wanderers   agatha had spent a month with mrs hastings when they were driving over to wyllards homestead one afternoon the older woman pulled up her team while they were still some little distance away from their destination and looked about her with evident interest on the one hand a vast breadth of tornup loam ran back across the prairie which was now faintly flecked with green on the other plowing teams were scattered here and there across the tussocky sod and long lines of clods that flashed where the sunlight struck their facets trailed out behind them the great sweep of grasses that rustled joyously before a glorious warm wind gleamed luminously and overhead hung a vault of blue without a cloud in it trailing out across it flocks of birds moved up from the south  harry is sowing a very big crop this year and most of it on fall backset she observed he has however horses enough to do that kind of thing and of course he does it thoroughly she glanced toward the place where the teams were hauling unusually heavy plows through the grassy sod this is virgin prairie that hes breaking and hell probably put oats on it they ripen quicker he ought to be a rich man after harvest unless the frost comes or the market goes against him some of his neighbors including my husband would have sown a little less and held a reserve in hand  agatha remembered what wyllard had told her one night on board the scarrowmania and smiled for she fancied that she understood the man he was not one to hedge as she had heard it called or cautiously hold his hand he staked boldly but she felt that this was not only for the sake of the money that he might hope to gain it was part of his naturethe result of an optimistic faith or courage that appealed to her and sheer love of effort she also guessed that his was not a spasmodic impulsive activity she could imagine him holding on as steadfastly with everything against him exacting all that men and teams and machines could do it struck her as curious that she should feel so sure of this but she admitted that it was the case  sitting in the drivingseat of a big machine that ripped broad furrows through the crackling sod he was approaching them four horses plodded wearily in front of the giant plow until he thrust one hand over and there was a rattle and clanking as he swung them and the machine around beside the wagon then he got down and stood smiling up at agatha with his soft hat in his hand and the sunlight falling full upon his weatherdarkened face it was not a particularly striking face but there was something in it a hint of restrained force and steadfastness she thought which gregorys did not possess and for a moment or two she watched him covertly  he wore an old blue shirt open at the throat and belted into trousers of blue duck and she noticed the fine symmetry of his spare figure the absence of any superfluous flesh struck her as in keeping with her view of his character the man was wellendowed physically but apart from the strong vitality that was expressed in every line of his pose he looked clean as she vaguely described it to herself there was an indefinable something about him that was apparently born of a simple healthful life spent in determined labor in the open air it became plainer as she remembered other men upon whom the mark of the beast was unmistakably set mrs hastings broke the silence  well she said we have driven over as we promised ive no doubt you will give us supper but well go on and sit with mrs nansen in the meanwhile i expect youre too busy to talk to us  wyllard laughed and it occurred to agatha that his laugh was wholesome as well as pleasant  i generally am busy he admitted these horses have been at it since sunup and theyre rather played out now ill talk to you as long as you will let me after supper which will soon be ready  agatha noticed that though the near horses coat was foul with dust and sweat he laid his brown hand upon it and it seemed to her that the gentleness with which he did it was very suggestive  mrs hastings who had been scrutinizing the field asked whats to be the result of all this plowing if we have harvest frost or the market goes against you  quite a big deficit answered wyllard cheerfully  and that doesnt cause you any anxiety  ill have had some amusement for my money  mrs hastings turned to agatha he calls working from sunrise until its dark and afterwards now and then amusement she looked back at wyllard i believe it isnt quite easy for you to hold your back as straight as you are doing and that offhorse certainly looks as if it wanted to lie down  wyllard laughed it wont until after supper anyway there are two more rows of furrows still to do  i suppose that is a hint mrs hastings glanced at agatha when the wagon jolted on  that man she said is a great favorite of mine for one thing hes fastidious though hes fortunately very far from perfect in some respects he has a redhot temper which now and then runs away with him  what do you mean by fastidious  its a little difficult to define but i certainly dont mean pernicketty of course there is a fastidiousness which makes one shrink from unpleasant things but harrys is the other kind it impels him to do them every now and then  agatha made no answer she was uneasily conscious that it might not be advisable to think too much about this man and in another minute or two they reached the homestead the house was a plain frame building that had grown out of an older and smaller one of logs part of which remained it was much the same with the barns and stables for while they were stoutly built of framed timber or logs one end of most of them was lower than the rest and in some cases consisted of poles and sods even to her untrained eyes all she saw suggested order neatness and efficiency the whole was flanked and sheltered by a big birch bluff in which trunks and branches showed through a thin green haze of tiny opening leaves  a man whom wyllard had sent after them took the horses  agatha commented on what she called the addedto look of the buildings  the range said mrs hastings has grown rapidly since harry took hold the old part represents the highwater mark of his fathers efforts of course she added reflectively harry has had command of some capital since a relative of his died but i never thought that explained everything  they entered the house and a grayhaired swedish woman led them through several matchboarded rooms into a big cool hall she left them there for a while and agatha was absorbed for a minute or two with her impressions of the house it was singularly empty by comparison with the few english homesteads that she had seen there were no curtains nor carpets nor hangings of any kind but it was commodious and comfortable  what can a bachelor want with a place like this she asked  i dont know answered mrs hastings perhaps its harrys idea of having everything proportionate the range is quite a big and generally a prosperous farm besides its likely that he doesnt contemplate remaining a bachelor forever indeed allen and i sometimes wonder how he has escaped marriage for so long  is escaped the right word agatha asked  it is asserted mrs hastings with a laugh you see hes highly eligible from our point of view but at the same time hes apparently invulnerable i believe she added dryly thats the right word too  the swedish housekeeper appeared again and they talked with her until she went to bring in the six oclock supper soon after the table was laid wyllard and the men came in wyllard was attired as when agatha had last seen him except that he had put on a coat he led his guests to the head of the long table but the menthere were a number of themsat below and evidently had no diffidence about addressing question or comment to their employer  the men ate with a voracious haste but that appeared to be the custom of the country and agatha could find no great fault with their manners or conversation the talk was for the most part quaintly witty and some of the men used what struck her as remarkably fitting and original similes indeed as the meal proceeded she became curiously interested  the windows were open wide and a sweet warm air swept into the barely furnished room the spaciousness of the room impressed her and she was pleased with the evident unity of these brownfaced strongarmed toilers with their leader at the head of the table he sat selfcontained but courteous and responsive to all alike and though they were in an essentially democratic country she felt that there was something almost feudal in the relations between him and his men she could not imagine them to be confined to the mere exaction of so much labor and the expectation of payment of wages due she was pleased that he had not changed his clothing  so strong was agathas interest that she was surprised when the meal was finished afterward she and mrs hastings talked with the housekeeper for a while and an hour had slipped away when wyllard suggested that he should show her the slough beyond the bluff  its the nearest approach to a lake we have until you get to the alkali tract he said  agatha went with him through the shadow of the wood and when they came out among the trees he found her a seat upon a fallen birch the house and plowing were hidden now and they were alone on the slope to a slight hollow in which half a mile of gleaming water lay its surface was broken here and there by tussocks of grass and reeds and beyond it the prairie ran back unbroken a dim gray waste to the horizon the sun had dipped behind the bluff and the sky had become a vast green transparency there was no wind now but a wonderful exhilarating freshness crept into the cooling air and the stillness was broken only by the clamor of startled wildfowl which agatha could see paddling in clusters about the gleaming slough  those are duckswild ones she asked  yes answered wyllard ducks of various kinds most of them the same as your english ones  do you shoot them  agatha was not greatly interested but he seemed disposed to silence and she felt for no very clear reason that it was advisable to talk of something  no he said not often anyway if mrs nansen wants a couple i crawl down to the long grass with the rifle and get them for her  the rifle doesnt the big bullet destroy them  no returned wyllard you have to shoot their head off or cut their neck in two  you can do thatwhen theyre right out in the slough asked agatha who had learned that it is much more difficult to shoot with a rifle than a shotgun which spreads its charge  wyllard smiled generally that is if i havent been doing much just before it depends upon ones hands we have our game laws but as a rule nobody worries about them and anyway those birds wont nest until they reach the tundra by the polar sea still as i said we never shoot them unless mrs nansen wants one or two for the pot  why  i dont quite know for one thing theyre worn out they just stop here to rest  his answer appealed to the girl it did not seem strange to her that the love of the lower creation should be strong in this man who had no hesitation in admitting that the game laws were no restraint to him when these lesser brethren worn with their journey sailed down out of the blue heavens he believed in giving them right of sanctuary  they have come a long way she asked  wyllard pointed towards the south from florida cuba yucatan further than that perhaps in a day or two theyll push on again toward the pole and others will take their places theres a further detachment arriving now  looking up agatha saw a straggling wedge of birds dotted in dusky specks against the vault of transcendental blue the wedge coalesced drew out again and dropped swiftly and the air was filled with the rush of wings then there was a harsh crying and splashing and she heard the troubled water lap among the reeds until deep silence closed in upon the slough again  the migrating instinct is strangely interesting she said  a curious look crept into wyllards eyes  it gives the poor birds a sad destiny i think theyre wanderers and strangers without a habitation theres unrest in them after a few months on the tundra mosses to gather strength and teach the young to fly theyll unfold their wings to beat another passage before the icy gales some of us i think are like them  agatha could not avoid the personal application  you surely dont apply that to yourself she said you certainly have a habitationthe finest isnt it on this part of the prairie  yes answered wyllard slowly i suppose it is ive now had a little rest and quietness too  his last remark did not appear to call for an answer and agatha sat silent  still he went on reflectively i have a feeling that some day the call will come and i shall have to take the trail again he paused and looked at her before he added it would be easier if one hadnt to go alone or since that would be necessary if one had at least something to come back to when the journey was done  must you heed the call asked agatha who was puzzled by his steady gaze  yes he said with gravity the call will come from the icy north if it ever comes at all  there was another brief silence agatha wondered what he was thinking of but he soon told her  i remember how i came back from there last time he said we were rather late that season and out of our usual beat when the gale broke upon us in the gateway of the pole between alaska and asia we ran before it with a strip of the boomforesail on one vessel and a jib that blew to ribands every now and then the schooner was small ninety tons or so and for a week she scudded with the gray seas tumbling after her whitetopped out of the snow and spume the waves ranged high above her taffrail curling horribly but one did not want to look at them the one man on deck had a line about him and he looked ahead watching the vessel screwing round with hoveup bows as she climbed the seas if hed let her fall off or claw up the next wave would have made an end of her he was kneedeep half the time in icy brine and his hands had split and opened with the frost but the sweat dripped from him as he clung to the jarring wheel the helmsmen had another trouble which preyed on them they were thinking of the three men they had left behind  well he added we ran out of the gale and i had bitter words to face when we reached vancouver as one result of the trouble i walked out of the city with four or five dollars in my pocketthough there was a share due to me then in an open car i rode up into the ranges to mend railroad bridges in the frost and snow it was not the kind of homecoming one would care to look forward to  ah agatha cried with a shudder it must have been horribly dreary  the man met her eyes yes he said youknow you came here from far away i think a little weary too and something failed you then you felt yourself adrift there wereit seemedonly strangers around you but you were wrong in one respect you were by no means a stranger to me  he had been leaning against a birch trunk but now he moved a little nearer and stood gravely looking down on her  you have sent gregory away he questioned  yes answered agatha and startled as she was it did not occur to her that the mere admission was misleading  wyllard stretched out his hands then wont you come to me  the blood swept into the girls face for the moment she forgot gregory and was conscious only of an unreasoning impulse which prompted her to take the hands held out to her she rose and faced wyllard with burning cheeks  you know nothing of me she said can you think that i would let you take me out of charity  again youre wrongon both points as i once told you i have sat for hours beside the fire beneath the pines or among the boulders with your picture for company when i was worn out and despondent you encouraged me you have been with me high up in the snow on the ranges and through leagues of shadowy bush that is not all there were times when as we drove the branch line up the gorge beneath the big divide all ones nature shrank from the monotony of brutal labor the paydays came around and opportunities were made for us to forget what we had borne and had still to bear then you laid a restraining hand on me i could not take your picture where you could not go is all that to count for nothing  he held out his arms to her as to the other question can you get beyond the narrow point of view were in a big new country where the old barriers are down were merely flesh and bloodred bloodand we speak as we feel admitting that i was sorry for youi amhow does that tell against meor you theres one thing only that counts at alli want you  agatha was stirred with an emotion that made her heart beat wildly he had spoken with a force and passion that had nearly swept her away with it the vigor of the new land throbbed in his voice and flinging aside all cramping restraints and conventions he had claimed her as primitive man claimed primitive woman her whole being responded to his love and gregory faded out of her mind but there was after all pride in her and she could not quite bring herself to look at life from his point of view all her prejudices and her traditions were opposed to it he had made a mistake when he had admitted that he was sorry for her she did not want his compassion and she shrank from the thought that she would marry himfor shelter it brought to her a sudden shameful confusion as she remembered the haste with which marriages were arranged on the prairie then as the first unreasoning impulse which had almost compelled her to yield to him passed away she reflected that it was scarcely two months since she had met him in england it was intolerable that he should think that she would be willing to fall into his arms merely because he had held them out to her  it is a little difficult to get beyond ones sense of what is fit she said youi must say againcant know anything about me you have woven fancies about that photograph but you must recognize that im not the girl you have created out of your reveries in all probability she is wholly unreal unnatural visionary agatha contrived to smile for she was recovering her composure perhaps it is easy when one has imagination to endow a person with qualities and graces that could never belong to them it must be easythough she was unconscious of it there was a trace of bitterness in her voicebecause i know i could do it myself  again the man held out his arms then he said simply wont you try if you can only feel sure that the person has the qualities you admire it is possible that he could acquire one or two  agatha drew back and ive changed ever so much since that photograph was taken she exclaimed with a catch in her voice  wyllard admitted it yes he said i recognized that you were a little immature then i know that nowbut all the graciousness and sweetness in you has grown and ripened what is more you have grown just as i seemed to know you would i saw that clearly the day we met beside the steppingstones i would have asked you to marry me in england only gregory stood in the way  the color ebbed suddenly out of the girls face as she remembered  gregory she declared in a strained voice stands in the way still i didnt send him away altogether im not sure i made that clear  wyllard stood very still for a moment or two  i wonder he said if theres anything significant in the fact that you gave me that reason last he failed you in some way  im not sure that i havent failed him but i cant go into that  again wyllard stood silent then he turned to her with a strong restraint in his face  gregory is a friend of mine he said there is at least one very good reason why i should remember it but it seems that somehow he hadnt the wit to keep you well i can only wait but when the time seems ripe i shall ask you again until then you have my promise that i will not say another word that could distress you perhaps i had better take you back to mrs hastings now  agatha turned away and they walked back together silently     chapter xiii  the summons   mrs hastings was standing beside her wagon in the gathering dusk when agatha and wyllard joined her after wyllard had helped the two women into the vehicle she looked down at him severely as she gathered up the reins  by this time allen will have had to put the kiddies to bed she said christina as you might have borne in mind goes over to branstocks every evening anyway youll drive across and see him about that team as soon as you can come to supper  ill try promised wyllard with a certain hesitation mrs hastings turned to agatha as they drove away  why did he look at you before he answered me she asked and laughed for there was just light enough left to show the color in the girls cheek well she added i told allen he was sure to be the first  agatha looked at her in evident bewilderment but she nodded yes she said of course i knew it would come everybody knows by now that you have fallen out with gregory  but as i told you i havent fallen out with him  you certainly havent married him and if you have said no to harry wyllard because you would sooner take gregory after all youre a singularly unwise young woman anyway youll have to meet harry when he comes to supper allens fond of a talk with him i cant have him kept away  i was a little afraid of that replied agatha slowly what makes the situation more difficult is that he told me he would ask me again  mrs hastings was thoughtful for a moment in that case he will in all probability do it but i dont think you need feel diffident about meeting him especially as you cant help it hell wait and say nothing until he considers it advisable  she changed the subject and talked about other matters until they reached the homestead  as the weeks went by agatha found that what mrs hastings had told her was warranted wyllard drove over every now and then but she was reassured by his attitude he greeted her with the quiet cordiality which had hitherto characterized him and it went a long way towards allaying the embarrassment of which she was conscious at first by and by however she felt no embarrassment at all in spite of the disturbing possibility that he might at some future time once more adopt the role of lover  in the meanwhile she realized that despite the efforts she made to think of him tenderly she was drifting further apart from gregory she had two other offers of marriage before the wheat had shot up a hands breadth above the rich black loam this was a matter of regret to her and though mrs hastings assured her that the boys would get over it she was rather shocked to hear that one of them had shortly afterwards involved himself in difficulties by creating a disturbance in winnipeg  the wheat however was growing tall when at mrs hastings request agatha drove over to willow range wyllard was out when they reached the homestead and leaving mrs hastings and his housekeeper together the girl wandered out into the open air she went through the birch bluff and towards the slough which had almost dried up now and it was with a curious stirring of confused feelings that she remembered what wyllard had said to her there through all her thoughts ran a regret that she had not met him four years earlier  regrets however were useless and in order to get rid of them she walked more briskly up a low rise of ground where the grass was already turning white again over the crest of the hill and down the side to another hollow the prairie rolled in wide undulations as the sea does when the swell of a distant gale underruns a glassy calm agatha had grown fond of the prairie its clear skies and fresh breezes had brought the color to her cheeks and given her composure though there were times when the knowledge that she was no nearer a decision in regard to gregory weighed heavily upon her she had seen very little of him and he had not been effusive then she could not guess what his feelings might be but it had been a relief to her when he had ridden away from the home of the hastingses for a while after she saw him he faded to an unsubstantial shadowy figure in the back of her mind  on this afternoon when agatha tried to put out of her mind the disturbing reflections that came to her as she walked the prairie stretched away before her gleaming in the sunlight under a vast sweep of cloudless blue she was halfway down the long slope when a clash and tinkle reached her and she noticed that a cloud of dust hung about the hollow where there had been another slough which evidently had dried up weeks before as men and horses were moving amid the dust she supposed that they were cutting prairie hay which grows longer in such places than it does upon the levels she went on another halfmile and then sat down for she had walked farther than she had intended to go she could now see the men more clearly and though it was fiercely hot they were evidently working at high pressure their blue duck clothing and bare brown arms appeared among the white and ocher tinting of the grass that seemed charged with brightness and the sounds of their activity came up to her she could distinguish the clashing tinkle of the mowers the crackle of the harsh stems and the rattle of wagon wheels  a great mound of gleaming grass overhanging two halfseen horses moved out of the slough and she watched it draw nearer until she made out wyllard sitting in the front of it she sat still until he pulled the team up close beside her and looked down with a smile  its almost two miles to the homestead if you could manage to climb up i could make you a comfortable place he said  agatha held her hands up with one foot upon a spoke of the wheels as wyllard leaned down and next moment she was lifted upwards she felt his supporting hand upon her waist then she found herself standing upon a narrow ledge clutching at the hay while he tore out several big armfuls of it and flung it back upon the top of the load  illustration the next moment she was lifted upwards page 146  now he announced i guess youll find that a snug enough nest  she sank into it with a sense of physical satisfaction the grass was soft and warm it was scented with the aromatic odors of wild peppermint and it yielded like a downy cushion beneath her limbs still she was just a little uneasy in mind for she fancied that she had seen a sudden sign of feeling in wyllards face when he had held her for a moment on the ledge of the wagon she glanced at him and was reassured he was looking straight before him with unwavering eyes and his face was set and quiet neither of them spoke until the team moved on then he turned to her  you wont be jolted much he assured her theyve been at it since four oclock this morning  that replied agatha must mean that you rose at three  wyllard smiled as a matter of fact it was halfpast two there was no dew last night and we started early ive several extra teams this year and theres a good deal of hay to cut of course we have to get it in the sloughs or any damp place where its long we dont sow grass and we have no meadows like those there are in england  agatha understood that he meant to talk about matters of no particular consequence as he usually did she had noticed a vein of poetic imagination in him and his idea that she had been with him through the snow of the lonely ranges and the gloom of the great forests of the pacific slope appealed to her since the day when he told her that he loved her he had spoken only of commonplace subjects sitting close beside him in the hay she decided to let him talk about his farm while she listened halfabsently  but you have a foreman who could see the teams turned out havent you she asked going back to the subject of his early rising  i had but he left me three or four days ago its a pity since ive taken up rather more than i can handle this year  then why didnt you keep him  martial was a little mulish and im afraid im troubled with a shortness of temper now and then we had a difference of opinion as to the best way to drive the mower into the slough and he didnt seem to recognize that he should have deferred to me unfortunately as the boys were standing by i had to insist upon his getting out of the saddle  he had turned a little further towards her and agatha noticed that there was a bruise upon one side of his face after what he had just told her the sight of it jarred upon her though she would not admit that there was any reason why it should she could not deny that on the prairie a resort to physical force might be warranted by the lack of any other remedy but it hurt her to think of him as descending to an open brawl with one of his men  then it occurred to her that the other man in all probability had suffered more and this brought her a certain sense of satisfaction which she admitted was more or less barbarous she had made it clear that wyllard was nothing to her but she could not help watching him as he lay back against the hay his wide hat set off his bronzed face which though not exactly handsome was pleasant and reassuring the dusty shirt and old blue trousers accentuated the long clean lines of his figure and she realized with a faint sense of anger that his mere physical perfection his strength and suppleness stirred her heart she recognized a feeling to be judiciously checked after all in spite of her denial of it she was endowed with power to love as women close to nature love with an emotion allencompassing and not subject to cold reasoning  they talked of trifles of no great consequence for both of them were conscious of the necessity for a certain reticence and when they reached the homestead agatha joined mrs hastings while wyllard pitched the hay off the wagon he came in to supper presently with about half of his men and they all sat down together in the long barely furnished room wyllard was unusually animated he drew mrs hastings into a bout of whimsical badinage which was interrupted when a beat of hoofs rose from the prairie  somebodys riding in i wonder what he wants remarked wyllard i certainly dont expect anybody  the drumming of hoofs rang more sharply through the open windows for the sod was hard and dry it stopped suddenly and agatha saw wyllard start as a man came into the room he was a little thickset man with a seamed and tanned face he was dressed in rather old blue serge and he walked as if he were a seaman  the stranger stood still looking about him and wyllards lips set tight a thrill of apprehension ran through agatha for she felt that she knew what this strangers errand must be  wyllard rose and walked towards the man with outstretched hand  sit right down and have some supper youll want it if you have ridden in from the railroad he said well talk afterwards  the stranger nodded im from vancouver he announced had quite a lot of trouble tracing you  he sat down and wyllard who sent a man out to take the newcomers horse went back to his seat but he was very quiet during the remainder of the meal when supper was finished he asked mrs hastings to excuse him and leading the stranger into a smaller room pulled out two chairs and laid a cigar on the table  now you can get ahead he said laconically  the seaman fumbled in his pocket and taking out a slip of wood handed it to his companion  thats what i came to bring you he remarked  wyllards eyes grew grave as he gazed at the thing it was a slip of willow which grows close up to the limits of eternal ice and it bore a rude representation of the british ensign union down which signifies in distress besides this there were one or two indecipherable words scratched on it and three common names rather more clearly cut wyllard recognized every one of them  how did you get it he asked in tense suspense  the seaman once more felt in his pocket and took out a piece of paper cut from a chart he flattened the paper out on the table and it showed as wyllard had expected a strip of the kamtchatkan coast  i guess i neednt tell you where that is the seaman said as he pointed to the parallel of latitude that ran across it dunton gave it to me he was up there late last season well over on the western side a northeasterly gale fell on them and took most of the foremast out of their ship i understand they tried to lash on a boom or something as a jury mast but it hadnt height enough to set much forward canvas and that being the case she wouldnt bear more than a threereefed mainsail anyway they couldnt do anything with her on the wind and as it kept heading them from the east she sidled away down south through the kuriles into the yellow sea they got icebound somewhere which explains why dunton fetched vancouver only a week ago  but the message  when they were in the thick of their troubles they hove to not far off the icy beach and a husky came down on them in some kind of boat  a husky repeated wyllard who knew the seaman meant an esquimau  thats what dunton called him but i guess he must have been a kamtchadale or a koriak anyway he brought this strip of willow and he had tom lewsons watch dunton traded him something for it they couldnt make much of what he said except that hed got the message from three white men somewhere along the beach they couldnt make out how long ago  dunton tried for them  how could he his vessel would hardly look at the wind and the ice was piling up on the coast close to lee of him he hung on a week or two with the floes driving in all the while and then it freshened hard and blew him out  the stranger had told his story and wyllard who rose with a quick gesture of deep anxiety stood leaning on his chairback his face was grave  that he said must have been eight or nine months ago  it was theyve been up there since the night we couldnt pick up the boat  its unthinkable declared wyllard the thing cant be true  the seaman gravely produced a little common metal watch made in connecticut and worth five or six dollars opening it he pointed to a name scratched inside it  you cant get over that he said simply  wyllard strode up and down the room when he sat down again with a clenched hand laid upon the table he and the seaman looked at each other steadily for a moment or two then the stranger made a significant gesture  you sent them he said what are you going to do  im going for them  the sailor smiled i knew it would be that youll have to start right away if its to be done this year ive my eye upon a schooner  he lighted a cigar and settled himself more comfortably in his chair well he answered im going with you but youll have to buy my ticket to vancouver it cleaned me out to get here wed a difficulty with a blame gunboat last season and the boss went back on me sealings not what is used to be anyway we can fix the thing up later i wont keep you from your friends  wyllard left the sailor and though he did not find mrs hastings immediately he came upon agatha sitting outside the house she glanced at his face when he sat down beside her  ah she said you have had the summons  wyllard nodded yes he replied that man was the skipper of a schooner i once sailed in he has come to tell me where those three men are  he told her what he had heard and the girl was conscious of mingled admiration and fear the fear of losing him from her everyday life  you are going up there to search for them she asked wont it cost you a great deal  she saw his face harden as he gazed at the tall wheat but his expression was resolute  yes he admitted thats a sure thing most of my money is locked up in this crop and theres need of constant watchfulness and effort until the last bushels hauled in to the elevators it probably sounds egotistical but now ive got rid of martial i cant put my hand on any one as fit to see the thing through as i am still i have to go without delay what else could i do  wouldnt the provincial government of british columbia or your authorities at ottawa take the matter up  wyllard shook his head it wouldnt be wise to give them an opportunity for one thing theyve had enough of sealing cases and that isnt astonishing well say they applied for the persons of three british subjects who are supposed to be living somewhere in russian asiaand for that matter i couldnt be sure that two of them arent americansthe russians naturally inquire what the men were doing there the answer is that they were poaching for the russians seals then the affair on the beach comes up and theres a big claim for compensation and trouble all round it seems to me the last thing those mentheyre practically outlawswould desire would be to have a russian expedition sent up on their trail they would want to lie hidden until they could somehow get off again  but how have they lived up there the whole land is frozen isnt it most of the year she questioned  they had sealing rifles and the koriaks make out farther north in their roofedin pits one can live on seal and walrus meat and blubber  agatha shivered but they had no tents nor furs nor blankets its horrible to imagine it  yes agreed wyllard gravely thats why im going for them  agatha sat still a moment she could realize the magnitude of the sacrifice that he was making and in some degree the hazards that he must face it appealed to her with an overwhelming force but she was also conscious of a strange dismay she turned to him with a flush of color in her cheeks and her eyes shining  oh she said its splendid  wyllard smiled what could i do he said i sent them     chapter xiv  agatha proves obdurate   it was two days later when agatha coming back from a stroll across the prairie with the two little girls found mrs hastings awaiting her at the homestead door  ill take the kiddies harry wyllards here and he seems quite anxious to see you though i dont know what he wants she said  she flashed a searching glance at the girl whose face however remained impassive it was not often that agathas composure broke down  dont wait she added you had better go in this minute allen has been arguing with him the last halfhour and cant get any sense into him it seems to me the mans crazy but he might perhaps listen to you  i think that is scarcely likely replied agatha  mrs hastings made a sign of impatience then she rejoined its a pity anyway if he speaks to you about his project you can tell him that its altogether unreasonable  she drew aside and agatha walked into the room in which she had had her painful interview with gregory wyllard who rose as she came in stood quietly watching her  nellie hastings or her husband has been telling you what they think of my idea he said questioningly  yes agatha answered their opinion evidently hasnt much weight with you  havent you a message for me he asked you were sent to denounce my follyand you cant do it if you trusted your own impulses you would give me your benediction instead he smiled down at her  agatha who was troubled with a sense of regret saw a suggestive wistfulness in his face  no she said slowly i cant denounce your folly as they call your decision to go north for one reason i have no right of any kind to force my views on you  you told mrs hastings that  it seemed an unwarranted question but the girl admitted the truth frankly  in one sense i did i suggested that there was no reason why you should listen to me  wyllard smiled again nellie and her husband are good friends of mine but sometimes our friends are a little too officious anyway it doesnt count if you had had that right you would have told me to go  agatha felt the warm blood rise to her cheeks it seemed to her that he had paid her a great and sincere compliment in taking it for granted that if she had loved him she would still have bidden him undertake his perilous duty  ah she said i dont know perhaps i should not have been brave enough  it was not a judicious answer she realized that but she felt that she must speak with unhesitating candor  after all she added can you be quite sure that this is your duty  wyllard kept his eye on her no he said i cant in fact when i sit down to think i can see at least a dozen reasons why it doesnt concern me in a case of this kind thats always easy its just borne in upon mei dont know howthat i have to go  agatha crossed to the window and sat down he leaned upon a chairback looking at her gravely  well he continued well go on a little further it seems better that i should make whats in my mind quite clear to you you see captain dampier and i start in a week  agatha was conscious of a shock of dismay  we may be back before the winter but its also quite likely that we may be icenipped before our work is through and in that case it would be a year at least before we reach vancouver he went on steadily after a little pause in fact theres a certain probability that all of us may leave our bones up there now theres a thing i must ask you is it only a passing trouble that stands between you and gregory are you still fond of him  agathas heart beat fast it would have been a relief to assure herself that she was as fond of gregory as she had been but she could not do it  that is a point on which i cannot answer you she declared in a voice that trembled  well let it go at that the fact that gregory sent me over for you implied a certain obligation how far events have cleared me of it i dont knowand you dont seem willing to tell me but i believe there is now less cause than there was for me to thrust my own wishes into the background and as i start in another week the situation has forced my hand i cant wait as i had meant to do and it would be a vast relief to know that i had made your future safer than it is before i go will you marry me at the settlement the morning i start  halfconscious as she was of the unselfishness which had prompted this suggestion agatha faced him in hot anger  can you suppose for a moment that i would agree to that she asked  wait he pleaded try to look at it calmly first of all i want you you know thatthough you have never shown me any tenderness you cant doubt itbut i cant stay to win your liking i must go away as things stand your future is uncertain but as my wife it would at least be safe however badly the man i leave in charge of the range may manage there would be something saved out of the wreck and i would like to make that something yours as i said i may be away a year perhaps eighteen months and i may never come back if i dont return the fact that you would bear my name could cause you no great trouble it would lay no restraint on you in any way  agatha looked him in the eyes and spoke with quick intensity we cant contemplate your not coming back its unthinkable  thank you said wyllard still with the grave quietness she wondered at then im not sure that my turning up again would greatly complicate the situation there would at least be one way out of the difficulty you wouldnt find your position intolerable if i could make you fond of me  agatha broke into a little highstrung laugh that was near to weeping  oh she exclaimed arent you taking too much for granted am i really to believe you are making this fantastic offer seriously do you suppose i would marry youfor your possessions  my proposition does sound coldblooded perhaps it is in one way but you wouldnt always find me so practical and calculating just now because my hand is forced i am only anticipating things if i live you will some day have to choose between gregory and me in that case he must hold his own if he can  against what you have offered me she flung the question at him  he looked at her with his face set  i expect i deserved that i wanted to make you safe its the most pressing difficulty  the resentment was still in the girls eyes  so far as i am concerned you seem to believe it is the only difficulty oh do you imagine that an offer of the kind you have made me made as you have made it would lead anyone to love you  wyllard spoke with a new tenderness when i first saw your picture and when i saw you afterwards i loved your gracious quietness now you seem to have lost your repose and i love you better as you are there is one thing agatha that i must ask again and its your duty to tell me are you fonder of gregory than you feel you ever could be of me  agathas eyes fell she felt that she could not look at him nor could she answer his question honestly as she desired to answer it  at least i am bound to him until he releases me  ah responded wyllard that is what i was most afraid of all along it hampered me and in it you have the reason for my cold businesslike talk today it is another reason why i should go away  for fear that you should tempt me from my duty  wyllards expression changed and there crept into his eyes a gleam of the passion that he was smothering  my dear he said i seem to know that i could make you break faith with that man you belong to me for three years you have been everywhere with me now i must go away and gregory will have a clear field but the probability is in favor of my coming back again and then if he has failed to make the most of his chance ill enforce my claim  he seized both her hands holding them firmly  that is my last word at least you will let me think that when i go up yonder into the mists and snow i shall take your good wishes for my success away with me  she lifted her flushed face and once looked him steadily in the eyes  my good wishes are yours most fervently she replied it would be intolerable that you should fail  he looked sad as he let her hands fall after all he said one can do only what one can  he went away without another glance at her  not long afterwards mrs hastings who was possessed of a reasonable measure of curiosity found occasion to enter the room  you have said something to trouble harry she began  im not sure hes greatly troubled in any case i told him i would not marry him agatha answered  mrs hastings gave her a glance of compassionate astonishment  oh she said hes mad did he tell you that he means to leave gregory in charge of willow range  agathas face showed her surprise but mrs hastings nodded reassuringly its a fact she asserted he asked gregory to meet him here to save time andshe turned towards the windowtheres his wagon now  she went to the door and then turned again  is there any bloodred blood we will call itor even commonsense in you you could have kept harry here if you had wanted to do so  no replied agatha i dont think i could im not even sure that if id had the right i would have done it he recognized that  mrs hastings looked at her dubiously then she commented you have either a somewhat extraordinary character or you are in love with him in a way that is beyond most of us in any case i cant help feeling that you will be sorry some day for what you have done  next moment the door closed with a bang and agatha was left alone to analyze her sensations during her interview with wyllard she found the task difficult for her memory of what had happened was confused and fragmentary she had certainly been angry with wyllard it was humiliating that he had evidently taken it for granted that the greater security she would enjoy as his wife would have preponderance of weight with her yet there was a certain satisfaction in the reflection that to leave her dependent upon mrs hastings caused him concern for another thing his reserve had been perplexing and it was borne in upon her that it would have cost her a more determined effort to withstand him had he spoken with fire and passion  if the man had been fervently in love with her why had he not insisted on that fact she asked herself could it have been because with the fantastic generosity of which he was evidently capable he had been willing to leave his friend unhandicapped with an open field that seemed too much to expect from any man then there was the other explanationthat he preferred to leave the choice wholly to her lest he should tempt her too strongly to break faith with gregory this idea brought the blood to her face since it suggested that he believed that he had merely to urge her sufficiently in order to make her yield there was it seemed no satisfactory explanation at all the one fact remained that he had made her a dispassionate offer of marriage and had left her to decide  wyllard could not have made the matter very much clearer shrewdly practical as he was in some respects there were times when he acted blindly merely doing without reasoning what he felt subconsciously was right this had more than once involved him in disaster but in the long run the failures of such men often prove better than the dictates of calculating wisdom  agatha found a momentary relief from her thoughts as she watched hawtrey get down from his wagon and approach the house the change in him was plainer than it had ever been it may have been because she had now a standard of comparison that it was so apparent he was tall and wellfavored and he moved with a jaunty yet not ungraceful swing but it seemed to her that his bearing was merely the result of an empty selfsufficiency there was she felt no force behind it gregory was smiling and there was certainly a hint of sensuality in his face which suggested that the man might sink into a selfindulgent coarseness agatha remembered that she was still pledged to him and determinedly brushed these thoughts aside  hawtrey entered a room where with a paper in his hand wyllard sat awaiting him  i asked you to drive over here because it would save time said wyllard i have to go in to the railroad at once heres a draft of the scheme i suggested you had better tell me if theres anything youre not quite satisfied with  he threw the paper on the table and hawtrey took it up  im to farm and generally manage the range on your behalf said hawtrey after reading its contents my percentage to be deducted after harvest im empowered to sell out grain or horses as appears advisable and to have the use of teams and implements for my own place when occasion requires it  he looked up ive no fault to find with the thing harry its generous  then you had better sign it and well get hastings to witness it in a minute or two in the meanwhile theres a thing i have to ask you how do you stand in regard to miss ismay  hawtrey pushed his chair back noisily that he said is a subject on which im naturally not disposed to give you any information how does it concern you  in this way believing that your engagement must be broken off i asked miss ismay to marry me  hawtrey was clearly startled but in a moment or two he smiled  of course he said she wouldnt as a matter of fact our engagement isnt broken off its merely extended  the two men looked at each other in silence for a moment or two and there was a curious hardness in wyllards eyes hawtrey spoke again  in view of what you have just told me why did you want to put me of all people in charge of the range he asked  ill be candid answered wyllard for one thing you held on when i was slipping off the trestle that day in british columbia for another youll make nothing of your own holding and if you run the range as it ought to be run it will put a good many dollars into your pocket besides relieving me of a big anxiety if youre to marry miss ismay id sooner she was made reasonably comfortable  hawtrey looked up with a flush in his face  harry he said this is extravagantly generous  wait returned wyllard theres a little more to be said i cant be back before the frost and i may be away eighteen months while i am away you will have a clear fieldand you must make the most of it if you are not married when i come back i shall ask miss ismay again nowand he glanced at his comrade steadilydoes this stand in the way of youre going on with the arrangement we have arrived at  there was a rather tense silence for a moment or two and then hawtrey said  no after all there is no reason why it should do so it has no practical bearing upon the other question  wyllard rose well he suggested if you will call allen hastings in well get this thing fixed up  the document was duly signed and a few minutes later wyllard drove away  mrs hastings contrived to have a few words with hawtrey before he left the house  ive no doubt that harry took you into his confidence on a certain point she remarked  yes admitted hawtrey he did i was a little astonished besides feeling rather sorry for him there is however reason to believe that hell soon get over it  you feel sure of that mrs hastings smiled  isnt it evident if he had cared much about her he certainly wouldnt have gone away  you mean you wouldnt  no declared hawtrey theres no doubt of that  mrs hastings smiled again well she commented i would like to think you were right about harry it would be a relief to me  hawtrey presently drove away and soon after he left the homestead agatha approached mrs hastings  theres something i must ask you she said has gregory consented to take charge of wyllards farm  he has answered mrs hastings in her dryest tone  there was a flash in agathas eyes  oh she said its almost unendurable  agatha saw wyllard only once again and that was when he called early one morning he got down from the wagon where dampier sat and shook hands with her and allen and mrs hastings few words were spoken and she could not remember what she said but when he swung himself up again and the wagon jolted away into the white prairie she went back to the house with a feeling of loss and depression     chapter xv  the beach   for a fortnight after they reached vancouver wyllard and dampier were very busy they had various difficulties to contend with for while they would have preferred to slip away to sea as quietly as possible a british vessels movements are fenced about with many formalities and they did not wish to ship a white man who could be dispensed with wyllard knew there were sailors and sealers in vancouver and down puget sound who would have gone with him but there was a certain probability of their discussing their exploits afterwards in the saloons ashore which was about the last thing that he desired it was essential that he should avoid notoriety as much as possible  he had further trouble about obtaining provisions and general necessaries for considerably more attention than the freelance sealers cared about was being bestowed upon the north and he did not desire to arouse the curiosity of the dealers as to why he was filling his lazaret up with arctic stores he obviated that difficulty by dividing his orders among all of them and buying as little as possible dampier proved an adept at the difficult business and eventually the schooner selache painted a pale green crept out from the narrows at dusk one evening under all plain sail with her big mainboom making at least a fathom beyond her taffrail on board were wyllard dampier and two other white men a week later the selache sailed into a deep rockwalled inlet on the western coast of vancouver island at the settlement the storekeeper made no difficulty about selling wyllard all his flour and canned goods at higher figures than there was any probability of obtaining from the local ranchers  the selache slid down the inlet again and lay for several days in a forestshrouded arm near the mouth of it when she once more dropped her anchor off a siwash rancherie far up on the wild west coast she was painted a dingy gray and her sawnoff boom just topped her stern one does not want a great mainboom in the northern seas and a big mainsail needs men to handle it wyllard however shipped several seabred indians who had made perilous voyages on the trail of the seal and halibut in open canoes all of them had also sailed in sealing schooners their comrades sold him furs and filled part of the hold with redwood billets and bark for the stove for he had not considered it advisable to load too much wellington coal  wyllard pushed out into the waste pacific and once when a beautiful big white mail boat reeled by him driving with streaming bows into an easterly gale he sent back a message to his friends upon the prairie it duly reached them for three weeks afterward allen hastings opening the colonist which he had ordered from victoria as soon as wyllard sailed read to his wife and agatha a paragraph in the shipping news  empress of india from yokohama reports having passed small gray british schooner flying there followed several code letters the latitude and longitude and a line apparently by the waterfront reporter no schooner belonging to this city allotted the signal in question  hastings smiled as he laid down the paper no he observed that signal is wyllards private code agatha wont you reach me down my map of the pacific its just behind you  as he looked around he noticed the significant expression on his wifes face for the girl already had turned towards the shelf where he kept the lately purchased map  the easterly gale that started did not last for the wind came out of the west and north and sank to foggy calms when it did not blow wickedly hard this meant that the selaches course was all to windward and though they drove her unmercifully under reefed bookforesail main trysail and a streaming jib or two with the brine going over her she had made little headway when each arduous day was done they were drenched to the skin continuously and lashed by stinging spray cooking except of the crudest kind was out of the question and sleep would have been impossible to any but wornout sailors the little crew was often aroused in the blackness of the night to haul down a burst jib to get in another reef or to crawl out on a plunging bowsprit washed by icy seas as the schooner lay with her lee rail under glad as they were of the respite it was even more trying to lie rolling wildly on the big smooth waves that hove out of the windless calm while everything in the vessel banged to and fro when the breeze came screaming through the fog or rain they sprang to make sail again  fate seemed to oppose them as it was certain that if their purpose was suspected the hand of every white man whom they might come across would be against them but they held on over leagues of empty ocean  the season wore away and at last the wind freshened easterly and they ran for a week under boomforesail and a jib with the big gray combers curling as they foamed by high above her rail then the wind fell and dampier who got an observation armed his deepsea lead and finding shells and shoal water went aft to talk to wyllard with the strip of duntons chart  wyllard who was clad in oilskins stood by the wheel his face was tanned and roughened by cold and stinging brine there was an open sore upon one of his elbows and both his wrists were raw forward a white man and two siwash were standing about the windlass and when the bows went up a dreary stretch of slategray sea opened beyond them beneath the dripping jibs the selache was carrying sail and lurching over the steep swell at some four knots an hour  dampier stopped near the wheel and glanced at wyllards oilskins  youll have to take them off its stuffed boots and those indian sealgut things or furs from now on he said that leather cuffs chewing up your hand  well cut that out replied wyllard its not to the point cant you get on  dampier grinned were on soundings and they and duntons longitude most agree with this wind we should pick the beach up in the next two days next question is where were those men  where are they corrected wyllard  if theyve pushed on its probably a different thing though if theyd food yonder i dont quite see why theyd want to push on anywhere it wouldnt be south anyway theyd run up against the russians there  weve decided that already  im admitting it said the skipper theres the other choice that theyve gone up north its narrower across to alaska there and its quite likely they might have a notion of looking out for one of the steam whalers the koriaks up yonder will have boats of some kind if the boats are skin ones like those the huskies have they might sledge them on the ice  it was a suggestion that had been made several times before but both the men realized that there was in all probability very little to warrant it wyllard had wasted no time endeavoring to learn what was known about the desolation on the western shore of the behring sea he had bought a schooner and set out at once it appeared almost impossible to him that any three men could haul the skin boats and supplies they would need far over hummocky ice  the point is that well have to fix on some course in the next few days added dampier say we run in to make inquiriesa gleam of grim amusement crept into his eyeswhat are we going to find a beach with a roaring surf on it and if we get a boat through a desolate halffrozen swamp behind it its quite likely there are people in the country koriaks or kamtchadales but if there are theyll probably move up and down after what they get to eat like the huskies do and we cant hang on and wait for them most any time next month well have the ice closing in  wyllard made no reply for another minute and as he stood with hands clenched on the wheel a puff of bitter spray splashed upon his oilskins they had been over it all often before weighing conjecture after conjecture and had found nothing in any that might serve to guide them now when winter was close at hand they had leagues of surfswept beach to search for three men who might have perished twelve months earlier  well stand in until we pick up the beach he said at length then if theres no sign of them well push north as long as we can find open water now if youll call charly ill let up at the wheel  another white man walked aft and wyllard entering the little stern cabin the top of which rose several feet above the deck took off his wet oilskins and crawled dressed as he was into his bunk evening was closing in and for a while he lay blinking at the swinging lamp and wondering what the end of the search would be  the selache was a little fore and aft schooner of some ninetyodd tons wholly unprotected against icechafe or nip and he knew that prudence dictated their driving her south under every rag of canvas now there was however the possibility of finding some sheltered inlet where she could lie out the winter frozen in and he had blind confidence in his crew the white men were sealers who had borne the lash of snowladen gales the wash of icy seas and tremendous labor at the oar and the indians had been born to an unending struggle with the waters all of them had many times looked the king of terrors squarely in the face as an encouraging aid to strenuous effort they had been promised a tempting bonus if the selache returned home successful  while wyllard pondered upon these things he went to sleep and slept soundly though dampier expected to raise the beach some time next morning the skippers expectation proved to be warranted and when wyllard turned out the stretch of shore lay before them a dingy smear on a slategreen sea that was cut off from it by a wavy line of vivid whiteness which he knew to be a fringe of spouting surf it had cost wyllard more than he cared to contemplate to reach that beach and now there was nothing in the dreary spectacle that could excite any feeling except a shrinking from the physical effort of the search there was little light in the heavy sky or on the sullen heave of sea the air was raw the schooners decks were sloppy and the vessel rolled viciously as she crept shorewards with her mainsail peak eased down what wind there was blew dead onshore which was not as the skipper would have had it  wyllard heard the splash of the lead as he and the white man charly ate their breakfast in the little stern cabin there was a clatter of blocks and on going out on deck he found the men swinging a boat over with charly and two of the indians he dropped into the boat and dampier who had hove the schooner to looked down on them over the vessels rail  if you knock the bottom out of her put a jacket on an oar and ill try to bring you off he said pointing toward the boat if you dont signal ill stand off and on with a thimbleheaded topsail over the mainsail youll start back right away if you see us haul it down when she wont stand that therell be more surf than youll have any use for with the wind dead on the beach  wyllard made a sign of comprehension and they slid away on the back of a long sea waves rolled up behind them cutting off the schooners hull so that only her gray canvas showed above dim slopes of water the beach rose fast before them it looked forbidding with the sprayhaze drifting over it and the long wash of the pacific weltering among its hammered stones when the men drew a little nearer wyllard stood up with the big sculling oar in his hand there was no point to offer shelter and in only one place could he see a strip of surflapped sand  its a little softer than the boulders anyway well try it there he ordered  the oars dipped again and in another minute the sea that came up behind them hove them high and broke into a little spout of foam the next wave had a hissing crest part of which splashed on board and like a toboggan down an icy slide the boat went shoreward on the shoulders of the third to keep her straight while the water seethed about them was all that they could do for a moment their hearts were in their mouths when the wave left them to sink with a dizzy swing into the hollow of the sea  they pulled desperately as another whitetopped ridge came on astern and they went up with it amid a chaotic frothing and splashing of spray after that there was a shock and a crash they sprang out into the kneedeep water and held fast to the boat while the foam boiled into her before the next sea came in they had run the boat up beyond its reach and they discovered that there was not much the matter with her when they hove her over wyllard looked back at the tumbling surf  dampier was right about that topsail it wont be quite so easy getting off he declared youll stand by charly and watch the schooner if the surf gets steeper you can make some sign ill leave one of the siwash on the rise yonder  then he walked up the beach on the crest of the low rise a mile or two behind it he stopped a while gazing out at what seemed to be an empty desolation there were willows in the hollow beneath him and upon the slope a few little stunted trees which resembled the juniper that he had seen among the ranges of british columbia but he could see no sign of any kind of life what was more portentous the mossy sod he stood upon was frozen and there were stretches of snow among the straggling firs upon a higher ridge inland the little breeze seemed to have fallen dead away and there was an oppressive silence which the rumble of the surf accentuated  wyllard left one of the indians on the hill and going on with the other scrambled through a halffrozen swamp in the hollow but when they came back hours afterwards as the narrow horizon was drawing further in they had found nothing to show that any man had ever entered that grim silent land the surf seemed a little smoother and they reeled out through it with only a few inches of very cold water splashing about their boots and pulled across a long stretch of darkening sea toward the rolling schooner  wyllard was weary and depressed but it was not until he sat in the stern cabin with its cheerful twinkling stove and swinging lamp that he understood how he had shrunk from that forbidding wilderness his consultation with dampier who came in by and by was brief  well head north for a couple of days and try again he said  he crawled into his berth early and it was some time after midnight when he was awakened by being rudely flung out of it that fact and the slant of deck and sounds above suggested that the schooner had been struck down by a sudden gale he had grown more or less accustomed to such occurrences and to sleeping fully dressed and in another moment or two he was out of the deckhouse a sharp wind drove stinging flakes of snow into his face it was very dark but he guessed that the schooners rail was in the sea which was washing the decks and that some of the crew were struggling to get the mainsail off her a man whom he supposed to be charly ran into him  better come forard got to haul outer jib down before it blows away he shouted  up to his knees in water wyllard staggered after him and made out by the mad banging that some one had already cast the peak of the boomforesail loose he reached the windlass and clutched it as a sea that took him to the waist frothed in over the weather rail the bows lurched out of it viciously hurling another icy flood back on him and he could see a dim white chaos of frothing water about and beneath them above rose the black wedge of the jibs  he did not want to get out along the bowsprit to stop one of them down but there are many things flesh and blood shrink from which must be faced at sea he made out that a siwash was fumbling at the downhaul made fast near his side and when the mans shadowy figure rose up against the whiteness of the foam he made a jump forward then he was on the bowsprit lying upon it while he felt for the footrope slung beneath he found it and was cautiously lowering himself when the man in front of him called out harshly and he saw a white sea range up ahead it broke short over with a rush and roar and he clung with hands and feet for his life as the schooners dipping bows rammed the seething mass  the vessel went into it to the windlass wyllard was smothered in an icy flood that seemed bent on wrenching him from his hold but that was only for a moment or two and then streaming with water he was swung high above the sea again it was bad enough merely to hold on but that was a very small share of his task for the big black sail that cut the higher darkness came rattling down its stay and fell upon him and his companion as it dropped the wind took hold of the folds of it and buffeted them cruelly as he clutched at the canvas it seemed to him incredible that he had not already been flung off headlong from the reeling spar still that banging thrashing canvas must be mastered somehow though it was snowsoaked and almost unyielding and with bleeding hands he clawed at it furiously while twice the bowsprit raked a sea and dipped him waistdeep into the water at last the other man flung him the end of the gasket and they worked back carefully leaving the sail lashed down and scrambled aft to help the others who were making the big mainboom fast when this was done wyllard fell against dampier and clutched at him  hows the wind he roared  northeast answered the skipper  they could scarcely hear each other though the schooner was lurching over it more easily now with shortened canvas and wyllard made dampier understand that he wished to speak to him only by thrusting him towards the deckhouse door they went in together and stood clutching at the table with the lamplight on their tense wet faces and the brine that ran from them making pools upon the deck  the wind has hauled round said the skipper the wrong way  wyllard made a savage gesture weve had it from the last quarter we wanted ever since we sailed and we sailed nearly three months too late were too close in to the beach for you to heave her to  a sure thing agreed dampier i was driving her to work off it with the sea getting up when the breeze burst on us she put her rail right under and we had to let go most everything before shed pick it up shes pointing somewhere north jammed right up on the starboard tack just now but i cant stand on  this was evident to wyllard and he closed one hand tight he wanted to stand on as long as possible before the ice closed in but he realized that to do so would put the schooner ashore  well he questioned sharply  dampier made a grimace im going out to heave her round if wed any sense in us wed square off the boom then and leg it away across the pacific for vancouver  in that case observed wyllard somebody would lose his bonus  the skipper swung around on him with a flash in his eyes the bonus he repeated who was it came for you with two dollars in his pocket after hed bought his ticket from vancouver  wyllard smiled at him if you took that up the wrong way im sorry she ought to work off on the port track and when weve open water to leeward you can heave her to when it moderates we can pick up the beach again  thats just what i mean to do  dampier went out on deck while wyllard flinging off his dripping clothing crawled into his bunk and went quietly to sleep     chapter xvi  the first ice   before they hove to the selache daylight broke on a frothing sea across which scudded wisps of smokeadrift and thin showers of snow with two little wet rags of canvas set the schooner lay almost head on to the big combers having little way upon her she lurched over instead of ramming the waves and though now and then one curled on board across her rail it was not often that there was much heavy water upon her slanted deck  all around the narrow circle a leaden sky met the sea it was bitterly cold and the spray stung the skin like halfspent pellets from a gun there was only one man in turn exposed to the weather and he had little to do but brace himself against the savage buffeting of the wind as he clutched the wheel the selache for the most part steered herself lifting buoyantly while the froth came sluicing aft from her tilted bows falling off a little with a vicious leeward roll when a comber bigger than usual smote her to weather and coming up again streaming to meet the next sometimes she forged ahead in what is called at sea by courtesy a smooth and all the time shroud and stay to weather gave out tumultuous harmonies and the slack of every rope to leeward blew out in unyielding curves  three of the white men lay sleeping or smoking in the little cabin which was partly raised above and partly sunk beneath the afterdeck it was a reasonably strong structure but it worked and sweated as they sat at sea and the heat of the stove had further opened up the seams in it moisture dripped from the beams overhead moisture trickled up and down the slanting deck there were great globules of water on the bulkheading and everything including the mens clothes and blankets was wet the men lay in their bunks from necessity because it was a laborious matter to sit they said very little since it was difficult to hear anything amid the cataclysm of elemental sound it became at length almost a relief to turn out into inky darkness or misty daylight dimmed by flying spray to take a turn at the jarring wheel  for three days the bad weather continued and then when the gale broke and a little pale sunshine streamed down on the tumbling sea changing the gray combers to flashing white and green the skipper gave her a doublereefed mainsail part of the boomforesail and a jib or two and thrashed her slowly back to the northward on the starboard tack more than one of the men glanced over the taffrail longingly as the schooner gathered way she was fast and with a little driving and that breeze over her quarter she would bear them south toward warmth and ease at some two hundred miles a day while the way they were going it would be a fight for every fathom with bitter charging seas and there lay ahead of them only cold and peril and toil incredible  there are times at sea when human nature revolts from the strain that the overtaxed body must bear the leaden weariness of wornout limbs and the subconscious effort to retain warmth and vitality in spite of the ceaseless lashing of the icy gale then as aching muscles grow lax the nervous tension becomes more insupportable unless indeed utter weariness breeds indifference to the personal peril each time the decks are swept by a frothing flood or a slippery spar must be clung to with frostnumbed and often bleeding hands the men on the selache knew this and it was to their credit that they obeyed when dampier gave the word to put the helm up and trim the sheets over wyllard however stood a little apart with a hardset face and he looked forward over the plunging bows for he was troubled by a sense of responsibility such as he had not felt since he had one night several years before asked for volunteers he realized that an account of these mens lives might be demanded from him  it was a fortnight later and they had twice made a perilous landing without finding any sign of life on or behind the hammered beach when they ran into the first of the ice the gray day was near its end the long heave faintly twinkling here and there ran sluggishly after them when creeping through a belt of haze they came into sight of several blurrs of grayish white that swung with the dim green swell the selache was slowly lurching over it with everything aloft to the topsails then and dampier glanced at the ice with a feeling of deep anxiety  earlier than i expected he commented anyway its a sure thing theres plenty more where that came from  big patch away to starboard cried a man in the foremast shrouds  dampier turned to wyllard what are you going to do  whats most advisable  the skipper looked grave well he said thats quite simple get out of this and head her south just as soon as we can but i guess thats not quite what you mean  no admitted wyllard i meant for the next few hours or so in a general way were still pushing on  im not worrying much about pushing her through that ice is light and scattered and as shes going it wont hurt her much if she plugs some in the dark its what were going to do the next two weeks that im not sure about if theres ice we maynt fetch the creek where wed figured on laying her up its still most a hundred miles to the north of us the other inlet id fixed on is way further south  this brought them back to the difficulty with which they had grappled at many a council the men for whom they searched might have gone either north or south or they might have gone inland if indeed any of them survived  if we only knew how they had headed said wyllard quietly still right or not im for pushing on  then charly who held the wheel broke in  i guess its north he assented theyd have no use for fetching up among the russians and theres nobody else until you get to japan no white men anyway besides from the behring sea to the kuriles is quite a long way  if you were dumped down ashore there which way would you go dampier asked  if id a wallet full of papers certifying me as a harmless traveler it would be south just as hard as i could hit the trail guess id strike somebody out prospecting or surveying and theyd set me along to the kuriles still if id been sealing i wouldnt head that way no sir thats dead sure  there was a reason for this certainty right or wrong in the minds of the sealers how many of the skins they brought home were obtained in open water where they could fish without molestation they alone knew but they were regarded in certain quarters as poachers and outlaws who deserved no mercy they had their differences with the americans who owned the pribilofs it was admitted that the americans had bought the islands and might reasonably be considered to have some claim upon the seals which frequented them the freelances bore their execrations and reprisals more or less resignedly though that did not prevent them from occasionally exchanging compliments with oar butts or sealing clubs but the muscovite was a grim mysterious figure they feared and hated  then youd have tried up north wyllard suggested  sure answered the helmsman if id a boat and a rifle and it was summer id have pushed across for alaska you can eat birds and walrus and a man might eat a furseal if hed had nothing else for a week though ive struck nothing that has more smell than the holluschickie blubber if it was winter id have tried the ice the huskies make out on it for weeks together and quite a few of the steam whaler men have trailed an odd hundred or two miles over it one time or another they hadnt tents and dogteams either  wyllards face grew anxious he had naturally considered both courses and had decided that they were out of the question seas do not freeze up solid and that three men should transport a boat supposing that they had one over leagues of ice appeared impossible an attempt to cross the narrow sea which is either wrapped in mist or swept by sudden gales in any open craft would clearly result only in disaster but admitting that he felt that had he been in those mens place he would have headed north there was one question which had all along remained unanswered and that was how they had reached the coast from which they had sent their message  anyway he said after a long pause well stand on and run into the creek weve fixed on if its necessary  dusk had closed down on them and it had grown perceptibly colder the haze crystallized on the rigging the rail was white with rime and the deck grew slippery but they left everything on the selache to the topsails and she crept on erratically through the darkness avoiding the faint spectral glimmer of the scattered ice the breeze abeam propelled her with gently leaning canvas at some four knots to the hour and now and then wyllard who hung about the deck that night fancied he could hear a thin sharp crackle beneath the slowly lifting bows  next day the haze thickened and there seemed to be more ice about but the breeze was fresher and there was at least no skin upon the ruffled sea they took off the topsails and proceeded cautiously with two men with loggers pikepoles forward and another in the eyes of the foremast rigging they struck nothing fortunately and when night came the selache lay rolling in a heavy portentous calm dampier and one or two of the men declared their certainty that there was ice near them but at least they could not see it though there was now no doubt about the crackling beneath the schooners side it was an anxious night for most of the crew but a breeze that drove the haze aside got up with the sun and dampier expected to reach the creek before darkness fell he might have succeeded but for the glistening streak on the horizon which presently crept in on them and resolved itself into detached graywhite masses with openings of various sizes in and out between them the breeze was freshening and the selache was going through it at some six knots when dampier came aft to wyllard who was standing at the wheel there was a moderately wide opening in the floating barrier close ahead of him the rest of the crew stood silent watching the skipper for they were by this time more or less acquainted with wyllards temperament  you cant get through that said dampier pointing to the ice  wyllard looked at him sourly and the white men at least understood what he was feeling so far he had had everything against himcalm and fog and sudden galeand now when he was almost within sight of the end of the first stage of his journey they had met the ice  youre sure of that he questioned  dampier smiled it would cost too much or id let you try he called to the man perched high in the foremost shrouds and the answer came down packed right solid a couple of miles ahead  wyllard lifted one hand and let it suddenly fall again  lee oh well have her round he said and spun the wheel  the men breathed more easily as they jumped for the sheets and with a great banging and thrashing of sailcloth the vessel shot up to windward and turned as on a pivot as the schooner gathered way on the other tack the men glanced at wyllard for the selaches bows were pointing to the southeast again and they felt that was not the way he was going  wyllard turned to dampier with a gesture of impatience  baulked again he said it would have been a relief to have rammed her in with this breeze wed have picked that creek up in the next six hours  sure replied dampier who glanced at the swirling wake  then if we cant get through the ice we can work the schooner round stand by to flatten all sheets in boys  they obeyed orders cheerfully though they knew it meant a thrash to windward along the perilous edge of the ice soon the windlass was caked with glistening ice and long spikes of it hung from her rail while the slippery crystals gathered thick on deck lumps and floes of ice detached themselves from the parent mass and sailed out to meet the vessel crashing on one another while it seemed to the men who watched him that wyllard tried how closely he could shave them before he ran the selache off with a vicious drag at the wheel none of them however cared to utter a remonstrance  they brought the schooner around when she had stretched out on the one tack a couple of miles and standing in again closehauled found the ice thicker than ever then she came around once more and until the early dusk fell wyllard stood at the jarring helm or high up in the forward shrouds  we cant work along the edge in the dark he said to dampier  well answered the skipper dryly it wouldnt be wise we could stand on as shes lying until half through the night and then come round and pick up the ice again a little before sunup  wyllard made a sign of acquiescence then he said dont call me until youre in sight of it a day of this kind takes it out of one  he moved aft heavily toward the deckhouse and dampier watched him with a smile of comprehension for he was a man who had in his time made many fruitless efforts and bravely faced defeat after all it is possible that when the final reckoning comes some failures will count  for several hours the selache stretched out closehauled into what they supposed to be open water and they certainly saw no ice they hove her to and when the wind fell light brought her round and crept back slowly upon the opposite tack wyllard had gone to sleep after his day of anxious work and daylight was just breaking when he next went out on deck there was scarcely a breath of wind and the heavy calm seemed portentous and unnatural the schooner lay lurching on a sluggish swell with the frostwool thick on her rigging and a belt of haze ahead of her the ice glimmered in the growing light but in one or two places stretches of bluegray water seemed to penetrate it and dampier who strode aft when he saw wyllard said he believed that there must be an opening somewhere  by the thickness of it that ice has formed some time and as weve seen nothing but a skin it must have come from further north he added it gathered up under a point or in a bay most likely until a shift of wind broke it out and the stream or breeze sent it down this way that seems to indicate that there cant be a great deal of it but a few days calm and frost would freeze it solid  well wyllard returned impatiently  it lies between us and the inlet and its quite clear that we cant stay where we are once we got nipped thered probably be an end of her we must get into that inlet at once or make for the other further south  wyllard shook his head it all leads back to the same point we must get through the ice the one question ishow is it to be done  with a working breeze id stand into the biggest opening but as theres none well wait until it clears a little and then send a boat in the sun may bring the wind  they had breakfast while they waited but the wind did not come and it was several hours later when a pale coppery disc became visible and the haze grew thinner then they swung a boat out hastily for it would not be very long before the light died away again two white men and an indian dropped into the boat and they pulled across half a mile of sluggishly heaving water crept up an opening and presently vanished among the ice soon afterward the low sun went out and wisps of ragged cloud crept up from the westward while smears of vapor blurred the horizon and the swell grew steeper there was no wind at all but blocks and canvas banged and thrashed furiously at every roll until they lowered the mainsail and lashed its heavy boom to the big iron crutch astern the boat remained invisible but its crew had been given instructions to push on as far as possible if they found clear water and dampier who did not seem uneasy about the men paced up and down the deck while the afternoon wore away     chapter xvii  defeat   a gray dimness was creeping in upon the schooner when a bitter breeze sprang tip from the westward and dampier bade the crew get the mainsail on to the selache  i dont like the look of the weather and im beginning to feel that id like to see that boat he said anyhow well get way on her  it was a relief to hoist the mainsail the work put a little warmth into the sailors the white men had been conscious of a growing uneasiness about their comrades in the boat and action of any sort was welcome the breeze had freshened before they set the sail and there were whitecaps on the water when the selache headed for the ice which had somewhat changed its formation for big masses had become detached from it and were moving out into the water while the open space had become perceptibly narrower the light was now fading rapidly and wyllard took the wheel when dampier sent forward the man who had held it  get the cover off the second boat and see everything clear for hoisting out commanded the skipper and then called to wyllard were close enough youd better heave her round  the schooner came around with a thrashing of canvas stretched out seawards and came back again with her deck sharply slanted and little puffs of spray blowing over her weatherrail for there was no doubt that the breeze was freshening fast dampier now sent a man up into the foremast shrouds and looked at wyllard afterward  id heave a couple of reefs down if i wasnt so anxious about that blamed boat he said as it is i want to be ready to pick her up just as soon as we see her and its quite likely shed turn up when wed got way off the schooner and the peak eased down  wyllard realized that dampier was right as he glanced over the rail at the dimness that was creeping in on them it was blowing almost fresh by this time and the selache was driving very fast through the swell which began to froth here and there it is as he knew from experience always hard work and often impossible to pull a boat to windward in any weight of breeze which rendered it advisable to keep the schooner under way if the boat drove by them while they were reefing it might be difficult to pick her up afterwards in the dark he was now distinctly anxious about her just as the light was dying out the man in the shrouds sent down a cry  i see them sir he said  dampier turned to wyllard with a gesture of relief thats a weight off my mind i wish we had a reef in buthe glanced up at the canvasshell have to stand it anyway ill leave you there we want to get that second boat lashed down again  this as wyllard recognized was necessary though he would rather have had somebody by him and the rest of them ready to let the mainsheet run inasmuch as he was a little to windward of the opening and surmised that he would have to run the schooner down upon the boat it was a few moments later when he saw the boat emerge from the ice and the men in her appeared to be pulling strenuously they were perhaps half a mile off and the schooner heading for the ice was sailing very fast wyllard lost sight of the boat again for a thin shower of whirling snow suddenly obscured the light dampier called to him  youll have to run her off he said boys slack out your sheets  there was a clatter of blocks and when wyllard pulled his helm up it taxed all his strength the selache swung around and he gasped with the effort to control her as she drove away furiously into the thickening snow she was carrying far too much canvas but they could not heave her to and take it off her now the boat must be picked up first and the veins rose swollen to wyllards forehead as he struggled with the wheel there is always a certain possibility of bringing a foreandaft rigged vessels mainboom over when she is running hard and this is apt to result in disaster to her spars so fast was the selache traveling that the sea piled up in big white waves beneath her quarter and cold as the day was the sweat of tense effort dripped from wyllard as he foresaw what he had to do first of all he must hold the schooner straight before the wind without letting her fall off to leeward which would bring the booms crashing over then he must run past the boat which he could no longer see and round up the schooner with forestaysail aback to leeward of her to wait until she drove down on them  this would not have been difficult in a moderate breeze but the wind was blowing furiously and the schooner was greatly pressed with sail he thought of calling the others to lower the mainsail peak but with the weight of wind there was in the canvas he was not sure that they could haul down the gaff besides they were busy securing the boat which must be made fast again before they hove the other in and it was almost dark now in view of what had happened in the same waters one night four years before the desire to pick up the boat while there was a little light left became an obsession  the swell was rapidly whitening and getting steeper the selache hove herself out of it forward as she swung up with streaming bows it seemed to wyllard that he must overrun the boat before he noticed her but at last he saw dampier swing himself on to the rail the skipper stood there clutching at a shroud and presently swinging an arm turned toward wyllard  eight ahead he shouted let her come up a few points before you run over them  wyllard put his helm down a spoke or two which was easy and then as the bows swung high again there was a harsh cry from the man who stood above dampier in the shrouds  ice he roared big pack of it right under your weather bow  dampier shouted something but wyllard did not hear what he said he was conscious only that he had to decide what he must do in the next few seconds if he let the selache come up to avoid the boat there was the ice ahead and at the speed she was traveling it would infallibly incrush her bows while if he held her straight there was the boat close in front of her to swing her clear of both by going to leeward he must bring the mainsail and boomforesail over with a tremendous shock but that seemed preferable and with his heart in his mouth he pulled his helm up  he fancied he cried out in warning but was never sure of it though three men came running to seize the mainsheet the schooner fell off a little swinging until the boomforesail came over with a thunderous bang and crash she rolled down heaving a wide strip of wet planking out of the sea and now for a moment or two there were great breadths of canvas swung out on either hand then the ponderous mainboom went up high above his head and he saw three shadowy figures dragged aft as they tried in vain to steady it the big mainsail was bunched up a vast portentous shape above him and he set his lips and pulled up the helm another spoke as it swung  he never quite knew what happened after that there was a horrible crash and the schooner appeared to be rolling over bodily the spokes he clung to desperately reft themselves from his grasp the deck slanted until one could not stand upon it and something heavy struck him on the head he dropped and dampier flung himself upon the wheel above his senseless body  there was mad confusion and a frantic banging of canvas as the schooner came up beam to the wind with her rent mainsail flogging itself to tatters its ponderous boom was broken and the mainmasthead had gone but it was not the first time the sealers had grappled with similar difficulties and dampier kept his head he had the boat to think of and she was somewhere to windward hidden in the sudden darkness and the turmoil of the quickly rising sea but the schooner counted most of all his crew could scarcely hear him through the uproar made by the thundering canvas and the screaming of the wind but the orders were given and from habit and the custom of their calling the men knew what the commands must be  they hauled a jib down backed the forestaysail and got the boomforesail sheeted in but they let the rent mainsail bang for it could do no more damage than it had already done  a man sprang up on the rail with a blue light in his hand and as the weird radiance flared in a long streak to leeward a cry rose from the water in another few moments a blurred object half hidden in flying spray drove down upon the schooner furiously on the top of a sea and then there was sudden darkness as the man flung down the torch  another harsh and halfheard cry rose out of the obscurity an indistinguishable object plunged past the schooners stern there was a crash to leeward as the schooner rolled and a man standing up in the boat clutched her rail the man was swung out of it as the vessel rolled back again but he crawled on to the rail with a rope in one hand and after jamming it fast around something he sprang down with the hooks of the lifting tackles which one of the crew had given him while two more men scrambled up there was a clatter of blocks but a shattered sea struck the boat as they hove her clear and when she swung in the brine poured out through the rents in her dampier waved an arm as they dropped her on the deck and they heard him faintly  boys he shouted you have got to cut that mainsail down  they obeyed somehow hanging on to the masthoops and now and then enveloped by the madly flogging canvas after that they trimmed her forestaysail over and there was by contrast a curious quietness as dampier jammed his helm up and the schooner swung off before the sea  then somebody lighted a lantern and charly stooped over wyllard who lay limp and still beside the wheel in the feeble light wyllards face showed gray except where a broad red stain had spread across it dampier cast a glance at him  get him below and into his bunk two of you he commanded  the men carried him with difficulty for the selache lurched viciously each time a whitetopped sea came up upon her quarter as soon as it seemed advisable to leave the deck dampier went down wyllard lay in his bunk with his eyes halfopen his face was colorless except for the broad smear of blood which was oozing fast from a laceration in his scalp dampier who noticed his chilliness did not trouble about the wound he stripped off the senseless mans long boots and unshipping a hot fender iron from the stove laid it against his feet afterward he contrived to get some whisky down wyllards throat and then he set to work to wash the scalp wound dropping into the water a little of the permanganate of potash which is freely used at sea when that was done he applied a rag dipped in the same fluid and seeing no result of his efforts went back on deck he was anxious about his patient but not unduly so for he had discovered long ago that men of wyllards type are apt to recover from more serious injuries  it was blowing very hard when the skipper stood near the wheel a steep sea was already tumbling after the schooner but she was at least heading out from where they supposed the ice to be and he let her go keeping her away before it and heading a little south of east the next morning the sea was very high and the faint light was further dimmed by snow but it seemed safe to dampier and the vessel held on while the big combers came up astern and forged by high above her rail  the selache was traveling fast to the eastward she was under boomforesail and one little jib with her mainmast broken short off where the bolts of the halliard blocks had traversed it dampier realized that every knot the vessel made then could not be recovered that season he wondered with a little uneasiness what wyllard would say when he came to himself again  next day the breeze moderated somewhat and they let the schooner come up a little heading further south on the morning after that wyllard showed signs of returning consciousness dampier however kept away from him partly to allow his senses to readjust themselves and partly because he shrank from the necessary interview when dusk was falling charly went on deck to say that wyllard who seemed perfectly conscious insisted on seeing the skipper and with some misgivings dampier went down into the little cabin the lamp was lighted and when he sat down wyllard who raised himself feebly on his pillow turned a pallid face to him  charly tells me you picked the boat up he said  we did answered dampier she had three or four planks on one side ripped out of her  wyllards faint grimace implied that this did not matter and dampier braced himself for the question he dreaded he had to face it another moment  hows she heading  a little south of east  wyllards face hardened it was still blowing moderately and by the heave of the vessel and the wash of water outside he could guess how fast she was traveling for a moment or two there was an oppressive silence in the little cabin then wyllard spoke again  you have been running to the eastwards since i was struck down he asked  dampier nodded three days he confessed just now the breeze is on her quarter  he winced under wyllards gaze and spread out his hands with a deprecating gesture  now he added what else was there i could do she wrung her masthead off when you jibed her and theres not stick enough left to set any canvas that would shove her to windward i might have hove her to but the first time the breeze hauled easterly shed have gone up on the beach or among the ice with us i had to run  wyllard closed a feeble hand dunton was crippled too its almost incredible  in one way it looks like that but after all a jibes quite a common thing with a foreandafter if you run her off to lee when shes going before it her mainbooms bound to come over of course nobody would run her off in a wicked breeze unless he had to but youd no choice with the ice in front of you  wyllard lay very still for a minute it was clear to him that his project must be abandoned for that season which meant that at least six months must elapse before he could even approach the kamtchatkan coast again  well he inquired at length what do you mean to do  if the breeze holds we could pick up one of the aleutians in a few days but im keeping south of the islands therell probably be ugly ice along the beaches and ive no fancy for being cast ashore by a strong tide when the fog lies on the land with westerly winds id sooner hold on for alaska we could lie snug in an inlet there and its quite likely get a cedar that would make a spar i cant head right away for vancouver with no mainsail  this was clear to wyllard who made a weak gesture if the wind comes easterly  dampier pursed up his lips then unless i could fetch one of the kuriles wed sure be jammed she wont beat to windward and thered be all kamtchatka to lee of us the ice is packing up along the north of it now and the russians have two or three settlements to the south we dont want to run in and tell them what were after  a faint smile touched wyllards lips no he said not after that little affair on the beach since its very probable that the vessel they send up to the seal islands would deliver store along the coast the folks in authority would have a record of it they would call the thing piracyand in a sense theyd be justified  he was silent for a few moments and then looked up again wearily  i wonder he remarked how that boats crew ever got across to kamtchatka it was north of the islands where the man brought dunton the message  dampier understood that wyllard desired to change the subject for this was a question they had often discussed already  well he replied i still hold to my first notion they were blown ashore on the beach we have just left and made prisoners then a supply schooner or perhaps a steamer came along and they were sent off in her to be handed over to the authorities the vessel put in somewhere well say she was lying in an inlet with a boat astern and somehow our friends cut that boat loose in the dark and got away in her  he broke off for a moment to look at his companion significantly  you can find quite a few points where that idea seems to fail he added they were in kamtchatka but im beginning to feel that we shall never know any more than that  wyllard made a gesture of concurrence but in his face dampier saw no sign that he meant to abandon his project he seemed to sink into sleep and the skipper who went up on deck paced to and fro a while before he stopped by the wheel and turned to the helmsman  you can let her come up a couple of points we may as well make a little southing while we can he said  charly who was steering looked up with suggestive eagerness then hes not going for the aleutians  no answered dampier dryly i was kind of afraid of that but i choked him off anyway this year wont see us back in vancouver he paused were going to stay up here until we find out where those men left their bones the man who has this thing in hand isnt the kind that lets up  charly made no answer but his face hardened as he put his helm down a spoke or two  next day the wind fell lighter but for a week it still held westerly and after that it blew moderately fresh from the south crippled as she was the selache would lie a point or two south of east when they had set an old cutdown forestaysail on what was left of her mainmast the hearts of her crew became lighter as she crawled on across the pacific the men had no wish to be blown back to the frozen north  the days were growing shorter rapidly and the sun hung low in the southern sky when at last the schooner crept into one of the many inlets that indent the coast of southern alaska there was just wind enough to carry her in around a long foamlapped point and soon afterwards they let the anchor go in four fathoms of water their haven was a sheltered arm of the sea with a river mouth not far away there was no sign of life anywhere and the ragged cedars that crept close down to the beach stood out in somber spires against the gleaming snow  the cold was not particularly severe when the selache arrived but when dampier went ashore next morning to pick a log from which they could hew a mast the temperature suddenly fell and that night the drift ice from the river mouth closed in on them when the late daylight broke the schooner was frozen fast and they knew it would be several months before she moved again it was before the gold rush and in winter alaska was practically cut off from all communication with the south no man would have attempted to traverse the tremendous snowwrapped desolation of almost impassable hills and trackless forests that lay between them and the nearest of the commercial factories on the north or the canneries on the other hand besides the canneries were shut up in winter time they were prisoners and could only wait with what patience they could muster until the thaw set them free again     chapter xviii  a delicate errand   there was a sharp frost outside and the prairie was white with a thin sprinkle of snow when a little party sat down to supper in the hastings homestead one saturday evening hastings sat at the head of the table mrs hastings at the foot with her little daughters and agatha sproatly and winifred between them sproatly and winifred had just driven over from the railroad settlement as they did now and then and that was why the meal which was usually served early in the evening had been delayed an hour or so the two hired men whom mrs hastings had not kept waiting had gone out to some task in the barn or stables  sproatly took a bundle of papers out of his pocket and laid them on the table there had been a remarkable change in his appearance for he now wore store clothes and the skin coat he had taken off when he came in was a new one it occurred to mrs hastings that there was a certain significance in this though sproatly had changed his occupation some time before and now drove about the prairie as an agent for certain makers of agricultural implements  i called for your mail and gregorys before we left he said i had to go around to see hawtrey which is partly what made us so late though winifred couldnt get away as soon as she expected they have floods of wheat coming in to the elevators and i understand that the milling people cant take another bushel in  mrs hastings glanced at agatha who understood what the look meant for sproatly had hitherto spoken of winifred circumspectly as miss rawlinson  hastings took the papers which agatha handed to him and laid them aside  well let them wait until suppers over i dont expect any news thats particularly good he said the bottoms apparently dropping out of the wheat market  mr hamilton cant get cars enough and well have to shut down in another day or two unless they turn up remarked winifred its much the same all along the line the winnipeg traffic people wired us that they havent an empty car in the yards why do you rush the grain in that way its bound to break the market  hastings smiled well he explained a good many of us have bills to meet for another thing theyve had a heavy crop in manitoba dakota and minnesota and i suppose some folks have an idea theyll get in first before the other people swamp the eastern markets i think theyre foolish its a temporary scare prices will stiffen by and by  thats what mr hamilton says but i suppose the thing is natural men are very like sheep arent they  mr hastings laughed well he admitted we are in some respects when prices break a little we generally rush to sell one or two of my neighbors are holding on and its hardly likely that very much of my wheat will be flung on to a falling market  we have been getting a good deal from the range  there was displeasure in hastings face gregorys selling largely on harrys account  theyve been hauling wheat in to us for the last few weeks said winifred  agatha noticed that hastings glanced at his wife significantly but mrs hastings interposed and forbade any further conversation on the subject until supper was over after the table had been cleared hastings opened his papers the others sat expectantly silent while he turned the pages over one after another  no he said theres no news of harry and im afraid its scarcely possible that well hear anything of him this winter  agatha was conscious that mrs hastings eyes were upon her and she sat very still though her heart was beating faster than usual hastings went on again  the colonist has a line or two about a barque from alaska which put into victoria short of stores she was sent up to an a c c factory and had to clear out before she was ready the ice it seems was closing in unusually early a steam whaler at portland reports the same thing and from the news brought by a steamer from japan all communication with northeastern asia is already cut off  no one spoke for a moment or two and agatha leaning back in her chair glanced around the room there was not much furniture in it but though this was unusual on the prairie door and double casements were guarded by heavy hangings the big brass lamp overhead shed a cheerful light and birch wood in the stove snapped and cracked noisily and the stovepipe which was far too hot to touch diffused a drowsy heat one could lounge beside the fire contentedly knowing that the stinging frost was drying the snow to dusty powder outside the cozy room heightened the contrast that all recognized in thinking of wyllard agatha pictured the little schooner bound fast in the northern ice and then two or three travelworn men crouching in a tiny tent that was buffeted by an arctic gale she could see the poles bend and the tricings strain  after that with a sudden transition her thoughts went back to the early morning when wyllard had driven away and every detail of the scene rose up clearly in her mind she saw him and the stolid dampier sitting in the wagon with nothing in their manner to suggest that they were setting out upon a perilous venture and she felt his hand close tight upon her fingers as it had done just before the vehicle jolted away from the homestead she could once more see the wagon growing smaller and smaller on the white prairie until it dipped behind the crest of a low hill and the sinking beat of hoofs died away then at least she had realized that he had started on the first stage of a journey which might lead him through the icebound gates of the north to the rest that awaits the souls of sailors she could not however imagine him shrinking from any ordeal gripping helm or hauling in the sled traces he would gaze with quiet eyes steadfastly ahead even if he saw only the passage from this world to the next once more a curious thrill ran through her and there was pride as well as regret in it presently she became conscious that hastings was speaking  what took you around by the range jim he asked  collecting answered sproatly i sold gregory a couple of binders earlier in the season but i couldnt get a dollar out of him he laughed of course if it had been anybody else id have stayed until he handed over the money but i couldnt press gregory too hard after quartering myself upon him as i did last winter though im rather afraid my employers wouldnt appreciate that kind of delicacy  mrs hastings looked thoughtful gregory should have been able to pay he thrashed out a moderately good crop  about twothirds of what it should have been and ive reason for believing that he has been putting up a mortgage interests heavy theres another matter i wonder if youve heard that hes getting rid of two of harrys hands i mean pat and tom moran  youre sure of that hastings asked sharply  tom told me  mrs hastings leaned forward suddenly in her chair then she said im going to drive across on monday and have a few words with gregory did moran tell you that harry had decided to keep the two of them on throughout the year  he wasnt very explicit but he seemed to feel he had a grievance against gregory of course in a way you cant blame gregory hes in charge and it isnt in him to carry out harrys policy this fall in wheat is getting on his nerves and in any case hed probably have held his hand and cut down the crop next year  i do blame him mrs hastings turned to agatha you will understand that in a general way theres not much that can be done when the snows upon the ground and as one result of it the hired man prefers to engage himself for the year to secure himself from being turned adrift when harvest is over he frequently makes a concession in wages now i know harry intended to keep those two men on and tom moran who has a little halfcleared ranch back somewhere in the bush of ontario came out here tempted by higher wages i understand he had to raise a few dollars or give the place up and he left his wife behind many of the smaller ranch men cant live upon their holdings well im going over on monday to tell gregory he has got to keep these two men and youre coming with me  agatha made no reply in the first place she knew that if mrs hastings had made any plan she would gain nothing by objecting and in addition to this she was conscious of a certain desire to go she felt that if wyllard had let the men understand that he would not dismiss them the promise implied or explicit must be redeemed wyllard would not have attempted to release himself from itshe was sure of thatand it appeared intolerable to her that another man should be permitted to do anything that would unfavorably reflect on him somewhat to her relief hastings started another topic  you have sold quite a few binders and harrows one way or another havent you jim he asked  sproatly laughed i have he answered as i told the companys western representative some time ago a man who could sell patent medicine to the folks round here could do a good trade in anything he admitted that my contention sounded reasonable but i didnt wear store clothes then and he seemed very far from sure of me anyway he gave me a show and now ive got two or three complimentary letters from the company theyve added a few dollars to my salary and hint that its possible they may put me in charge of an implement store  and youre satisfied  well said sproatly with an air of reflection in some respects i suppose i am in others the things galling you have to report who youve called upon and if you couldnt do business why they bought somebody elses machines if you cant get a farmer to take you in you have to put up at a hotel theres no more camping in a birch bluff under your wagon besides you have to wear store clothes  hastings glanced at winifred and agatha fancied that she understood what was in his mind  some folks would sooner sleep in a hotel he remarked with a twinkle in his eyes  then declared sproatly they dont know very much theyre the kind of men whod spend an hour every morning putting their clothes on and they havent found out that theres no comfort in any garment until youve had to sew two or three flour bag patches on to it then think of the splendid freeness of the other way of living you get your supper when you want it and just as you like it no tea tastes as good as the kind with the wood smoke in it that you drink out of a blackened can you can hear the little birch leaves and the grasses whispering about you when you lie down at night and you drive on in the glorious freshnessjust when it pleases youevery morning now the company has the whole route and programme plotted out for me their clerks write me letters demanding most indelicately why i havent done this and that  winifred looked at him disapprovingly civilization she said implies responsibility you cant live just as you like without its being detrimental to the community  oh yes returned sproatly with a rueful gesture it implies no end of giving up you have to fall into line and thats why i kept outside it just as long as i could i dont like standing in a rank and he glanced down at his cloth ive an inborn objection to wearing uniform  agatha laughed as she caught hastings eye she guessed that sproatly would be sorry for his candor afterwards but to some extent she understood what he was feeling it was a revolt against cramping customs and conventionalities and she partly sympathized with it though she knew that such revolts are dangerous even in the west those who cannot lead must march in column with the rank and file or bear the consequences of their futile mutiny it is a hard truth that no man can live as he pleases  restraint asserted winifred is a wholesome thing but its one most of the men i have met are singularly deficient in thats why they cant be left alone but must be driven as they are in companies its their own fault if they now and then find it a little humiliating  there was a faint gleam in her eyes at which sproatly apparently took warning for he said no more upon that subject and they talked about other matters until he took his departure an hour or two later it was the next afternoon when he appeared again and mrs hastings smiled at agatha as he and winifred drove away together  thirty miles is a long way to drive in the frost i suppose you have noticed that she calls him jim mrs hastings commented anyway theres a good deal of very genuine ability in that young man he isnt altogether wild  his appearance rather suggested it when i first met him replied agatha with a laugh was it a pose  no said mrs hastings reflectively i think one could call it a reaction and its probable that some very worthy people in the old country are to blame for it sproatly is not the only young man who has suffered from having too many rules and conventions crammed down his throat in fact theyre rather plentiful  agatha said nothing further for the little girls appeared just then and it was not until the next afternoon that she and mrs hastings were again alone together then as they drove across the prairie the older woman spoke of the business they had in hand  gregory must keep those men she said theres no doubt that harry meant to do it and it would be horribly unfair to turn them loose now when there is absolutely nothing going on besides tom moran is a man im specially sorry for as i told you he left a young wife and a very little child behind him when he came out here  one would wonder why he did it responded agatha  he had to there seems to be a notion in the old country that we earn our money easily but its very wrong well take that mans case as an example he has a little desolate holding up in the bush of ontario a hole chopped out of the forest and studded all over with sawnoff firstumps on it is a little tworoomed log shack in all probability there isnt a settlement within two or three leagues of the spot now as a rule a place of that kind wont produce enough to keep a man for several years after he has partially cleared it and unless he can earn something in the meanwhile he must give it up moran it seems got heavily into debt with the nearest storekeeper and had to choose between selling the place or coming out here where wages are higher well you can probably imagine what it must be to the woman who stayed behind in the desolate bush seeing nobody for weeks together though ive no doubt that shed bear it uncomplainingly believing that her husband would come back with enough to clear the debt  agatha could imagine the state of affairs in the little home and a certain indignation against gregory crept into her heart she had once liked to think of him as pitiful and chivalrous and now it seemed he was quite willing that this woman should make her sacrifice in vain  but why have you taken the trouble to impress this onme she asked  mrs hastings smiled i want you to plead that womans cause gregory may do what you ask him gracefully that would be much the nicest way out of it  the nicest way  yes answered mrs hastings there is another one gregory is going to keep tom moran anyway harry has one or two friends in this neighborhood who feel it more or less of an obligation on them to maintain his credit  agatha felt the blood rise to her face it was an unpleasant thing to admit but she fancied that gregory might yield to judicious pressure when he would not be influenced by either compassion or a sense of equity it flashed upon her that had mrs hastings believed that she still retained any tenderness for the man the story of moran would not have been told to her the whole situation was horribly embarrassing but agatha had courage in her  well she promised simply i will speak to him  they said nothing more until they approached the range and as they drove by the outbuildings agatha glanced about her curiously it occurred to her that the homestead did not look quite the same as it appeared when wyllard was there a wagon without one wheel stood near the straw pile a door of the barn hung awkwardly open in a manner which suggested that it needed mending and the snow had blown inside the building in the side of one sod and pole structure there was a gap which should have been repaired several other things suggested slackness and indifference she saw mrs hastings frown  there is a change in the place already said her friend they alighted in another minute or two and when they entered the house the grayhaired swedish woman greeted them moodily she seemed to notice the glance mrs hastings cast around her and her manner became deprecatory  i cant keep things straight now it is not the same she complained  mrs hastings asked if hawtrey was in and hearing that he was turned to agatha go along and talk to him ive something to say to mrs nansen she said     chapter xix  the prior claim   it was with confused feelings among which a sense of repugnance predominated that agatha walked toward hawtreys room she was not one of the women who take pleasure in pointing out another persons duty for while she had discovered that this task is apparently an easy one to some people she was aware that a duty usually looks much more burdensome when it is laid upon ones self indeed she was conscious just then that one might be shortly thrust upon her which she would find it very hard to bear and she became troubled with a certain compunction as she remembered how she had of late persistently driven all thought of it out of her mind  there was no doubt that she was still pledged to gregory and that she had loved him once both facts had to be admitted and it seemed to her that if he insisted she must marry him deep down in her there was an innate sense of right and honesty and she realized that the fact that he was not the man she had once imagined him to be did not release her it was clear that if he was about to commit a cruel and unjustifiable action she was the one person of all others whose part it was to restrain him  the color was a little plainer in her face than usual when she entered the room where he lay pipe in hand in a lounge chair his attitude of languid ease irritated her she had seen that there were several things outside which should have had some claim on his attention a litter of letters and papers lay upon a little table at his side but the fact that he could not reach them as he lay was suggestive he did not notice her entrance immediately he rose when he saw her and came forward with outstretched hand  i didnt hear you he said this is a pleasure i scarcely anticipated  agatha sat down in the chair that he drew out for her near the stove he noticed that she glanced at the papers on the table and he laughed  bills and things of that kind theyve been worrying me for a week or two he said lightly he seized the litter and bundling it together flung it into an open drawer which he shut with a snap anyway thats the last of them for today im awfully glad you drove over  agatha smiled the action was so characteristic of the man she had once found no fault with gregorys careless habits and his way of thrusting a difficulty into the background had appealed to her it had suggested his ability to straighten out the trouble when it appeared advisable now she told herself that she would not be absurdly hypercritical and as it happened he had given her the lead that she desired  i should think that you would have had to give them more attention as wheat is going down she remarked  hawtrey looked at her with an air of reproach it must be nearly three weeks since i have seen you and now you expect me to talk of farming he made a rueful gesture if you quite realized the situation it would be about the last thing you would ask me to do  agatha was astonished to remember that three weeks had actually elapsed since she had last met him and they had only exchanged a word or two then he had certainly not obtruded himself upon her for which she was grateful  nobody is talking about anything except the fall in prices just now she persisted i suppose it affects you too  gregory who seemed to accept this as a rebuff looked at her rather curiously and then laughed  it must be admitted that it does in fact ive been acquiring parsimonious habits and worrying myself about expenses lately the expenses have to be kept down somehow and thats a kind of thing i never took kindly to  you feel it a greater responsibility when youre managing somebody elses affairs suggested agatha who was still awaiting her opportunity  well replied hawtrey in whom there was after all a certain honesty thats not quite the only thing that has some weight with me you see im not altogether disinterested i get a certain percentageon the marginafter everything is paid and i want it to be a big one things are rather tight just now and the wretched mortgage on my place is crippling me  it had slipped out before he quite realized what he was saying and he saw the girls look of concern she now realized what sproatly had meant  you are in debt gregory i thought you had at least kept clear of that she said  so i didfor a while in any case if wyllard stays away and i can run this place on the right lines i shall no doubt get out of it again  she was vexed that he should speak so selfishly for it was clear to her that if wyllard did not return until another crop was gathered in it would be because he was held fast among the northern ice in peril of his life then another thought struck her she had never quite understood why gregory had been willing to undertake the management of the range in view of the probability that wyllard had plainly told him what to expect concerning herself she had been greatly puzzled by his acquiescence but he had made that point clear by admitting that he had been burdened with a load of debt but why had he incurred debts the answer came to her as she remembered having heard mrs hastings or somebody else say that he had spent a great deal of money upon his house and the furnishings for it it brought her a sudden sense of confusion for as one result of that expenditure he had been forced into doing what she fancied must have been a very repugnant thing and she had never even crossed his threshold  when did you borrow that money she asked sharply  there was no doubt that gregory was embarrassed and her heart softened toward him for his hesitation it was to further her comfort that he had laid that load upon himself and he was clearly unwilling that she should know it that counted for much in her favor  was it just before i came out she asked again  hawtrey made a little sign of expostulation you really mustnt worry me about these matters aggy a good many of us are in the storekeepers or mortgagejobbers hands and theres no doubt that if i have another good year at the range i shall clear off the debt  agatha turned her face away from him for a moment or two the thing that gregory had done laid a heavy obligation on her and she remembered that she had only found fault with him even then stirred as she was she was conscious that all the tenderness that she had once felt for him had vanished the duty however remained and with a little effort she turned to him again  oh she exclaimed im so sorry  hawtrey smiled i really dont think i deserve a very great deal of pity as i have said ill probably come out all right next year if i can only keep expenses down  then agatha remembered the task that she had in hand it was a very inauspicious moment to set about it but that could not be helped and even for gregorys own sake she felt that she must win him over  there is one way gregory in which i dont think it ought to be done she said you assumed mr wyllards obligations when you took the farm and i think you should keep the two morans  hawtrey started ah he replied mrs hastings has been setting you on i partly expected it  she told me agatha admitted unless you will look at the thing as i do i could almost wish she hadnt the thought of that mans wife shut up in the woods all winter only to find that what she has had to bear has all been thrown away troubles me now wyllard promised to keep those men on didnt he  there was no regular engagement so far as i can make out  still moran seems to have understood that he was to be kept on  yes replied hawtrey he evidently does if the market had gone with us id have fallen in with his views as it hasnt every mans wages count  agatha was conscious of a little thrill of repugnance of late gregorys ideas had frequently jarred on her  does that release you  hawtrey did not answer this  ill keep those men on if you want me to he promised  agatha winced at this she had discovered that she must not look for too much from gregory but to realize that he had practically no sense of moral obligation and could be influenced to do justice only by the expectation of obtaining her favor positively hurt her  i want them kept on but i dont want you to do it for that reason she said cant you grasp the distinction gregory  a trace of darker color dyed hawtreys face but while she was a little surprised at the evidence that he felt her rebuke he looked at her steadily he had not thought much about her during the last month but now the faint scorn in her voice aroused his resentment  now he said there are just three reasons aggy why you should have troubled yourself about this thing you are perhaps a little sorry for morans wife but as you havent even seen her that can hardly count for much the next is that you dont care to see me doing what you regard as a shabby thing perhaps it is a shabby thing in some respects but i feel its justifiable of course if thats your reason theres a sense in which while not exactly complimentaryits consoling  he broke off and looked at her with a question in his eyes and it cost agatha an effort to meet his she was not prudish or overconscious of her own righteousness but once or twice after the shock of her disillusionment in regard to him had lessened she had dreamed of the possibility of endowing him little by little with some of the qualities she had once fancied he possessed and as she vaguely thought of it rehabilitating him now however the thing seemed impossible and what was more the desire to bring it about had gone hateful as the situation was becoming she was honest and she could not let him credit her with a motive that had not influenced her  in the meanwhile her very coldness and aloofness stirred desire in the man and she shrank as she saw a spark of passion kindling in his eyes she recognized that there was a strain of grossness in him  no she responded that reason was not one which had any weight with me  hawtreys face darkened then he said grimly well get on to the third wyllards credit is a precious thing to you sooner than anything should cast a stain on it you would beg a favor fromme you have set him up on a pedestal and it would hurt you if he came down considering everything its a remarkably curious situation  agatha grew pale gregory was horribly right for she had no doubt now that he had merely thrust upon her a somewhat distressing truth it was to save wyllards credit and for that alone that she had undertaken this most unpleasant task she did not answer and hawtrey stood up  wyllard has his faults but theres this in his favorhe keeps a promise he said one has a certain respect for a person who never goes back upon his word well because i really think he would like it ill keep those men  he paused for a moment as if to let her grasp the drift of his words and then turned to her with something that startled her in his voice and manner the question isare you willing to emulate his example  agatha shrank from the glow in his eyes oh she broke out you cannot urge me nowafter what you said  hawtrey laughed harshly well he said ill come for my answer very shortly it seems that you and wyllard attach a great deal of importance to a moral obligationand i must remind you that the time agreed upon is almost up  agatha sat very still for perhaps half a minute while a sense of dismay took possession of her there was no doubt that gregorys retort was fully warranted she had insisted upon his carrying out an obligation which would cost him something not because she took pleasure in seeing him do what was honorable but to preserve the credit of another man and now it was with intense repugnance that she recognized that there was apparently no escaping from the obligation she had incurred gregorys attitude was perfectly natural and logical she had promised to marry him and he had saddled himself with a load of debt on her account but the slight pity and tenderness that she had felt for him a few minutes earlier had utterly disappeared indeed she felt that she almost hated him his face had grown hard and almost brutal and there was a look she shrank from in his eyes  she rose with trembling limbs  do you wish to speak to mrs hastings she asked  hawtreys lip curled no he said if shell excuse me i dont think i do if you tell her you have been successful shell probably be quite content  agatha went out without another word hawtrey lighted his pipe and stretched himself out in his chair when he heard the wagon drive away a few minutes later he did not like mrs hastings and had a suspicion that she had no great regard for him but he was conscious of a grim satisfaction there was though it seldom came to the surface a current of crude brutality in his nature and it was active now when agatha had first come from england the change in her had been a shock to him and it would not have cost him very much to let her go since then however her coldness and halfperceived disdain had angered him and the interview which was just past had left him in an unpleasant mood though it was perhaps the last effect he would have expected it had stirred him to desire a fulfillment of her pledge it was consoling to feel that he could exact the keeping of her promise his face grew coarser as he assured himself of his claim but he had never realized the shiftiness and instability of his own character it was his misfortune that the impulses which swayed him one day had generally changed the next  this became apparent when having occasion to drive in to the elevators on the railroad a week later he called at a store to make one or two purchases the man who kept the store laid a package on the counter  i wonder if youd take this along to miss creighton as a favor he said she wrote for the things and elliot was to take them out but i guess he forgot anyway he didnt call  hawtrey told the clerk to put the package in his wagon he had scarcely seen sally since his recovery and he suddenly remembered that after all he owed her a good deal and that she was very pretty besides one could talk to sally without feeling the restraint that agathas manner usually laid on him  the storekeeper laid an open box upon the counter  i guess youre going to be married by and by he said hawtrey was thinking of sally then and the question irritated him  i dont know that it concerns you but in a general way its probable he replied  well said the storekeeper goodhumoredly a pair of these mittens would make quite a nice present for a lady smartest thing of the kind ive ever seen here choicest alaska fur  hawtrey bought a pair and the storekeeper took a fur cap out of another box  now he said this is just the thing shed like to go with the mittens theres style about that cap feel the gloss of it  hawtrey bought the cap and smiled as he swung himself up into his wagon gloves are not much use in the prairie frost and mittens which are not divided into fingerstalls will within limits fit almost anybody this he felt was fortunate for he was not quite sure that he meant to give them to agatha  it was bitterly cold and the pace the team made was slow for the snow was loose and too thin for a sled of any kind night had closed down and hawtrey was suffering from the cold when at last a birch bluff rose out of the waste in front of him it cut black against the cold blueness of the sky and the spectral gleam of snow but when he had driven a little further a stream of ruddy orange light appeared in the midst of it a few minutes later he pulled his team up in front of a little logbuilt house and getting down with difficulty saw the door open as he approached it sally stood in the entrance silhouetted against a blaze of cheerful light  oh she cried gregory  hawtrey recognized the thrill in her voice and took both her hands as he had once been in the habit of doing  will you let me in he asked  the girl laughed in a strained fashion she had been a little startled and was not quite sure yet as to how she should receive him but hawtrey drew her in  the old folks are out she said theyve gone over to elliots for supper hes bringing us a package  hawtrey who explained that he had the parcel let her hands go and sat down somewhat limply he had come suddenly out of the bitter frost into the little brightlylighted stovewarmed room the comfort and cheeriness of it appealed to him  this looks very cozy after my desolate room at the range he remarked  then if youll stay ill cook you supper i suppose theres nothing to take you home  no declared hawtrey with a significant glance at her there certainly isnt sally as a matter of fact i often wish there was  he saw her sudden uncertainty which was however not tinged with embarrassment and feeling that he had gone far enough he went out to put up his team when he returned there was a cloth on the table and sally was busy about the stove he sat down and watched her attentively in some respects he thought she compared favorably with agatha she had a nicely molded figure and a curious lithe gracefulness of carriage which was suggestive of a strong vitality agathas bearing was usually characterized by a certain frigid repose then sallys face was at least as comely as agathas though attractive in a different way and there was no reserve in it sally was what he thought of as human frankly flesh and blood her quick smile was as a rule provocative and never chilled one as agathas quiet glances sometimes did  sally he said youve grown prettier than ever  the girl turned partly towards him with a slow sinuous movement  now she replied quickly you oughtnt to say those things to me  hawtrey laughed he was usually sure of his ground with sally  why shouldnt i when im telling the truth  for one thing miss ismay wouldnt like it  gregorys face hardened im not sure shed mind anyway miss ismay doesnt like many things im in the habit of doing  sally who had watched him closely turned away again but a thrill of exultation ran through her it had been with dismay she had first heard him speak of his marriage and she had fled home in an agony of anger and humiliation that state of mind however had not lasted long and when it became evident that the wedding was postponed indefinitely she began to wonder whether it was quite impossible that hawtrey should come back to her she felt that he belonged to her although he had never given her any very definite claim on him she was primitive and passionate but she was determined and now that he had done what she had almost expected him to do she meant to keep him  you have fallen out she inquired and contrived to keep the anxiety that she was conscious of out of her voice  the question and more particularly the form of it jarred upon hawtrey but he answered it  oh no he said as a matter of fact sally you cant fall out nicely with everybody now when we fell out you got delightfully angryi dont know whether you were more delightful then or when you graciously agreed to make it up again he laughed i almost wish i could make you a little angry now  sally had moved nearer him to take a kettle off the stove and she looked down on him with her eyes shining in the lamplight she realized that she would have to fight miss ismay for the man but there was this in her favorthat she appealed directly to one side of his nature as agatha even if she had loved him could not have attracted him  would you she asked dare you try  i might if i was tempted sufficiently  she leaned upon the table still looking at him mockingly and she was probably aware that her pose and expression challenged him indeed she could not have failed to recognize the meaning of the sudden tightening of his lips though she did not in the least shrink from it she had not the faintest doubt of her ability to keep him at a due distance if it appeared necessary  oh she taunted you only say things  hawtrey laughed and stooping down packed up a package he had brought from the store  well he said after all i think id rather try to please you he opened the package are these things very much too big for you sally  the girls eyes glistened at the sight of the mittens he held out they were very different from the kind she had been in the habit of wearing and when he carelessly took out the fur cap she broke into a little cry of delight hawtrey watched her with a curious expression he was not quite sure that he had meant sally to have the things when he had purchased them but he was quite contented now the one gift he had diffidently offered agatha since her arrival in canada had been almost coldly laid aside  in a few minutes sally laid out supper and as she waited upon him daintily or filled his cup hawtrey thrust the misgivings he had felt further behind him sally he thought with a feeling of satisfaction could certainly cook when the meal was finished he sat talking about nothing in particular for almost an hour and then it occurred to him that sallys mother would be back before very long she was a person he had no great liking for and he was anxious to go  well he said i must be getting home wont you let me see you with that cap on  sally who betrayed no diffidence put on the cap and stood before a dingy mirror with both hands raised while she pressed it down upon her gleaming hair she flashed a smiling glance at him it was quite sufficient and as she turned again hawtrey slipped forward as softly as he could she swung around however with a flush in her face and a forceful restraining gesture  dont spoil it all gregory she said sharply  hawtrey who saw that she meant itwhich was a cause of some astonishment to himdropped his arms that were held out to embrace her  oh he said if you look at it in that way im sorry goodnight sally  she let him go but she smiled when he drove away and half an hour later she showed the cap and mittens to her mother with significant candor mrs creighton who was a severely practical person nodded  well she said he only wants a little managing if he bought you these and nobody could say you ran after him     chapter xx  the first stake   a fortnight had slipped by since the evening hawtrey had spent with sally when winifred and sproatly once more arrived at the hastings homestead the girl was looking jaded and it appeared that the manager of the elevator who had all along treated her with a great deal of consideration had insisted upon her going away for a few days when the pressure of business which had followed the harvest had slackened sproatly as usual had driven her in from the settlement  when the evening meal was finished they drew their chairs close up about the stove and hastings thrust fresh birch billets into it for there was a bitter frost mrs hastings installed winifred in a canvas lounge and wrapped a shawl about her  you havent got warm yet and youre looking quite worn out she said i suppose hamilton has still been keeping you at work until late at night  we have been very busy since i was last here winifred admitted and then turned to hastings until the last week or so there has been no slackening in the rush to sell everybody seems to have been throwing wheat on to the market  hastings looked thoughtful a good many of the smaller men have been doing so but i think theyre foolish theyre only helping to break down prices and i shouldnt wonder if one or two of the big longheaded buyers saw their opportunity in the temporary panic in fact if id a pile of money lying in the bank im not sure that i wouldnt send along a buying order and operate for a rise  mrs hastings shook her head at him no she said you certainly wouldnt while i had any say in the matter youre rather a good farmer but i havent met one yet who made a successful speculator some of our friends have tried itand you know where it landed them i expect those broker and mortgage men must lick their lips when a nice fat woolly farmer comes along it must be quite delightful to shear him  hastings laughed i should like to point out that most of the farmers in this country are decidedly thin and have uncommonly little wool on them then he turned to the others i feel inclined to tell you how mrs hastings made the expenses of her paris trip its an example of feminine consistency she went around the neighborhood and bought up all the wheat anybody had left on hand or at least she made me do it  mrs hastings who had means of her own nodded that was different she declared anyway i had the wheat and iknewit would go up  then why shouldnt other folks sell forward for instance when they know it will go down thats not what i suggested doing but the points the same  they havent got the wheat  of course they wouldnt operate for a fall if they had on the other hand if their anticipations proved correct they could buy it for less than they sold at before they had to deliver  that asserted mrs hastings severely is pure gambling its sure to land one in the hands of the mortgage jobber  hastings smiled at the others as a matter of fact it not infrequently does but i want you to note the subtle distinction the things quite legitimate if youve only got the wheat in a bag in such a case you must naturally operate for a rise  theres a good deal to be said for that point of view observed sproatly you can keep the wheat if youre not satisfied but when you try the other plan the margin that may vanish at any moment is the danger i suppose gregory has still been selling the range wheat winifred  i believe we have sent on every bushel  sproatly exchanged a significant glance with hastings whose face once more grew thoughtful  then remarked hastings if hes wise hell stop at that  mrs hastings changed the subject and drew her chair closer in to the stove which snapped and crackled cheerfully  it must be a lot colder where harry is she said with a shiver  she flashed a swift glance at agatha and saw the girls expression change but sproatly broke in again  it was bad enough driving in from the railroad this afternoon he said winifred was almost frozen that is why i didnt go round for the pattern mati think thats what creighton said it wasmrs creighton borrowed from you i met him at the settlement a day or two ago  mrs hastings said that he could bring it another time and while the rest talked of something else winifred turned to agatha  it really was horribly cold and i almost fancied one of my hands was frostnipped she said as it happens i cant buy mittens like your new ones  my new ones questioned agatha  the ones gregory bought you  agatha laughed my dear he never gave me any  winifred looked puzzled well she persisted he certainly bought them and a fur cap too i was in the store when he did it though i dont think he noticed me they were lovely mittenssuch a pretty brown fur  just then mrs hastings unobserved by either of them looked up and caught sproatlys eye his face became suddenly expressionless and he looked away  when was that agatha asked  a fortnight ago anyway  agatha sat silent and was glad when mrs hastings asked winifred a question she desired no gifts from gregory but since he had bought the cap and mittens she wondered what he could have done with them it was disconcerting to feel that while he evidently meant to hold her to her promise he must have given them to somebody else she had never heard of his acquaintance with sally creighton but it struck her as curious that although the six months delay he had granted her had lately expired he had neither sent her any word nor called at the homestead  a few minutes later mrs hastings took up a basket of sewing and moved towards the door sproatly who rose as she approached him drew aside his chair and she handed the basket to him  you can carry it if you like she said  sproatly took the basket and followed her into another room where he sat it down  well he said with a twinkle in his eyes  mrs hastings regarded him thoughtfully i wonder if you know what gregory did with those mittens  im rather pleased that i can assure that i dont  do you imagine that he kept them  im afraid i havent an opinion on that point  still if i said that i felt certain he had given them to somebody you would have some idea as to who it would probably be  well confessed sproatly reluctantly if you insist upon it i must admit that i could make a guess  mrs hastings smiled in a manner which suggested comprehension so could i she said i shouldnt wonder if we both guessed right now you may as well go back to the others  sproatly who made no answer turned away and he was talking to agatha when half an hour later a wagon drew up outside the door in another minute or two he leaned forward in amused expectation as sally walked into the room  im going on to landers and just called to bring back the mat you lent us she said to mrs hastings sproatly was to have come for it but he didnt  sproatly who said he was sorry fixed his eyes on her it was clear to him that agatha did not understand the situation but he fancied that sally was filled with an almost belligerent satisfaction she was wearing a smart fur cap and in one hand she carried a pair of new fur mittens which she had just taken off sproatly who glanced at them noticed that winifred did the same then mrs hastings spoke  i dont think you have met miss ismay sally she said  sally merely acknowledged that she had not been introduced and sproatly became more sure that the situation was an interesting one when mrs hastings formally presented her it was clear to him that agatha was somewhat puzzled by sallys attitude  as a matter of fact agatha who said that she must have had a cold drive was regarding the new arrival with a curiosity that she had not expected to feel when the girl first came in miss creighton she admitted was comely though she was clearly somewhat primitive and crude the long skin coat she wore hid her figure but her pose was too virile and there was a look which mystified agatha in her eyes it was almost openly hostile and there was a suggestion of triumph in it agatha who could find no possible reason for this resented it  sally had remained standing and as she said nothing further there was an awkward silence she was the dominant figure in the room and the others became sensible of a slight constraint and embarrassment as she gazed at agatha with unwavering eyes in fact it was rather a relief to them when at last she turned to mrs hastings  i cant stop it wouldnt do to leave the team in this frost said she  this was so evident that they let her go and mrs hastings who went with her to the door afterwards sat down beside sproatly a little apart from the rest  ive no doubt you noticed those mittens she commented softly  i did sproatly admitted i think you can rely upon my discretion if you hadnt wanted this assurance i dont suppose youd have said anything upon the subject it however seems very probable that winifred noticed them too  does that mean youre not sure that winifreds discretion is equal to your own  sproatlys eyes twinkled in this particular case the trouble is that shes animated by a sincere attachment to miss ismay and has i understand a rather poor opinion of gregory of course i dont know how far your views on that point coincide with hers  do you expect me to explain them to you  no answered sproatly im only anxious to keep out of the thing gregory is a friend of mine and after all he has his strong points i should however like to mention that winifreds expression suggests that shes thinking of something  mrs hastings smiled then i must endeavor to have a word or two with her  she left him with this and not long afterwards she and winifred went out together when the others were retiring she detained agatha for a minute or two in the empty room  havent the six months gregory gave you run out yet she asked  agatha said they had but she spoke in a careless tone and it was evident that she had attached no particular significance to the fact that sally had worn a new fur cap  he hasnt been over to see you since  the girl who admitted it looked troubled mrs hastings laid a hand upon her shoulder  my dear she said if he does come you must put him off  why agatha asked in a low strained voice  for one thing because we want to keep you mrs hastings looked at her with a very friendly smile are you very anxious to make it up with gregory a shiver ran through the girl oh she exclaimed i cant answer you that i must do what is right  to her astonishment mrs hastings drew her a little nearer stooped and kissed her  most of us i believe have that wish but the thing is often horribly complex she said anyway you must put gregory off again if its only for another month or two i fancy you will not find it difficult  she turned away thus ending the conversation but her manner had been so significant that agatha who did not sleep well that night decided if it was possible to act on the wellmeant advice  it happened that a little dapper man who was largely interested in the land agency and general mortgage business spent that evening with hawtrey in wyllards room at the range he had driven around by hawtreys homestead earlier in the afternoon and had deduced a good deal from the state of it though this was a point he kept to himself now he lay on a lounge chair beside the stove smoking one of wyllards cigars and unobtrusively watching his companion there was a roll of bills in his pocket with which gregory had very reluctantly parted  in view of the fall in wheat it must have been rather a pull for you to pay me that interest he remarked  it certainly was hawtrey admitted with a rueful smile im sorry it had to be done  i dont quite see how you made it persisted the other man what you got for your wheat couldnt have done much more than cover working expenses  hawtrey laughed he was quite aware that his visitors profession was not one that was regarded with any great favor by the prairie farmers but he was never particularly cautious and he rather liked the man  as a matter of fact it didnt edmonds he confessed you see i practically paid you out of what i get for running this place the red wheat wyllard raises generally commands a cent or two a bushel more from the big milling people than anything put on the market round here  edmonds made a sign of agreement he had without directly requesting him to do so led hawtrey into showing him around the range that afternoon and having of necessity a practical knowledge of farming he had been impressed by all that he had noticed the farm which was a big one had evidently been ably managed until a recent date and he felt the strongest desire to get his hands on it this as he knew would have been out of the question had wyllard been at home but with hawtrey upon whom he had a certain hold in charge the thing appeared by no means impossible  oh yes he replied i suppose he was reasonably liberal over your salary  i dont get one i take a share of the margin after everything is paid  edmonds carefully noted this he was not sure that such an arrangement would warrant one in regarding hawtrey as wyllards partner but he meant to gather a little more information upon that point  if wheat keeps on dropping there wont be any margin at all next year and thats what im inclined to figure on he declared there are however ways a man with nerve could turn it to account  you mean by selling wheat down  yes said edmonds thats just what i mean of course there is a certain hazard in the thing you can never be quite sure how the market will go but the signs everywhere point to still cheaper wheat next year  thats your view  edmonds smiled and took out of his pocket a little bundle of market reports  other folks seem to share it in winnipeg chicago new york and liverpool you cant get behind these stock statistics though of course dead low prices are apt to cut the output  hawtrey read the reports with evident interest all were in the same pessimistic strain and he could not know that the moneylender had carefully selected them with a view to the effect he hoped to produce edmonds who saw the interest in hawtreys eyes leaned towards him confidentially when he spoke again  i dont mind admitting that im taking a hand in a big bear operation he said its rather outside my usual business but the thing looks almost certain  hawtrey glanced at him with a gleam in his eyes there was no doubt that the prospect of acquiring money by an easier method than toiling in the rain and wind appealed to him  if its good enough for you it should be safe he remarked the trouble is that ive nothing to put in  then youre not empowered to lay out wyllards money if that was the case it shouldnt be difficult to pile up a bigger margin than youre likely to do by farming  hawtrey started for the idea had already crept into his mind  in a way i am but im not sure that im warranted in operating on the market with it  have you the arrangement you made with him in writing  hawtrey opened a drawer and edmonds betrayed no sign of the satisfaction he felt when he was handed an informally worded document he perused it carefully and it seemed to him that it constituted hawtrey a partner in the range which was satisfactory he looked up thoughtfully  now he said while i naturally cant tell what wyllard contemplated this paper certainly gives you power to do anything you think advisable with his money in any case i understand that he cant be back until well on in next year  i shouldnt expect him until late in the summer anyway  there was silence for a moment or two and during it hawtreys face grew set it was unpleasant to look forward to the time when he would be required to relinquish the charge of the range and of late he had been wondering how he could make the most of the situation then edmonds spoke again  its almost certain that the operation i suggested can result only one way and it appears most unlikely that wyllard would raise any trouble if you handed him several thousand dollars over and above what you had made by farming i cant imagine a man objecting to that kind of thing  hawtrey sat still with indecision in his eyes for half a minute and edmonds who was too wise to say anything leaned back in his chair then hawtrey turned to the drawer again with an air of sudden resolution  ill give you a check for a couple of thousand dollars which is as far as i care to go just now he announced with studied carelessness  he took a pen and edmonds watched him with quiet amusement as he wrote as a matter of fact hawtrey was in one respect at least perfectly safe in entrusting the money to him edmonds had deprived a good many prairie farmers of their possessions in his time but he never stooped to any crude trickery he left that to the smaller fry just then he was playing a deep and cleverly thoughtout game  he pocketed the check that hawtrey gave him and then discussed other subjects for half an hour or so before he rose to go  you might ask them to get my team out ive some business at landers and have ordered a room there he said ill send you a line when theres any change in the market     chapter xxi  gregory makes up his mind   wheat was still being flung on to a lifeless market when hawtrey walked out of the mortgage jobbers place of business in the railroad settlement one bitter afternoon he had a big roll of paper money in his pocket and was feeling particularly pleased with himself for prices had steadily fallen since he had joined in the bear operation edmonds had suggested and the result of it had proved eminently satisfactory this was why he had just given edmonds a further draft on wyllards bank with instructions to sell wheat down on a more extensive scale he meant to operate in earnest now which was exactly what the broker had anticipated but in this case edmonds had decided to let hawtrey operate alone indeed being an astute and farseeing man the broker had gone so far as to hint that caution might be advisable though he had at the same time been careful to show hawtrey only those market reports which had a distinctly pessimistic tone edmonds was rather disposed to agree with the men who looked forward to a reaction before very long  hawtrey glanced about him as he strode down the street it was wholly unpaved and deeply rutted but the drifted snow had partly filled the hollows and it did not look very much rougher than it would have appeared if somebody had recently driven a plow through it along both sides of it ran a rude plank sidewalk raised a foot or two above the ground so that footpassengers might escape the mire of the thaw in spring immediately behind the sidewalk squat weatherbeaten frame houses all of much the same pattern rose abruptly on some of the houses the fronts carried up as high as the ridge of the shingled roof had an unpleasantly square appearance here and there a dilapidated wagon stood with lowered pole before a store but it was a particularly bitter afternoon and there was nobody out of doors the place looked desolate and forlorn with a leaden sky hanging over it and an icy wind sweeping through the streets  hawtrey strode along briskly until he reached the open space which divided the little wooden town from the unfenced railroad track it was strewn with fine dusty snow and the huge bulk of the grain elevators towered high above it against the lowering sky a freight locomotive was just hauling a long string of wheat cars out of a sidetrack the locomotive stopped presently and though hawtrey could not see anything beyond the big cars he knew by the shouts which broke out that something unusual was going on he was expecting sally who was going east to brandon by a train due in an hour or two  when the shouts grew a little louder he walked around in front of the locomotive which stood still with the steam blowing noisily from a valve and he saw the cause of the commotion a pair of vicious halfbroken bronchos were backing a light wagon away from the locomotive on the other side of the track and a furwrapped figure sat stiffly on the driving seat hawtrey called out and ran suddenly forward as he saw that it was sally who was in peril  just then one of the horses lifted its fore hoofs off the ground and being jerked back by the pole plunged and kicked furiously until the other horse flung up its head and the wagon went backward with a run then they stopped and there was a series of resounding crashes against the front of the vehicle hawtrey was within a pace or two of the wagon when sally recognized him  keep off she cried you cant lead them they dont want to cross the track but theyve got to if i pull the jaws off them  this was more forcible than elegant and the shrill harshness of the girls voice jarred upon hawtrey though he was getting accustomed to sallys phraseology he understood that she would not have his help even if it would have been of much avail which was doubtful and he reluctantly moved back toward the group of loungers who were watching her  i guess youve no call to worry about her said one of the men shes holding them on the lowest notch and its a mighty powerful bit fixing besides that girl could drive anything that goes on four legs  sure said one of the others shes a daisy  hawtrey was annoyed to notice that in place of being embarrassed sally evidently rather enjoyed the situation though several of the freighttrain and station hands had now joined the group of loungers and were cheering her on he had already satisfied himself that she had not a trace of fear in another moment or two however he forgot his slight sense of disapproval for sally sitting tense and strung up on the driving seat with a glow in her cheeks and a snap in her eyes was wholly admirable there was lithe grace strength and resolution in every line of her furwrapped figure it is possible that her appearance would have been less effective in a drawingroom but in the wagon she was in her place and in harmony with her surroundings lowering sky gleaming snow furclad men and even the big dingy locomotive all fitted curiously into the scene and she made an imposing central figure as she contended with the halftamed team hawtrey was conscious of a tumult of emotion as he watched her  the struggle with the team lasted for several minutes during which the horses plunged and kicked again until sally stood boldly erect a moment while the wagon rocked to and fro her tall straight figure was commanding and her face with a tress of loosened hair streaming out beneath her fur cap was glowing with excitement again and again she swung the stinging whip then it seemed that the team had had enough for as she dropped lightly back into the seat the bronchos broke into a gallop and in another moment the wagon jolting noisily as it bounced across the track vanished behind the locomotive gregory heard a shout of acclamation as he turned and hurried after it  sally drove right through the settlement and back outside it before she could check the horses and she had just pulled them up in front of the wooden hotel when hawtrey reached it he stood beside the wagon holding up his hand to her and sally who laughed dropped bodily into his arms which was as he realized a thing that agatha certainly would not have done he set sally down upon the sidewalk and when a man came out to take the team hawtrey took her into the hotel  it was the locomotive that did it she explained they were most too scared for anything but i hate to be beaten by a team ours know too much to try but i got haslem to drive me in i dropped him at nortons wholl bring him on  he oughtnt to have left you with them said hawtrey severely  sally laughed well she replied id quit driving if i couldnt handle any team you or haslem could put the harness on  the hotels in the smaller prairie settlements offer one very little comfort or privacy as a rule they contain two general rooms in one of which the three daily meals are served with a punctuality which is as unvarying as the menu the traveler who arrives a few minutes too late for one meal must wait until the next is ready the second room usually contains a rusty stove and a few uncomfortable benches and there are not infrequently a couple of rows of very small matchboarded cubicles on the floor overhead the occident was however a notable exception for one thing the building was unusually large and its proprietor had condescended to study the requirements of his guests who came from the outlying settlements there were two rooms above the general lounging place on the first floor one of which was reserved for the wives and daughters of the farmers who drove in long distances to purchase stores or clothing in the other drygoods traveling men were permitted to display their wares and privileged customers who wished to leave by a train the departure of which did not correspond with the hotel arrangements were occasionally supplied with meals  it was getting dusk when hawtrey and sally entered the first of the two rooms where the proprietors wife was just lighting the big lamp the woman smiled at gregory who was a favorite of hers  go right along and ill bring your supper up in a minute or two she said i guess youll want it after your drive  hawtrey strode on down a short corridor towards the second room but sally stopped behind him a moment  is hastings in town she asked i thought i saw his new wagon outside  his wife is said the other woman she and miss ismay drove in to buy some things  sally asked no further questions it was evident that mrs hastings would not start home until after supper and as the regular hour meal would be ready in about half an hour it seemed certain that she would come back to the hotel very shortly that left sally very little time for she had no desire that hawtrey should meet either mrs hastings or agatha until she had carried out the purpose she had in hand it was at gregorys special request that she had permitted him to drive in to see her off and she meant to make the most of the opportunity she had long ago regretted her folly in running away from his homestead when he lay helpless but things had changed considerably since then  when she entered the second room she said nothing to hawtrey about what she had heard the room was cozily warm and brightly lighted and the little table was laid for two with a daintiness very uncommon on the prairie it was a change for sally to be waited on and to have a meal set before her which she had not prepared with her own fingers and she sank into a chair with a smile of appreciation  its real nice gregory she remarked suppers never quite the same when youve had to stand over the stove ever so long getting it ready she sighed when i have to do that after working hard all day i dont want to eat  the man felt compassionate sally as he was aware had to work unusually hard at the desolate homestead where she and her mother perforce undertook a great many duties that do not generally fall to a woman creighton who was getting to be an old man was of a grasping nature and hired assistance only when it was indispensable  well hawtrey responded im not particularly fond of cooking either  sally glanced at him with a provoking smile for he had given her a lead then she asked with a coquettish raising of the eyebrows why dont you get somebody else to do it for you  this was as gregory recognized almost painfully direct but there was no doubt that sally looked very pretty with the faint flush of color in her cheeks and the tantalizing light in her eyes  as a matter of fact thats a thing ive been thinking over rather often the last few months he said and he laughed its rather a pity you dont seem to like cooking sally  sally appeared to consider this oh she said it depends a lot on who its for  hawtrey became suddenly serious for a moment or two there was no doubt that at one time he would have considered it impossible that he should marry a girl of sallys description and even now he had misgivings he had however almost made up his mind and he was not exactly pleased that the proprietors wife came in with the meal and stayed to talk a while  when the woman went out he watched sally with close and what he imagined was unobtrusive attention while she ate and though he was aware of the indelicacy of his scrutiny he was relieved to find that she did nothing that was actually repugnant to him there was a certain daintiness about the girl and her frank appreciation of the good things set before her only amused him she was certainly much more companionable than agatha had been since she came out to canada and her cheerful laughter had a pleasant ring  when at last the meal was over sally bade gregory draw her chair up to the stove  now she said as she pointed to another chair across the room you can sit yonder and smoke i know you want to  hawtrey remembered that agatha did not like tobacco smoke and always had been inclined to exact a certain conventional deference which he had grown to regard as rather out of place upon the prairie  my chairs a very long way off he objected  sally showed no sign of conceding the point as he had expected and he took out his pipe he wanted to think for once more instincts deep down in him stirred in faint protest against what he almost meant to do there were also several points that required practical consideration and among them were his financial difficulties though these did not trouble him so much as they had done a few months earlier for a minute or two neither of them said anything and then sally spoke again  youre worrying about something gregory she said  hawtrey admitted it yes he replied i am my place is a poor one and when wyllard comes home i shall have to go back to it again things would be so much easier for me just now if i had the range  the girl looked at him steadily with reproach in her eyes  oh she said your place is quite big enough if youd only take hold and run it as it ought to be run you could surely do it gregory if you tried  the mans resistance grew feebler as it usually did when his prudence was at variance with his desires sallys words were in this case wholly guileless as he recognized and they stirred him he made no comment however and she spoke again  isnt it worth while though there are things you would have to give up she asked you couldnt go away and waste your money in winnipeg every now and then  hawtrey laughed no he admitted i suppose if i meant to make anything of the place that couldnt be done still you see its horribly lonely sitting by oneself beside the stove in the long winter nights i wouldnt want to go to winnipeg if i had only somebody to keep me company  he turned towards her suddenly with decision in his face and sally lowered her eyes  dont you think you could get anybody if you tried she inquired  the trouble said hawtrey gravely is that i have so little to offer its a poor place and im almost afraid sally that im rather a poor farmer as you have once or twice pointed out i dont stay with things still it might be different if there was any particular reason why i should  he rose and crossing the room stood close beside her chair sally he added would you be afraid to take hold and see what you could make of the place and me perhaps you could make something though it would probably be very hard work my dear  the blood surged into the girls face and she looked up at him with open triumph in her eyes it was her hour and sally as it happened was not afraid of anything  oh she exclaimed you really want me  yes said hawtrey quietly i think i have wanted you for ever so long though i did not know it until lately  then she said ill do what i can gregory  illustration would you be afraid to see what you could make of the place and me page 242  hawtrey bent his head and kissed her with a deference that he had not expected to feel for there was something in the girls simplicity and the completeness of her surrender which though the thing seemed astonishing laid a restraint on him as he sat down on the arm of her chair with a hand upon her shoulder he was more astonished still for she quietly made it clear that she expected a good deal from him for one thing he realized that she meant him to take and to keep a foremost place among his neighbors and though sally had not the gift of clear and imaginative expression it became apparent that this was less for her own sake than his she was with somewhat crude forcefulness trying to arouse a sense of responsibility in the man to incite him to resolute action and wholesome restraint and as he remembered what he had hitherto thought of her a salutary sense of confusion crept upon him  she seemed to recognize it for at length she glanced up at him sharply  what is it gregory why do you look at me like that she asked  hawtrey smiled in a perplexed fashion hitherto she had made her appeal through his senses to one side of his nature only there was no doubt on that point but now it seemed there were in her qualities he had never suspected she had desired him as a husband but it was becoming clear that she would not be content with the mere possession of him sally it seemed had wider ideas in her mind and though the idea seemed almost ludicrous she wanted to be proud of him  my dear he faltered i cant quite tell youbut you have made me heartily ashamed im afraid its a very rash thing you are going to do  she looked at him with candid anxiety and then appeared to dismiss the subject with a smile  there is so much i want to say and it maynt be so easyafterwards she said its a pity the train starts so soon  we can get over that difficulty anyway said hawtrey ill come on as far as i can with you and get back from one of the way stations by the pacific express  sally made no objections and drawing a little closer to him she talked on in a low voice     chapter xxii  a painful revelation   a sprinkle of snow was driving down the unpaved street before the biting wind when mrs hastings came out of a store in the settlement and handed sproatly who was waiting close by several big packages  you can put them into the wagon and tell jake well want the team as soon as suppers over she said were going to stay with mrs ormond tonight and i dont want to get there too late  sproatly took the parcels and mrs hastings turned to agatha who stood a pace or two behind her with winifred  now she announced if theres nothing else you want to buy well go across to the hotel  they were standing in a big comfortless room in the hotel when sproatly rejoined them  this place is quite shivery observed mrs hastings they generally have the stove lighted in the little room along the corridor go and see jim  sproatly went out it happened that he was wearing rubber boots which make very little noise he proceeded along the dark corridor and then stopped abruptly when he had almost reached a partlyopen door for he could see into a lighted room hawtrey was sitting near the stove on the arm of sallys chair  though he was not greatly surprised sproatly drew back a pace or two into the shadow for it became evident that there were only two courses open to him he could judiciously announce his presence by making the door rattle and then go in and mention as casually as possible that mrs hastings and agatha were in the hotel he felt that he ought to do it but there was the difficulty that he could not warn hawtrey without embarrassing sally sproatly hesitated in honest doubt as it became evident that the situation was a delicate one he decided on the alternative he would go back quietly and keep mrs hastings out of the room if it could be done  i think you would be just as comfortable where you are he informed her when he joined the others  im rather doubtful declared mrs hastings wasnt the stove lighted  yes answered sproatly i fancy it was  but i sent you to make sure  the fact is i didnt go in said sproatly uneasily theres somebody in the room already  any of the boys would go out if they knew we wanted it  oh yes acquiesced sproatly still you see its only a small room and one of them has been smoking  mrs hastings flashed a keen glance at him and then smiled in a manner he did not like it suggested that while she yielded to his objections she had by no means abandoned the subject  well she said what shall we do until supper this stove wont draw properly and i dont feel inclined to sit shivering here  then sproatly was seized by what proved to be a singularly unfortunate inspiration  its really not snowing much and well go down to the depôt and watch the atlantic express come in he suggested its one of the things everybody does  this was as a matter of fact correct there are not many amusements open to the inhabitants of the smaller settlements along the railroad track and the arrival of the infrequent trains is a source of unflagging interest mrs hastings fell in with the suggestion and sproatly was congratulating himself upon his diplomacy when agatha stopped as they reached the door of the hotel  oh she said ive only brought one of my mittens  ill go back for the other responded sproatly promptly  you dont know where i left it  then ill lend you one of mine it will certainly go on the man persisted  agatha objected to this and sproatly who fancied that mrs hastings was watching him let her go after which he and the others moved out into the street agatha ran back to the room they had left and finding the mitten had reached the head of the stairway when she heard voices behind her in the corridor she recognized them and turned in sudden astonishment standing in the shadow she involuntarily waited not far away a stream of light from the door of the room shone out into the corridor next moment hawtrey and sally approached the door and as the light fell upon them the blood surged into agathas face for she remembered the embarrassment in sproatlys manner and that he had done all he could to prevent her from going back for the mitten  hawtrey spoke to sally and there was no doubt whatever that he called her my dear filled with burning indignation agatha stood still for a moment and they were almost upon her before she turned and fled precipitately down the stairway she felt that this was horribly undignified but she could not stay and face them when she overtook the others she had recovered her outward composure and they went on together toward the track as yet she was conscious only of anger at gregorys treachery that feeling possessed her too completely for her to be conscious of anything else  cold as it was there were a good many loungers in the station and sproatly who spoke to one or two of them led his party away from the little shed where they loitered and walked briskly up and down beside the track until a speck of blinking light rose out of the white wilderness the light grew rapidly larger until they could make out a trail of smoke behind it and the roar of wheels rose in a long crescendo then a bell commenced to toll and the blaze of a big lamp beat into their faces as the great locomotive came clanking into the station  the locomotive stopped and the light from the long car windows fell upon the groups of watching furclad men while here and there a shadowy object that showed black against it leaned out from a platform there was however no sign of any passengers for the train until at the last moment two figures appeared hurrying along they drew nearer and agatha set her lips tight as she recognized them for the light from a vestibule shone into hawtreys face as he half lifted sally on to one of the platforms and sprang up after her then the bell tolled again and the train slid slowly out of the station with its lights flashing upon the snow  agatha turned away abruptly and walked a little apart from the rest the thing she felt admitted of only one explanation sproatlys diplomacy had had a most unfortunate result and she was sensible of an intolerable disgust she had kept faith with gregory at least as far as it was possible and he had utterly humiliated her the affront he had put upon her was almost unbearable  in the meanwhile mrs hastings walked up to sproatly who feeling distinctly uncomfortable had drawn back judiciously into the shadow  now she said i understand you of course anticipated this  i didnt declared sproatly with a decision which carried conviction with it i certainly saw them at the hotel but how could i imagine that they had anything of the kind in view  he broke off for a moment and waved his hand after all he added what right have you to think it now  mrs hastings laughed somewhat harshly unfortunately i have my eyes but ill admit that theres a certain obligation on me to make quite certain before going any further thats why i want you to ascertain where he checked his baggage to  im afraid thats more than im willing to undertake do you consider it advisable to set the station agent wondering about the thing besides once or twice in my career appearances have been rather badly against me and im not altogether convinced yet  mrs hastings let the matter drop and they went back rather silently to the hotel as soon as supper was past mrs hastings bade sproatly get their wagon out and she drove away with agatha during the long cold journey she said very little to the girl and they had no opportunity of private conversation when they reached the homestead where they were to spend the night agatha hated herself for the thought in her mind but everything seemed to warrant it and it would not be driven out she had heard what gregory had called sally at the hotel and the fact that he must have bought his ticket and checked his baggage earlier in the afternoon when there was nobody about so that he could run down with sally at the last moment evidently in order to escape observation was very significant  the two women went home next day and on the following morning a man who was driving in to landers brought mrs hastings a note from sproatly it was very brief and ran  gregory arrived same night by pacific train it is evident he must have got off at the next station down the line  mrs hastings showed it to her husband  im afraid we have been too hasty what am i to do with this she said  hastings smiled since you ask my advice id put it into the stove  but it clears the man isnt it my duty to show it to agatha  well said hastings reflectively im not sure that it is your duty to put ideas into her mind when you cant be quite certain that she has entertained them  i should be greatly astonished if she hadnt answered mrs hastings  hastings made an expressive gesture oh he remarked youll no doubt do what you think wisest when you come to me for advice you have usually made up your mind and you merely expect me to tell you that youre right  mrs hastings thought over the matter for another hour or two for one thing agathas quiet manner puzzled her and she did not know that the girl had passed a night in agony of anger and humiliation and had then become conscious of a relief of which she was ashamed there was however no doubt that while agatha blamed herself in some degree for what had happened she did feel as if a weight had been lifted from her heart she was sitting alone in a shadowy room watching the light die off the snowy prairie outside when mrs hastings came softly in and sat down beside her  my dear said mrs hastings its rather difficult to speak of but that little scene at the station must have hurt you  agatha looked at her quietly and searchingly but there was only sympathy in her face and she leaned forward impulsively  oh she exclaimed it hurt me horribly because i feel it was my fault i was the cause of it  how could that be  if i had only been kinder to gregory he would perhaps never have thought of that girl i must have made it clear that he jarred upon me i drove himagatha turned her face away while her voice trembledinto that womans arms no doubt she was ready to make the most of the opportunity  mrs hastings thought that the girls scorn and disgust were perfectly natural even though as it happened they were not quite warranted  in the first place she suggested i think you had better read this note  agatha took the note and there was light enough left to show that the blood had crept into her face when she laid it down again for almost a minute she sat very still  it is a great relief to know that i was wrongin one respect but you must not think i hated this girl because gregory had preferred her to me she said at last when the first shock had passed there was an almost horrible satisfaction in feeling that he had released meat any cost i suppose i shall always be ashamed of that  she broke off a moment and her voice was very steady when she went on again  still what sproatly says does not alter the case so much after all it cant free me of my responsibility if i hadnt driven him gregory would not have gone to her  you consider that in itself a very dreadful thing  agatha looked at mrs hastings with suddenly lifted head of course she answered can you doubt it  mrs hastings laughed though there was a little gleam in her eyes for this was an opportunity for which she had been waiting  then she said you spoke like an englishwomanof stationjust out from the old countrybut im going to try to disabuse you of one impression sally to put it crudely is quite good enough for gregory in fact if she had been my daughter id have kept him away from her to begin with once you strip gregory of his little surface graces and his clean english intonation how does he compare with the men you meet out here what does his superiority consist of is he truer or kinder than you have found most of them to be has he a finer courage or a more resolute endurancea greater capacity for labor or a clearer knowledge of the calling by which he makes his living  agatha did not answer she could not protest that gregory possessed any of these qualities and mrs hastings continued  has he even a more handsome person i could point to a dozen men between here and the railroad whose clean selfdenying lives have set a stamp on them that gregory will never wear to descend to perhaps the lowest point of all has he more money we know he wasted what he hadprobably in indulgenceand there is a mortgage on his farm has he any sense of honor he let sally believe he was in love with her before you even came out here and of late while he still claimed you he has gone back to her cant you get away from your point of view and realize what kind of a man he is  agatha turned her head away ah she cried i realized himseveral months ago they were painful months to me but you are quite sure he was in love with sally before i came out  well mrs hastings declared his conduct suggested it she laid a caressing hand on the girls shoulder you tried to keep faith with him tried desperately i think did you succeed  agatha contrived to meet the older womans eyes  at least i would have married him  then asserted mrs hastings i can forgive gregory even his treachery and you have no cause to pity him sally is simpleprimitive you would call herbut shes clever and capable in all practical things she will bear with gregory when you would turn from him in dismay and when it is necessary she will not shrink from putting a little judicious pressure on him in a way you could not have done it may sound incomprehensible but that girl will lead or drive gregory very much further than he could have gone with you she doesnt regard him as perfection but she loves him  mrs hastings paused and for several minutes there was a tense silence in the little shadowy room it had grown almost dark and the square of the window glimmered faintly with the dim light flung up by the snow  agatha turned slowly in her chair thank you she said in a low voice you have taken a heavy weight off my mind  she paused a moment and then added you have been a good friend all along it was supreme good fortune that placed me in your hands  mrs hastings patted her shoulder and then went out quietly agatha lay still in her chair beside the stove the fire snapped and crackled cheerfully but except for the pleasant sound there was a restful quietness the room was cozily warm though its occupant could hear a little icy wind wail about the building it swept agathas thoughts away to the frozen north and she realized what it had cost her to keep faith with gregory as she pictured a little snowsheeted schooner hemmed in among the floes and two or three wornout men hauling a sled painfully over the ridged and furrowed ice the man who had gone up into that great desolation had been endued with an almost fantastic sense of honor and now he might never even know that she loved him she admitted that she had loved him for several months     chapter xxiii  through the snow   next morning the mailcarrier who halffrozen and white all over drove up to the homestead out of a haze of falling snow brought agatha a note from gregory the note was brief and agatha read it with a smile of halfamused contempt though she admitted that considering everything he had handled the embarrassing situation gracefully this attitude however was only what she had expected and she recognized that it was characteristic of hawtrey that he had written releasing her from her engagement instead of seeking an interview gregory as she realized now had always taken the easiest way and it was evident that he had not even the courage to face her she quietly dropped the noteit did not seem worth while to fling itinto the stove  agatha could forgive gregory for choosing sally though she was very human in most respects that scarcely troubled her but she could not forgive him for persisting in his claim to her while he was philanderingand this seemed the most fitting termwith her rival had he only been honest she would not have let wyllard go away without some assurance of her regard which would have cheered the brave seafarer on his perilous journey and it was clear to her that wyllard might never come back again her face grew hard when she thought of it and she had thought of it frequently for that doubledealing she felt she almost hated gregory  a month passed drearily with arctic frost outside on the prairie and little to do inside the homestead except to cook and gorge the stove and endeavor to keep warmth in ones body water froze solid inside the house stinging draughts crept in through the double windows and there were evenings when mrs hastings and agatha shivering close beside the stove waited anxiously for the first sign of hastings and the hired man who were bringing back a sled loaded with birch logs from a neighboring bluff the bluff was only a few miles away but men sent out to cut fuel in the awful cold snaps in that country have now and then sunk down in the snow with the life frozen out of them there were other days when the wooden building seemed to rock beneath the buffeting of the icy hurricane and it was a perilous matter to cross the narrow open space between it and the stables through the haze of swirling snow  the weather moderated a little by and by and one afternoon mrs hastings drove off to landers with the one hired man that they kept through the winter mr hastings had set out earlier for the bluff and as the scandinavian maid had been married and had gone away agatha was left in the house with the little girls  it was bitterly cold even inside the dwelling but agatha was busy baking and she failed to notice that the temperature had become almost arctic until she stood beside a window as evening was closing in a low dingy sky hung over the narrowing sweep of prairie which stretched back gleaming lividly into the creeping dusk but a few minutes later a haze of snow whirled across it and cut off the dreary scene  the light died out suddenly and agatha and the little girls drew their chairs close up to the stove the house was very quiet and agatha could hear the mournful wailing of the wind about it with now and then the soft swish of driven snow upon the walls and roofing shingles  the table was laid for supper and the kettle was singing cheerfully upon the stove but there was no sign of the other members of the family and presently agatha began to feel a little anxious mrs hastings she fancied would stay one night at landers if there was any unfavorable change in the weather but she wondered what could be detaining hastings it was not very far to the bluff and as he could not have continued chopping in the darkness it seemed to her that he should have reached the homestead  he did not come however and she grew more uneasy as the time slipped by the wail of the wind grew louder and the stove crackled more noisily at last one of the little girls rose with a cry that she thought she heard the beat of hoofs the impression grew more distinct until she was sure that some one was riding toward the homestead and agatha heard the hoofbeats but soon after that the sound ceased abruptly and she could not hear the rattle of flungdown logs which she had expected this struck agatha as curious since she knew that hastings generally unloaded the sled before he led the team to the stable she waited a moment or two but except for the doleful wind nothing broke the silence now and when the stillness became oppressive she moved towards the door  the wind tore the door from her grasp when she opened it and flung it against the wall with a jarring crash while a fine powder that stung the skin unbearably drove into her face for a few moments she could see nothing but a whirling haze and then as her eyes became accustomed to the change of light she dimly made out the blurred white figures of the horses standing still with the load of birch logs rising a shapeless mass behind them there seemed to be nobody with the team and though she twice called sharply no answer came out of the falling snow then she recognized the significant fact that the team had come home alone  it was difficult to close the door and before she accomplished what was a feat of strength her hands had stiffened and grown almost useless and the hall was strewn with snow it was every evident that there was something for her to do it cost her three or four minutes to slip on a blanket skirt and soft hide moccasins with gum boots over them muffled in her furs she opened the door again when she had contrived to close it the cold struck through her to the bone as she floundered towards the team there was nobody to whom she could look for assistance but that could not be helped it was evident that some misfortune had befallen hastings and that she must act wisely and quickly  the first thing necessary was to unload the sled and though the birches seldom grow to any size in a prairie bluff some of the logs were heavy she was gasping with the effort when she had flung a few of them down after which she discovered that the rest were held up by one or two stout poles let into sockets try as she would she could not get them out and then she remembered that hastings kept a whipsaw in a shed close by she contrived to find it and attacked the poles in breathless haste working clumsily with mittened hands until there was a crash and rattle as she sprang clear then she started the team and the rest of the logs rolled off into the snow  that was one difficulty overcome but the next appeared more serious she must find the bluff as soon as possible and in the snowfilled darkness she could not tell where it lay even if she could have seen anything of the kind there was no landmark on the desolate level waste between it and the homestead she however remembered that she had one guide  hastings and his hired man had recently hauled in a great many loads of birch logs and as they had made a wellworn trail it seemed to her just possible that she might trace it back to the bluff no great weight of snow had fallen yet  before agatha set out she had a struggle with the team for the horses evidently had no intention of making another journey if they could help it but at last she swung them into the narrow riband of trail and plodded away into the darkness at their heads it was then that she first clearly realized what she had undertaken very little of her face was left bare between her fur cap and collar but every inch of uncovered skin tingled as if it had been lashed with thorns or stabbed with innumerable needles the air was thick with a fine powder that filled her eyes and nostrils the wind buffeted her and there was an awful coldthe cold that taxes the utmost strength of mind and body of those who are forced to face it on the shelterless prairie  still the girl struggled on feeling with halffrozen feet for the depression of the trail and grappling with a horrible dismay when she failed to find it she was never sure to what extent she guided the team or how far from mere force of habit they headed for the bluff but as the time went by and there was nothing before her but the whirling snow she grew feverishly apprehensive the trail was becoming fainter and fainter and now and then she could find no trace of it for several minutes  the horses floundered on blurred shapes as white as the haze they crept through and at length she felt that they were dipping into a hollow then a faint sense of comfort crept into her heart as she remembered that a shallow ravine which seamed the prairie ran through the bluff she called out and started at the faintness of her voice it seemed such a pitifully feeble thing there was no answer nothing but the soft fall of the horses hoofs and the wail of the wind but the wind was reassuring for the volume of sound suggested that it was driving through a bluff close by  a few minutes later agatha cried out again and this time she felt the throbbing of her heart for a faint sound came out of the whirling haze she pulled the horses up and as she stood still listening a blurred object appeared almost in front of them it shambled forward in a curious manner stopped and moved again and in another moment or two hastings lurched by her with a stagger and sank down into a huddled white heap on the sled she turned back towards him and he seemed to look up at her  turn the team he said  agatha obeyed and sat down beside him when the horses moved on again  a small birch i was chopping fell on me he said i dont know whether it smashed my ankle or whether i twisted it wriggling clearthe thing pinned me down it is badly hurt anyway  he spoke disconnectedly and hoarsely as if in pain and agatha who noticed that one of his gum boots was almost ripped to pieces realized part of what he must have suffered she knew that nobody pinned to the ground and helpless could have withstood that cold for more than a very little while  oh she cried it must have been dreadful  i found a branch hastings added it helped me but i fell over every now and then headed for the homestead dont think i could have made it if you hadnt come for me he stopped abruptly and turned to her you mustnt sit down walkkeep warmbut dont try to lead the team  agatha struggled forward as far as the near horses shoulder the team slightly sheltered her and it was a little easier walking with a hand upon a trace it was a relief to cling to something for the wind that flung the snow into her face drove her garments against her limbs so that now and then she could scarcely move when her strength began to flag every yard of the homeward journey was made with infinite pain and difficulty at times she could scarcely see the horses and again blinded breathless and dazed she stumbled along beside them she did not know how hastings was faring but she halfconsciously recognized that if once she let the trace go the sled would slip away from her and she would sink down to freeze  at last however a dim mass crept out of the white haze ahead and a moment later a man laid hold of her the man told her that mrs hastings was with him and that the homestead was close at hand agatha learned afterwards that they had reached the house a short time previously and had immediately set out in search of her and hastings  she floundered on beside the horses with another team dimly visible in front of her until a faint ray of light streamed out into the snow then the team stopped and she had only a hazy recollection of staggering into a lighted room in the homestead and sinking into a chair what they did with hastings she did not know but mrs hastings who went with her to her room kissed her before she left her  nobody could have faced the snow next morning and it was several days later when watson who had attended hawtrey after his accident was brought over watson did what he could but it was several weeks before hastings could use his injured foot again before hastings recovered news was sent him of some difficulty in the affairs of a small creamery at a settlement further along the line in which he and his wife held an interest and mrs hastings went east to make inquiries respecting it she took agatha with her and one evening after she had finished the business she had in hand they left a little way station by the pacific train  the car that they entered was empty except for two persons who sat close together near the middle of it a big lamp overhead shed a brilliant light and agatha started when one of their fellow passengers looked around as she approached him in another moment she stood face to face with hawtrey who had risen while sally gazed up at her with a curious expression in her eyes agatha was perfectly composed she felt no sympathy for hawtrey who was visibly confused she was not surprised that he found the situation a somewhat difficult one  you have been to winnipeg she asked  no answered hawtrey with evident relief that she had chosen a safe topic only to brandon sally has some friends there and she spends a day or two with them once or twice each winter brandon is quite a lively place after the prairie i went in last night to bring her back he turned to his companion i think you have met miss ismay  agatha was conscious that sallys eyes were fixed upon her and that mrs hastings was watching them all with quiet amusement but she was a little astonished when the girl moved some wraps from the seat opposite her  yes she said i have if miss ismay doesnt mind i should like to talk to her  hawtreys relief was evident and agatha glanced at him with a smile that was halfcontemptuous he had carefully kept out of her way since he had written her the note and now it seemed only natural that if there was anything to be said he should leave it to sally  i think ill go along for a smoke he observed with evident impatience to leave them and he retired precipitately  mrs hastings looked after him and laughed in a manner that caused sally to wince  he doesnt seem anxious to talk to me she said you can come along to the next car by and by agatha  she moved away and agatha who sat down opposite sally looked at her questioningly  well she said  sally made a little deprecatory gesture ive something to say but its hard to begin with are you very angry with me  no answered agatha i think i really am a little angry with gregory but not altogether because he chose you  sally considered this statement for a moment or two before she looked up again  well she confessed not long ago i wanted to hate you and i guess i most succeeded it made things easier still i want to say that i dont hate you now she hesitated a moment id like you to forgive me  agatha smiled i can do that willingly she said  sally was disconcerted by her quiet ease of manner and perfect candor it was evidently not quite what she had looked for  then you were never very fond of him she suggested  no answered agatha reflectively since you have compelled me to say it i dont think now that i ever was really fond of him though i dont know how i can make that quite clear to you it was only after i came out here that irealizedgregory it was not the actual man i fell in love with in england  sally turned her face away for agatha had made her meaning perfectly plain somewhat to sallys astonishment she showed no sign of resentment  then sally responded it is way better that you didnt marry him she paused and seemed to search for words with which to express herself i knew all along all there was to know about gregoryexcept that he was going to marry you and it was some time before i heard thatand i was ready to take him i was fond of him  agathas heart went out to her yes she said simply it is a very good thing that i let him go she smiled that however doesnt quite describe it sally  gregorys fiancée flushed i couldnt have said that but you dont quite understand yet i said i knew all there was to know about himand you never did you made too much of him in england and when you came out here you only saw the things you didnt like in him still they werent the only ones  agatha started at this statement for she realized that part of it was certainly true and she could admit the possibility of all of it being a fact gregory might possess a few good qualities that she had never discovered  perhaps i did she admitted i dont think it matters now  theyre all of them mixed persisted sally one cant expect too much but you can bear with a great deal when youre fond of any one  agatha sat silent a while for she was troubled by a certain sense of wholesome confusion it seemed to her that sally had the clearer vision love had given her discernment as well as charity and not expecting perfection it was the mans strong points upon which she fixed her eyes  yes she replied presently i am glad you look at it that way sally  the girl laughed oh she said ive only seen one man on the prairie who was quite white all through and i had a kind of notion that he was fond of you  agatha sat very still but it cost her an effort  her face asked the question that was in her heart  harry wyllard announced sally  agatha made no answer and sally changed the subject well said sally after all i want you to be friends with me  i think you can count on that replied agatha with a smile as she rose to rejoin mrs hastings     chapter xxiv  the landing   the ice among the inlets on the american side of the north pacific broke up unusually early when spring came round again and several weeks before wyllard had expected it the selache floated clear the crew had suffered little during the bitter winter for dampier had kept the men busy splicing gear and patching sails and they had fitted the schooner with a new mainmast hewn out of a small cedar none of the sailors had been trained as carpenters but men who keep the sea for months in small vessels are necessarily handy at repairs and they had all used ax and saw to some purpose in their time  wyllard was satisfied when they thrashed the selache out of the inlet under whole mainsail in a fresh breeze and when evening came he sat smoking near the wheel he was in a contemplative mood as the climbing forests and snowclad heights dropped back astern he wondered what his friends were doing upon the prairie and whether agatha had married gregory yet it seemed to him that it was at least possible that agatha was married for she was one to keep a promise and it was difficult to believe that gregory would fail to press his claim wyllards face grew grim as he thought of it though this was a thing he had done more or less constantly during the winter he fancied that he might have ousted gregory if he had remained at the range for perhaps unconsciously agatha had shown him that she was not quite indifferent to him but that would have been to involve her in a breach of faith which she would probably always have looked back on with regret in any case he could not have stayed to press his suit he knew that he would never forget her but it was not impossible that she might forget him he realized also though this was not by comparison a matter of great consequence that the range was scarcely likely to prosper under gregorys management but that could not be helped and after all he owed gregory something it never occurred to him that he was doing an extravagant thing in setting out upon the search that he had undertaken he felt that the obligation was laid upon him and being what he was he could not shrink from it  a puff of spray that blew into his face disturbed his meditations and when a little tumbling sea splashed in over the weather bow he helped the others to haul down a reef in the mainsail that accomplished he went below and brought out a wellworn chart the selache drove away to the westwards over a whiteflecked sea this time she carried fresh southerly breezes with her most of the way across the pacific and plunged along hove down under the last piece of canvas they dared to set upon her until at last they ran into the fog close in to the kamtchatkan beaches then the wind dropped and they were baffled by light and fitful breezes while it became evident that there was ice about  the day they saw the first big mass of ice gleaming broad across their course on a raw green sea dampier got an observation and they held a brief council in the little cabin that evening the schooner was hove to then and lay rolling with banging blocks and thrashing canvas on a sluggish heave of sea  thirty miles off shore announced dampier if it had been clear enough wed have seen the top of the big range quite a way further out to sea now its drift ice ahead of us but its quite likely theres a solid block along the beach winter holds on a long while in this country i guess youre for pushing on as fast as you can  wyllard nodded of course he said youll look for an opening and work her in as far as possible then if its necessary charly and i and another man will take the sled and head for the beach across the ice if theres a lane anywhere i would however probably take the smallest boat we might haul her a league or two anyway on the sled if the ice wasnt very rough  he looked at charly who acquiesced  well charly observed simply i guess ill have to see you through now weve made a sled for her id take the boat anyway were quite likely to strike a big streak of water when the ice is breaking up  theres one other course declared dampier the sensible one and thats to wait until it has gone altogether seems to me i ought to mention it though its not likely to appeal to you  wyllard laughed from all appearances we might wait a month i dont want to stay up here any longer than is strictly necessary  youll head north  thats my intention  then said dampier pointing to the chart before them as you should make the beach in the next day or two ill head for the inlet here as its not very far you wont have to pack so many provisions along and ill give you say three weeks to turn up in if you dont ill figure that theres something wrong and do what seems advisable  they agreed to that and when next morning a little breeze came out of the creeping haze they sailed the selache slowly shorewards among the drifting ice until at nightfall an apparently impenetrable barrier stretched gleaming faintly ahead of them wyllard turned in soon afterwards and slept soundly all his preparations had been made during the winter and there was no occasion for new plans when morning broke he breakfasted before he went out on deck the boat was already packed with provisions sleepingbags a tent and two light sled frames on one of which it seemed possible that they might haul her a few miles she was very light and small and had been built for such a purpose as they had in view  the schooner lay to with backed forestaysail tumbling wildly on a dim gray sea half a mile away the ice ran back into a dingy haze and there was a low gray sky to weather now and then a fine sprinkle of snow slid across the water before a nipping breeze as wyllard glanced to windward dampier strode up to him  i guess youd better put it off he said i dont like the weather well have wind before long  wyllard smiled and dampier made a forceful gesture  then he advised id get on to the ice just as soon as possible youre still quite a way off the beach  wyllard shook hands with him we should make the inlet in about nine days and if i dont turn up in three weeks youll know theres something wrong he said if theres no sign of me in another week you can take her home again  dampier who made no further comment bade them swing the boat over and when she lay heaving beneath the rail wyllard and charly and one indian dropped into her it was only a preliminary search they were about to engage in for they had decided that if they found nothing they would afterwards push further north or inland when they had supplied themselves with fresh stores from the schooner  they gazed at the selache with grim faces as they pulled away and wyllard who loosed his oar a moment to wave his fur cap when dampier stood upon her rail was glad when a fresher rush of the bitter breeze forced him to fix his attention on his task the boat was heavily loaded and the tops of the gray seas splashed unpleasantly close about her gunwale she was running before them rising sharply and dropping down into the hollows out of sight of all but the schooners canvas and though this made rowing easier wyllard was apprehensive of difficulties when he reached the ice  his misgivings proved warranted for the ice presented an almost unbroken wall against the face of which the sea spouted there was no doubt as to what would happen if the frail craft was hurled upon that frozen mass and wyllard who was sculling fancied that before the boat could even reach it there was a probability of her being swamped in the upheaval where the backwash met the oncoming sea charly looked at him dubiously  its a sure thing we cant get out there charly observed  wyllard nodded then he said well pull along the edge of it until we find an opening or something to make a lee the seas higher than it seemed to be from the schooner  weve got to do it soon charly declared theres more wind not far away  wyllard dipped his oar again and for an hour they pulled along the edge of the ice for there were now little frothing white tops on the seas  it was evident that the wind was freshening and at times a deluge of icy water slopped in over the gunwale the men were hampered by their furs and the stores lying about their feet  the perspiration dripped from wyllard when they approached a ragged jutting point it did not seem advisable to attempt a landing on that side of it and when a little snow began to fall he looked at his companions  i guess weve got to pull her out said charly dampiers heaving a reef down he sees whats working up to windward  wyllard could barely make out the schooner which had apparently followed them a blur of dusky canvas against a bank of haze and then as the boat slid down into a hollow there was nothing but the lowhung lowering sky it was evident to him that if they were to make a landing it must be done promptly  well pull around the point first anyway he decided  a shower of fine snow that blotted out the schooner broke upon them and the work was arduous they were pulling to windward now and it was necessary to watch the seas that ranged up ahead and to handle the boat circumspectly while the freshening breeze blew the spray over them they had to fight for every fathom and once or twice the little craft nearly rolled over with them it became apparent by degrees that as they could not have reached the schooner had they attempted it they were pulling for their lives and that the one way of escape open to them was to find an egress of some kind around the point the ragged tongue of which was horribly close to lee of them when the snow cleared for a minute or two they saw that dampier had driven the selache further off the ice the schooner was hove to now and there was a black figure high up in her shrouds  a bitter rush of wind hurled the spray about them and the boat fell off almost beamon to the sea in spite of all that they could do the icy brine washed into the boat and it seemed almost certain that she would swamp or roll over before they could get way on her still pulling desperately they drove her around the point gasping and dripping they made their last effort a sea rolled up ahead and as the boat swung up with it wyllard had a momentary glimpse of an opening not far away he shouted to his companions but could not tell whether they heard and understood him for after that he was conscious only of rowing savagely until another sea broke into the boat and she struck there was a crash and she swung clear with the backwash with all one side smashed in then she swung in again just beyond a tongue of ice over which the froth was pouring tumultuously and the indian jumped from the bow he had the painter with him and for half a minute standing in the foam he held the boat somehow while they hurled a few of the carefully madeup packages that composed her important freight as far on to the ice as possible  as wyllard who seized one sled frame jumped the disabled boat rolled over he landed on his hands and knees but in another moment he was on his feet and he and the indian clutched at charly who drove towards them amid a long wash of foam they dragged him clear and as he stood up dripping without his cap a sudden haze of snow whirled about them there was no sign of the schooner and they could scarcely see the broken ice some sixty yards away they had made the landing wet through with about half their stores and it was evident that their boat would not carry them across the narrowest lane of water even if they could have recovered her the sea rumbled along the edge of the ice and they could not tell whether the frozen wall extended as far as the beach they looked at one another until wyllard spoke  we have got the handsled and some at least of the things he said the sooner we start for the beach the sooner well get there  it was a relief to load the sled and when that was done they put themselves into the hide traces and set off across the ice their traveling was arduous work apart from the hauling of the load for the ice was rough and broken and covered for the most part with softening snow they had only gumboots with soft hide moccasins under them for snowshoes are used only in eastern canada and it takes one a long while to learn to walk on them  sometimes the three men sank almost kneedeep sometimes they slipped and scrambled on uncovered ledges but they pushed on with the sled bouncing and sliding unevenly behind them until the afternoon had almost gone  they set up the wet tent behind a hummock and crouched inside it upon a groundsheet while charly boiled a kettle on the little oil blast stove the wind hurled the snow upon the straining canvas which stood the buffeting when they had eaten a simple meal charly put the stove out and the darkness was not broken except when one of them struck a match to light his pipe they had but one strip of rubber sheeting between them and the snow for the water had gotten into the sleeping bags their clothes dried upon them with the heat of their bodies they said nothing for a while and wyllard was half asleep when charly spoke  ive been thinking about that boat he remarked though i dont know that we could have done it we ought to have tried to pull her out  why asked wyllard shed have been all to pieces anyway  im figuring it out like this if dampier wasnt up in the shrouds when we made the landing hed sent somebody we could see him up against the sky but wed be much less clear to him low down with the ice and the surf about us besides it was snowing quite fast then well i dont know what dampier saw but i guess hed have made out that we hadnt hauled the boat up anyway the trouble is that with the wind freshening and it getting thick hed have to thrash the schooner out and lie to until it cleared when he runs in again its quite likely that hell find the boat and an oar or two seems to me thats going to worry him considerable  wyllard drowsy as he was agreed with this view of the matter he realized that it would have been quite impossible for dampier to send them any assistance and it was merely a question whether they should retrace their steps to the edge of the ice next morning and make him some signal against this there was the strong probability that he would not run in if the gale and snow continued and the fact that it was desirable to make the beach as soon as possible in case the ice broke up before they reached it what was rather more to the purpose wyllard was quietly determined on pushing on  it cant be helped he said simply well start for the beach as soon as its daylight  charly made no answer and the brawny darkskinned siwash who spoke english reasonably well merely grunted unless it seemed necessary he seldom said anything at all bred to the sea and living on the seal and salmon an additional hazard or two or an extra strain on his tough body did not count for much with him he had been accustomed to sleep wet through with icy water and to crouch for hours with numbed hands clenched on the steeringpaddle while the long sea canoe scudded furiously over the big combers before bitter gale or driving snow wyllard who rolled over pulled a wet sleepingbag across him and after that there was silence in the little rocking tent                                                   charlys deductions had been proved correct for when the breeze freshened dampier climbed into the shrouds he had noticed the ominous blackness to windward and he knew what it meant that was why he had hauled down a reef in the schooners mainsail and now kept the vessel out a little from the ice as the light faded he found it very difficult to see the boat against the white wash of the seas that recoiled from the ice but when the snow was whirling about him he decided that she was in some peril unless her crew could pull her around the point it was evident that this would be a difficult matter though he had only an occasional glimpse of her now he waved an arm to the helmsman who understood that he was to run the schooner in there was a rattle of blocks as the booms swung out and as the selache sped away before the rapidly freshening breeze it seemed to dampier that he saw the boat hurled upon the ice a blinding haze of snow suddenly shut out everything and the skipper hastened down to the deck he stood beside the wheel for several minutes gazing forward he could see nothing except the filmy whiteness and the tops of the seas that had steadily been getting steeper the schooner was driving furiously down upon the ice but it was evident that to send wyllard any assistance was utterly beyond his power he could have hove to the schooner while he got the bigger boat over and two men might have pulled towards the ice with the breeze astern of them but it was perfectly clear that they could have neither made a landing nor have pulled her back again it was also uncertain whether he and the other man could have brought the schooner round or have gotten more sail off her he stood still until they heard the wash of the sea upon the ice close to lee of them and then it was a hardclenched hand he raised in sign to the helmsman  on the wind haul lee sheets he commanded  the selache came round a little heading off the ice and when she drove away with the foam seething white beneath one depressed rail and the spray whirling high about her plunging bows there was a tense look in the white mens faces as they gazed into the thickening white haze to lee of her they thrashed her out until dampier decided that there was sufficient water between him and the ice and then stripped most of the sail off her and she lay to until next morning when they once more got sail on her and ran in again the breeze had fallen a little it was rather clearer and they picked up the point though it had somewhat changed its shape they got a boat over and the two men who went off in her found a few broken planks a couple of oars and charlys cap washing up and down in the surf they had very little doubt as to what that meant     chapter xxv  news of disaster   when the boat reached the schooner dampier went off with one of the men and with difficulty contrived to make a landing on the ice only to find it covered with a trackless sheet of slushy snow though dampier floundered shorewards a mile or two there was nothing except the shattered boat to suggest what had befallen wyllard and his companions the skipper who retraced his steps with a heavy heart retained little hope of seeing them again dampier waited two days until a strong breeze blew him off the ice which was rapidly breaking up and he then stood out for the open sea where he hove the selache to for a week or so after that he proceeded northward to the inlet wyllard and he had agreed to  dampier was convinced that this was useless but as the opening was almost clear of ice he sailed the schooner in and spent a week or two scouring the surrounding country he found it a desolation still partly covered with slushy snow out of which ridges of volcanic rock rose here and there on two of these spots a couple of days march from the schooner he made a depôt of provisions and piled a heap of stones beside them at times when it was clear he could see the top of a great range high up against the western sky but those times were rare for the most part the wilderness was swept by rain or wrapped in clammy fog  there was however no sign of wyllard and at last dampier coming back jaded and dejected from another fruitless search after the time agreed upon had expired shut himself up alone for a couple of hours in the little cabin he was certain now that wyllard and his companions had been drowned while attempting to make a landing on the ice since they would have joined him at the inlet as arranged had this not been the case the distance was by no means great and there were no russian settlements on that part of the coast the skipper sat very still with a clenched hand upon the little table balancing conjecture against conjecture and then regretfully decided that there was only one course open to him it was dark when he went up on deck again but the men were sitting smoking about the windlass forward  you can heave some of that cable in boys he announced well clear out for vancouver at sunup  the men said nothing but they shipped the levers and dampier went back to the cabin for the clank of the windlass and the ringing of the cable jarred upon him  early next morning the selache stood out to sea and once they had left behind them the fog and rain near the coast she carried fine weather with her across the pacific on reaching vancouver dampier had some trouble with the authorities to whom it was necessary to report the drowning of three of his crew but he was more fortunate than he expected and after placing the schooner for sale with a broker he left the city one evening on the atlantic train three days later he was driving across the prairie towards the hastings homestead the members were sitting together in the big general room after supper when the wagon dampier had hired swung into sight over the crest of a hill  it was a still hot evening and as the windows were open wide a faint beat of hoofs came up across the tall wheat and dusty prairie before the wagon topped the rise hastings who sat in a cane chair near the window with his pipe in his hand looked up as he heard it  somebody driving in he remarked i shouldnt be astonished if its gregory he talked about coming over the last time i saw him  if he wants to talk about a deal in wheat he can stay away said mrs hastings sharply if all one hears is true he has lost quite a few of harrys dollars on the market lately  hastings looked troubled at this id sooner think it was his own money hed thrown away  thats quite out of the question he hasnt any  well said hastings with an air of reflection ill get sproatly to make inquiries hell probably be along with winifred this evening and if he finds that gregory is getting in rather deep ill have a word or two with him i cant have him wasting harrys money and as one of the executors i have a right to protest  agatha started at the last word it had an ominous ring and she fancied that hastings had noticed the effect on her for he glanced at her curiously turning from him she rose and walked to the window  the wheat stretched across the foreground tall and darkly green and beyond it the white grass ran back to the hill which cut sharply against a red and smoky glow the sun had gone down some time before and there was an exhilarating coolness in the air somehow the sight reminded her of another evening when she had looked out across the prairie from a seat at wyllards table almost a year had passed since then  the wagon drew nearer down the long slope of the hill and the beat of hoofs that grew steadily louder in a sharp staccato made the memories clearer she had heard dampier riding in the night wyllard had received his summons and now she wondered who the approaching stranger was and what his business could be she did not know why but she thought it was not gregory  presently hastings looked round again its the team bramfield hires out at the settlement he said none of our friends would get him to drive them in there seem to be two men in the wagon bramfield will be one i cant make out the other  mrs hastings who was evidently becoming curious about the unexpected guest went to his side and they stood watching the wagon until agatha made an abrupt movement  its captain dampier she exclaimed with foreboding in her voice  she stood tensely still with lips slightly parted and a strained look in her eyes while hastings gazed at the wagon for another moment or two  yes he said and his voice was harsh its dampier the other mans surely bramfield harrys not with him  he glanced at agatha who turned away and sat down in the nearest chair she made no comment and there was an oppressive silence through which the beat of hoofs and rattle of wheels rang more distinctly  it seemed a long time before dampier came in he shook hands with agatha and mrs hastings diffidently  you remember me he asked  of course answered mrs hastings with impatience in her tone wheres harry  the skipper spread a hard hand out and sat down heavily  that he said is what i have to tell you he asked me to  he asked you to questioned agatha and though her voice was strained there was relief in it  dampier made a gesture which seemed to beseech her patience  yes he said ifanything went wronghe told me i was to come here to mrs hastings  agatha turned her head away but mrs hastings saw that she caught her breath before she cried  then something has gone wrong  about as wrong as it could dampier met her gaze gravely wyllard and two other men are drowned  he paused as if watching for words that might soften the dire meaning of his message and mrs hastings saw agatha shiver the girl turned slowly around with a drawn white face it was however hastings who spoke almost sternly  go on he said  im to tell you all  this time it was agatha who broke in  yes she replied with a steadiness that struck the others as being strained and unnatural you must tell us all  dampier who appeared to shrink from his task began awkwardly but he gained coherence and force of expression as he proceeded he made them understand something of the grim resolution which had animated wyllard he pictured in terse seamans words the little schooner plunging to windward over long phalanxes of icy seas or crawling white with snow through the blinding fog his listeners saw the big combers tumbling ready to break short upon the dipping bows and halffrozen men struggling for dear life with folds of madly thrashing sail the pictures were necessarily somewhat blurred and hazy for after all only an epic poet could fittingly describe the things that must be done and borne at sea and epic poets are not bred in the forecastle when he reached the last scene he gained dramatic power and agathas face grew white and tense she saw the dim figures pulling the boat through the flying spray beneath the wall of ice  we ran her in he told them with the snow blinding us it was working up for a heavy blow and as wed have to beat her out we couldnt take sail off her we stood on until we heard the sea along the edge of the ice and then there was nothing to do but jam her on the wind and thrash her clear there was only a plank or two of the boat an oar and charlys cap when we came back again  after all though the boat was smashed they might have gotten out hastings suggested  well said dampier simply it didnt seem likely the ice was sharp and ragged and there was a long wash of sea a mans not tough enough to stand much of that kind of hammering  agathas face grew whiter but dampier went on again  anyway he said they didnt turn up at the inlet as wed fixed and that decided the thing if wyllard had been alive he surely would have been there  isnt it just possible that he might have fallen into the hands of the russians asked hastings  i naturally thought of that but so far as the chart shows there isnt a settlement within leagues of the spot besides supposing the russians had got him how could i have helped him theyd have sent him off in the first place to one of the bigger settlements in the south and if the authorities couldnt have connected him with any illegal sealing theyd no doubt have managed to send him across to japan by and by in that case hed have gotten home without any trouble  dampier paused and it was significant that he turned to agatha with a deprecatory gesture  no he added there was nothing i could do  it was evident that agatha acquitted him but she asked a question  captain dampier she said had you any expectation of finding those three men when you sailed the second time  no acknowledged the bronzed sailor with an impressive calmness i hadnt any and i dont think wyllard had either still he meant to make quite certain he felt he had to  the skipper gazed at agatha and saw comprehension in her eyes  yes she observed with an unsteady voice and when you have said that you could say very little more of any man  she turned her head away from them and for a few moments there was a heavy silence in the room it cost the girl a painful effort to sit still apparently unmoved but there was strength in her and she would not betray her distress she felt that her grief must be endured bravely it was almost overwhelming but there was mingled with it a faint consolatory thrill of pride for it was clear that the man who had loved her had done a splendid thing he had given all that had been given himshe knew she would never forget that phrase of hiswillingly and it seemed to her that the traits with which he had been endowed were rare and precious ones she recognized the steadfast unflinching courage and the fine sense of honor which had sent him out on that forlorn hope unyielding and undismayed he had gone down to deathshe felt sure of thatamid the blinding snow  mrs hastings set food before dampier by and by sproatly and winifred arrived and they heard the story after that dampier who had promised to stay with them a day or two left wyllards friends for an hour  it seems to me youll naturally want to talk over things he said if youll excuse me ill take a stroll across the prairie  he went out and hastings looked at each member of the little group with hasty scrutiny  harrys friends are numerous but were perhaps the nearest and as dampier said we have to consider things he observed speaking with deliberation to begin with theres a certain possibility that he has escaped after all  he saw the quick movement that agatha made and went on more quickly  gregory of course has control of the range until we have proof of harrys death though wyllard made a proviso that if there was no word of the party within eighteen months after he had sailed or within six months of the time dampier had landed him we could assume it after which the will he handed me would take effect this it is evident leaves gregory in charge for some months yet but it seems to me its our duty to see he doesnt fling away harrys property ive reasons for believing that he has been doing it lately  he looked at sproatly who sat silent a moment or two  im rather awkwardly placed sproatly remarked you see theres no doubt that im indebted to gregory  winifred turned to him with impatience in her eyes then she said severely you certainly shouldnt have been and it ought to be quite clear that nobody wishes you to do anything that would hurt him she looked at hastings in case the will takes effect who does the property go to  hastings appeared embarrassed that he objected is a thing im not warranted in telling you now  a suggestive gleam flashed into winifreds eyes but it vanished and her manner became authoritative when she turned back to sproatly  jim she said you will tell mr hastings all you know  sproatly made a gesture of resignation after all he admitted i think its necessary gregory as ive told you already put a big mortgage on his place and in view of the price of wheat and the state of his crop its evident that he must have had some difficulty in meeting the interest unlessand one or two things suggest thishe paid it with harrys money of course as harry gave him a share theres no reason why he shouldnt do this so long as he does not overdraw that share theres no doubt however that he has lost a good deal of money on the wheat market  has he lost any of harrys mrs hastings asked  sproatly hesitated im afraid its practically certain  winifred broke in yes she asserted he has lost a great deal hamilton knows almost everything thats going on and i got it out of him hes a friend of wyllards and seems vexed with gregory  the others did not speak for a moment or two and then mrs hastings said  most of us dont keep much in the bank and that expedition must have cost harry several thousand dollars how would gregory get hold of the money before harvest  edmonds who holds his mortgage would let him have it sproatly explained  but wouldnt he be afraid of gregory not being able to pay if the market went against him  sproatly looked thoughtful the arrangement wyllard made with gregory would perhaps give edmonds a claim upon the range if gregory borrowed any money in his name i almost think thats what the moneylender is scheming for the mans cunning enough for anything i dont like him  hastings stood up with an air of resolution yes he said im afraid youre quite correct anyway ill drive over in a day or two and have a talk with gregory  after that they separated hastings strolled away to join dampier  sproatly and winifred walked out on to the prairie when they had left the house sproatly turned to his companion  why did you insist upon my telling them what i did he asked  oh answered winifred i had several reasons for one thing when i first came out feeling very forlorn and friendless it was wyllard who sent me to the elevator and they really treat me very decently  they repeated sproatly with resentment in his face if you mean hamilton it seems to me that he treats you with an excess of decency that theres no occasion for  winifred laughed in any case he doesnt drive me out here every two or three weeks thoughshe glanced at her companion provokinglyhe once or twice suggested that he would like to  i suppose you pointed out his presumption  no confessed winifred with an air of reflection i didnt go quite so far as that after all the man is my employer i had to handle him tactfully  he wont be your employer a week after the implement people open their new depôt returned sproatly resolutely but were getting away from the subject have you any more reasons for concerning yourself about what gregory does with wyllards property  ive one i suppose you dont know who he has left at least a part of it to  sproatly started as an idea crept into his mind  i wonder if youre right he said  i feel reasonably sure of it winifred smiled in fact thats partly why i dont want gregory to throw any more of wyllards money away you have done all i expect from you  then hastings is to go on with the thing  hastings winifred assured him will failjust as you would this is a matter which requires to be handled delicatelyand effectively  then who is going to undertake it  winifred laughed oh she answered a woman naturally im going back by and by to have a word or two with mrs hastings     chapter xxvi  the rescue   winifreds suspicions soon were proved correct for hastings who drove over to the range a day or two after her visit returned home rather disturbed in temper after what he described as a very unsatisfactory interview with hawtrey  i couldnt make the man hear reason he informed mrs hastings in fact he practically told me that the matter was no concern of mine i assured him that it concerned me directly as one of the executors of harrys will and im afraid i afterwards indulged in a few personalities i expect that blamed mortgagebroker has got a very strong hold on him  mrs hastings looked thoughtful you have never told me anything about the will  if i havent it wasnt for want of prompting returned hastings dryly the will was sealed and handed to me by harry on the express understanding that it was not to be opened until we had proof that he was dead or until the six months mentioned had expired if he turned up it would of course be handed back to him he made me promise solemnly that i would not offer the least hint as to its provisions to anybody  mrs hastings indulged in a shrug indicating resignation in that case i suppose i must be content but he might have made an exception ofme anyway i think i see how we can put what appears to be a little necessary pressure upon gregory she turned again to her husband rather abruptly after all is it worth while for me to trouble about the thing  hastings was taken off his guard yes he said decidedly if you can put any pressure on gregory i guess it would be very desirable to do it as soon as possible  then you think that harry may turn up after all  i do said hastings gravely i dont know why in any case its highly desirable that gregory shouldnt fling his property away  mrs hastings smiled well she said ill think over it ill probably get agatha to see what she can do in the first place  she saw a trace of uncertainty in her husbands face  as you like he said something must be done but on the whole id rather you didnt trouble agatha about the matter it would be wiser  mrs hastings asked no more questions she believed that she understood the situation and she had agathas interests at heart for she had grown very fond of the girl there was certainly one slight difficulty in the way of what she meant to do but she determined to disregard it though she admitted that it might cause agatha some embarrassment afterward when she found the girl alone she sat down beside her  my dear she said i wonder if i may ask whether you are quite convinced that harry is dead  she felt that the question was necessary though it seemed rather a cruel one  no replied agatha calmly i cant quite bring myself to believe it  then since you heard what sproatly said you would be willing to do anything that appeared possible to prevent gregory throwing harrys money away  yes said agatha i have been thinking about it a sparkle of disdainful anger showed in her eyes gregory seems to have been acting shamefully  then as he wont listen to allen we must get sally to impress that fact on him  sally questioned agatha in evident astonishment  mrs hastings smiled i dont think you understand sally as well as i do of course like the rest of us she falls a long way short of perfection andthough its a difficult subjecttheres no doubt that her conduct in leading gregory on while he was still engaged to you was hardly quite correct after all however you owe her something for that  it isnt very hard to forgive her for it confessed agatha  well i want you to understand sally right or wrong shes fond of gregory of course ive told you this already but i must try to make it clear how that fact bears upon the business in hand sally certainly fought for him and theres no doubt that one could find fault with several things she did but the point is that shes evidently determined on making the most of him now she has got him in some respects at least shes absolutely straightone hundred cents to the dollar is what allen says of herand although you might perhaps not have expected this i believe it would hurt her horribly to feel that gregory was squandering money that didnt strictly belong to him  then you mean to make her understand what he is doing  no replied mrs hastings i want you to do it ive reasons for believing that your influence would go further with her than mine for one thing i fancy she is feeling rather ashamed of herself  agatha looked thoughtful she had certainly not credited sally with possessing any fine sense of honor but she was willing to accept mrs hastings assurance  the situation she pointed out is rather a delicate one you wish to expose gregorys conduct to the girl he is going to marry though as you admit the explanation will probably be painful to her cant you understand that the course suggested is a particularly difficult and repugnant oneto me  ive no doubt of it admitted mrs hastings still i believe it must be adoptedfor several reasons in the first place i think that if we can pull gregory up now we shall save him from involving himself irretrievably after all perhaps you owe him the effort then i think that we all owe something to harry and we can at least endeavor to carry out his wishes he told what was to be done with his possessions in a will and he never could have anticipated that gregory would dissipate them as he is doing  the least reason as she had foreseen proved convincing to agatha and she made a sign of concurrence  if you will drive me over i will do what i can she promised  now that she had succeeded mrs hastings lost no time and they set out for the creighton homestead next day soon after they reached the house she contrived that sally should be left alone with agatha the two girls stood outside the house together when agatha turned to her companion  sally she said there is something that i must tell you  sally glanced at her face and then walked forward until the log barn hid them from the house she sat down upon a pile of straw and motioned to agatha to take a place beside her  now she observed sharply you can go on its about gregory i suppose  agatha who found it very difficult to begin though she had been well primed by hastings on the previous evening sat down in the straw and looked about her for a moment or two it was a hot afternoon dazzlingly bright and almost breathlessly still in front of her the dark green wheat rolled waisthigh and beyond it the vast sweep of grass stretched back to the skyline far away a team and a wagon slowly moved across the prairie but that was the only sign of life and no sound from the house reached them to break the heavy stillness  she finally nerved herself to the effort and spoke earnestly for several minutes before she glanced at sally it was evident that sally had understood all that had been said for she sat very still with a hard set face  oh sally exclaimed if id thought youd come to tell me this because you were vexed with me id know what to do  this was what agatha had dreaded it certainly looked as if she had come to triumph over her rivals humiliation but sally made it clear that she acquitted her of that intention  still said sally i know that wasnt the reason and im not mad withyou it hurtsshe made an abrupt movementbut i know its true  she turned to agatha suddenly why did you do it  i thought you might save gregory if i told you  that was all sally looked at her with incredulous eyes  no answered agatha simply that was only part it did not seem right that gregory should go against wyllards wishes and gamble the range away on the wheat market  she admitted it without hesitation for she realized now exactly what had animated her to seek this painful interview she was fighting wyllards battle and that fact sustained her  sally winced yes she agreed i guess you had to tell me he was fond of you one could be proud of that harry wyllard never did anything low down and mean  agatha did not resent her candor although this was a thing she would scarcely have credited a little while ago she saw that the girl felt the contrast between gregorys character and that of the man whose place he had taken and regretted it agathas eyes became dim with unshed tears  wyllard they think is dead she said in a low voice you have gregory still  sally looked at her with unveiled compassion and agatha did not shrink from it  yes she declared with a simplicity that became her and gregory must have someone totake care of him i must do it if i can  there was no doubt that agatha was stirred this halftaught girls quiet acceptance of the burden that many women must carry made her almost ashamed  we will leave it to you she said  it became evident that there was another side to sallys character for her manner changed and the hardness crept back into her face  well she admitted id most been expecting something of this kind when i heard that man edmonds was going to the range he has got a pull on gregory but hes surely not going to feel quite happy when i get hold of him  she rose in another moment and saying nothing further walked back toward the house in front of which they came upon mrs hastings sally looked at mrs hastings significantly  im going over to the range after supper she said  mrs hastings drove away with agatha she said little to the girl during the journey but an hour after they had reached the homestead she slipped quietly into agathas room she found her reclining in a big chair sobbing bitterly she sat down close beside her and laid a hand upon her shoulder  i dont think sally could have said anything to trouble you like this she said  it was a moment or two before agatha turned a wet white face toward her and saw gentle sympathy in her eyes there was she felt no cause for reticence  no she said it was the contrast between us she has gregory  mrs hastings showed sympathy and comprehension and you have lost harrybut i think you have not lost him altogether we do not know that he is deadbut even if it be so it was all that was finest in him that he offered you it is yours still  she sat silent a moment or two before she went on again  my dear it is perhaps cold comfort and i am not sure that i can make what i feel quite clear still harry was only human and it is almost inevitable that had it all turned out differently he would have said and done things that would have offended you now he has left you a purged and stainless memoryone i think which must come very near to the reality the man who went up therefor an idea a fantastic point of honorsloughed off every taint of the baseness that hampers most of us in doing it it was a man changed and uplifted above all petty things by a high chivalrous purpose who made that last grim journey  agatha realized the truth of this already wyllards memory had become etherealized and she treasured it as a very fine and precious thing still though he now wore immortal laurels that would not content her when all her human nature cried out for his bodily presence she wanted him as she had grown to love him in the warm erring flesh and the vague splendid vision was cold and remote there was a barrier greater than that of crashing ice and bitter water between them  oh she cried i have felt that i try to feel it alwaysbut just now its not enough  she turned her face away with a bitter sob and mrs hastings who stooped and kissed her went out of the room the older woman knew that the girl had broken down at last after months of strain                                                   it happened that edmonds the mortgagebroker drove over to the range and found hawtrey waiting for him in wyllards room it was early in the evening and he could see the hired men busy outside tossing prairie hay from the wagons into the great barn the men were halfnaked and grimed with dust but hawtrey who was dressed in store clothes evidently had taken no share in their labors when edmonds came in he turned to the moneylender with anxiety in his face  well he questioned brusquely  markets a little stiffer said edmonds  edmonds sat down and stretched out his hand toward the cigarbox on the table while hawtrey waited with very evident impatience  still moving up he asked  edmonds nodded its the other folks last stand he declared with the wheat ripening as its doing the flood that will pour in before the next two months are out will sweep them off the market i was half afraid from your note that this little rally had some weight with you and that as one result of it you meant to cover now  that admitted hawtrey was in my mind  then remarked his companion its a pity  hawtrey leaned upon the table with hesitation in his face and attitude he had neither the courage nor the steadfastness to make a gambler and every fluctuation of the market swayed him to and fro he had a good deal of wheat to deliver by and by and he could still secure a very desirable margin if he bought in against his sales now unfortunately however he had once or twice lost heavily in an unexpected rally and he greatly desired to recoup himself then he had decided nothing could tempt him to take part in another deal  if i hold on and the market stiffens further ill be awkwardly fixed he declared wyllard made a will and in a few months ill have to hand everything over to his executors there would naturally be unpleasantness over a serious shortage  edmonds smiled he had handled his man cleverly and had now a reasonably secure hold upon him and the range but he was far from satisfied if hawtrey made a further loss he would in all probability become irretrievably involved  then he pointed out theres every reason why you should try to get straight  hawtrey admitted it of course he said you feel sure i could do it by holding on  edmonds seldom answered such a question it was apt to lead to unpleasantness afterwards  well he said beeman and oliphant and barstow are operating for a fall one would fancy that you were safe in doing what they do when men of their weight sell forward figures go down  this was correct as far as it went but edmonds was quite aware that the gentlemen referred to usually played a very deep and obscure game he had also reasons for believing that they were doing it now it was however evident that hawtreys hesitation was vanishing  its a big hazard but i feel greatly tempted to hang on he said  edmonds who disregarded his remark sat smoking quietly since he was tolerably certain as to what the result would be he felt that it was now desirable to let hawtrey decide for himself in which case it would be impossible to reproach him afterwards wheat it seemed very probable would fall still further when the harvest began but he had reasons for believing that the market would rally first in that case hawtrey who had sold forward largely would fall altogether into his hands and he looked forward with very pleasurable anticipation to enforcing his claim upon the range in the meanwhile he was unobtrusively watching hawtreys face and it had become evident that in another moment or two his victim would adopt the course suggested when there was a rattle of wheels outside edmonds who saw a broncho team and a a wagon appear from behind the barn realized that he must decide the matter without delay  as i want to reach landers before its dark ill have to get on he said carelessly if youll give me a letter to the broker ill send it to him  next moment a clear voice rose somewhere outside  i guess you neednt worry it said ill go right in  then sally walked into the room  edmonds was disconcerted but bowed and then sat down again quietly determined to wait for he discovered that there was hostility in the swift glance she flashed at him  thats quite a smart team you were driving miss creighton he remarked  sally who disregarded this turned to hawtrey  whats he doing here she asked  he came over on a little matter of business answered hawtrey  you have been selling wheat again  hawtrey looked embarrassed for her manner was not conciliatory well he admitted i have sold some  wheat you havent got  hawtrey did not answer and sally sat down her manner suggested that she meant thoroughly to investigate the matter and edmonds who would have greatly preferred to get rid of her decided that as it appeared impossible he would appeal to her cupidity the creightons were grasping folk and he had heard of her engagement to hawtrey  if you will permit me ill try to explain he said well say that you have reason for believing that wheat will go down and you tell a broker to sell it forward at a price a little below the actual one if other people do the same it drops faster and before you have to deliver you can buy it in at less than you sold it at a great deal of money can be picked up that way  it looks easy sally agreed with something in her manner which led him to fancy he might win her over of course prices have been falling gregory has been selling down  he has in fact theres already a big margin to his credit declared edmonds unsuspectingly  that is if he bought in now hed have clearedseveral thousand dollars  edmonds told her exactly how much and then started in sudden consternation with rage in his heart for she turned to hawtrey imperiously  then youll write your broker to buy in right away she said  there was an awkward silence during which the two men looked at each other until edmonds spoke  are you wise in suggesting this miss creighton he asked  sally laughed harshly oh yes she replied its a sure thing and i dont suggest i tell him to get it done  she turned again to hawtrey who sat very still looking at her with a flush in his face take your pen and give him that letter to the broker now  there was this in her favor that hawtrey was to some extent relieved by her persistence he had not the courage to make a successful speculator and he had already felt uneasy about the hazard that he would incur by waiting besides although prices had slightly advanced he could still secure a reasonable margin if he covered his sales in any case he did as she bade him and in another minute or two he handed edmonds an envelope  the broker took it from him without protest for he was one who could face defeat  well he said with a gesture of resignation ill send the thing on if miss creighton will excuse me ill tell your man to get out my wagon  he went out and sally turned to hawtrey with the color in her cheeks and a flash in her eyes  its harry wyllards money she commented as she met his glance with flashing eyes     chapter xxvii  in the wilderness   a bitter wind was blowing when wyllard stood outside the little tent the morning after he had made a landing on the ice he was to leeward of the straining canvas which partly sheltered him but the raw cold struck through him to the bone and he was stiff and sore from his exertions during the previous day his joints ached unpleasantly and his clothing had not quite dried upon him he was conscious of a strong desire to crawl back into the tent and go to sleep again but that was one it would clearly not be wise to indulge in since they were he believed still some distance off the beach and the ice might begin to break up at any moment it stretched away before him seamed by fissures and serrated ridges here and there for a few hundred yards and then was lost in the snow as he gazed at it he shrank from the prospect of the journey through the frozen desolation  with a shiver he crawled back into the tent where his two companions were crouching beside the cookinglamp the feeble light of its sputtering blue flame touched their faces which were graver than usual but charly looked up as he came in  winds dropping announced wyllard curtly well start as soon as you have made breakfast we must try to reach the beach tonight  charly made no answer though the duskyskinned siwash grunted and in a few more minutes they silently commenced their meal which was promptly finished they struck the tent and packed it with their sleepingbags and provisions upon the sled and then taking up the traces set out across the ice the light had grown clearer now and the snow was thinning but it still whirled about them and lay piled in drawnout wreaths to lee of every hummock or ragged ridge they floundered kneedeep and in the softer places the weight upon the traces grew unpleasantly heavy that however was not a thing any of them felt the least desire to complain of and it was indeed a matter of regret to them that they were not harnessed to a heavier burden there was a snowwrapped desolation in front of them and they had lost a number of small comforts and part of their provisions in making a landing whether the provisions could be replaced they did not know  the small supply of food was an excellent reason for pushing on as fast as possible and they stumbled and floundered forward until late in the afternoon the ice became more rugged and broken as they proceeded the snow had ceased but the drifts which stretched across their path were plentiful and they were in the midst of one when it seemed to wyllard who was leading that they were sinking much deeper than usual the snow was over the tops of his long boots the sled seemed very heavy and he could hear his comrades floundering savagely there was a cry behind him and he was jerked suddenly backwards for a pace or two until he flung himself down at full length in the snow after that he was drawn back no further but the strain upon the trace became almost insupportable and there was still a furious scuffling behind him  in a moment or two however the strain slackened and looking round he saw charly waistdeep in the snow charly struggled out with difficulty holding on by the trace but the sled had vanished and it was with grave misgivings that wyllard scrambled to his feet they hauled with all their might and after a tense effort that left them gasping dragged the sled back into sight part of its load however had been left behind in the yawning hole  charly went back a pace or two cautiously until he once more sank to the waist and they had some trouble in dragging him clear then he sat down on the sled and wyllard stood still looking at the holes in the snow  did you feel anything under you he asked at length in a jarring voice  i didnt said charly simply it was only the trace saved me from dropping through altogether but if id gone a little further id have been in the water kind of snow bridge over a crevice we broke it up and the sled fell through  wyllard turned and flung the tent their sleepingbags and the few packages which had not fallen out of the sled after which he hastily opened one or two of them his companions looked at them with apprehension in their eyes until he spoke again  the provisions may last a week or so if we cut down rations he said  he could not remember afterwards whether anybody suggested it and he believed that the same idea occurred to all of them at once but in another moment or two they set about undoing the traces from the sled and making them secure about their bodies for half an hour they made perilous attempt after attempt to recover the lost provisions and failed the snow broke through continuously beneath the foremost man but it did not break away altogether and they could not tell what lay beneath it when they had drawn him out of the hole when it became evident that the attempt was useless sitting on the sled they held a brief council  i guess we dont want to go back said charly its quite likely weve crossed a good many of these crevices and the snows getting soft besides dampier will have hauled off and headed for the inlet by now  he spoke quietly though his face was grave pausing a moment he waved his hand it seems to me he added we have got to fetch the inlet while the provisions last  exactly agreed wyllard since the chart shows a river between us and it the sooner we start the better if the thaw holds the stream will break up the ice on it  the indian who made no suggestion grunted what appeared to be concurrence and they silently set to work to reload the sled that done they took up the traces and floundered on again into the gathering dimness and a thin haze of driving snow darkness had fallen when they made camp again and sat wornout and aching in every bone about the sputtering lamp inside the little straining tent the meal they made was a very frugal one and they lay down in the darkness after it for half their store of oil had been left behind in the crevice they spoke seldom for the second disaster had almost crushed the courage out of them and it was clear to all that it would be only by a strenuous effort that they could reach the inlet before their provisions quite ran out they slept however and rising in a stinging frost next morning set out again on the weary march but it was slow traveling and at noon they left the tent and poles behind  in another few days said wyllard well leave the sled  they made the beach that afternoon though the only sign of it was the fringe of more ragged ice and the white slope beyond a thin haze hung about them heavy with rime and they could not see more than a quarter of a mile ahead when darkness fell they scraped out a hollow beneath what seemed to be a snowcovered rock and sat upon their sleepingbags the cookinglamp gave little heat having eaten they huddled close together with part of their aching bodies upon the sled but none of them slept much that night for the cold was severe  the morning broke clear and warmer and wyllard climbing to the summit of the rock had a brief glimpse of the serrated summits of a great white range that rose to the west and south it however faded like a vision while he watched it and turning he looked out across the rolling wilderness that stretched away to the north nothing broke its gleaming monotony and there was no sign of life anywhere in the vast expanse  they set out after breakfast breaking through a thin crust of snow which rendered the march almost insuperably difficult and they had made a league or two by the approach of night the snow had grown softer and the thawing surface would not bear the sled which sank in the slush beneath still they floundered on for a while after darkness fell and then lay down in a hollow a fine rain poured down on them  somehow they slept and though this was more difficult got upon their feet again when morning came for of all the hard things the wanderer in rainswept bush or frozen wilderness must bear there is none that tests his powers more than in the early dawn the bracing of himself for another day of effort comfortless as the nights lair has been the jaded body craves for such faint warmth as it afforded and further rest the brain is dull and heavy and the aching limbs appear incapable of supporting the weight on them difficulties loom appallingly large in the faint creeping light courage fails and the will grows feeble wyllard and his companions felt all this but it was clear to them that they could not dally with their provisions out and staggering out of camp after a very scanty meal they hauled the sled through the slush for an hour or so then they had stopped gasping and the indian slipped out of the traces  weve hauled that thing about far enough said charly who dropped the traces too and slipped away from the sled  wyllard stood looking at them for a moment or two with anxious eyes it was evident that they could haul the hampering load no further and he was troubled by an almost insupportable weariness  in that case he said you have to decide what youll leave behind  they discussed the subject for some minutes partly because it furnished an excuse for sitting upon the sled though none of them had much doubt as to the result of the council it was unthinkable that they should sacrifice a scrap of the provisions then when each man had lashed a light load upon his shoulders with a portion of the cutup traces they set out again and it rained upon them heavily all that day  during the four following days they were buffeted by a furious wind but the temperature had risen and the snow was melting fast and splashing kneedeep through slush and water they made progress while he stumbled along with the packstraps galling his shoulders wyllard was conscious of little beyond the unceasing pain in his joints and the leaden heaviness of his limbs the recollection of that march haunted him like a horrible nightmare long afterwards when each sensation and incident emerged from the haze of numbing misery he remembered that he stormed at charly who lagged behind now and then in a fit of languid dejection and that once he fell heavily and was sensible of a halfconscious regret that he was still capable of going on when the indian dragged him to his feet again they rarely spoke to one another and noticed nothing beyond the strip of white waste through which uncovered brown patches commenced to break immediately in front of them except when they crossed some low elevation and looked down upon the stretch of dull gray water not far away on one hand the breeze had swept the ice away and that was reassuring because it meant that dampier would be at the inlet when they reached it though now and then a horrible fear that their strength would fail them or that their provisions would run out first crept in  their faces had grown gaunt and haggard and each scanty meal had been cut down to the smallest portion which would keep life and power of movement within them still though the weight of it hampered him almost intolerably wyllard clung to the one rifle that they had saved from the disaster at the landing and a dozen cartridges this was a folly about which he and charly once had virulent words  at last they came to a river which flowed across their path and lay down beside it feeling that the end was not far away except in the eddies and shallows the ice had broken up and the stream swirled by in raging flood thick with heavy masses which it had brought down from its higher reaches the ice crashed upon the gleaming spurs that here and there projected from the halfthawed fringe and smashed with a harsh crackling among the boulders and there was no doubt as to what would befall the stoutest swimmer who might attempt the passage so far as wyllard afterwards remembered none of them said anything when they lay down among the wet stones but with the first of the daylight they started up stream the river was not a large one and it seemed just possible that they might find a means of crossing higher up though they afterwards admitted that this was a great deal more than they expected  the ground rose sharply and the stream flowed out of a deep ravine which they followed the rocks were of volcanic origin and some of them had crumbled into heaps of ragged débris the slope of the ravine became a talus along which it was almost impossible to scramble and they were forced back upon the boulders and the halfthawed ice in the slacker pools  they made progress notwithstanding all the obstacles in their way and when evening drew near found a little clearer space between rock and river the indian had wrenched his knee and when they stopped to make camp among the rocks it was some little time before he overtook them he said that he had found the tracks of some animal which he believed had gone up the ravine what the beast was he did not know but he was sure that it was at least large enough to eat and that appeared to be of the most importance then he would not however take the rifle nothing could compel him to drag himself another rod that night he said and the others who had noticed how he limped accepted his decision with an expressionless face he sat down among the stones and charly decided that it was wyllards part to pick the trail  you could beat me every time at trailing or shooting when we went ashore on the american side and im not sorry to let it go at that now he said  wyllard smiled grimly and ive carried this rifle a week on top of my other load you cant shoot when youre dead played out  they called in the indian and gave the rifle to him he gravely pointed to wyllard  charly grinned for the first time in several days  well he remarked in this case i guess ive no objections to let it be as he suggests  wyllard resignedly took up the rifle and strode wearily out of camp there was he knew scarcely an hours daylight left and already the dimness seemed a little more marked down in the hollow he however found the place where the indian had seen the animals track and as there was a wall of rock on one side up which he believed the beast could not scramble he pushed on up stream beside the ice there was nothing to guide him but he was a little surprised to feel that his perceptions which had been dull and dazed for the last few days were growing clearer he noticed the different sounds the river made and picked out the sharp crackle of ice among the stones though he had hitherto been conscious only of a hoarse pulsating roar the rocks also took distinctive shapes instead of looming in blurred masses before his heavy eyes and he found himself gazing with strained attention into each strip of deeper shadow still though he walked cautiously there was no sign of any life in the ravine he was horribly weary and now and then he set his lips as he stumbled noisily among the stones but he pushed on beside the water while the deep hollow grew dimmer and more shadowy     chapter xxviii  the unexpected   after a hard tramp wyllard felt a troublesome dizziness creeping over him and he sat down upon a boulder with the rifle across his knees he had eaten little in the last few days which had been spent in arduous exertion and now the leaden weariness which he had fought against since morning threatened to overcome him in addition to this he was oppressed by a black dejection which though his mind had never been clearer reacted upon his failing physical powers for it was now evident that he and his companions could not reach the inlet while their provisions held out there was no longer any doubt that he had involved the two faithful men in disaster and the knowledge that he had done so was bitter  with haggard face he sat gazing up the ravine although he scarcely imagined that either of the others had expected anything he shrank from going back as emptyhanded as when he had left them the light was getting very dim but he could still see the ice fringe upon the pool in front of him and a mass of rock that rose black against the creeping dusk not very far away beyond it on the one side there seemed to be a waste of stones amid which a few wreaths of snow still gleamed lividly then a wall of rock scarcely distinguishable in the shadow shut in the hollow  the hollow was filled with the hoarse roar of the river and the sharp crash and crackle of streamdriven ice but by and by the wornout man started as he caught another faint sound which suggested the clink of a displaced stone his hands closed hard upon the rifle but he sat very still listening with strained attention until he heard the sound again then a thrill ran through him for he was quite certain of its meaning a stone had rolled over higher up the gorge and he rose and crept forward cautiously keeping the detached rock between him and the upper portion of the ravine once or twice a stone clattered noisily beneath his feet and he stopped for a moment or two wondering with tense anxiety whether the sound could be heard at any distance through the roar of the river this was a much more serious business than crawling through the long grass for a shot at the prairie antelope when in ease of success it had seemed scarcely worth while to pack the tough and stringy venison back to the homestead  by and by he heard the clatter of a displaced stone again and this time the sound was so distinct and near that it puzzled him the wild creatures of the waste were he knew always alert and their perception of an approaching danger was wonderful it seemed strange that the beast he was creeping in upon could not hear him but he realized that he must face the hazard of detection since in another few minutes it would be too dark to shoot he had almost reached the rock by this time and he shifted his grasp on the rifle holding it thrust forward in front of him while crouching low he looked down for a spot on which to set his foot each time he moved it would he knew be useless to go any further if a stone turned over now he was fortunate however and strung up to highest tension he stole into the deeper gloom behind the rock  a little pool ran in close beneath the rock but it was covered with ice and slushy snow treading cautiously he crept across it and held his breath as he moved out from behind the rock he stopped suddenly for a man stood face to face with him scarcely a stones throw away the strangers furclad figure cut sharply against a gleaming back of snow and he held a gun in his hand though the light had almost gone it was evident to wyllard that he was a white man  they stood very still for several seconds gazing at each other and then the stranger dropped the butt of his weapon and called out sharply uttering words in a tongue that wyllard did not recognize wyllard did not move and the man spoke again what he said was still unintelligible but this time wyllard knew that he was trying german when he received only a shake of the head as an answer the stranger tried again this time is was french that he spoke  you can come forward comrade he said  he did not seem to be hostile and wyllard who tossed his rifle into the hollow of his left arm moved out a pace or two to meet him  you are russian he questioned in the language the other had used for french is freely spoken in parts of canada  the man laughed that afterwards he answered  it is said so my name is overwegalbrecht overweg as to you it appears you do not understand russian  wyllard drew a little nearer and sat down upon a boulder now that the tension had slackened his weariness had once more become almost insupportable and he felt that he might need his strength and senses he was bewildered by the encounter for it was certainly astonishing in that desolate wilderness to fall in with a man who spoke three civilized languages and wore spectacles  no he replied after a slight pause it is almost the first time i have heard russian spoken  ah responded the other there is a certain significance in that admission my friend may i inquire where you have come from and what you are doing here  wyllard who had no desire to give him any information concerning the quest for his lost comrades pointed towards the east  that is where i come from as to my business at the moment you will excuse me it is perhaps not a rudeness to ask what is yours  the stranger laughed caution it seems is necessary and to the east where you have pointed there is only the sea i will however tell you my business it is science and nothe seemed to add this with a certain significancein any way connected with the administration of the country  wyllard was conscious of a vast relief on hearing this but as he was not quite sure that he could believe it he felt that prudence was still advisable in any case he could not let the stranger go away until he had learned whether there were any more white men with him he sat still thinking hard for a moment or two  you have a camp somewhere near he asked at length  certainly replied the man you will come back with me or shall i come to yours  there are several of you  besides myself two kamtchadales  then said wyllard i will come with you i have left two comrades a little further down the ravine will you wait until i bring them  the stranger made a sign of assent and sitting down upon a ledge of rock took out a cigar wyllard now felt more sure of him since it was evident that had he meditated any treachery he would naturally have preferred him to make the visit unattended in any case it seemed likely that he would have something to eat in his camp  wyllard plodded back down the ravine and when he returned with his comrades overweg was still sitting there in the gathering darkness he greeted them with a wave of his hand and rising silently led the way up the hollow until they came in sight of a little tent that glimmered beneath a rock there was a light inside the tent and two dusky figures were silhoueted against the canvas overweg drew the flap back and the light shone upon his face as he signed them to enter wyllard standing still a moment looked at him steadily and then seeing a reassuring smile went in  overweg called to one of the kamtchadales who came in and busied himself about the cookinglamp the three famished men sat down with a sense of luxurious content among the skins that were spread upon the ground sheet after the raw cold outside the tent was very snug and warm wyllard said little however and overweg made no attempt at conversation until the kamtchadale laid out a meal when he watched his guests with a smile while they ate voraciously he had stripped off his furs and with his knees drawn up sat on one of the skins he was a little plump roundfaced man with towcolored hair and eyes that gleamed shrewdly behind his spectacles  shall i open another can he asked presently  no answered wyllard we owe you thanks enough already provisions are evidently plentiful with you  overweg nodded i have a base camp two or three days journey back he explained it is possible that i shall make a depôt we brought our stores up from the south with dog sleds before the snow grew soft but it is necessary for me to push on further my business you understand is the scientific survey to report upon the natural resources of the country  he paused and his manner changed a little when he went on again i have he added to this extent taken you into my confidence and i invite an equal candor two things are evident you have made a long journey and your french is not that one hears in paris  first of all said wyllard i must ask again are you a russian  overweg shrugged his shoulders my name which i have told you is not slavonic and it may be admitted that i was born in bavaria in the meanwhile it is true that i have been sent on a mission by the russian government  i wonder remarked wyllard reflectively how far you consider your duty towards your employers goes  overwegs eyes twinkled it covers all that can be ascertained about the geological structure and the fauna of the country especially the fauna that produce marketable furs at present i am not convinced that it goes very much further  it was clear to wyllard that he was already in this mans hands since he could not reach the inlet without provisions and overweg could if he thought fit send back a messenger to the russian authorities he was one who could think quickly and make a momentous decision and he realized that if he could not win the mans sympathy there must be open hostility between them  in that case i think i may tell you what has brought me here he said if you have traveled much in kamtchatka you can perhaps help me to begin with i sailed from vancouver in canada nearly a year ago  it required some time to make his errand clear and then overweg looked at him with an inscrutable expression  it is said the scientist a tale that in these days one finds some little difficulty in believing still it must be admitted that i am acquainted with one fact which appears to substantiate it  as he saw the blood rise to wyllards forehead he broke off with a laugh  my friend he added is it permitted to offer you my felicitations the men who would attempt a thing of this kind are i think singularly rare  what is the fact that gives me at least partial credence asked wyllard impatiently  there is a kamtchadale in my base camp who told me of a place where a white man was buried some distance to the west of us he spoke of a second white man but nobody i understand knows what became of him  wyllard straightened himself suddenly you will send for that kamtchadale  assuredly the tale you have told me has stirred my curiosity as my path lies west up the river valley we can if it pleases you go on for a while together  wyllard who thanked him turned to charly with a sigh of relief  it seems that we shall not bring those men back but i think we may find out where they lie he said  charly made no comment for this was the most he had expected and a few minutes later there was silence in the little tent when the men lay down to sleep among the skins  they started at sunrise next morning and followed the river slowly by easy stages until the man sent back to overwegs base camp overtook them with another kamtchadale then they pushed on still further inland and it was a week later when one evening their guide led them up to a little pile of stones upon a lonely ridge of rock there were two letters very rudely cut on one of the stones and wyllard who stooped down beside it took off his cap when he rose  theres no doubt that jake leslie lies here he said looking at overweg he asked your man is sure there was only one white man who buried him  overweg spoke to the kamtchadale who answered  there was only one white man it seems he went inland afterwardsat least a year ago  wyllard turned to charly and his face was very grave that makes it certain that two of them have died there was one left and he may be dead by this time he made a forceful gesture if one only knew  charly made no answer he was not a man of education or much imagination but like others of his kind he had alternately borne many privations in the wilderness logging prospecting trailcutting about the remoter mines and at sea as one result of this there crept into his mind some recognition of what the outcast who lay at rest beside their feet had had to facethe infinite toil of the march the black despair the blinding snow and arctic frost he met his leaders gaze with a look of comprehending sympathy  by what grim efforts and primitive devices their comrade had clung to life for a time it seemed probable they would never know but they clearly realized that though some might call it an illegal raid or even piracy it was a work of mercy this outlaw had undertaken when he was cast away in the command to swing the boats over and face the roaring surf in the darkness of the night he had heard the clear call of duty and had fearlessly obeyed his obedience had cost him much but as the man who had come so far to search for him looked down upon the little pile of stones there in the desolate wilderness there awoke within him a sure recognition of the fact that this was not the end that at least was unthinkable his comrade putting off the halffrozen suffering flesh had gone on to join the immortals with his duty done  it was with warmth at his heart and a slight haziness in his eyes that wyllard turned away at length but when he put on his fur cap again he was more determined than ever to carry out the search there were many perils and difficulties to be faced but he felt that he must not flinch  one man went inland he said to overweg i must go that way too  the little spectacled scientist looked at him curiously  ah he replied the road your comrade traveled is a hard one you have seen what it leads to  then wyllard gave another a glimpse of the emotion that he generally kept hidden deep in him  no he said quietly the hard road leads furtherwhere we do not knowbut one feels that the full knowledge will not bring sorrow when it is some day given to those who have the courage to follow  overweg waved a hand as he spoke it is not the view of the materialists but it is conceivable that the materialists may be wrong he responded in this case however it is the concrete and practical we have to grapple with my friend you say you are going inland to search for that man and for a while i go that way but though i have my base camp there is the question of provisions if you come with me  they discussed the matter until wyllard suggested that he could replace any provisions his companion supplied him with from the schooner to which overweg agreed and they afterwards decided to send the siwash and one of the kamtchadales on to the inlet with a letter to dampier the two messengers started next day when they found a place where the river was with difficulty fordable and the rest pushed on slowly into a broken and rising country seamed with belts of thin forest here and there they held westwards for another week and then one evening made their camp among a few stunted straggling firs the temperature had risen in the daytime but the nights were cold and when they had eaten their evening meal they were glad of the shelter of the tent a small fire of resinous branches was sinking into a faintly glowing mass close outside the canvas  the flap was drawn back and wyllard who lay facing the opening could see a triangular patch of dim blue sky with a sharp sickle moon hanging low above a black fir branch the night was clear and still but now and then among the stunted trees there was a faint elfin sighing that quickly died away again while still determined wyllard was moodily discouraged for they had seen no sign of human life during the journey and his reason told him that he might search for years before he found the bones of the last survivor of the party still he meant to search while overweg was willing to supply him with provisions  by and by he saw charly sharply raise his head and gaze towards the opening  did you hear anything outside asked charly  it must be the kamtchadales wyllard answered  they went back a mile or two to lay some traps  then said wyllard decisively it couldnt have been anything  charly did not appear satisfied and it seemed to wyllard that overweg was also listening but there was deep stillness outside now and he dismissed the matter from his mind a few minutes later however it seemed to him that a shadowy form appeared out of the gloom among the firs and faded into it again this struck him as very curious since if it had been one of the kamtchadales he would have walked straight into camp but he said nothing to his companions and there was silence for a while until charly rose softly to his feet  get out as quietly as you can he said as he slipped by wyllard who crept after him to the entrance  when he reached it wyllards voice rang out with a startling vehemence  stop right now he cried and after a pause nobodys going to hurt you walk right ahead  wyllard felt his heart beat furiously for a dusky halfseen figure materialized out of the gloom and grew into sharper form as it drew nearer to the sinking fire the thing was wholly unexpected almost incredible but it was clear that the man could understand english and his face was white in another moment wyllards last doubt vanished and he sprang forward with a gasp  lewsontom lewson he cried  charly thrust the man inside the tent and when somebody lighted a lamp lewson sat down stupidly and looked at them his face was gaunt and almost blackened by exposure to the frost his hair was long and tattered garments of greasy skins hung about him there was something that suggested bewildered incredulity in his eyes  its real he said slowly and haltingly you have come at last  they assured him that this was the case for a moment or two the mans face was distorted with a strange look and he made a hoarse sound in his throat  lord he muttered if im dreaming i dont want to wake  charly leaned forward and smote him on the shoulder  shall i hit you like i did that afternoon in the thompson house on the vancouver water front he asked  then the certainty of the thing seemed to dawn upon the man for he quivered and his eyes half closed after that he straightened himself with an effort  i should have known and i think i did he said turning to wyllard something seemed to tell me that you would come for us when you could  wyllards face flushed but he made no answer and it was charly who asked the next question  the others are dead  lewson made an expressive gesture hopkins was drowned in a crevice of the ice i buried leslie back yonder  he broke off abruptly as though speech cost him an effort and wyllard turned to overweg  this is the last of the men i was looking for he announced  overweg quietly nodded then you have my felicitationsbut it might be advisable if you did not tell me too much he remarked afterwards i may be questioned by those in authority     chapter xxix  cast away   tom lewson had been an hour in camp before he began the story of his wanderings and at first lying propped up on one elbow with the lamplight on his worn face he spoke slowly and with faltering tongue  we broke an oar coming off the beach that night and it kind of crippled us he said twice the boat nearly went back again in the surf and i dont quite know how we pulled her off anyway one of us was busy heaving out the water that broke into her it was jake i think and he seemed kind of silly once we saw a boat hove up on a sea but we lost her in the spray and a long while after we saw the schooner just then a comber that broke on board most hove us over and when we had dodged the next two there wasnt a sign of the schooner after that we knew that we were done and we just tried to keep her headto and ease her to the seas  he stopped a moment and looked around at the others with troubled eyes as if trying to marshal uncertain memories he was a simple sailorman who contented himself with the baldest narrative still two of those who heard him could fill in the things he had not mentionedthe mad lurching of the halfswamped boat the tense struggle with the oars each time a big frothing comber forged out of the darkness and the savage desperation of the drenched and halffrozen men cast away with the roaring surf to lee of them and their enemies watching upon the hammered beach  it blew hard that night he continued somehow our little boat lived through it but there wasnt a sign of the island when morning camenothing but the combers and the flying haze guess the wind must have shifted a few points and drove us by the end of it then we found jake had his head laid open by a sealing club the sea was getting longer and as we were too played out to hold the boat to it we got her away before it and somehow she didnt roll over i think it was next day though it might have been longer when we fetched another island she just washed up on it and one of the others pulled me out there wasnt a sign of anybody on the beach but there were plenty of skinned holluschickie seals on the slope behind it and that was fortunate for us  you struck nobody on the island questioned wyllard  we didnt lewson answered simply the russians must have sent a vessel to take off the killers after the last drive of the season a day or two before for the holluschickie were quite fresh it was blowing hard and the surf was getting steep and the men had left quite a few of their things behind them we found the shacks that the killers lived in and we made out that winter in one of them  it occurred to wyllard that this was a thing very few men except sealers could have done had they been cast ashore without stores or tools to face the awful winter of the north  how did you get through he asked  well explained lewson we had a rifle and the catridges werent spoilt the killers hadnt taken their cooking outfit and by and by we got a walrus in an open lane among the ice theyd left some gear behind them but we were most of two days cutting and heaving the beast out with a parbuckle under him there was no trouble about things keeping in that frost besides wed the holluschickie blubber to burn and there was a halfempty bag or two of stores in one of the shacks no we hadnt any great trouble in making out  you had to stay there until the ice broke up charly observed  and after the boat was gone and we couldnt get away she broke up in the surf and we burned what we saved of her at last a schooner came along and we hid out across the island until shed gone away it was blowing fresh and hazy and she just shoved a new gang of killers ashore there was an okotsk russian with them but he made no trouble for us he was white anyway and it kind of seemed to me he didnt like one of the other men who got hurt that night on the beach  then some of them did get badly hurt wyllard broke in  well lewson said from what that russian told usand we got to understand each other after a timeone of the killers had his ribs broke and it seems that another would go lame for life besides among other things there was a white man got his face quite smashed i saw him with his nose flattened way out to starboard and one eye canted he was a boss of some kind they called him smirnoff  overweg looked up sharply ah he commented smirnoff a man with an unsavory name i have heard of him  anyway lewson went on we killed seals all the open season with that russian and ive no fault to find with him in fact i figure that if he could have fixed it hed have left us on the island that winter but when a schooner came to take the killers off and collect the skins smirnoff was on board of her thatan ominous gleam crept into lewsons eyeswas the real beginning of the trouble he had us hauled up before himguess the other man had to tell him who we wereand when i wouldnt answer he slashed me across the face with a dog whip  lewson clenched a lean brown fist yes he added hoarsely i was whippedbut they should have tied my hands first it was not my fault i didnt have that mans life it was most a minute before three of them pulled me off him and he was considerably worse to look at then  there was silence for a minute or two and wyllard who felt his own face grow warm saw the suggestive hardness in charlys eyes lewson was gazing out into the darkness but the veins were swollen on his forehead and his whole body had stiffened  well let that go i cant think of it he said recovering his composure they put us on board the schooner and by and by she ran into a creek on the coast we were to be sent somewhere to be dealt with and we knew what that meant with what they had against us well they went ashore to collect some skins from the kamtchadales and at night we cut the boat adrift we got off in the darkness and if they followed they never trailed us guess they figured we couldnt make out through the winter that was coming on  so far the story had been more or less connected and comprehensible it laid no great tax on wyllards credulity and indeed all that lewson described had come about very much as dampier had once or twice suggested but it seemed an almost impossible thing that the three men should have survived during the years that followed lewson as it happened never made that matter very clear he sat silent for almost a minute before he went on again  we hauled the boat out and hid her among the rocks and after that we fell in with some kamtchadales going north he said they took us along i dont know how far but they were trapping for furs and after a timei think it was months afterwe got away from them then we fell in with another crowd and went on further north with them they were koriaks and we lived with them a long whilea winter and a summer anyway it was more perhapsi cant remember  he broke off with a vague gesture and sat looking at the others vacantly with his lean face furrowed  we must have been with them two yearsbut i dont quite know it was all the same up yonderever so far to the north  it seemed to wyllard that he had seldom heard anything more expressive in its way than this sailormans brief and fragmentary description of his life in the wilderness he had heard from whalerskippers a little about the tundra that fringes the polar sea the vast desolation frozen hard in summer a few inches below the surface on which nothing beyond the mosses ever grew it was easy to understand the braincrushing sameness and monotony of an existence checkered only by times of dire scarcity on those lonely shores  how did you live he asked  there were the birds in summer and fish in the rivers in winter we killed things in the lanes in the ice though there were weeks when we lay about the blubber lamp in the pits they made pits and put a roof on them i dont know why we staked there but jake had always a notion that we might get across to alaskasomehow we were way out on the ice one day when jim fell into a crevice and we couldnt get him out  he stopped and sat still a while as one dreaming i cant put things together but at last we came south jake and i and struck the kamtchadales again we could talk to them and one of them told us about a schooner lying in an inlet by a settlement the russians had brought her there from the islands and she must have been a sealer jake figured it was just possible we might run away with her and push across for the aleutians or alaska  charly looked up suddenly shewasa sealerhaysons seminole i was in victoria when we heard that the russians had seized her  wyllard turned to overweg who nodded when he asked a question in french  yes he said i believe the vessel lies in the inlet still they have used her now and then it is understood that they were warranted in seizing her but i think there was some diplomatic pressure brought to bear on them for they sent her crew home  lewson went on again food was scarce that season and we got most nothing in the traps he said besides there were russians out prospecting and that headed us off we figured that some of the kamtchadales who traded skins to the settlements would put them on our trail when we went to look for the boat shed gone but we hadnt much notion of getting off in her though another timei dont remember whenwe gave two kamtchadales messages wed cut on slips of wood sometimes the schooners stood in along the coast  wyllard nodded dunton of the cypress got your message he said he was in difficulties then but he afterwards sent it me  well said lewson there isnt much more to it we hung about the beach a while and then went north before the winter jake played out on the trail by and by he had to let up and in a day or two i buried him  his voice grew hoarse after that it didnt seem to matter what became of me but i kept the trail somehow and found i couldnt stay up yonder thats why i started south with some of them before the summer came now im heretalking englishtalking with white menbut it doesnt seem the same as it should have beenwithout the others  he talked no more that night but wyllard translated part of his story for the benefit of overweg  the thing it seems incredible commented the scientist this man who has so little to tell knows things which would make a trained explorer famous  it generally happens that way said wyllard the men who know cant tell  overweg made a sign of assent and then changed the subject  what shall you do now he asked  start for the inlet where we expect to find the schooner at sunrise i want to saywyllard hesitatedthat you have laid an obligation on me which i can never repay but i can at least replace the provisions you have given me  that goes for nothing declared overweg with a smile i have however drawn upon my base camp rather heavily and should be glad of any stores from the schooner that you could let me have the difficulty is that i do not wish to go too far toward the beach  they arranged a rendezvous a few days march from the inlet and in another halfhour all of them were fast asleep  when the first of the daylight came wyllard set off with his two companions and since it was evident that dampier must have now lain in the inlet awaiting them a considerable time they marched fast for several days then to their consternation they came upon the siwash lying beside a river badly lame it appeared that in climbing a slippery ridge of rock the knee he had injured had given way and he had fallen some distance heavily after which the kamtchadale finding him helpless had disappeared with most of the provisions none of the party ever learned what had become of the faithless courier but they realized that the situation was now a rather serious one charly who looked at wyllard when he had heard the indians story explained it concisely  im worrying about the boat we left on the edge of the ice he said ive had a notion all along it was going to make trouble dampier would see the wreckage when he ran in and i guess it would only mean one thing to him hed make quite certain he was right when he didnt find us at the inlet he paused and pointed towards the distant sea you have got to push right on with lewson as fast as you can while i try to bring the siwash along  wyllard started within the next few minutes and afterward never quite forgot the strain and stress of that arduous march the journey that he had made with overweg had been difficult enough but they had then traversed rising ground from which most of the melting snow had drained away now however as they approached the more level littoral there were wide tracts of mire and swamp to be painfully floundered through while every ravine and hollow was swept by a frothing torrent and they had often to search for hours for a place where it was possible to cross to make things worse they were drenched with rain half the time and trails of dingy mist obscured their path but they toiled on stubbornly through every obstacles though it was only by the tensest effort that wyllard kept pace with his companion the gaunt longhaired lewson seemed proof against physical weariness and there was seldom any change in the expression of his grim lined face now and then wyllard felt a curious shrinking as he glanced at lewson for his fixed look suggested what he had borne in the awful solitudes of the frozen north  slowly with infinite toil they crossed the weary leagues lying at night with a single skin between them and the soil for they traveled light wyllard was limping painfully with his boots worn off his feet when one morning they came into sight of a low promontory which rose against a stretch of gray lifeless sea his heart throbbed fast as he realized that behind it lay the inlet into which dampier had arranged to bring the selache he glanced at lewson who said nothing and they plodded forward faster than before  the misty sun was high in the heavens when they reached the foot of the steep rise and wyllard gasped heavily as they crept up the ascent he was making a severe muscular effort but it was the nervous tension that troubled him most for he knew that he would look down upon the inlet from the summit he blamed himself bitterly for not sending a messenger to dampier immediately after he fell in with overweg there had certainly been difficulties in the way for the increase in the scientists party had made additional packers necessary and wyllard felt that he could not reasonably compel the man who had succored him to leave behind the camp comforts to which he had evidently been accustomed in spite of that he had been at fault in not disregarding every objection and he realized it now  somehow he kept pace with lewson but he closed one hand tight as he neared the top of the promontory when he reached the summit he stopped suddenly and his face set hard as he looked down beneath him lay a strip of dim green water with a fringe of soft white surf while beyond the beach there stretched away an empty expanse of slowly heaving sea there was no schooner in the inlet no boat upon the beach  in another moment or two they went down the slope at a stumbling run and then stopped gasping by the waters edge and looked at one another there were marks in the sand which showed where a boat had been drawn up not very long before the selache evidently had been there and had sailed away again  wyllard sat down limply upon the shingle for all the strength seemed suddenly to melt out of him and it was several minutes before he looked up gazing out at sea lewson was still standing a shapeless barbaric figure in his garments of skins the hide moccasins he wore had chafed through and wyllard noticed that the blood was trickling from one of his feet  well lewson asked harshly  wyllard laid a stern restraint upon himself their case looked desperate but it must be grappled with  we must go back and meet the rest he said that firstwhat is to come afterwards i dont quite know a faint gleam of resolution crept into his eyes the schooner the russians seized lies in an inlet down the coast  lewson made a sign of comprehension there are four of us there will be birds by and by i can trap things  he flung himself down near his comrade and for an hour neither of them spoke wyllard was worn out physically and limp from the last few hours mental strain while lewson very seldom said more than was absolutely necessary they made a very frugal meal and long afterwards wyllard was haunted by the memory of that dreary afternoon during which he lay upon the shingle watching the slow pulsations of the dim lifeless sea  they set out again early next morning and as it happened found a little depôt of provisions that dampier had made but it was several days before they met charly and the indian and another week had passed before overweg reached the appointed meetingplace the scientist listened to wyllards story gravely and then appeared to consider  you have some plans he asked  wyllard admitted that this was the case and overweg smiled behind his spectacles  it is perhaps better that you should not tell me what they are he said there is however one thing i can do you say you left some stores you could not carry at the depôt which i will take for provisions are now not plentiful with me but at my base camp there are still a few things you have not which are almost necessary andhe made a gesture of reassuring significanceafter all if i have to go south a little earlier than i intended it is not a great matter  he wrote on a strip of paper which he handed to wyllard you will take these and nothing else i may add that smirnoff is stationed at the inlet where the schooner lies  wyllard thanked him and then looked him in the eyes there is a long journey before us and you have only my word that i will take nothing but these things  overweg nodded quietly yes he said it is perhaps permissible to assure you that it is sufficient for me  little more was said and in another halfhour wyllard and his companions were ready to set out he and the little spectacled scientist grasped each others hands and then wyllard abruptly turned away looking back a few minutes later he saw overweg standing upon the ridge where he had left him silhouetted against a low gray sky the scientist raised his cap once and wyllard who answered him swung around once more and strode faster towards the south     chapter xxx  the last effort   it was after a long and arduous journey which had left its mark on all of them that wyllard and his companions one lowering evening lay among the boulders beside a sheltered inlet waiting for the dusk to fall they were cramped and aching for they had scarcely moved during the last hour their garments were badly tattered and their halfcovered feet were bleeding with three knives and one rifle among them they were a pitiful company to seize a vessel but there was resolution in their haggard faces  close in front of them the green water lapped softly among the stones the breeze was light off shore and the tide which was just running ebb rippled against the bows of a little schooner lying some thirty yards from the bank the vessel had been seized for illegal sealing some years earlier and it was evident that she had been little used since then the paint was peeling from her cracked and weathered side her gear was frayed and bleached with frost and rain and only very hardpressed men would have faced the thought of going to sea in her wyllard and his companions were however very hardpressed indeed and they preferred the hazards of a voyage in the crazy vessel to falling into the russians hands it was also clear that they had no choice it must be either one thing or the other  some little distance up stream a low hill cut against the dingy sky it shut off all of the upper part of the inlet which wound in behind it but wyllard and his companions had cautiously climbed the slope earlier in the afternoon and lying flat upon the summit had looked down upon the little wooden houses that clustered above the beach he had then decided that this part of the inlet would dry out at about halfebb and as the schooners boat which he meant to seize lay upon the shingle it was evident that he must carry out his plans within the next three hours  these plans were very simple there was nobody on board the schooner which lay in deeper water and he believed that it would be possible to swim off to her and slip the cable but they must have provisions and there was so far as he could see only one way of obtaining them a building which stood by itself close beside the beach was evidently a store for he had seen two men carrying bags and cases out of it under the superintendence of a third in some kind of uniform and it appeared to be unguarded wyllard had reasons for surmising that the store contained government supplies and had arranged that charly and lewson should break into it as soon as darkness fell they were to pull off to the schooner with anything they could find inside whether they would succeed in doing this he did not know and he admitted to himself that it scarcely seemed probable but he could think of no other plan and the attempt must be made  a thin haze drove across the crest of the hill the breeze freshened slightly and the little ripples lapped more noisily along the shingle there was evidently a great deal of fresh water coming down the inlet and it was in a fever of impatience he watched the schooner strain at her cable that evening had already seemed the longest he had ever spent in his life by and by it began to rain and little streams of chilly water trickled about the weary men but they lay still with lips tight set in tense suspense what lewson had had to face in the awful icy wastes to the north of them wyllard could scarcely imagine and lewson could not tell but he and his two other comrades had borne things almost beyond endurance since he began his search and now there was far too much at stake for him to increase the odds against them by any undue precipitancy he was then in a dangerous mood but he had laid his plans with grim coldblooded caution and he meant to adhere to them  very slowly the light faded until the beach grew shadowy and the schooners spars and rigging showed dim and blurred against a dusky background the rise that shut off the settlement was lost in drifting haze and the dull rumble of the surf on the outer beach came up more sharply through the gathering darkness the measured beat of the tides deep pulsations almost maddened wyllard as he lay and listened for if all went right in an hour or two he would be sliding out over the long heave with every sail piled on to the crazy schooner  when there was only a faint gleam of water sliding by below he rose stiffly to his feet and lewson stretched out a hand for the rifle that lay among the stones there was a sharp click as he jerked the lever and then he laughed a little jarring laugh as the magazine snapped back  theyll treat us as pirates if they get hands on usand ive been lashed in the facewith a sleddogwhip he said  charly made no remark as he loosed the long seamans knife in his belt wyllard could not utter a remonstrance for there is as he recognized a point beyond which prudence does not count after what overweg had once or twice told him it was unthinkable that they should fall into smirnoffs hands  lewson and charly melted away into the darkness wyllard and the siwash walked quietly down to the waters edge a little upstream of the schooner as the stream was running strong as they waited a few moments before plunging into the sea they stripped off nothing for it was evident that none of the rags they left behind could be replaced and they knew from experience that when the first shock is over a man swimming in icy water is kept a little warmer by his clothing for all that the cold struck through wyllard when he flung himself forward and swung his left hand out it was perhaps a minute before he was clearly conscious of anything beyond the physical agony and the mental effort to retain control of his faculties then he made out the schooner a vague blurred shape a little downstream and he swam furiously his face dipping under each time his left hand came out  he drew level with the vessel clutched at her cable a foot short and was driven against her bows the stream swept him onward gasping and clawing savagely at the slippery side of the schooner until his fingers found a hold it was merely the rounded top of a bolt that he touched but with a desperate effort he clutched the bent iron that led up from it to one of the deadeyes of the mainmastshrouds he could not however draw himself up any further and he hung on wondering when his strength would fail him the siwash who had crawled up the cable leaned down from above and seized his shoulder in another moment he reached the rail and went staggering across the deck dripping and halfdazed  action was imperatively necessary and he braced himself for the effort the schooner was lying with her anchor upstream but he did not think it would be possible to heave her over it and break it out unless he waited until the others arrived and it would then be a lengthy and what was more to the purpose a noisy operation the anchor must be sacrificed but there was the difficulty that in the dark he could hardly expect to find a shackle on the cable running forward with the siwash he pulled out a chain stopper and then shipping the windlass levers found with vast relief that it would work it would make a horribly distinct clanking he knew but that could not be helped and the next thing was to discover whether the end of the chain was made fast below for it is very seldom that a skipper finds it necessary to pay out all his cable  dropping into the darkness of the locker beneath the forecastle he was more fortunate than he could reasonably have expected to be for as he crawled over the rusty links he felt a shackle it appeared to be of the usual harppattern with a cottered pin and he called out sharply to the siwash who presently flung him an iron bar and a big spike he struck one of the two or three sulphur matches he had carefully treasured and when the sputtering blue flame went out set to work to back the pin out in the dark he smashed his knuckles and badly bruised his hands but he succeeded and knew that he had shortened the chain by twothirds now  he scrambled up on deck again and hurried aft for the vessels kedge had been laid out astern to prevent her swinging there was a heavy hemp warp attached to it and it cost them some time to heave most of it over after which they proceeded to get the mainsail on to her it was covered with a coat and wyllard cut himself as he slashed through the tiers in savage impatience then he and the siwash toiled at the halliards desperately for the task of raising the heavy gaff was almost beyond their powers  there was no grease on the masthoops the blocks evidently had not been used for months several times they desisted a moment or two gasping breathless and utterly exhausted still foot by foot they got the black canvas up and then leaving the peak hanging ran forward to the boomforesail which was smaller and lighter they set that cast two jibs and the staysail loose and let them lie wyllard sat down feeling that the thing they had done would if attempted in cold blood have appeared almost impossible it was done however and now he must wait until the boat appeared there was no sign of her and as he gazed up the inlet seeing only the glimmer of the water and the sliding mist the suspense became almost intolerable minute after minute slipped by and still nothing loomed out of the haze the canvas rustled and banged above him there was a growing splashing beneath the bows and the schooner strained more heavily at her cable everything was ready only his comrades did not appear he clenched his hands and set his lips as he waited he wondered at the siwash who sat upon the rail a dim shapeless figure impassively still  at last his heart leaped for a faint splash of oars came out of the darkness both men ran forward to the windlass the sharp clanking it made drowned the splash of oars but in another minute or two there was a crash as the boat drove alongside and charly scrambled up with a rope while lewson hurled sundry bags and cases after him then he climbed on deck in turn and charly began a breathless explanation  its all we could get theres nobody on our trail he said  the last fact was most important and wyllard cut him short get the jibs and staysail on to her he commanded  the new arrivals worked rapidly while the cable clanked and rattled as the schooner drove astern but at the first heave the rotten staysail tore off the hanks and one jib burst as they ran it up its stay for an anxious moment or two the cable jammed and the anchor brought the schooner up all four flung themselves upon the windlass levers and after a furious effort the chain came up again and ran out faster fathom by fathom rattling horribly until the end of it shot suddenly over the windlass then there was another check as the schooner brought up by the kedge swung suddenly across the stream  her banging canvas filled she listed over and it was evident to all of them that if the kedge started she would forthwith drive ashore tense with strain its warp ripped out of the water and she was swinging on it heading for the beach when wyllard flung himself upon the wheel  hang on to every inch or break it he roared out mainboom box your jib and staysail up to weather  in desperate haste they obeyed orders amid a great clatter of blocks and thrashing of canvas while wyllard wrenched up his helm and the schooner straining on the warp fell away with her bows downstream the sweat of effort dripped from wyllard when he swung up an arm to lewson who was standing at the bollard to which the warp was made fast  now he cried hoarsely let her go  the rope fell with a splash the schooner lurched forward and drove away down the inlet with the stream running seaward under her while wyllard felt a trifle dazed from sheer revulsion of feeling the rumble of the surf was growing louder the deck slanted slightly beneath him if they could keep her off the beach for the next few minutes there was freedom before them he hazarded a glance astern but could see no sign of a boat up the inlet they had done a thing which even then appeared almost incredible  the breeze came down fresher the gurgle at the bows grew louder and the deck began to heave with a slow and regular rise and fall a long shadowy point girt about with spectral surf slipped by and they were out in open water they ran the schooner out for an hour or two and then though the peak of the mainsail burst to tatters as they hauled her on a wind let her stretch away northward following the trend of coast  well stand on as shes lying until we find a creek or river mouth we must have water wyllard said  an hour later he called charly to the wheel and sitting down in the shelter of the rail went to sleep though this was about the last thing he had contemplated doing it was gray dawn when he opened his eyes again and aching all over and very cold stood up to see that the schooner was tumbling over a spiteful sea with the hazy loom of land not far away from her he glanced at the gear and canvas and was almost appalled while charly who was busy close by saw his face and grinned  you dont want to look at her too much he observed we took a swig on the peakhalliards a little while ago and had to let up before we pulled the gaff off her boomforesails worse and the jibs are dropping off her while the water just pours in through her topsides when she puts another lee plank down  wyllard made an expressive gesture and leaned upon the rail he realized then something of the nature of the task he had undertaken they had no anchor no fresh water no fuel for cooking and so far as he was aware very few provisions while it seemed to him that the weathered wornout gear would not hold the masts in the vessel in any weight of breeze still the thing must be attempted and there was one want at least that could be supplied  anyway he said well beat her in when we come abreast of the first creek you and tom and the siwash will go ashore  it was afternoon when they sighted a little stream and they took most of the canvas off the vessel before three of them pulled away in the boat leaving wyllard at the helm it was blowing moderately fresh off shore and it was with feverish impatience that he watched them toiling at the oars two of them pulling while the third man sculled they disappeared behind a point and an anxious hour went by before the boat which now showed a very scanty strip of side above the tumbling foam crept out from the beach again having no breakers they had brought the water off in bulk sitting in it as they pulled and it was fortunate that the boat lurched off shore easily before the little splashing seas they lost some of the water before they hove it into the big rusty tank and then they held a consultation when they had swung the boat in and the schooner was running off to the east again  weve about stores enough to last two weeksthat is if you dont expect too much lewson pointed out theres an american stove in the deckhouse and while we cant find anything meant to burn in it theres an ax down forward and we could cut out cabin floorings or a beam or two without taking too much stiffening out of her  wyllard who had inspected the stores knew that a fortnight was the very longest that could be counted on though they ate no more than would keep a modicum of strength in them from their kind and quality he surmised that the provisions had been intended for the officials in charge of the settlement  how did you get them tom he asked  the thing said lewson quietly was simple it was dark and hazy and raining quite hard the first thing we did was to run the boat down and leave her nearly afloat then we crawled back and lay by listening outside that store we were figuring how we were to break it in when two men came along they went in and came out with a bag or two and as they left the door open we figured they were coming back for more we humped out a moderate load and had just got it down to the boat when we saw those men or two others in the haze i was for lying by but charly would get out then  charly laughed dryly he wanted to take the rifle and go back to look for smirnoff id no use for any trouble of that kind and i shoved the boat off while he was seeing how many catridges there were in the magazine he waded in and grabbed the boat when he saw i was sure going but i shoved her away from him then it kind of struck him he had to get in or swim  lewsons expression grew grim thats the thing that hurts the mostto go away before i got even with that man he declared still i may get over it if i try to think of him with his nose smashed hard to starboard  wyllard made a sign of impatience he felt that after all there was perhaps something to be said for smirnoffs point of view  there is just one plan open to us and thats to drive the schooner across to the eastward as fast as we can he said we might perhaps pick up an alaska c c factory before the provisions quite run out if this breeze and the gear hold up failing that we must try for one of the western aleutians  the others concurred in this and very fortunately the breeze kept to the west and south for wyllard had very grave doubts as to whether he could have thrashed the schooner to windward through a steep head sea indeed on looking back on that voyage and remembering the state of the vessel it seemed to him that he and his companions had escaped as by a miracle in any case they hove the vessel to one misty evening in a deep inlet behind a promontory and wyllard who sculled up the inlet alone in the growing darkness badly startled the agent of an acc factory when he appeared ragged haggard and wet with rain in the doorway of a big stovewarmed room  the agent however was out for business but when wyllard produced a wad of paper money stained by wet and perspiration he appeared quite willing to part with certain provisions he was told that no questions would be answered and when he had given his visitor supper wyllard sculled away in the darkness leaving him none the wiser half an hour later the schooner slipped out to sea again  the rest was by comparison easy they had the coast of alaska and british columbia close aboard and they crept southwards in fine weather once running off their course when the smoke of a steamer crept up above the horizon in a strong breeze they ran for the northern tongue of vancouver island and wyllard who had already decided that the vessel would fetch scarcely five hundred dollars and that it would be better if all trace of her disappeared pulled his wheel over suddenly as she was scraping by a surfswept reef  in another minute she was on hard and fast and they had scarcely got the boat over when the masts went with a crash a quarter of an hour later the wreckage was thrown up on the beach and before they set out on a long march through the bush there was very little to be seen of the vessel  three or four days afterward they reached a little wooden town and wyllard who slipped into it alone in the dusk bought clothing for himself and his companions who put it on in the bush then they went into the town together and slept that night in a hotel  their troubles were over and what was more wyllard who pledged the rest to secrecy fancied that what had become of the schooner would remain a mystery     chapter xxxi  wyllard comes home   harvest had commenced at the range and the clashing binders were moving through the grain when hawtrey sat one afternoon in wyllards room it was about five oclock and every man belonging to the homestead was toiling barearmed and grimed with dust among the yellow oats but hawtrey sat at a table gazing with a troubled face at the litter of papers in front of him he wore a white shirt and store clothes which was distinctly unusual in case of a western farmer at harvest time and edmonds the mortgagejobber leaned back in a big chair quietly watching him  edmonds had called at a singularly inconvenient time and hawtrey was anxious to get rid of him before the arrival of the guests that he expected it was sallys birthday and since she took pleasure in simple festivities of any kind he had arranged to celebrate it at the range he was however sufficiently acquainted with the moneylenders character to realize that it was most unlikely that he would take his departure before he had accomplished the purpose which had brought him there this was to collect several thousand dollars  it was quite clear to hawtrey that he was in an unpleasantly tight place edmonds held a bond upon his homestead teams and implements as security for a short date loan repayment of which was due and he was to be married to sally in a month or so  cant you wait a little he asked at length  im afraid not was the uncompromising reply moneys tight this fall and things have gone against me besides you could pay me off if you wanted to  edmonds turned toward an open window and glanced at the great stretch of yellow grain that ran back across the prairie dusty teams and binders with flashing wooden arms moved halfhidden along the edge of the vast field and the still clear air was filled with a clash and clatter and the rustle of flungout sheaves  there was no doubt that money could be raised upon that harvest field indeed hawtrey fancied that his companion would be quite content to take a bond for the delivery of so many thousand bushels in repayment of the loan but while he had already gone further than he had at one time contemplated doing this was a course he shrank from suggesting after all the grain was wyllards and there was the difficulty that wyllard might still come back if wyllard failed to return an absence of another few months would entitle his executors to consider him dead in either case hawtrey would be required to account for his property  no he decided i cant takethat way  there was a trace of contempt in the mortgagejobbers smile you of course understand just how youre fixed but it seemed to me from that draft of the arrangement with wyllard that you have the power to do pretty much what you like anyway if you gave me a bond on as much of that grain as would wipe out the loan at the present figure it would only mean that you would have wyllards trustees for creditors instead of me and its probable that they wouldnt be as hard upon you as im compelled to be as things stand you have got to square up or i throw your place on the market  hawtreys face betrayed his dismay and edmonds believed that he would yield to a little further pressure gregory had not said anything about the mortgage to sally and it would be extremely unpleasant to be turned out upon the prairie within a month or two of his marriage for he could not count upon being left in possession of the range much longer  im only entitled to handle wyllards money on his account he objected  edmonds appeared to reflect so far as i can remember there was nothing of that kind stated in the draft of the arrangement it empowered you to do anything you thought fit with the money but its altogether your own affair i can of course get my money back by selling your homestead and i must decide if that must be done or not before i leave  edmonds had very little doubt as to what the decision would be hawtrey would yield and afterwards it would not be difficult to draw him into some unwise speculation with the object of getting the money back which he imagined that hawtrey would be desperately anxious to do as the result of this he expected to get such a hold upon the range that he would be master of the situation when the property fell into the hands of wyllards trustees that hawtrey would be disgraced as well as ruined naturally did not count with him  gregory took up one of the papers and read it through then he rose and stood leaning on the table while he gazed at the teams toiling amid the grain there was wealth enough yonder to release him from his torturing anxieties and after all he felt something must turn up before the reckoning was due it was not in his nature to face a crisis and with him a trouble seemed less formidable if it could only be put off a little edmonds who knew with what kind of man he had to deal said nothing further and quietly reached out for another cigar he saw vacillation in his victims manner  meantime though neither of the men were aware of it sally had alighted from her wagon on the other side of the house and two other vehicles were growing larger upon the sweep of whitened prairie as she entered the homestead the girl met mrs nansen who informed her that hawtrey was busy with edmonds in wyllards room sallys eyes sparkled when she heard it and her face grew hard  that man she exclaimed well i guess ill go right in to them  in another minute she opened the door and answered the mortgagejobbers embarrassed greeting with a frigid stare having had some experience with sallys uncompromising directness he was inclined to fancy that the game was up but he waited calmly  whats this man doing here again sally asked fixing her eyes on hawtrey you promised me you would never make another deal with him  gregory flushed had he thought it would be the least use he would have made some attempt to get sally out of the room but he was unpleasantly sure that unless she was fully satisfied first it would only result in failure driven to desperation as he was he had a halfconscious feeling that she might provide him with some means of escape sally had certainly saved him once and humiliating as the thought was he had an idea that she did not expect too much from him she might be very angry but sallys anger was after all less difficult to face than agathas quiet scorn  i havent made another deal itsa previous one gregory explained lamely  sally swung around on edmonds you have come here for money you may as well tell me i wont leave you with gregory until you do  it was quite evident that she would make her promise good and edmonds nodded  yes he said about three thousand dollars  and gregory cant pay you  edmonds thought rapidly and decided to take a bold course he was acquainted with hawtreys habit of putting things off and fancied that his debtor would seize upon the first loophole of escape from an embarrassing situation that was why he gave him a lead  well he said there is a way in which he could do it if he wished he has only to fill in a paper and hand it to me  edmonds had not sufficiently counted on sallys knowledge of his victims affairs or her quickness of wit for she turned to hawtrey with a commanding gesture  where are you going to get three thousand dollars from she asked  the blood rushed into hawtreys face for this was a thing he could not tell her but a swift suspicion flashed into her mind as she looked at him  perhaps it could beraised he answered  to pay this mortgage off sally swung round on edmonds now as she questioned him  yes he admitted he can easily do it  then the girl turned to hawtrey gregory she said with harsh incisiveness theres only one way you could get that moneyand it isnt yours  hawtrey made no reply he could not meet her gaze and when he turned from her she looked back at the mortgagebroker  if youre gone before i come back therell sure be trouble she informed him and sped swiftly out of the room  hawtrey sat down limply in his chair and edmonds laughed in a jarring manner the game was up but after all if he got his three thousand dollars he could be satisfied for one way or another he had already extracted a great deal of money from hawtrey  if i were you id marry that girl right away edmonds advised hawtrey youd be safer if you had her to look after you  hawtrey let the jibe pass for one thing he felt that it was warranted and just then his anxiety was too strong for anger  in the meanwhile sally had run out of the house to meet hastings who had just handed his wife down from their wagon the girl drew him a pace or two aside  im worried about gregory she said hes in troublebig trouble somehow we have got to raise three thousand dollars edmonds is inside with him  hastings did not seem surprised ah he said i guess its over that mortgage of his it would be awkward for you and gregory if edmonds took the homestead and turned him out  sallys face grew white but she met his gaze steadily  oh she replied thats not what i would mind the most  hastings reflected a moment or two he thought that it was a very difficult admission for the girl to make and that she had made it suggested that hawtrey might become involved in more serious difficulties he had also a strong suspicion of what they were likely to be  sally questioned hastings quietly you are afraid of edmonds making him do something you would not like  though she did not answer directly he saw the shame in the girls face and remembered that he was one of wyllards trustees  i must raise that moneynowand i dont know where to get more than five hundred dollars from i might manage that she said  well answered hastings you want me to lead you then and im not sure that i can still if youll wait a few minutes ill see what i can do  sally left him and he turned to his wife whose expression suggested that she had overheard part of what was said and had guessed the rest  you mean to raise that money after all we are friends of his and it may save him from letting edmonds get his grip upon the range she said  hastings made a sign of reluctant assent i dont quite know how i can do it personally in view of the figure wheat is standing at and i dont think much of any security that gregory could offer me still there is perhaps a way in which it could be arranged and its one that considering everything is more or less admissible i think ill wait here for agatha  agatha was in the wagon driven by sproatly when sproatly had helped her and winifred to alight hastings who walked to the house with them drew agatha into an unoccupied room  im afraid that gregorys in rather serious trouble sally seems very anxious about him he said its rather a delicate subject but i understand that in a general way you are on good terms with both of them  agatha met his embarrassed gaze with a smile she knew that what he really wished to discover was whether she still felt any bitterness against gregory or blamed him for pledging himself to sally  yes she answered sally and i are good friends and i am very sorry to hear that gregory is in any difficulty  hastings still seemed embarrassed and she was becoming puzzled by his manner  once upon a time you would have done anything possible to make things easier for him he said i wonder if i might ask if to some extent you have that feeling still  of course if he is in serious trouble i should be glad to do anything within my power to help him  even if it cost we will say about six hundred english pounds  agatha gazed at him in bewilderment  there are some twenty dollars in my possession which your wife handed me not long ago she remarked in a puzzled tone  still if you had the money you would be glad to help himand would not regret it afterwards  no asserted agatha decisively if i had the means and the need was urgent i should be glad to do what i could then she laughed i cant understand in the least how this is to the purpose  if you will wait for the next two or three months i may be able to explain it to you replied hastings in the meanwhile there are one or two things i have to do  when he left her agatha sat still wondering what he could have meant but feeling that she would be willing to do what she could for gregory hastings suggestion that it was possible that she still cherished any sense of grievance against him because he was going to marry sally brought a scornful smile to her lips it was easy to forgive gregory that for she now saw him as he wasshallow careless shiftless a man without depth of character he had a few surface graces and on occasion a certain halfinsolent forcefulness of manner which in a curious fashion was almost becoming there was however nothing beneath the surface he was it seemed quite willing that a woman should help him out of the trouble in which he had involved himself for she had no doubt that sally had sent hastings on his incomprehensible errand  then a clear voice came in through the window and turning towards it agatha discovered that a young lad clad in blue duck was singing as he drove his binder through the grain the song was a simple one which had some vogue just then upon the prairie but her eyes grew suddenly hazy as odd snatches of it reached her through the beat of hoofs the clash of the binders arms and the rustle of the flungout sheaves                      my bonny lies over the ocean                     my bonny lies over the sea  the youth called to his horses and it was a few moments before she heard again                       bring back my bonny to me  a quiver ran through her as she leaned upon the window frame there was a certain pathos in the simple strain and she could fancy that the lad who was clearly english as an exile felt it too once more as the jaded horses and clashing machine grew smaller down the edge of the great sweep of yellow grain his voice came faintly up to her with its haunting thrill of longing and regret                       bring back my bonny to me  this in her case was more than anyone could do and as she stood listening a tear splashed upon her closed hands the man by comparison with whom gregory appeared a mere lay figure was in all probability lying still far up in the solitudes of the frozen north with his last grim journey done this time however he had not carried her picture with him gregory was to blame for that and it was the one thing she could not forgive him  she leaned against the window for another minute struggling with an almost uncontrollable longing and looking out upon the sweep of golden wheat and whitened grass with brimming eyes until there was a rattle of wheels and she saw edmonds drive away she heard voices in the corridor and it became evident that hastings was speaking to his wife  ive got rid of the man and its reasonable to expect that gregory will keep clear of him after this he said  dont you mean that agatha did it  it was mrs hastings who asked the question and agatha became intent as she heard her name she did not however hear the answer and mrs hastings spoke again  allen she said you dont keep a secret badly though harry pledged you not to tell still all that caution was a little unnecessary it was of course just the kind of thing he would do  what did he do hastings asked and agatha heard mrs hastings soft laugh for they were just outside the door now  left the range or most of it to agatha in case he didnt come back again  they went on and agatha turning from the window sat down limply with the blood in her face and her heart beating fast wyllards last care it seemed had been to provide for her and that fact brought her a curious sense of solace in an unexplainable fashion it took the bitterest sting out of her grief though how far he had succeeded in his intentions did not seem to matter in the least it was sufficient to know that amid all the haste of his preparation he had not forgotten her  becoming a little calmer she understood what had been in hastings mind during the interview that had puzzled her and was glad that she assured him of her willingness to sacrifice anything that might be hers if it was needed to set gregory free it was she felt what wyllard would have done with the money he had said that gregory was a friend of his and that she knew meant a great deal to him  she suddenly realized that she must join the others if she did not wish her absence to excite comment going out she came face to face with sally in the corridor the girl stopped and saw the sympathy in her eyes  yes she said impulsively ive saved him edmonds has gone hastings bought him off and though i dont quite know how you helped him he stayed behind to wait for you  agatha smiled the vibrant relief in her companions voice stirred her and she realized once more that in choosing this halftaught girl gregory had acted with a wholly unusual wisdom it was with a sense of halfcontemptuous amusement at her own folly that she remembered how she had once fancied that gregory was marrying beneath him sally was far from perfect but in the essentials the man was not fit to brush her shoes  my dear responded agatha i really dont know exactly what ihavedone but if it amounts to anything it is a pleasure to me  they went together into the big general room where gregory was talking to winifred somewhat volubly agatha however judged from his manner that he had at least the grace to feel ashamed of himself supper she heard mrs nansen say would be ready very shortly and feeling in no mood for general conversation she sat near a window looking out across the harvest field until she heard a distant shout and saw a wagon appear on the crest of the hill to her astonishment two of the binders stopped and she saw the men who sprang down from them run to meet the wagon in another moment or two more of the teams stopped and a faint clamor of cries went up while here and there little running figures straggled up the slope all the occupants of the room clustered about her at the window and winifred turned to hastings  what are they shouting for she asked they are all crowding about the wagon now  agatha felt suddenly dazed and dizzy for she knew what the answer to that question must be even before mrs hastings spoke  its harry coming back she gasped  in another moment they all hastened out of the house and agatha found it scarcely possible to follow them for the sudden revulsion of feeling had almost overpowered her still she reached the door and saw the wagon drawn up amid a cluster of struggling men presently wyllard whom they surrounded broke from them she stood on the threshold waiting for him and in the moment of her exultation a pang smote her as she saw how gaunt and worn he was he came straight toward her apparently regardless of the others and clasping the hands she held out drew her into the house  so you have not married gregory yet he questioned and laughed triumphantly when he saw the answer in her shining eyes  no she said softly it is certain that i will never marry him  wyllard drew her back still further with a compelling grasp  why he asked  agatha looked up at him and then turned her eyes away  i was waiting for you she said simply  then he took her in his arms and kissed her before he turned still with her hand in his to face the others who were now flocking back to the house in another moment they went in together amid a confused clamor of good wishes  the end
