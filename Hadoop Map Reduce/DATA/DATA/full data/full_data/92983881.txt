       mrs helen bell     fruitlands collection        three unpublished poems     by louisa m alcott     fruitlands collection     we sometimes hear of one who nearly died of a broken    heartbut bronson alcott nearly died of a broken dream                                mrs helen bell   there is a room upstairs in the old house at fruitlands in harvard massachusetts where the visitors pause and look about them with a softening glance and often with visible emotion as though they felt a sudden nearness to something infinitely intimate and personal they have come to see the place where bronson alcott and the group of transcendentalists cut themselves off from the world in the spring of 1843 and tried to found a new eden where evil could find no entrance and where all might share in common the peace of an industrious simple life intermixed with study and close to the heart of nature a spiritual and intellectual center where mind and soul could grow in quiet seclusion yet with sympathetic companionship this was alcotts dream  the comedy and tragedy of the experiment have been the theme of many a magazine article and years have come and gone yet hundreds of people cross the pastures to the lonely spot each year and wander through the house and listen to the story of the joy of the first glad hopeful days and the pitiful ending of this philosophers plan for an earthly paradise  there is so much that is quaint to see and seemingly impossible to hear for there were some strange theories worked out by this group of learned men that a sudden outburst of surprise and amusement will break into the recital of the tale but in the room upstairs they are wont to grow quiet and speak in lowered voices for they seem to feel the pathos there of the final disillusionment it is the room where at the end of a laborious day mrs alcott with tired eyes sewed and sewed night after night by the light of her one flickering lamp and where bronson alcott deserted by his followers lay in his bed with his face turned to the wall and in his despair over the bitter failure of his most cherished dream called upon death to release him  the visitors stand and look at mrs alcotts lace cap on the table by the window and the little cuffs that fell over her busy useful hands at the sewing basket left where she might have laid it when she was too wearied to thread another needle at all the many personal things belonging to them both that speak so clearly of them and seem to bring them very near and then they turn to read the manuscripts and letters that hang upon the walls for on the walls at fruitlands hang various original manuscripts that as yet have never been published and among them are three poems by louisa alcottbronson alcotts noted daughter these are now put before the public for the first time and surely they must stir a warm response in the most indifferent heart  indelibly impressed upon louisa alcotts memory were those days at fruitlands when her childish feet ran swiftly over the pastures and through the pine grove and where in the early mornings she sat upon a granite boulder far up on the hill and thought thoughtsso her diary tells us she afterwards was frequently heard to say that it was in those days at fruitlands that the seeds of her literary talents were sown which were to meet with such heartfelt appreciation from the reading public and were to give such solace and comfort to the old age of her gifted father and devoted mother her love and reverence for her father and her pride in his attainments were very beautiful and in order to appreciate what it was in him that inspired this great sentiment not only in his daughter but in so many leading men of that time the eccentricities of the man whom the world called unpractical and visionary must be forgotten so as to get a glimpse of the alcott who was the intimate friend of emersona genius a philosopher an optimist in spite of failure and in spite of opposition therefore it seems best to give some extracts from his own writings first that will reveal the tenor of his mind and the largeness of his heart and intellect in order that the poems of the daughter may be more fully understood the following extracts are from his book entitled tablets       if ones life is not worshipful he writes no one cares for his      professions we recognize goodness wherever we find it tis the      same helpful influence beautifying the meanest as the greatest      service by its manners as if it did it not                                            enthusiasm is existence earnestness lifes exceeding great      reward       our dispositions are the atmosphere we breathe and we carry our      climate and world in ourselves good humor gay spirits are the      liberators  the sure cure for spleen and melancholy  and he      who smiles is never beyond redemption                                            the liberal mind is of no sect it shows to sects their departure      from the ideal standard and thus maintains pure religion in the      world but there are those whose minds like the pupil of the eye      contract as the light increases tis a poor egotism that sees only      its own image reflected in its vision only as thou beest it      thou seest it                                            one cannot be well read unless well seasoned in thought and      experience life makes the man and he must have lived in all his      gifts and become acclimated herein to profit by his readings      living at the breadth of shakespeare the depth of plato the      height of christ gives the mastery  or if not that a worthy      discipleship  and here is a quotation that reveals his great and beautiful love of nature       nature is the good baptist plunging us in her jordan streams to      be purified of our stains and fulfil all righteousness and      wheresoever our lodge there is but the thin casement between us      and immensity nature without mind within inviting us forth      into the solacing air the blue ether if we will but shake our      sloth and cares aside and step forth into her great contentments  these are enough to show the rarified atmosphere of his thought world he lived upon the hilltops so to speak and it is curious to note that in spite of its derision the world has come to value many of his ideas which at first were deemed but foolishness the importance of taste and beauty in the schoolroom for instance is now accepted throughout the world yet when he first preached this what was then a new idea and had the walls of his temple school in boston tinted in restful colors and placed the busts of socrates and plato and other learned philosophers where they could be looked upon with reverence by his pupils it was thought to be absurd and even dangerous for the old regime of illlighted illventilated schoolrooms with bare forbidding walls was at its height  so also with one of his muchlaughedat theories of farming he advocated growing buckwheat and turning the crop back into the soil in order to enrich the land and all the farmers threw their hands up as though he had lost his reason yet only a year ago when the nations were at war the agricultural department in washington sent out bulletins urging farmers to do this very thing as an admirable and inexpensive method to pursue  illustration picture of bronson alcotts famous temple school boston mass where he taught his philosophy to young boys and girls it was the first school to be decorated and furnished with artistic taste and he believed it developed a sense of beauty and refinement 18301834 the school was in the masonic temple  the fundamental principle of his dietary system was the exclusive use of fruits vegetables and all kinds of grain eliminating all animal food while this was carried to excess the idea of it does not sound so very strange to modern ears there being plenty of vegetarians now to commend the theory these things are mentioned in order to show that in spite of much that was wholly unpractical he advocated many theories that have not died but have taken root  it was the intuitive consciousness of the sincerity of his appeal to the world that drew his daughter louisa so closely to him and led her to express herself so touchingly in the following poems   a b a  lines written by louisa m alcott to her father     like bunyans pilgrim with his pack      forth went the dreaming youth    to seek to find and make his own      wisdom virtue and truth    life was his book and

to teach to warn and bless     the world passed by nor cared to take      the treasure he could give    apart he sat content to wait      and beautifully live    unsaddened by long lonely years      of want neglect and wrong    his soul to him a kingdom was      steadfast serene and strong     magnanimous and pure his life      tranquil its happy end    patience and peace his handmaids were      death an immortal friend    for him no monuments need rise      no laurels make his pall    the memry of the good and wise      outshines outlives them all  the explanation of the following poem seems to give added color to it mr alcott had a habit of cutting his own haira feat that can certainly be called unusualand it was after one of these occasions that miss alcott picked up the curl and pasted

grown each year more thin      till they are now but a silvery haze     that wise old head though it does grow bald      with the knocks hard fortune may give    has a store of faith and hope and trust      which have taught him how to live    though the hat be old theres a face below      which telleth to those who look    the history of a good mans life      and it cheers like a blessed book

     grown sick with its folly and pride    will remember the mildfaced peddler then      whom it rudely had set aside    will remember the wares he offered it once      and will seek to find him again    eager to purchase truth wisdom and love      but oh it will seek him in vain     it will find but his footsteps left behind      along the byways of life    where he patiently walked striving the while      to quiet its tumult and strife    but the peddling pilgrim has laid down his pack      and gone with his earnings away    how small will they seem remembering the debt      which the

closing another unpublished poem is added to the foregoing ones it was written by louise chandler moulton upon hearing of the death of louisa alcott and is in the fruitlands collection   louisa m

               louise chandler moulton  old letters and old poems from the pen of some wellknown author of the past that are found in unexpected places or come to light through unlookedfor channels have a special charm and flavor of their own they seem to give out something peculiarly personal like an echo from a voice that has long been silent  this great devotion that bronson alcott inspired in those near to him is well known by those who have made a study of the remarkable group of men that formed a charmed literary circle in concord in the middle of the last century of whom ralph waldo emerson was the distinguished leader yet each additional proof gives an added warmth of color and a truer portrayal of the character of this quaint and original follower of the greek philosophers and of his gifted family  the writer of this article recalls one day when the late frank b sanborn wellknown sage of concord as he was called was reading these poems at fruitlands when he came to the last line of the first poem herein given he dwelt upon it as if in deep thought then lifting his head his face lighting with one of his sudden smiles he murmured that sounds just like louisa  1919
