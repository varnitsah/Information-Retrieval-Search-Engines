22275318	walden  and  on the duty of civil disobedience  by henry david thoreau     contents   walden  economy  where i lived and what i lived for  reading  sounds  solitude  visitors  the beanfield  the village  the ponds  baker farm  higher laws  brute neighbors  housewarming  former inhabitants and winter visitors  winter animals  the pond in winter  spring  conclusion   on the duty of civil disobedience     walden     economy   when i wrote the following pages or rather the bulk of them i lived alone in the woods a mile from any neighbor in a house which i had built myself on the shore of walden pond in concord massachusetts and earned my living by the labor of my hands only i lived there two years and two months at present i am a sojourner in civilized life again  i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained i will therefore ask those of my readers who feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if i undertake to answer some of these questions in this book in most books the i or first person is omitted in this it will be retained that in respect to egotism is the main difference we commonly do not remember that it is after all always the first person that is speaking i should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom i knew as well unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land for if he has lived sincerely it must have been in a distant land to me perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students as for the rest of my readers they will accept such portions as apply to them i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits  i would fain say something not so much concerning the chinese and sandwich islanders as you who read these pages who are said to live in new england something about your condition especially your outward condition or circumstances in this world in this town what it is whether it is necessary that it be as bad as it is whether it cannot be improved as well as not i have travelled a good deal in concord and everywhere in shops and offices and fields the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways what i have heard of bramins sitting exposed to four fires and looking in the face of the sun or hanging suspended with their heads downward over flames or looking at the heavens over their shoulders until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the stomach or dwelling chained for life at the foot of a tree or measuring with their bodies like caterpillars the breadth of vast empires or standing on one leg on the tops of pillarseven these forms of conscious penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which i daily witness the twelve labors of hercules were trifling in comparison with those which my neighbors have undertaken for they were only twelve and had an end but i could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or finished any labor they have no friend iolaus to burn with a hot iron the root of the hydras head but as soon as one head is crushed two spring up  i see young men my townsmen whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms houses barns cattle and farming tools for these are more easily acquired than got rid of better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in who made them serfs of the soil why should they eat their sixty acres when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born they have got to live a mans life pushing all these things before them and get on as well as they can how many a poor immortal soul have i met wellnigh crushed and smothered under its load creeping down the road of life pushing before it a barn seventyfive feet by forty its augean stables never cleansed and one hundred acres of land tillage mowing pasture and woodlot the portionless who struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh  but men labor under a mistake the better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost by a seeming fate commonly called necessity they are employed as it says in an old book laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal it is a fools life as they will find when they get to the end of it if not before it is said that deucalion and pyrrha created men by throwing stones over their heads behind them             inde genus durum sumus experiensque laborum            et documenta damus qua simus origine nati  or as raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way    from thence our kind hardhearted is enduring pain and care    approving that our bodies of a stony nature are  so much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle throwing the stones over their heads behind them and not seeing where they fell  most men even in this comparatively free country through mere ignorance and mistake are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them their fingers from excessive toil are too clumsy and tremble too much for that actually the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men his labor would be depreciated in the market he has no time to be anything but a machine how can he remember well his ignorancewhich his growth requireswho has so often to use his knowledge we should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes and recruit him with our cordials before we judge of him the finest qualities of our nature like the bloom on fruits can be preserved only by the most delicate handling yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly  some of you we all know are poor find it hard to live are sometimes as it were gasping for breath i have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time robbing your creditors of an hour it is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live for my sight has been whetted by experience always on the limits trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt a very ancient slough called by the latins aes alienum anothers brass for some of their coins were made of brass still living and dying and buried by this others brass always promising to pay promising to pay tomorrow and dying today insolvent seeking to curry favor to get custom by how many modes only not stateprison offenses lying flattering voting contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes or his hat or his coat or his carriage or import his groceries for him making yourselves sick that you may lay up something against a sick day something to be tucked away in an old chest or in a stocking behind the plastering or more safely in the brick bank no matter where no matter how much or how little  i sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous i may almost say as to attend to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called negro slavery there are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south it is hard to have a southern overseer it is worse to have a northern one but worst of all when you are the slavedriver of yourself talk of a divinity in man look at the teamster on the highway wending to market by day or night does any divinity stir within him his highest duty to fodder and water his horses what is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests does not he drive for squire makeastir how godlike how immortal is he see how he cowers and sneaks how vaguely all the day he fears not being immortal nor divine but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself a fame won by his own deeds public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion what a man thinks of himself that it is which determines or rather indicates his fate selfemancipation even in the west indian provinces of the fancy and imaginationwhat wilberforce is there to bring that about think also of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last day not to betray too green an interest in their fates as if you could kill time without injuring eternity  the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation what is called resignation is confirmed desperation from the desperate city you go into the desperate country and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats a stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind there is no play in them for this comes after work but it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things  when we consider what to use the words of the catechism is the chief end of man and what are the true necessaries and means of life it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other yet they honestly think there is no choice left but alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear it is never too late to give up our prejudices no way of thinking or doing however ancient can be trusted without proof what everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true today may turn out to be falsehood tomorrow mere smoke of opinion which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields what old people say you cannot do you try and find that you can old deeds for old people and new deeds for new old people did not know enough once perchance to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire agoing new people put a little dry wood under a pot and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds in a way to kill old people as the phrase is age is no better hardly so well qualified for an instructor as youth for it has not profited so much as it has lost one may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned anything of absolute value by living practically the old have no very important advice to give the young their own experience has been so partial and their lives have been such miserable failures for private reasons as they must believe and it may be that they have some faith left which belies that experience and they are only less young than they were i have lived some thirty years on this planet and i have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors they have told me nothing and probably cannot tell me anything to the purpose here is life an experiment to a great extent untried by me but it does not avail me that they have tried it if i have any experience which i think valuable i am sure to reflect that this my mentors said nothing about  one farmer says to me you cannot live on vegetable food solely for it furnishes nothing to make bones with and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones walking all the while he talks behind his oxen which with vegetablemade bones jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle some things are really necessaries of life in some circles the most helpless and diseased which in others are luxuries merely and in others still are entirely unknown  the whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by their predecessors both the heights and the valleys and all things to have been cared for according to evelyn the wise solomon prescribed ordinances for the very distances of trees and the roman prætors have decided how often you may go into your neighbors land to gather the acorns which fall on it without trespass and what share belongs to that neighbor hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut our nails that is even with the ends of the fingers neither shorter nor longer undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as adam but mans capacities have never been measured nor are we to judge of what he can do by any precedents so little has been tried whatever have been thy failures hitherto be not afflicted my child for who shall assign to thee what thou hast left undone  we might try our lives by a thousand simple tests as for instance that the same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of earths like ours if i had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes this was not the light in which i hoed them the stars are the apexes of what wonderful triangles what distant and different beings in the various mansions of the universe are contemplating the same one at the same moment nature and human life are as various as our several constitutions who shall say what prospect life offers to another could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each others eyes for an instant we should live in all the ages of the world in an hour ay in all the worlds of the ages history poetry mythologyi know of no reading of anothers experience so startling and informing as this would be  the greater part of what my neighbors call good i believe in my soul to be bad and if i repent of anything it is very likely to be my good behavior what demon possessed me that i behaved so well you may say the wisest thing you can old manyou who have lived seventy years not without honor of a kindi hear an irresistible voice which invites me away from all that one generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels  i think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do we may waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere nature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strength the incessant anxiety and strain of some is a wellnigh incurable form of disease we are made to exaggerate the importance of what work we do and yet how much is not done by us or what if we had been taken sick how vigilant we are determined not to live by faith if we can avoid it all the day long on the alert at night we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties so thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live reverencing our life and denying the possibility of change this is the only way we say but there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre all change is a miracle to contemplate but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant confucius said to know that we know what we know and that we do not know what we do not know that is true knowledge when one man has reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to his understanding i foresee that all men at length establish their lives on that basis  let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which i have referred to is about and how much it is necessary that we be troubled or at least careful it would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier life though in the midst of an outward civilization if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them or even to look over the old daybooks of the merchants to see what it was that men most commonly bought at the stores what they stored that is what are the grossest groceries for the improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of mans existence as our skeletons probably are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors  by the words necessary of life i mean whatever of all that man obtains by his own exertions has been from the first or from long use has become so important to human life that few if any whether from savageness or poverty or philosophy ever attempt to do without it to many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life food to the bison of the prairie it is a few inches of palatable grass with water to drink unless he seeks the shelter of the forest or the mountains shadow none of the brute creation requires more than food and shelter the necessaries of life for man in this climate may accurately enough be distributed under the several heads of food shelter clothing and fuel for not till we have secured these are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a prospect of success man has invented not only houses but clothes and cooked food and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire and the consequent use of it at first a luxury arose the present necessity to sit by it we observe cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature by proper shelter and clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat but with an excess of these or of fuel that is with an external heat greater than our own internal may not cookery properly be said to begin darwin the naturalist says of the inhabitants of tierra del fuego that while his own party who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire were far from too warm these naked savages who were farther off were observed to his great surprise to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting so we are told the new hollander goes naked with impunity while the european shivers in his clothes is it impossible to combine the hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the civilized man according to liebig mans body is a stove and food the fuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs in cold weather we eat more in warm less the animal heat is the result of a slow combustion and disease and death take place when this is too rapid or for want of fuel or from some defect in the draught the fire goes out of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with fire but so much for analogy it appears therefore from the above list that the expression animal life is nearly synonymous with the expression animal heat for while food may be regarded as the fuel which keeps up the fire within usand fuel serves only to prepare that food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from withoutshelter and clothing also serve only to retain the heat thus generated and absorbed  the grand necessity then for our bodies is to keep warm to keep the vital heat in us what pains we accordingly take not only with our food and clothing and shelter but with our beds which are our nightclothes robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow the poor man is wont to complain that this is a cold world and to cold no less physical than social we refer directly a great part of our ails the summer in some climates makes possible to man a sort of elysian life fuel except to cook his food is then unnecessary the sun is his fire and many of the fruits are sufficiently cooked by its rays while food generally is more various and more easily obtained and clothing and shelter are wholly or half unnecessary at the present day and in this country as i find by my own experience a few implements a knife an axe a spade a wheelbarrow etc and for the studious lamplight stationery and access to a few books rank next to necessaries and can all be obtained at a trifling cost yet some not wise go to the other side of the globe to barbarous and unhealthy regions and devote themselves to trade for ten or twenty years in order that they may livethat is keep comfortably warmand die in new england at last the luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm but unnaturally hot as i implied before they are cooked of course à la mode  most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind with respect to luxuries and comforts the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor the ancient philosophers chinese hindoo persian and greek were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches none so rich in inward we know not much about them it is remarkable that we know so much of them as we do the same is true of the more modern reformers and benefactors of their race none can be an impartial or wise observer of human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary poverty of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury whether in agriculture or commerce or literature or art there are nowadays professors of philosophy but not philosophers yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live to be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts nor even to found a school but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates a life of simplicity independence magnanimity and trust it is to solve some of the problems of life not only theoretically but practically the success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtierlike success not kingly not manly they make shift to live merely by conformity practically as their fathers did and are in no sense the progenitors of a noble race of men but why do men degenerate ever what makes families run out what is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys nations are we sure that there is none of it in our own lives the philosopher is in advance of his age even in the outward form of his life he is not fed sheltered clothed warmed like his contemporaries how can a man be a philosopher and not maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men  when a man is warmed by the several modes which i have described what does he want next surely not more warmth of the same kind as more and richer food larger and more splendid houses finer and more abundant clothing more numerous incessant and hotter fires and the like when he has obtained those things which are necessary to life there is another alternative than to obtain the superfluities and that is to adventure on life now his vacation from humbler toil having commenced the soil it appears is suited to the seed for it has sent its radicle downward and it may now send its shoot upward also with confidence why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth but that he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens abovefor the nobler plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light far from the ground and are not treated like the humbler esculents which though they may be biennials are cultivated only till they have perfected their root and often cut down at top for this purpose so that most would not know them in their flowering season  i do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures who will mind their own affairs whether in heaven or hell and perchance build more magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest without ever impoverishing themselves not knowing how they liveif indeed there are any such as has been dreamed nor to those who find their encouragement and inspiration in precisely the present condition of things and cherish it with the fondness and enthusiasm of loversand to some extent i reckon myself in this number i do not speak to those who are well employed in whatever circumstances and they know whether they are well employed or notbut mainly to the mass of men who are discontented and idly complaining of the hardness of their lot or of the times when they might improve them there are some who complain most energetically and inconsolably of any because they are as they say doing their duty i also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy but most terribly impoverished class of all who have accumulated dross but know not how to use it or get rid of it and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters                                       if i should attempt to tell how i have desired to spend my life in years past it would probably surprise those of my readers who are somewhat acquainted with its actual history it would certainly astonish those who know nothing about it i will only hint at some of the enterprises which i have cherished  in any weather at any hour of the day or night i have been anxious to improve the nick of time and notch it on my stick too to stand on the meeting of two eternities the past and future which is precisely the present moment to toe that line you will pardon some obscurities for there are more secrets in my trade than in most mens and yet not voluntarily kept but inseparable from its very nature i would gladly tell all that i know about it and never paint no admittance on my gate  i long ago lost a hound a bay horse and a turtle dove and am still on their trail many are the travellers i have spoken concerning them describing their tracks and what calls they answered to i have met one or two who had heard the hound and the tramp of the horse and even seen the dove disappear behind a cloud and they seemed as anxious to recover them as if they had lost them themselves  to anticipate not the sunrise and the dawn merely but if possible nature herself how many mornings summer and winter before yet any neighbor was stirring about his business have i been about mine no doubt many of my townsmen have met me returning from this enterprise farmers starting for boston in the twilight or woodchoppers going to their work it is true i never assisted the sun materially in his rising but doubt not it was of the last importance only to be present at it  so many autumn ay and winter days spent outside the town trying to hear what was in the wind to hear and carry it express i wellnigh sunk all my capital in it and lost my own breath into the bargain running in the face of it if it had concerned either of the political parties depend upon it it would have appeared in the gazette with the earliest intelligence at other times watching from the observatory of some cliff or tree to telegraph any new arrival or waiting at evening on the hilltops for the sky to fall that i might catch something though i never caught much and that mannawise would dissolve again in the sun  for a long time i was reporter to a journal of no very wide circulation whose editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of my contributions and as is too common with writers i got only my labor for my pains however in this case my pains were their own reward  for many years i was selfappointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully surveyor if not of highways then of forest paths and all acrosslot routes keeping them open and ravines bridged and passable at all seasons where the public heel had testified to their utility  i have looked after the wild stock of the town which give a faithful herdsman a good deal of trouble by leaping fences and i have had an eye to the unfrequented nooks and corners of the farm though i did not always know whether jonas or solomon worked in a particular field today that was none of my business i have watered the red huckleberry the sand cherry and the nettletree the red pine and the black ash the white grape and the yellow violet which might have withered else in dry seasons  in short i went on thus for a long time i may say it without boasting faithfully minding my business till it became more and more evident that my townsmen would not after all admit me into the list of town officers nor make my place a sinecure with a moderate allowance my accounts which i can swear to have kept faithfully i have indeed never got audited still less accepted still less paid and settled however i have not set my heart on that  not long since a strolling indian went to sell baskets at the house of a wellknown lawyer in my neighborhood do you wish to buy any baskets he asked no we do not want any was the reply what exclaimed the indian as he went out the gate do you mean to starve us having seen his industrious white neighbors so well offthat the lawyer had only to weave arguments and by some magic wealth and standing followedhe had said to himself i will go into business i will weave baskets it is a thing which i can do thinking that when he had made the baskets he would have done his part and then it would be the white mans to buy them he had not discovered that it was necessary for him to make it worth the others while to buy them or at least make him think that it was so or to make something else which it would be worth his while to buy i too had woven a kind of basket of a delicate texture but i had not made it worth any ones while to buy them yet not the less in my case did i think it worth my while to weave them and instead of studying how to make it worth mens while to buy my baskets i studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling them the life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the others  finding that my fellowcitizens were not likely to offer me any room in the court house or any curacy or living anywhere else but i must shift for myself i turned my face more exclusively than ever to the woods where i was better known i determined to go into business at once and not wait to acquire the usual capital using such slender means as i had already got my purpose in going to walden pond was not to live cheaply nor to live dearly there but to transact some private business with the fewest obstacles to be hindered from accomplishing which for want of a little common sense a little enterprise and business talent appeared not so sad as foolish  i have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits they are indispensable to every man if your trade is with the celestial empire then some small counting house on the coast in some salem harbor will be fixture enough you will export such articles as the country affords purely native products much ice and pine timber and a little granite always in native bottoms these will be good ventures to oversee all the details yourself in person to be at once pilot and captain and owner and underwriter to buy and sell and keep the accounts to read every letter received and write or read every letter sent to superintend the discharge of imports night and day to be upon many parts of the coast almost at the same timeoften the richest freight will be discharged upon a jersey shoreto be your own telegraph unweariedly sweeping the horizon speaking all passing vessels bound coastwise to keep up a steady despatch of commodities for the supply of such a distant and exorbitant market to keep yourself informed of the state of the markets prospects of war and peace everywhere and anticipate the tendencies of trade and civilizationtaking advantage of the results of all exploring expeditions using new passages and all improvements in navigationcharts to be studied the position of reefs and new lights and buoys to be ascertained and ever and ever the logarithmic tables to be corrected for by the error of some calculator the vessel often splits upon a rock that should have reached a friendly pierthere is the untold fate of la prouseuniversal science to be kept pace with studying the lives of all great discoverers and navigators great adventurers and merchants from hanno and the phoenicians down to our day in fine account of stock to be taken from time to time to know how you stand it is a labor to task the faculties of a mansuch problems of profit and loss of interest of tare and tret and gauging of all kinds in it as demand a universal knowledge  i have thought that walden pond would be a good place for business not solely on account of the railroad and the ice trade it offers advantages which it may not be good policy to divulge it is a good port and a good foundation no neva marshes to be filled though you must everywhere build on piles of your own driving it is said that a floodtide with a westerly wind and ice in the neva would sweep st petersburg from the face of the earth  as this business was to be entered into without the usual capital it may not be easy to conjecture where those means that will still be indispensable to every such undertaking were to be obtained as for clothing to come at once to the practical part of the question perhaps we are led oftener by the love of novelty and a regard for the opinions of men in procuring it than by a true utility let him who has work to do recollect that the object of clothing is first to retain the vital heat and secondly in this state of society to cover nakedness and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work may be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe kings and queens who wear a suit but once though made by some tailor or dressmaker to their majesties cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits they are no better than wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on every day our garments become more assimilated to ourselves receiving the impress of the wearers character until we hesitate to lay them aside without such delay and medical appliances and some such solemnity even as our bodies no man ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch in his clothes yet i am sure that there is greater anxiety commonly to have fashionable or at least clean and unpatched clothes than to have a sound conscience but even if the rent is not mended perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence i sometimes try my acquaintances by such tests as thiswho could wear a patch or two extra seams only over the knee most behave as if they believed that their prospects for life would be ruined if they should do it it would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon often if an accident happens to a gentlemans legs they can be mended but if a similar accident happens to the legs of his pantaloons there is no help for it for he considers not what is truly respectable but what is respected we know but few men a great many coats and breeches dress a scarecrow in your last shift you standing shiftless by who would not soonest salute the scarecrow passing a cornfield the other day close by a hat and coat on a stake i recognized the owner of the farm he was only a little more weatherbeaten than when i saw him last i have heard of a dog that barked at every stranger who approached his masters premises with clothes on but was easily quieted by a naked thief it is an interesting question how far men would retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes could you in such a case tell surely of any company of civilized men which belonged to the most respected class when madam pfeiffer in her adventurous travels round the world from east to west had got so near home as asiatic russia she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travelling dress when she went to meet the authorities for she was now in a civilized country where people are judged of by their clothes even in our democratic new england towns the accidental possession of wealth and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone obtain for the possessor almost universal respect but they yield such respect numerous as they are are so far heathen and need to have a missionary sent to them beside clothes introduced sewing a kind of work which you may call endless a womans dress at least is never done  a man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a new suit to do it in for him the old will do that has lain dusty in the garret for an indeterminate period old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served his valetif a hero ever has a valetbare feet are older than shoes and he can make them do only they who go to soirées and legislative balls must have new coats coats to change as often as the man changes in them but if my jacket and trousers my hat and shoes are fit to worship god in they will do will they not who ever saw his old clotheshis old coat actually worn out resolved into its primitive elements so that it was not a deed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy by him perchance to be bestowed on some poorer still or shall we say richer who could do with less i say beware of all enterprises that require new clothes and not rather a new wearer of clothes if there is not a new man how can the new clothes be made to fit if you have any enterprise before you try it in your old clothes all men want not something to do with but something to do or rather something to be perhaps we should never procure a new suit however ragged or dirty the old until we have so conducted so enterprised or sailed in some way that we feel like new men in the old and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles our moulting season like that of the fowls must be a crisis in our lives the loon retires to solitary ponds to spend it thus also the snake casts its slough and the caterpillar its wormy coat by an internal industry and expansion for clothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil otherwise we shall be found sailing under false colors and be inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion as well as that of mankind  we don garment after garment as if we grew like exogenous plants by addition without our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis or false skin which partakes not of our life and may be stripped off here and there without fatal injury our thicker garments constantly worn are our cellular integument or cortex but our shirts are our liber or true bark which cannot be removed without girdling and so destroying the man i believe that all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt it is desirable that a man be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in the dark and that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly that if an enemy take the town he can like the old philosopher walk out the gate emptyhanded without anxiety while one thick garment is for most purposes as good as three thin ones and cheap clothing can be obtained at prices really to suit customers while a thick coat can be bought for five dollars which will last as many years thick pantaloons for two dollars cowhide boots for a dollar and a half a pair a summer hat for a quarter of a dollar and a winter cap for sixtytwo and a half cents or a better be made at home at a nominal cost where is he so poor that clad in such a suit of his own earning there will not be found wise men to do him reverence  when i ask for a garment of a particular form my tailoress tells me gravely they do not make them so now not emphasizing the they at all as if she quoted an authority as impersonal as the fates and i find it difficult to get made what i want simply because she cannot believe that i mean what i say that i am so rash when i hear this oracular sentence i am for a moment absorbed in thought emphasizing to myself each word separately that i may come at the meaning of it that i may find out by what degree of consanguinity they are related to me and what authority they may have in an affair which affects me so nearly and finally i am inclined to answer her with equal mystery and without any more emphasis of the theyit is true they did not make them so recently but they do now of what use this measuring of me if she does not measure my character but only the breadth of my shoulders as it were a peg to bang the coat on we worship not the graces nor the parcae but fashion she spins and weaves and cuts with full authority the head monkey at paris puts on a travellers cap and all the monkeys in america do the same i sometimes despair of getting anything quite simple and honest done in this world by the help of men they would have to be passed through a powerful press first to squeeze their old notions out of them so that they would not soon get upon their legs again and then there would be some one in the company with a maggot in his head hatched from an egg deposited there nobody knows when for not even fire kills these things and you would have lost your labor nevertheless we will not forget that some egyptian wheat was handed down to us by a mummy  on the whole i think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in this or any country risen to the dignity of an art at present men make shift to wear what they can get like shipwrecked sailors they put on what they can find on the beach and at a little distance whether of space or time laugh at each others masquerade every generation laughs at the old fashions but follows religiously the new we are amused at beholding the costume of henry viii or queen elizabeth as much as if it was that of the king and queen of the cannibal islands all costume off a man is pitiful or grotesque it is only the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it which restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people let harlequin be taken with a fit of the colic and his trappings will have to serve that mood too when the soldier is hit by a cannonball rags are as becoming as purple  the childish and savage taste of men and women for new patterns keeps how many shaking and squinting through kaleidoscopes that they may discover the particular figure which this generation requires today the manufacturers have learned that this taste is merely whimsical of two patterns which differ only by a few threads more or less of a particular color the one will be sold readily the other lie on the shelf though it frequently happens that after the lapse of a season the latter becomes the most fashionable comparatively tattooing is not the hideous custom which it is called it is not barbarous merely because the printing is skindeep and unalterable  i cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing the condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the english and it cannot be wondered at since as far as i have heard or observed the principal object is not that mankind may be well and honestly clad but unquestionably that corporations may be enriched in the long run men hit only what they aim at therefore though they should fail immediately they had better aim at something high  as for a shelter i will not deny that this is now a necessary of life though there are instances of men having done without it for long periods in colder countries than this samuel laing says that the laplander in his skin dress and in a skin bag which he puts over his head and shoulders will sleep night after night on the snow in a degree of cold which would extinguish the life of one exposed to it in any woollen clothing he had seen them asleep thus yet he adds they are not hardier than other people but probably man did not live long on the earth without discovering the convenience which there is in a house the domestic comforts which phrase may have originally signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the family though these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates where the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy season chiefly and two thirds of the year except for a parasol is unnecessary in our climate in the summer it was formerly almost solely a covering at night in the indian gazettes a wigwam was the symbol of a days march and a row of them cut or painted on the bark of a tree signified that so many times they had camped man was not made so large limbed and robust but that he must seek to narrow his world and wall in a space such as fitted him he was at first bare and out of doors but though this was pleasant enough in serene and warm weather by daylight the rainy season and the winter to say nothing of the torrid sun would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he had not made haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house adam and eve according to the fable wore the bower before other clothes man wanted a home a place of warmth or comfort first of warmth then the warmth of the affections  we may imagine a time when in the infancy of the human race some enterprising mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter every child begins the world again to some extent and loves to stay outdoors even in wet and cold it plays house as well as horse having an instinct for it who does not remember the interest with which when young he looked at shelving rocks or any approach to a cave it was the natural yearning of that portion any portion of our most primitive ancestor which still survived in us from the cave we have advanced to roofs of palm leaves of bark and boughs of linen woven and stretched of grass and straw of boards and shingles of stones and tiles at last we know not what it is to live in the open air and our lives are domestic in more senses than we think from the hearth the field is a great distance it would be well perhaps if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof or the saint dwell there so long birds do not sing in caves nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots  however if one designs to construct a dwellinghouse it behooves him to exercise a little yankee shrewdness lest after all he find himself in a workhouse a labyrinth without a clue a museum an almshouse a prison or a splendid mausoleum instead consider first how slight a shelter is absolutely necessary i have seen penobscot indians in this town living in tents of thin cotton cloth while the snow was nearly a foot deep around them and i thought that they would be glad to have it deeper to keep out the wind formerly when how to get my living honestly with freedom left for my proper pursuits was a question which vexed me even more than it does now for unfortunately i am become somewhat callous i used to see a large box by the railroad six feet long by three wide in which the laborers locked up their tools at night and it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might get such a one for a dollar and having bored a few auger holes in it to admit the air at least get into it when it rained and at night and hook down the lid and so have freedom in his love and in his soul be free this did not appear the worst nor by any means a despicable alternative you could sit up as late as you pleased and whenever you got up go abroad without any landlord or houselord dogging you for rent many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a larger and more luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box as this i am far from jesting economy is a subject which admits of being treated with levity but it cannot so be disposed of a comfortable house for a rude and hardy race that lived mostly out of doors was once made here almost entirely of such materials as nature furnished ready to their hands gookin who was superintendent of the indians subject to the massachusetts colony writing in 1674 says the best of their houses are covered very neatly tight and warm with barks of trees slipped from their bodies at those seasons when the sap is up and made into great flakes with pressure of weighty timber when they are green the meaner sort are covered with mats which they make of a kind of bulrush and are also indifferently tight and warm but not so good as the former some i have seen sixty or a hundred feet long and thirty feet broad i have often lodged in their wigwams and found them as warm as the best english houses he adds that they were commonly carpeted and lined within with wellwrought embroidered mats and were furnished with various utensils the indians had advanced so far as to regulate the effect of the wind by a mat suspended over the hole in the roof and moved by a string such a lodge was in the first instance constructed in a day or two at most and taken down and put up in a few hours and every family owned one or its apartment in one  in the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best and sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants but i think that i speak within bounds when i say that though the birds of the air have their nests and the foxes their holes and the savages their wigwams in modern civilized society not more than one half the families own a shelter in the large towns and cities where civilization especially prevails the number of those who own a shelter is a very small fraction of the whole the rest pay an annual tax for this outside garment of all become indispensable summer and winter which would buy a village of indian wigwams but now helps to keep them poor as long as they live i do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring compared with owning but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so little while the civilized man hires his commonly because he cannot afford to own it nor can he in the long run any better afford to hire but answers one by merely paying this tax the poor civilized man secures an abode which is a palace compared with the savages an annual rent of from twentyfive to a hundred dollars these are the country rates entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries spacious apartments clean paint and paper rumford fireplace back plastering venetian blinds copper pump spring lock a commodious cellar and many other things but how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a poor civilized man while the savage who has them not is rich as a savage if it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition of manand i think that it is though only the wise improve their advantagesit must be shown that it has produced better dwellings without making them more costly and the cost of a thing is the amount of what i will call life which is required to be exchanged for it immediately or in the long run an average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred dollars and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the laborers life even if he is not encumbered with a familyestimating the pecuniary value of every mans labor at one dollar a day for if some receive more others receive lessso that he must have spent more than half his life commonly before his wigwam will be earned if we suppose him to pay a rent instead this is but a doubtful choice of evils would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a palace on these terms  it may be guessed that i reduce almost the whole advantage of holding this superfluous property as a fund in store against the future so far as the individual is concerned mainly to the defraying of funeral expenses but perhaps a man is not required to bury himself nevertheless this points to an important distinction between the civilized man and the savage and no doubt they have designs on us for our benefit in making the life of a civilized people an institution in which the life of the individual is to a great extent absorbed in order to preserve and perfect that of the race but i wish to show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained and to suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage without suffering any of the disadvantage what mean ye by saying that the poor ye have always with you or that the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge  as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel  behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die  when i consider my neighbors the farmers of concord who are at least as well off as the other classes i find that for the most part they have been toiling twenty thirty or forty years that they may become the real owners of their farms which commonly they have inherited with encumbrances or else bought with hired moneyand we may regard one third of that toil as the cost of their housesbut commonly they have not paid for them yet it is true the encumbrances sometimes outweigh the value of the farm so that the farm itself becomes one great encumbrance and still a man is found to inherit it being well acquainted with it as he says on applying to the assessors i am surprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town who own their farms free and clear if you would know the history of these homesteads inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged the man who has actually paid for his farm with labor on it is so rare that every neighbor can point to him i doubt if there are three such men in concord what has been said of the merchants that a very large majority even ninetyseven in a hundred are sure to fail is equally true of the farmers with regard to the merchants however one of them says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not genuine pecuniary failures but merely failures to fulfil their engagements because it is inconvenient that is it is the moral character that breaks down but this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter and suggests beside that probably not even the other three succeed in saving their souls but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than they who fail honestly bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards from which much of our civilization vaults and turns its somersets but the savage stands on the unelastic plank of famine yet the middlesex cattle show goes off here with éclat annually as if all the joints of the agricultural machine were suent  the farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a formula more complicated than the problem itself to get his shoestrings he speculates in herds of cattle with consummate skill he has set his trap with a hair spring to catch comfort and independence and then as he turned away got his own leg into it this is the reason he is poor and for a similar reason we are all poor in respect to a thousand savage comforts though surrounded by luxuries as chapman sings               the false society of men                 for earthly greatness               all heavenly comforts rarefies to air  and when the farmer has got his house he may not be the richer but the poorer for it and it be the house that has got him as i understand it that was a valid objection urged by momus against the house which minerva made that she had not made it movable by which means a bad neighborhood might be avoided and it may still be urged for our houses are such unwieldy property that we are often imprisoned rather than housed in them and the bad neighborhood to be avoided is our own scurvy selves i know one or two families at least in this town who for nearly a generation have been wishing to sell their houses in the outskirts and move into the village but have not been able to accomplish it and only death will set them free  granted that the majority are able at last either to own or hire the modern house with all its improvements while civilization has been improving our houses it has not equally improved the men who are to inhabit them it has created palaces but it was not so easy to create noblemen and kings and if the civilized mans pursuits are no worthier than the savages if he is employed the greater part of his life in obtaining gross necessaries and comforts merely why should he have a better dwelling than the former  but how do the poor minority fare perhaps it will be found that just in proportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances above the savage others have been degraded below him the luxury of one class is counterbalanced by the indigence of another on the one side is the palace on the other are the almshouse and silent poor the myriads who built the pyramids to be the tombs of the pharaohs were fed on garlic and it may be were not decently buried themselves the mason who finishes the cornice of the palace returns at night perchance to a hut not so good as a wigwam it is a mistake to suppose that in a country where the usual evidences of civilization exist the condition of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as that of savages i refer to the degraded poor not now to the degraded rich to know this i should not need to look farther than to the shanties which everywhere border our railroads that last improvement in civilization where i see in my daily walks human beings living in sties and all winter with an open door for the sake of light without any visible often imaginable woodpile and the forms of both old and young are permanently contracted by the long habit of shrinking from cold and misery and the development of all their limbs and faculties is checked it certainly is fair to look at that class by whose labor the works which distinguish this generation are accomplished such too to a greater or less extent is the condition of the operatives of every denomination in england which is the great workhouse of the world or i could refer you to ireland which is marked as one of the white or enlightened spots on the map contrast the physical condition of the irish with that of the north american indian or the south sea islander or any other savage race before it was degraded by contact with the civilized man yet i have no doubt that that peoples rulers are as wise as the average of civilized rulers their condition only proves what squalidness may consist with civilization i hardly need refer now to the laborers in our southern states who produce the staple exports of this country and are themselves a staple production of the south but to confine myself to those who are said to be in moderate circumstances  most men appear never to have considered what a house is and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have as if one were to wear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him or gradually leaving off palmleaf hat or cap of woodchuck skin complain of hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown it is possible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we have which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for shall we always study to obtain more of these things and not sometimes to be content with less shall the respectable citizen thus gravely teach by precept and example the necessity of the young mans providing a certain number of superfluous glowshoes and umbrellas and empty guest chambers for empty guests before he dies why should not our furniture be as simple as the arabs or the indians when i think of the benefactors of the race whom we have apotheosized as messengers from heaven bearers of divine gifts to man i do not see in my mind any retinue at their heels any carload of fashionable furniture or what if i were to allowwould it not be a singular allowancethat our furniture should be more complex than the arabs in proportion as we are morally and intellectually his superiors at present our houses are cluttered and defiled with it and a good housewife would sweep out the greater part into the dust hole and not leave her mornings work undone morning work by the blushes of aurora and the music of memnon what should be mans morning work in this world i had three pieces of limestone on my desk but i was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily when the furniture of my mind was all undusted still and threw them out the window in disgust how then could i have a furnished house i would rather sit in the open air for no dust gathers on the grass unless where man has broken ground  it is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd so diligently follow the traveller who stops at the best houses so called soon discovers this for the publicans presume him to be a sardanapalus and if he resigned himself to their tender mercies he would soon be completely emasculated i think that in the railroad car we are inclined to spend more on luxury than on safety and convenience and it threatens without attaining these to become no better than a modern drawingroom with its divans and ottomans and sunshades and a hundred other oriental things which we are taking west with us invented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of the celestial empire which jonathan should be ashamed to know the names of i would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet cushion i would rather ride on earth in an ox cart with a free circulation than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and breathe a malaria all the way  the very simplicity and nakedness of mans life in the primitive ages imply this advantage at least that they left him still but a sojourner in nature when he was refreshed with food and sleep he contemplated his journey again he dwelt as it were in a tent in this world and was either threading the valleys or crossing the plains or climbing the mountaintops but lo men have become the tools of their tools the man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is become a farmer and he who stood under a tree for shelter a housekeeper we now no longer camp as for a night but have settled down on earth and forgotten heaven we have adopted christianity merely as an improved method of agriculture we have built for this world a family mansion and for the next a family tomb the best works of art are the expression of mans struggle to free himself from this condition but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten there is actually no place in this village for a work of fine art if any had come down to us to stand for our lives our houses and streets furnish no proper pedestal for it there is not a nail to hang a picture on nor a shelf to receive the bust of a hero or a saint when i consider how our houses are built and paid for or not paid for and their internal economy managed and sustained i wonder that the floor does not give way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the mantelpiece and let him through into the cellar to some solid and honest though earthy foundation i cannot but perceive that this socalled rich and refined life is a thing jumped at and i do not get on in the enjoyment of the fine arts which adorn it my attention being wholly occupied with the jump for i remember that the greatest genuine leap due to human muscles alone on record is that of certain wandering arabs who are said to have cleared twentyfive feet on level ground without factitious support man is sure to come to earth again beyond that distance the first question which i am tempted to put to the proprietor of such great impropriety is who bolsters you are you one of the ninetyseven who fail or the three who succeed answer me these questions and then perhaps i may look at your bawbles and find them ornamental the cart before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped and our lives must be stripped and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation now a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors where there is no house and no housekeeper  old johnson in his wonderworking providence speaking of the first settlers of this town with whom he was contemporary tells us that they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under some hillside and casting the soil aloft upon timber they make a smoky fire against the earth at the highest side they did not provide them houses says he till the earth by the lords blessing brought forth bread to feed them and the first years crop was so light that they were forced to cut their bread very thin for a long season the secretary of the province of new netherland writing in dutch in 1650 for the information of those who wished to take up land there states more particularly that those in new netherland and especially in new england who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to their wishes dig a square pit in the ground cellar fashion six or seven feet deep as long and as broad as they think proper case the earth inside with wood all round the wall and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth floor this cellar with plank and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling raise a roof of spars clear up and cover the spars with bark or green sods so that they can live dry and warm in these houses with their entire families for two three and four years it being understood that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the size of the family the wealthy and principal men in new england in the beginning of the colonies commenced their first dwellinghouses in this fashion for two reasons firstly in order not to waste time in building and not to want food the next season secondly in order not to discourage poor laboring people whom they brought over in numbers from fatherland in the course of three or four years when the country became adapted to agriculture they built themselves handsome houses spending on them several thousands  in this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence at least as if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants first but are the more pressing wants satisfied now when i think of acquiring for myself one of our luxurious dwellings i am deterred for so to speak the country is not yet adapted to human culture and we are still forced to cut our spiritual bread far thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten not that all architectural ornament is to be neglected even in the rudest periods but let our houses first be lined with beauty where they come in contact with our lives like the tenement of the shellfish and not overlaid with it but alas i have been inside one or two of them and know what they are lined with  though we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a cave or a wigwam or wear skins today it certainly is better to accept the advantages though so dearly bought which the invention and industry of mankind offer in such a neighborhood as this boards and shingles lime and bricks are cheaper and more easily obtained than suitable caves or whole logs or bark in sufficient quantities or even welltempered clay or flat stones i speak understandingly on this subject for i have made myself acquainted with it both theoretically and practically with a little more wit we might use these materials so as to become richer than the richest now are and make our civilization a blessing the civilized man is a more experienced and wiser savage but to make haste to my own experiment  near the end of march 1845 i borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by walden pond nearest to where i intended to build my house and began to cut down some tall arrowy white pines still in their youth for timber it is difficult to begin without borrowing but perhaps it is the most generous course thus to permit your fellowmen to have an interest in your enterprise the owner of the axe as he released his hold on it said that it was the apple of his eye but i returned it sharper than i received it it was a pleasant hillside where i worked covered with pine woods through which i looked out on the pond and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories were springing up the ice in the pond was not yet dissolved though there were some open spaces and it was all darkcolored and saturated with water there were some slight flurries of snow during the days that i worked there but for the most part when i came out on to the railroad on my way home its yellow sand heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere and the rails shone in the spring sun and i heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to commence another year with us they were pleasant spring days in which the winter of mans discontent was thawing as well as the earth and the life that had lain torpid began to stretch itself one day when my axe had come off and i had cut a green hickory for a wedge driving it with a stone and had placed the whole to soak in a pondhole in order to swell the wood i saw a striped snake run into the water and he lay on the bottom apparently without inconvenience as long as i stayed there or more than a quarter of an hour perhaps because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state it appeared to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive condition but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs arousing them they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life i had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions of their bodies still numb and inflexible waiting for the sun to thaw them on the 1st of april it rained and melted the ice and in the early part of the day which was very foggy i heard a stray goose groping about over the pond and cackling as if lost or like the spirit of the fog  so i went on for some days cutting and hewing timber and also studs and rafters all with my narrow axe not having many communicable or scholarlike thoughts singing to myself                    men say they know many things                   but lo they have taken wings                   the arts and sciences                   and a thousand appliances                   the wind that blows                   is all that any body knows  i hewed the main timbers six inches square most of the studs on two sides only and the rafters and floor timbers on one side leaving the rest of the bark on so that they were just as straight and much stronger than sawed ones each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned by its stump for i had borrowed other tools by this time my days in the woods were not very long ones yet i usually carried my dinner of bread and butter and read the newspaper in which it was wrapped at noon sitting amid the green pine boughs which i had cut off and to my bread was imparted some of their fragrance for my hands were covered with a thick coat of pitch before i had done i was more the friend than the foe of the pine tree though i had cut down some of them having become better acquainted with it sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted by the sound of my axe and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which i had made  by the middle of april for i made no haste in my work but rather made the most of it my house was framed and ready for the raising i had already bought the shanty of james collins an irishman who worked on the fitchburg railroad for boards james collins shanty was considered an uncommonly fine one when i called to see it he was not at home i walked about the outside at first unobserved from within the window was so deep and high it was of small dimensions with a peaked cottage roof and not much else to be seen the dirt being raised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap the roof was the soundest part though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun doorsill there was none but a perennial passage for the hens under the door board mrs c came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside the hens were driven in by my approach it was dark and had a dirt floor for the most part dank clammy and aguish only here a board and there a board which would not bear removal she lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof and the walls and also that the board floor extended under the bed warning me not to step into the cellar a sort of dust hole two feet deep in her own words they were good boards overhead good boards all around and a good windowof two whole squares originally only the cat had passed out that way lately there was a stove a bed and a place to sit an infant in the house where it was born a silk parasol giltframed lookingglass and a patent new coffeemill nailed to an oak sapling all told the bargain was soon concluded for james had in the meanwhile returned i to pay four dollars and twentyfive cents tonight he to vacate at five tomorrow morning selling to nobody else meanwhile i to take possession at six it were well he said to be there early and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel this he assured me was the only encumbrance at six i passed him and his family on the road one large bundle held their allbed coffeemill lookingglass hensall but the cat she took to the woods and became a wild cat and as i learned afterward trod in a trap set for woodchucks and so became a dead cat at last  i took down this dwelling the same morning drawing the nails and removed it to the pondside by small cartloads spreading the boards on the grass there to bleach and warp back again in the sun one early thrush gave me a note or two as i drove along the woodland path i was informed treacherously by a young patrick that neighbor seeley an irishman in the intervals of the carting transferred the still tolerable straight and drivable nails staples and spikes to his pocket and then stood when i came back to pass the time of day and look freshly up unconcerned with spring thoughts at the devastation there being a dearth of work as he said he was there to represent spectatordom and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of the gods of troy  i dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south where a woodchuck had formerly dug his burrow down through sumach and blackberry roots and the lowest stain of vegetation six feet square by seven deep to a fine sand where potatoes would not freeze in any winter the sides were left shelving and not stoned but the sun having never shone on them the sand still keeps its place it was but two hours work i took particular pleasure in this breaking of ground for in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable temperature under the most splendid house in the city is still to be found the cellar where they store their roots as of old and long after the superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the earth the house is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a burrow  at length in the beginning of may with the help of some of my acquaintances rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any necessity i set up the frame of my house no man was ever more honored in the character of his raisers than i they are destined i trust to assist at the raising of loftier structures one day i began to occupy my house on the 4th of july as soon as it was boarded and roofed for the boards were carefully featheredged and lapped so that it was perfectly impervious to rain but before boarding i laid the foundation of a chimney at one end bringing two cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms i built the chimney after my hoeing in the fall before a fire became necessary for warmth doing my cooking in the meanwhile out of doors on the ground early in the morning which mode i still think is in some respects more convenient and agreeable than the usual one when it stormed before my bread was baked i fixed a few boards over the fire and sat under them to watch my loaf and passed some pleasant hours in that way in those days when my hands were much employed i read but little but the least scraps of paper which lay on the ground my holder or tablecloth afforded me as much entertainment in fact answered the same purpose as the iliad                                       it would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than i did considering for instance what foundation a door a window a cellar a garret have in the nature of man and perchance never raising any superstructure until we found a better reason for it than our temporal necessities even there is some of the same fitness in a mans building his own house that there is in a birds building its own nest who knows but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands and provided food for themselves and families simply and honestly enough the poetic faculty would be universally developed as birds universally sing when they are so engaged but alas we do like cowbirds and cuckoos which lay their eggs in nests which other birds have built and cheer no traveller with their chattering and unmusical notes shall we forever resign the pleasure of construction to the carpenter what does architecture amount to in the experience of the mass of men i never in all my walks came across a man engaged in so simple and natural an occupation as building his house we belong to the community it is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a man it is as much the preacher and the merchant and the farmer where is this division of labor to end and what object does it finally serve no doubt another may also think for me but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself  true there are architects so called in this country and i have heard of one at least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core of truth a necessity and hence a beauty as if it were a revelation to him all very well perhaps from his point of view but only a little better than the common dilettantism a sentimental reformer in architecture he began at the cornice not at the foundation it was only how to put a core of truth within the ornaments that every sugarplum in fact might have an almond or caraway seed in itthough i hold that almonds are most wholesome without the sugarand not how the inhabitant the indweller might build truly within and without and let the ornaments take care of themselves what reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were something outward and in the skin merelythat the tortoise got his spotted shell or the shellfish its motheropearl tints by such a contract as the inhabitants of broadway their trinity church but a man has no more to do with the style of architecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its shell nor need the soldier be so idle as to try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his standard the enemy will find it out he may turn pale when the trial comes this man seemed to me to lean over the cornice and timidly whisper his half truth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he what of architectural beauty i now see i know has gradually grown from within outward out of the necessities and character of the indweller who is the only builderout of some unconscious truthfulness and nobleness without ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional beauty of this kind is destined to be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty of life the most interesting dwellings in this country as the painter knows are the most unpretending humble log huts and cottages of the poor commonly it is the life of the inhabitants whose shells they are and not any peculiarity in their surfaces merely which makes them picturesque and equally interesting will be the citizens suburban box when his life shall be as simple and as agreeable to the imagination and there is as little straining after effect in the style of his dwelling a great proportion of architectural ornaments are literally hollow and a september gale would strip them off like borrowed plumes without injury to the substantials they can do without architecture who have no olives nor wines in the cellar what if an equal ado were made about the ornaments of style in literature and the architects of our bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the architects of our churches do so are made the belleslettres and the beauxarts and their professors much it concerns a man forsooth how a few sticks are slanted over him or under him and what colors are daubed upon his box it would signify somewhat if in any earnest sense he slanted them and daubed it but the spirit having departed out of the tenant it is of a piece with constructing his own coffinthe architecture of the graveand carpenter is but another name for coffinmaker one man says in his despair or indifference to life take up a handful of the earth at your feet and paint your house that color is he thinking of his last and narrow house toss up a copper for it as well what an abundance of leisure be must have why do you take up a handful of dirt better paint your house your own complexion let it turn pale or blush for you an enterprise to improve the style of cottage architecture when you have got my ornaments ready i will wear them  before winter i built a chimney and shingled the sides of my house which were already impervious to rain with imperfect and sappy shingles made of the first slice of the log whose edges i was obliged to straighten with a plane  i have thus a tight shingled and plastered house ten feet wide by fifteen long and eightfeet posts with a garret and a closet a large window on each side two trap doors one door at the end and a brick fireplace opposite the exact cost of my house paying the usual price for such materials as i used but not counting the work all of which was done by myself was as follows and i give the details because very few are able to tell exactly what their houses cost and fewer still if any the separate cost of the various materials which compose them      boards  80312 mostly shanty boards     refuse shingles for roof sides  400     laths  125     two secondhand windows        with glass  243     one thousand old brick  400     two casks of lime  240  that was high     hair  031  more than i needed     mantletree iron  015     nails  390     hinges and screws  014     latch  010     chalk  001     transportation  140  i carried a good part                                       on my back         in all 281212  these are all the materials excepting the timber stones and sand which i claimed by squatters right i have also a small woodshed adjoining made chiefly of the stuff which was left after building the house  i intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street in concord in grandeur and luxury as soon as it pleases me as much and will cost me no more than my present one  i thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a lifetime at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually if i seem to boast more than is becoming my excuse is that i brag for humanity rather than for myself and my shortcomings and inconsistencies do not affect the truth of my statement notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisychaff which i find it difficult to separate from my wheat but for which i am as sorry as any mani will breathe freely and stretch myself in this respect it is such a relief to both the moral and physical system and i am resolved that i will not through humility become the devils attorney i will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth at cambridge college the mere rent of a students room which is only a little larger than my own is thirty dollars each year though the corporation had the advantage of building thirtytwo side by side and under one roof and the occupant suffers the inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors and perhaps a residence in the fourth story i cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these respects not only less education would be needed because forsooth more would already have been acquired but the pecuniary expense of getting an education would in a great measure vanish those conveniences which the student requires at cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides those things for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the student most wants tuition for instance is an important item in the term bill while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made the mode of founding a college is commonly to get up a subscription of dollars and cents and then following blindly the principles of a division of labor to its extremea principle which should never be followed but with circumspectionto call in a contractor who makes this a subject of speculation and he employs irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the foundations while the students that are to be are said to be fitting themselves for it and for these oversights successive generations have to pay i think that it would be better than this for the students or those who desire to be benefited by it even to lay the foundation themselves the student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable leisure defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure fruitful but says one you do not mean that the students should go to work with their hands instead of their heads i do not mean that exactly but i mean something which he might think a good deal like that i mean that they should not play life or study it merely while the community supports them at this expensive game but earnestly live it from beginning to end how could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics if i wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences for instance i would not pursue the common course which is merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor where anything is professed and practised but the art of lifeto survey the world through a telescope or a microscope and never with his natural eye to study chemistry and not learn how his bread is made or mechanics and not learn how it is earned to discover new satellites to neptune and not detect the motes in his eyes or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar which would have advanced the most at the end of a monththe boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had dug and smelted reading as much as would be necessary for thisor the boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the institute in the meanwhile and had received a rodgers penknife from his father which would be most likely to cut his fingers to my astonishment i was informed on leaving college that i had studied navigationwhy if i had taken one turn down the harbor i should have known more about it even the poor student studies and is taught only political economy while that economy of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed in our colleges the consequence is that while he is reading adam smith ricardo and say he runs his father in debt irretrievably  as with our colleges so with a hundred modern improvements there is an illusion about them there is not always a positive advance the devil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his early share and numerous succeeding investments in them our inventions are wont to be pretty toys which distract our attention from serious things they are but improved means to an unimproved end an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at as railroads lead to boston or new york we are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from maine to texas but maine and texas it may be have nothing important to communicate either is in such a predicament as the man who was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman but when he was presented and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his hand had nothing to say as if the main object were to talk fast and not to talk sensibly we are eager to tunnel under the atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to the new but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad flapping american ear will be that the princess adelaide has the whooping cough after all the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry the most important messages he is not an evangelist nor does he come round eating locusts and wild honey i doubt if flying childers ever carried a peck of corn to mill  one says to me i wonder that you do not lay up money you love to travel you might take the cars and go to fitchburg today and see the country but i am wiser than that i have learned that the swiftest traveller is he that goes afoot i say to my friend suppose we try who will get there first the distance is thirty miles the fare ninety cents that is almost a days wages i remember when wages were sixty cents a day for laborers on this very road well i start now on foot and get there before night i have travelled at that rate by the week together you will in the meanwhile have earned your fare and arrive there some time tomorrow or possibly this evening if you are lucky enough to get a job in season instead of going to fitchburg you will be working here the greater part of the day and so if the railroad reached round the world i think that i should keep ahead of you and as for seeing the country and getting experience of that kind i should have to cut your acquaintance altogether  such is the universal law which no man can ever outwit and with regard to the railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long to make a railroad round the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface of the planet men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere in next to no time and for nothing but though a crowd rushes to the depot and the conductor shouts all aboard when the smoke is blown away and the vapor condensed it will be perceived that a few are riding but the rest are run overand it will be called and will be a melancholy accident no doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their fare that is if they survive so long but they will probably have lost their elasticity and desire to travel by that time this spending of the best part of ones life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during the least valuable part of it reminds me of the englishman who went to india to make a fortune first in order that he might return to england and live the life of a poet he should have gone up garret at once what exclaim a million irishmen starting up from all the shanties in the land is not this railroad which we have built a good thing yes i answer comparatively good that is you might have done worse but i wish as you are brothers of mine that you could have spent your time better than digging in this dirt                                       before i finished my house wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars by some honest and agreeable method in order to meet my unusual expenses i planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans but also a small part with potatoes corn peas and turnips the whole lot contains eleven acres mostly growing up to pines and hickories and was sold the preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre one farmer said that it was good for nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on i put no manure whatever on this land not being the owner but merely a squatter and not expecting to cultivate so much again and i did not quite hoe it all once i got out several cords of stumps in plowing which supplied me with fuel for a long time and left small circles of virgin mould easily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans there the dead and for the most part unmerchantable wood behind my house and the driftwood from the pond have supplied the remainder of my fuel i was obliged to hire a team and a man for the plowing though i held the plow myself my farm outgoes for the first season were for implements seed work etc 147212 the seed corn was given me this never costs anything to speak of unless you plant more than enough i got twelve bushels of beans and eighteen bushels of potatoes beside some peas and sweet corn the yellow corn and turnips were too late to come to anything my whole income from the farm was                                          2344       deducting the outgoes  147212                                                 there are left   87112  beside produce consumed and on hand at the time this estimate was made of the value of 450the amount on hand much more than balancing a little grass which i did not raise all things considered that is considering the importance of a mans soul and of today notwithstanding the short time occupied by my experiment nay partly even because of its transient character i believe that that was doing better than any farmer in concord did that year  the next year i did better still for i spaded up all the land which i required about a third of an acre and i learned from the experience of both years not being in the least awed by many celebrated works on husbandry arthur young among the rest that if one would live simply and eat only the crop which he raised and raise no more than he ate and not exchange it for an insufficient quantity of more luxurious and expensive things he would need to cultivate only a few rods of ground and that it would be cheaper to spade up that than to use oxen to plow it and to select a fresh spot from time to time than to manure the old and he could do all his necessary farm work as it were with his left hand at odd hours in the summer and thus he would not be tied to an ox or horse or cow or pig as at present i desire to speak impartially on this point and as one not interested in the success or failure of the present economical and social arrangements i was more independent than any farmer in concord for i was not anchored to a house or farm but could follow the bent of my genius which is a very crooked one every moment beside being better off than they already if my house had been burned or my crops had failed i should have been nearly as well off as before  i am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are the keepers of men the former are so much the freer men and oxen exchange work but if we consider necessary work only the oxen will be seen to have greatly the advantage their farm is so much the larger man does some of his part of the exchange work in his six weeks of haying and it is no boys play certainly no nation that lived simply in all respects that is no nation of philosophers would commit so great a blunder as to use the labor of animals true there never was and is not likely soon to be a nation of philosophers nor am i certain it is desirable that there should be however i should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for any work he might do for me for fear i should become a horseman or a herdsman merely and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing are we certain that what is one mans gain is not anothers loss and that the stableboy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied granted that some public works would not have been constructed without this aid and let man share the glory of such with the ox and horse does it follow that he could not have accomplished works yet more worthy of himself in that case when men begin to do not merely unnecessary or artistic but luxurious and idle work with their assistance it is inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the oxen or in other words become the slaves of the strongest man thus not only works for the animal within him but for a symbol of this he works for the animal without him though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the degree to which the barn overshadows the house this town is said to have the largest houses for oxen cows and horses hereabouts and it is not behindhand in its public buildings but there are very few halls for free worship or free speech in this county it should not be by their architecture but why not even by their power of abstract thought that nations should seek to commemorate themselves how much more admirable the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruins of the east towers and temples are the luxury of princes a simple and independent mind does not toil at the bidding of any prince genius is not a retainer to any emperor nor is its material silver or gold or marble except to a trifling extent to what end pray is so much stone hammered in arcadia when i was there i did not see any hammering stone nations are possessed with an insane ambition to perpetuate the memory of themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave what if equal pains were taken to smooth and polish their manners one piece of good sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon i love better to see stones in place the grandeur of thebes was a vulgar grandeur more sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest mans field than a hundredgated thebes that has wandered farther from the true end of life the religion and civilization which are barbaric and heathenish build splendid temples but what you might call christianity does not most of the stone a nation hammers goes toward its tomb only it buries itself alive as for the pyramids there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the nile and then given his body to the dogs i might possibly invent some excuse for them and him but i have no time for it as for the religion and love of art of the builders it is much the same all the world over whether the building be an egyptian temple or the united states bank it costs more than it comes to the mainspring is vanity assisted by the love of garlic and bread and butter mr balcom a promising young architect designs it on the back of his vitruvius with hard pencil and ruler and the job is let out to dobson  sons stonecutters when the thirty centuries begin to look down on it mankind begin to look up at it as for your high towers and monuments there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook to dig through to china and he got so far that as he said he heard the chinese pots and kettles rattle but i think that i shall not go out of my way to admire the hole which he made many are concerned about the monuments of the west and the eastto know who built them for my part i should like to know who in those days did not build themwho were above such trifling but to proceed with my statistics  by surveying carpentry and daylabor of various other kinds in the village in the meanwhile for i have as many trades as fingers i had earned 1334 the expense of food for eight months namely from july 4th to march 1st the time when these estimates were made though i lived there more than two yearsnot counting potatoes a little green corn and some peas which i had raised nor considering the value of what was on hand at the last datewas      rice  17312     molasses  173     cheapest form of the

but i should not thus unblushingly publish my guilt if i did not know that most of my readers were equally guilty with myself and that their deeds would look no better in print the next year i sometimes caught a mess of fish for my dinner and once i went so far as to slaughter a woodchuck which ravaged my beanfieldeffect his transmigration as a tartar would sayand devour him partly for experiments sake but though it afforded me a momentary enjoyment notwithstanding a musky flavor i saw that the longest use would not make that a good practice however it might seem to have your woodchucks ready dressed by the village butcher  clothing and some incidental expenses within the same dates though little can be inferred from this item amounted to                                              84034     oil and some household utensils  200  so that all the pecuniary outgoes excepting for washing and mending which for the most part were done out of the house and their bills have not yet been receivedand these are all and more than all the ways by which money necessarily goes out in this part of the worldwere      house  281212     farm one year 147212     food eight months  874     clothing etc eight months  84034     oil etc eight months  200                                                     in all  619934  i address myself now to those of my readers who have a living to get and to meet this i have for farm produce sold                                              2344     earned by daylabor  1334                                                     in all 3678  which subtracted from the sum of the outgoes leaves a balance of 252134 on the one sidethis being very nearly the means with which i started and the measure of expenses to be incurredand on the other beside the leisure and independence and health thus secured a comfortable house for me as long as i choose to occupy it  these statistics however accidental and therefore uninstructive they may appear as they have a certain completeness have a certain value also nothing was given me of which i have not rendered some account it appears from the above estimate that my food alone cost me in money about twentyseven cents a week it was for nearly two years after this rye and indian meal without yeast potatoes rice a very little salt pork molasses and salt and my drink water it was fit that i should live on rice mainly who love so well the philosophy of india to meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers i may as well state that if i dined out occasionally as i always had done and i trust shall have opportunities to do again it was frequently to the detriment of my domestic arrangements but the dining out being as i have stated a constant element does not in the least affect a comparative statement like this  i learned from my two years experience that it would cost incredibly little trouble to obtain ones necessary food even in this latitude that a man may use as simple a diet as the animals and yet retain health and strength i have made a satisfactory dinner satisfactory on several accounts simply off a dish of purslane portulaca oleracea which i gathered in my cornfield boiled and salted i give the latin on account of the savoriness of the trivial name and pray what more can a reasonable man desire in peaceful times in ordinary noons than a sufficient number of ears of green sweet corn boiled with the addition of salt even the little variety which i used was a yielding to the demands of appetite and not of health yet men have come to such a pass that they frequently starve not for want of necessaries but for want of luxuries and i know a good woman who thinks that her son lost his life because he took to drinking water only  the reader will perceive that i am treating the subject rather from an economic than a dietetic point of view and he will not venture to put my abstemiousness to the test unless he has a wellstocked larder  bread i at first made of pure indian meal and salt genuine hoecakes which i baked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a stick of timber sawed off in building my house but it was wont to get smoked and to have a piny flavor i tried flour also but have at last found a mixture of rye and indian meal most convenient and agreeable in cold weather it was no little amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession tending and turning them as carefully as an egyptian his hatching eggs they were a real cereal fruit which i ripened and they had to my senses a fragrance like that of other noble fruits which i kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in cloths i made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of breadmaking consulting such authorities as offered going back to the primitive days and first invention of the unleavened kind when from the wildness of nuts and meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet and travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the dough which it is supposed taught the leavening process and through the various fermentations thereafter till i came to good sweet wholesome bread the staff of life leaven which some deem the soul of bread the spiritus which fills its cellular tissue which is religiously preserved like the vestal firesome precious bottleful i suppose first brought over in the mayflower did the business for america and its influence is still rising swelling spreading in cerealian billows over the landthis seed i regularly and faithfully procured from the village till at length one morning i forgot the rules and scalded my yeast by which accident i discovered that even this was not indispensablefor my discoveries were not by the synthetic but analytic processand i have gladly omitted it since though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome bread without yeast might not be and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay of the vital forces yet i find it not to be an essential ingredient and after going without it for a year am still in the land of the living and i am glad to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottleful in my pocket which would sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture it is simpler and more respectable to omit it man is an animal who more than any other can adapt himself to all climates and circumstances neither did i put any salsoda or other acid or alkali into my bread it would seem that i made it according to the recipe which marcus porcius cato gave about two centuries before christ panem depsticium sic facito manus mortariumque bene lavato farinam in mortarium indito aquae paulatim addito subigitoque pulchre ubi bene subegeris defingito coquitoque sub testu which i take to meanmake kneaded bread thus wash your hands and trough well put the meal into the trough add water gradually and knead it thoroughly when you have kneaded it well mould it and bake it under a cover that is in a baking kettle not a word about leaven but i did not always use this staff of life at one time owing to the emptiness of my purse i saw none of it for more than a month  every new englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this land of rye and indian corn and not depend on distant and fluctuating markets for them yet so far are we from simplicity and independence that in concord fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops and hominy and corn in a still coarser form are hardly used by any for the most part the farmer gives to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own producing and buys flour which is at least no more wholesome at a greater cost at the store i saw that i could easily raise my bushel or two of rye and indian corn for the former will grow on the poorest land and the latter does not require the best and grind them in a handmill and so do without rice and pork and if i must have some concentrated sweet i found by experiment that i could make a very good molasses either of pumpkins or beets and i knew that i needed only to set out a few maples to obtain it more easily still and while these were growing i could use various substitutes beside those which i have named for as the forefathers sang                  we can make liquor to sweeten our lips         of pumpkins and parsnips and walnuttree chips  finally as for salt that grossest of groceries to obtain this might be a fit occasion for a visit to the seashore or if i did without it altogether i should probably drink the less water i do not learn that the indians ever troubled themselves to go after it  thus i could avoid all trade and barter so far as my food was concerned and having a shelter already it would only remain to get clothing and fuel the pantaloons which i now wear were woven in a farmers familythank heaven there is so much virtue still in man for i think the fall from the farmer to the operative as great and memorable as that from the man to the farmerand in a new country fuel is an encumbrance as for a habitat if i were not permitted still to squat i might purchase one acre at the same price for which the land i cultivated was soldnamely eight dollars and eight cents but as it was i considered that i enhanced the value of the land by squatting on it  there is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such questions as if i think that i can live on vegetable food alone and to strike at the root of the matter at oncefor the root is faithi am accustomed to answer such that i can live on board nails if they cannot understand that they cannot understand much that i have to say for my part i am glad to hear of experiments of this kind being tried as that a young man tried for a fortnight to live on hard raw corn on the ear using his teeth for all mortar the squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded the human race is interested in these experiments though a few old women who are incapacitated for them or who own their thirds in mills may be alarmed                                       my furniture part of which i made myselfand the rest cost me nothing of which i have not rendered an accountconsisted of a bed a table a desk three chairs a lookingglass three inches in diameter a pair of tongs and andirons a kettle a skillet and a fryingpan a dipper a washbowl two knives and forks three plates one cup one spoon a jug for oil a jug for molasses and a japanned lamp none is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin that is shiftlessness there is a plenty of such chairs as i like best in the village garrets to be had for taking them away furniture thank god i can sit and i can stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse what man but a philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men a beggarly account of empty boxes that is spauldings furniture i could never tell from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a socalled rich man or a poor one the owner always seemed povertystricken indeed the more you have of such things the poorer you are each load looks as if it contained the contents of a dozen shanties and if one shanty is poor this is a dozen times as poor pray for what do we move ever but to get rid of our furniture our exuviæ at last to go from this world to another newly furnished and leave this to be burned it is the same as if all these traps were buckled to a mans belt and he could not move over the rough country where our lines are cast without dragging themdragging his trap he was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap the muskrat will gnaw his third leg off to be free no wonder man has lost his elasticity how often he is at a dead set sir if i may be so bold what do you mean by a dead set if you are a seer whenever you meet a man you will see all that he owns ay and much that he pretends to disown behind him even to his kitchen furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn and he will appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can i think that the man is at a dead set who has got through a knothole or gateway where his sledge load of furniture cannot follow him i cannot but feel compassion when i hear some trig compactlooking man seemingly free all girded and ready speak of his furniture as whether it is insured or not but what shall i do with my furnituremy gay butterfly is entangled in a spiders web then even those who seem for a long while not to have any if you inquire more narrowly you will find have some stored in somebodys barn i look upon england today as an old gentleman who is travelling with a great deal of baggage trumpery which has accumulated from long housekeeping which he has not the courage to burn great trunk little trunk bandbox and bundle throw away the first three at least it would surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk and i should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run when i have met an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his alllooking like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his necki have pitied him not because that was his all but because he had all that to carry if i have got to drag my trap i will take care that it be a light one and do not nip me in a vital part but perchance it would be wisest never to put ones paw into it  i would observe by the way that it costs me nothing for curtains for i have no gazers to shut out but the sun and moon and i am willing that they should look in the moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of mine nor will the sun injure my furniture or fade my carpet and if he is sometimes too warm a friend i find it still better economy to retreat behind some curtain which nature has provided than to add a single item to the details of housekeeping a lady once offered me a mat but as i had no room to spare within the house nor time to spare within or without to shake it i declined it preferring to wipe my feet on the sod before my door it is best to avoid the beginnings of evil  not long since i was present at the auction of a deacons effects for his life had not been ineffectual        the evil that men do lives after them  as usual a great proportion was trumpery which had begun to accumulate in his fathers day among the rest was a dried tapeworm and now after lying half a century in his garret and other dust holes these things were not burned instead of a bonfire or purifying destruction of them there was an auction or increasing of them the neighbors eagerly collected to view them bought them all and carefully transported them to their garrets and dust holes to lie there till their estates are settled when they will start again when a man dies he kicks the dust  the customs of some savage nations might perchance be profitably imitated by us for they at least go through the semblance of casting their slough annually they have the idea of the thing whether they have the reality or not would it not be well if we were to celebrate such a busk or feast of first fruits as bartram describes to have been the custom of the mucclasse indians when a town celebrates the busk says he having previously provided themselves with new clothes new pots pans and other household utensils and furniture they collect all their worn out clothes and other despicable things sweep and cleanse their houses squares and the whole town of their filth which with all the remaining grain and other old provisions they cast together into one common heap and consume it with fire after having taken medicine and fasted for three days all the fire in the town is extinguished during this fast they abstain from the gratification of every appetite and passion whatever a general amnesty is proclaimed all malefactors may return to their town  on the fourth morning the high priest by rubbing dry wood together produces new fire in the public square from whence every habitation in the town is supplied with the new and pure flame  they then feast on the new corn and fruits and dance and sing for three days and the four following days they receive visits and rejoice with their friends from neighboring towns who have in like manner purified and prepared themselves  the mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every fiftytwo years in the belief that it was time for the world to come to an end  i have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament that is as the dictionary defines it outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace than this and i have no doubt that they were originally inspired directly from heaven to do thus though they have no biblical record of the revelation                                       for more than five years i maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands and i found that by working about six weeks in a year i could meet all the expenses of living the whole of my winters as well as most of my summers i had free and clear for study i have thoroughly tried schoolkeeping and found that my expenses were in proportion or rather out of proportion to my income for i was obliged to dress and train not to say think and believe accordingly and i lost my time into the bargain as i did not teach for the good of my fellowmen but simply for a livelihood this was a failure i have tried trade but i found that it would take ten years to get under way in that and that then i should probably be on my way to the devil i was actually afraid that i might by that time be doing what is called a good business when formerly i was looking about to see what i could do for a living some sad experience in conforming to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to tax my ingenuity i thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries that surely i could do and its small profits might sufficefor my greatest skill has been to want but littleso little capital it required so little distraction from my wonted moods i foolishly thought while my acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the professions i contemplated this occupation as most like theirs ranging the hills all summer to pick the berries which came in my way and thereafter carelessly dispose of them so to keep the flocks of admetus i also dreamed that i might gather the wild herbs or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods even to the city by haycart loads but i have since learned that trade curses everything it handles and though you trade in messages from heaven the whole curse of trade attaches to the business  as i preferred some things to others and especially valued my freedom as i could fare hard and yet succeed well i did not wish to spend my time in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture or delicate cookery or a house in the grecian or the gothic style just yet if there are any to whom it is no interruption to acquire these things and who know how to use them when acquired i relinquish to them the pursuit some are industrious and appear to love labor for its own sake or perhaps because it keeps them out of worse mischief to such i have at present nothing to say those who would not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy i might advise to work twice as hard as they dowork till they pay for themselves and get their free papers for myself i found that the occupation of a daylaborer was the most independent of any especially as it required only thirty or forty days in a year to support one the laborers day ends with the going down of the sun and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit independent of his labor but his employer who speculates from month to month has no respite from one end of the year to the other  in short i am convinced both by faith and experience that to maintain ones self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime if we will live simply and wisely as the pursuits of the simpler nations are still the sports of the more artificial it is not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow unless he sweats easier than i do  one young man of my acquaintance who has inherited some acres told me that he thought he should live as i did if he had the means i would not have any one adopt my mode of living on any account for beside that before he has fairly learned it i may have found out another for myself i desire that there may be as many different persons in the world as possible but i would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way and not his fathers or his mothers or his neighbors instead the youth may build or plant or sail only let him not be hindered from doing that which he tells me he would like to do it is by a mathematical point only that we are wise as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye but that is sufficient guidance for all our life we may not arrive at our port within a calculable period but we would preserve the true course  undoubtedly in this case what is true for one is truer still for a thousand as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one since one roof may cover one cellar underlie and one wall separate several apartments but for my part i preferred the solitary dwelling moreover it will commonly be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convince another of the advantage of the common wall and when you have done this the common partition to be much cheaper must be a thin one and that other may prove a bad neighbor and also not keep his side in repair the only cooperation which is commonly possible is exceedingly partial and superficial and what little true cooperation there is is as if it were not being a harmony inaudible to men if a man has faith he will cooperate with equal faith everywhere if he has not faith he will continue to live like the rest of the world whatever company he is joined to to cooperate in the highest as well as the lowest sense means to get our living together i heard it proposed lately that two young men should travel together over the world the one without money earning his means as he went before the mast and behind the plow the other carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket it was easy to see that they could not long be companions or cooperate since one would not operate at all they would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures above all as i have implied the man who goes alone can start today but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready and it may be a long time before they get off                                       but all this is very selfish i have heard some of my townsmen say i confess that i have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic enterprises i have made some sacrifices to a sense of duty and among others have sacrificed this pleasure also there are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of some poor family in the town and if i had nothing to dofor the devil finds employment for the idlei might try my hand at some such pastime as that however when i have thought to indulge myself in this respect and lay their heaven under an obligation by maintaining certain poor persons in all respects as comfortably as i maintain myself and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer they have one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor while my townsmen and women are devoted in so many ways to the good of their fellows i trust that one at least may be spared to other and less humane pursuits you must have a genius for charity as well as for anything else as for doinggood that is one of the professions which are full moreover i have tried it fairly and strange as it may seem am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution probably i should not consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which society demands of me to save the universe from annihilation and i believe that a like but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it but i would not stand between any man and his genius and to him who does this work which i decline with his whole heart and soul and life i would say persevere even if the world call it doing evil as it is most likely they will  i am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one no doubt many of my readers would make a similar defence at doing somethingi will not engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it goodi do not hesitate to say that i should be a capital fellow to hire but what that is it is for my employer to find out what good i do in the common sense of that word must be aside from my main path and for the most part wholly unintended men say practically begin where you are and such as you are without aiming mainly to become of more worth and with kindness aforethought go about doing good if i were to preach at all in this strain i should say rather set about being good as if the sun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the splendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitude and go about like a robin goodfellow peeping in at every cottage window inspiring lunatics and tainting meats and making darkness visible instead of steadily increasing his genial heat and beneficence till he is of such brightness that no mortal can look him in the face and then and in the meanwhile too going about the world in his own orbit doing it good or rather as a truer philosophy has discovered the world going about him getting good when phaeton wishing to prove his heavenly birth by his beneficence had the suns chariot but one day and drove out of the beaten track he burned several blocks of houses in the lower streets of heaven and scorched the surface of the earth and dried up every spring and made the great desert of sahara till at length jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt and the sun through grief at his death did not shine for a year  there is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted it is human it is divine carrion if i knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good i should run for my life as from that dry and parching wind of the african deserts called the simoom which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are suffocated for fear that i should get some of his good done to mesome of its virus mingled with my blood noin this case i would rather suffer evil the natural way a man is not a good man to me because he will feed me if i should be starving or warm me if i should be freezing or pull me out of a ditch if i should ever fall into one i can find you a newfoundland dog that will do as much philanthropy is not love for ones fellowman in the broadest sense howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and worthy man in his way and has his reward but comparatively speaking what are a hundred howards to us if their philanthropy do not help us in our best estate when we are most worthy to be helped i never heard of a philanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good to me or the like of me  the jesuits were quite balked by those indians who being burned at the stake suggested new modes of torture to their tormentors being superior to physical suffering it sometimes chanced that they were superior to any consolation which the missionaries could offer and the law to do as you would be done by fell with less persuasiveness on the ears of those who for their part did not care how they were done by who loved their enemies after a new fashion and came very near freely forgiving them all they did  be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need though it be your example which leaves them far behind if you give money spend yourself with it and do not merely abandon it to them we make curious mistakes sometimes often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and gross it is partly his taste and not merely his misfortune if you give him money he will perhaps buy more rags with it i was wont to pity the clumsy irish laborers who cut ice on the pond in such mean and ragged clothes while i shivered in my more tidy and somewhat more fashionable garments till one bitter cold day one who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm him and i saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings ere he got down to the skin though they were dirty and ragged enough it is true and that he could afford to refuse the extra garments which i offered him he had so many intra ones this ducking was the very thing he needed then i began to pity myself and i saw that it would be a greater charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slopshop on him there are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on the needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he strives in vain to relieve it is the pious slavebreeder devoting the proceeds of every tenth slave to buy a sundays liberty for the rest some show their kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens would they not be kinder if they employed themselves there you boast of spending a tenth part of your income in charity maybe you should spend the nine tenths so and done with it society recovers only a tenth part of the property then is this owing to the generosity of him in whose possession it is found or to the remissness of the officers of justice  philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind nay it is greatly overrated and it is our selfishness which overrates it a robust poor man one sunny day here in concord praised a fellowtownsman to me because as he said he was kind to the poor meaning himself the kind uncles and aunts of the race are more esteemed than its true spiritual fathers and mothers i once heard a reverend lecturer on england a man of learning and intelligence after enumerating her scientific literary and political worthies shakespeare bacon cromwell milton newton and others speak next of her christian heroes whom as if his profession required it of him he elevated to a place far above all the rest as the greatest of the great they were penn howard and mrs fry every one must feel the falsehood and cant of this the last were not englands best men and women only perhaps her best philanthropists  i would not subtract anything from the praise that is due to philanthropy but merely demand justice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to mankind i do not value chiefly a mans uprightness and benevolence which are as it were his stem and leaves those plants of whose greenness withered we make herb tea for the sick serve but a humble use and are most employed by quacks i want the flower and fruit of a man that some fragrance be wafted over from him to me and some ripeness flavor our intercourse his goodness must not be a partial and transitory act but a constant superfluity which costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious this is a charity that hides a multitude of sins the philanthropist too often surrounds mankind with the remembrance of his own castoff griefs as an atmosphere and calls it sympathy we should impart our courage and not our despair our health and ease and not our disease and take care that this does not spread by contagion from what southern plains comes up the voice of wailing under what latitudes reside the heathen to whom we would send light who is that intemperate and brutal man whom we would redeem if anything ail a man so that he does not perform his functions if he have a pain in his bowels evenfor that is the seat of sympathyhe forthwith sets about reformingthe world being a microcosm himself he discoversand it is a true discovery and he is the man to make itthat the world has been eating green apples to his eyes in fact the globe itself is a great green apple which there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will nibble before it is ripe and straightway his drastic philanthropy seeks out the esquimau and the patagonian and embraces the populous indian and chinese villages and thus by a few years of philanthropic activity the powers in the meanwhile using him for their own ends no doubt he cures himself of his dyspepsia the globe acquires a faint blush on one or both of its cheeks as if it were beginning to be ripe and life loses its crudity and is once more sweet and wholesome to live i never dreamed of any enormity greater than i have committed i never knew and never shall know a worse man than myself  i believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with his fellows in distress but though he be the holiest son of god is his private ail let this be righted let the spring come to him the morning rise over his couch and he will forsake his generous companions without apology my excuse for not lecturing against the use of tobacco is that i never chewed it that is a penalty which reformed tobaccochewers have to pay though there are things enough i have chewed which i could lecture against if you should ever be betrayed into any of these philanthropies do not let your left hand know what your right hand does for it is not worth knowing rescue the drowning and tie your shoestrings take your time and set about some free labor  our manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints our hymnbooks resound with a melodious cursing of god and enduring him forever one would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the fears than confirmed the hopes of man there is nowhere recorded a simple and irrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life any memorable praise of god all health and success does me good however far off and withdrawn it may appear all disease and failure helps to make me sad and does me evil however much sympathy it may have with me or i with it if then we would indeed restore mankind by truly indian botanic magnetic or natural means let us first be as simple and well as nature ourselves dispel the clouds which hang over our own brows and take up a little life into our pores do not stay to be an overseer of the poor but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world  i read in the gulistan or flower garden of sheik sadi of shiraz that they asked a wise man saying of the many celebrated trees which the most high god has created lofty and umbrageous they call none azad or free excepting the cypress which bears no fruit what mystery is there in this he replied each has its appropriate produce and appointed season during the continuance of which it is fresh and blooming and during their absence dry and withered to neither of which states is the cypress exposed being always flourishing and of this nature are the azads or religious independentsfix not thy heart on that which is transitory for the dijlah or tigris will continue to flow through bagdad after the race of caliphs is extinct if thy hand has plenty be liberal as the date tree but if it affords nothing to give away be an azad or free man like the cypress                          complemental verses                      the pretensions of poverty            thou dost presume too much poor needy wretch           to claim a station in the firmament           because thy humble cottage or thy tub           nurses some lazy or pedantic virtue           in the cheap sunshine or by shady springs           with roots and potherbs where thy right hand           tearing those humane passions from the mind           upon whose stocks fair blooming virtues flourish           degradeth nature and benumbeth sense

enlightened sphere           study to know but what those worthies were                                  t carew     where i lived and what i lived for   at a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of a house i have thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen miles of where i live in imagination i have bought all the farms in succession for all were to be bought and i knew their price i walked over each farmers premises tasted his wild apples discoursed on husbandry with him took his farm at his price at any price mortgaging it to him in my mind even put a higher price on ittook everything but a deed of ittook his word for his deed for i dearly love to talkcultivated it and him too to some extent i trust and withdrew when i had enjoyed it long enough leaving him to carry it on this experience entitled me to be regarded as a sort of realestate broker by my friends wherever i sat there i might live and the landscape radiated from me accordingly what is a house but a sedes a seatbetter if a country seat i discovered many a site for a house not likely to be soon improved which some might have thought too far from the village but to my eyes the village was too far from it well there i might live i said and there i did live for an hour a summer and a winter life saw how i could let the years run off buffet the winter through and see the spring come in the future inhabitants of this region wherever they may place their houses may be sure that they have been anticipated an afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard woodlot and pasture and to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door and whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage and then i let it lie fallow perchance for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone  my imagination carried me so far that i even had the refusal of several farmsthe refusal was all i wantedbut i never got my fingers burned by actual possession the nearest that i came to actual possession was when i bought the hollowell place and had begun to sort my seeds and collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off with but before the owner gave me a deed of it his wifeevery man has such a wifechanged her mind and wished to keep it and he offered me ten dollars to release him now to speak the truth i had but ten cents in the world and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell if i was that man who had ten cents or who had a farm or ten dollars or all together however i let him keep the ten dollars and the farm too for i had carried it far enough or rather to be generous i sold him the farm for just what i gave for it and as he was not a rich man made him a present of ten dollars and still had my ten cents and seeds and materials for a wheelbarrow left i found thus that i had been a rich man without any damage to my poverty but i retained the landscape and i have since annually carried off what it yielded without a wheelbarrow with respect to landscapes                 i am monarch of all i survey                 my right there is none to dispute  i have frequently seen a poet withdraw having enjoyed the most valuable part of a farm while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples only why the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his farm in rhyme the most admirable kind of invisible fence has fairly impounded it milked it skimmed it and got all the cream and left the farmer only the skimmed milk  the real attractions of the hollowell farm to me were its complete retirement being about two miles from the village half a mile from the nearest neighbor and separated from the highway by a broad field its bounding on the river which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the spring though that was nothing to me the gray color and ruinous state of the house and barn and the dilapidated fences which put such an interval between me and the last occupant the hollow and lichencovered apple trees gnawed by rabbits showing what kind of neighbors i should have but above all the recollection i had of it from my earliest voyages up the river when the house was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples through which i heard the housedog bark i was in haste to buy it before the proprietor finished getting out some rocks cutting down the hollow apple trees and grubbing up some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture or in short had made any more of his improvements to enjoy these advantages i was ready to carry it on like atlas to take the world on my shouldersi never heard what compensation he received for thatand do all those things which had no other motive or excuse but that i might pay for it and be unmolested in my possession of it for i knew all the while that it would yield the most abundant crop of the kind i wanted if i could only afford to let it alone but it turned out as i have said  all that i could say then with respect to farming on a large scalei have always cultivated a gardenwas that i had had my seeds ready many think that seeds improve with age i have no doubt that time discriminates between the good and the bad and when at last i shall plant i shall be less likely to be disappointed but i would say to my fellows once for all as long as possible live free and uncommitted it makes but little difference whether you are committed to a farm or the county jail  old cato whose de re rusticâ is my cultivator saysand the only translation i have seen makes sheer nonsense of the passagewhen you think of getting a farm turn it thus in your mind not to buy greedily nor spare your pains to look at it and do not think it enough to go round it once the oftener you go there the more it will please you if it is good i think i shall not buy greedily but go round and round it as long as i live and be buried in it first that it may please me the more at last                                       the present was my next experiment of this kind which i purpose to describe more at length for convenience putting the experience of two years into one as i have said i do not propose to write an ode to dejection but to brag as lustily as chanticleer in the morning standing on his roost if only to wake my neighbors up  when first i took up my abode in the woods that is began to spend my nights as well as days there which by accident was on independence day or the fourth of july 1845 my house was not finished for winter but was merely a defence against the rain without plastering or chimney the walls being of rough weatherstained boards with wide chinks which made it cool at night the upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it a clean and airy look especially in the morning when its timbers were saturated with dew so that i fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude from them to my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of this auroral character reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which i had visited a year before this was an airy and unplastered cabin fit to entertain a travelling god and where a goddess might trail her garments the winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of mountains bearing the broken strains or celestial parts only of terrestrial music the morning wind forever blows the poem of creation is uninterrupted but few are the ears that hear it olympus is but the outside of the earth everywhere  the only house i had been the owner of before if i except a boat was a tent which i used occasionally when making excursions in the summer and this is still rolled up in my garret but the boat after passing from hand to hand has gone down the stream of time with this more substantial shelter about me i had made some progress toward settling in the world this frame so slightly clad was a sort of crystallization around me and reacted on the builder it was suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines i did not need to go outdoors to take the air for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness it was not so much within doors as behind a door where i sat even in the rainiest weather the harivansa says an abode without birds is like a meat without seasoning such was not my abode for i found myself suddenly neighbor to the birds not by having imprisoned one but having caged myself near them i was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the garden and the orchard but to those smaller and more thrilling songsters of the forest which never or rarely serenade a villagerthe wood thrush the veery the scarlet tanager the field sparrow the whippoorwill and many others  i was seated by the shore of a small pond about a mile and a half south of the village of concord and somewhat higher than it in the midst of an extensive wood between that town and lincoln and about two miles south of that our only field known to fame concord battle ground but i was so low in the woods that the opposite shore half a mile off like the rest covered with wood was my most distant horizon for the first week whenever i looked out on the pond it impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain its bottom far above the surface of other lakes and as the sun arose i saw it throwing off its nightly clothing of mist and here and there by degrees its soft ripples or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed while the mists like ghosts were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods as at the breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle the very dew seemed to hang upon the trees later into the day than usual as on the sides of mountains  this small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle rainstorm in august when both air and water being perfectly still but the sky overcast midafternoon had all the serenity of evening and the wood thrush sang around and was heard from shore to shore a lake like this is never smoother than at such a time and the clear portion of the air above it being shallow and darkened by clouds the water full of light and reflections becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important from a hilltop near by where the wood had been recently cut off there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley but stream there was none that way i looked between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon tinged with blue indeed by standing on tiptoe i could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest those trueblue coins from heavens own mint and also of some portion of the village but in other directions even from this point i could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me it is well to have some water in your neighborhood to give buoyancy to and float the earth one value even of the smallest well is that when you look into it you see that earth is not continent but insular this is as important as that it keeps butter cool when i looked across the pond from this peak toward the sudbury meadows which in time of flood i distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley like a coin in a basin all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water and i was reminded that this on which i dwelt was but dry land  though the view from my door was still more contracted i did not feel crowded or confined in the least there was pasture enough for my imagination the low shrub oak plateau to which the opposite shore arose stretched away toward the prairies of the west and the steppes of tartary affording ample room for all the roving families of men there are none happy in the world but beings who enjoy freely a vast horizonsaid damodara when his herds required new and larger pastures  both place and time were changed and i dwelt nearer to those parts of the universe and to those eras in history which had most attracted me where i lived was as far off as many a region viewed nightly by astronomers we are wont to imagine rare and delectable places in some remote and more celestial corner of the system behind the constellation of cassiopeias chair far from noise and disturbance i discovered that my house actually had its site in such a withdrawn but forever new and unprofaned part of the universe if it were worth the while to settle in those parts near to the pleiades or the hyades to aldebaran or altair then i was really there or at an equal remoteness from the life which i had left behind dwindled and twinkling with as fine a ray to my nearest neighbor and to be seen only in moonless nights by him such was that part of creation where i had squatted                there was a shepherd that did live                   and held his thoughts as high                as were the mounts whereon his flocks                   did hourly feed him by  what should we think of the shepherds life if his flocks always wandered to higher pastures than his thoughts  every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity and i may say innocence with nature herself i have been as sincere a worshipper of aurora as the greeks i got up early and bathed in the pond that was a religious exercise and one of the best things which i did they say that characters were engraven on the bathing tub of king tchingthang to this effect renew thyself completely each day do it again and again and forever again i can understand that morning brings back the heroic ages i was as much affected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible and unimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn when i was sitting with door and windows open as i could be by any trumpet that ever sang of fame it was homers requiem itself an iliad and odyssey in the air singing its own wrath and wanderings there was something cosmical about it a standing advertisement till forbidden of the everlasting vigor and fertility of the world the morning which is the most memorable season of the day is the awakening hour then there is least somnolence in us and for an hour at least some part of us awakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night little is to be expected of that day if it can be called a day to which we are not awakened by our genius but by the mechanical nudgings of some servitor are not awakened by our own newly acquired force and aspirations from within accompanied by the undulations of celestial music instead of factory bells and a fragrance filling the airto a higher life than we fell asleep from and thus the darkness bear its fruit and prove itself to be good no less than the light that man who does not believe that each day contains an earlier more sacred and auroral hour than he has yet profaned has despaired of life and is pursuing a descending and darkening way after a partial cessation of his sensuous life the soul of man or its organs rather are reinvigorated each day and his genius tries again what noble life it can make all memorable events i should say transpire in morning time and in a morning atmosphere the vedas say all intelligences awake with the morning poetry and art and the fairest and most memorable of the actions of men date from such an hour all poets and heroes like memnon are the children of aurora and emit their music at sunrise to him whose elastic and vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun the day is a perpetual morning it matters not what the clocks say or the attitudes and labors of men morning is when i am awake and there is a dawn in me moral reform is the effort to throw off sleep why is it that men give so poor an account of their day if they have not been slumbering they are not such poor calculators if they had not been overcome with drowsiness they would have performed something the millions are awake enough for physical labor but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life to be awake is to be alive i have never yet met a man who was quite awake how could i have looked him in the face  we must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake not by mechanical aids but by an infinite expectation of the dawn which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep i know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor it is something to be able to paint a particular picture or to carve a statue and so to make a few objects beautiful but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look which morally we can do to affect the quality of the day that is the highest of arts every man is tasked to make his life even in its details worthy of the contemplation of his most elevated and critical hour if we refused or rather used up such paltry information as we get the oracles would distinctly inform us how this might be done  i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion for most men it appears to me are in a strange uncertainty about it whether it is of the devil or of god and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify god and enjoy him forever  still we live meanly like ants though the fable tells us that we were long ago changed into men like pygmies we fight with cranes it is error upon error and clout upon clout and our best virtue has for its occasion a superfluous and evitable wretchedness our life is frittered away by detail an honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers or in extreme cases he may add his ten toes and lump the rest simplicity simplicity simplicity i say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand instead of a million count half a dozen and keep your accounts on your thumbnail in the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life such are the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousandandone items to be allowed for that a man has to live if he would not founder and go to the bottom and not make his port at all by dead reckoning and he must be a great calculator indeed who succeeds simplify simplify instead of three meals a day if it be necessary eat but one instead of a hundred dishes five and reduce other things in proportion our life is like a german confederacy made up of petty states with its boundary forever fluctuating so that even a german cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment the nation itself with all its socalled internal improvements which by the way are all external and superficial is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment cluttered with furniture and tripped up by its own traps ruined by luxury and heedless expense by want of calculation and a worthy aim as the million households in the land and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy a stern and more than spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose it lives too fast men think that it is essential that the nation have commerce and export ice and talk through a telegraph and ride thirty miles an hour without a doubt whether they do or not but whether we should live like baboons or like men is a little uncertain if we do not get out sleepers and forge rails and devote days and nights to the work but go to tinkering upon our lives to improve them who will build railroads and if railroads are not built how shall we get to heaven in season but if we stay at home and mind our business who will want railroads we do not ride on the railroad it rides upon us did you ever think what those sleepers are that underlie the railroad each one is a man an irishman or a yankee man the rails are laid on them and they are covered with sand and the cars run smoothly over them they are sound sleepers i assure you and every few years a new lot is laid down and run over so that if some have the pleasure of riding on a rail others have the misfortune to be ridden upon and when they run over a man that is walking in his sleep a supernumerary sleeper in the wrong position and wake him up they suddenly stop the cars and make a hue and cry about it as if this were an exception i am glad to know that it takes a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their beds as it is for this is a sign that they may sometime get up again  why should we live with such hurry and waste of life we are determined to be starved before we are hungry men say that a stitch in time saves nine and so they take a thousand stitches today to save nine tomorrow as for work we havent any of any consequence we have the saint vitus dance and cannot possibly keep our heads still if i should only give a few pulls at the parish bellrope as for a fire that is without setting the bell there is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of concord notwithstanding that press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning nor a boy nor a woman i might almost say but would forsake all and follow that sound not mainly to save property from the flames but if we will confess the truth much more to see it burn since burn it must and we be it known did not set it on fireor to see it put out and have a hand in it if that is done as handsomely yes even if it were the parish church itself hardly a man takes a halfhours nap after dinner but when he wakes he holds up his head and asks whats the news as if the rest of mankind had stood his sentinels some give directions to be waked every halfhour doubtless for no other purpose and then to pay for it they tell what they have dreamed after a nights sleep the news is as indispensable as the breakfast pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globeand he reads it over his coffee and rolls that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the wachito river never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed mammoth cave of this world and has but the rudiment of an eye himself  for my part i could easily do without the postoffice i think that there are very few important communications made through it to speak critically i never received more than one or two letters in my lifei wrote this some years agothat were worth the postage the pennypost is commonly an institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts which is so often safely offered in jest and i am sure that i never read any memorable news in a newspaper if we read of one man robbed or murdered or killed by accident or one house burned or one vessel wrecked or one steamboat blown up or one cow run over on the western railroad or one mad dog killed or one lot of grasshoppers in the winterwe never need read of another one is enough if you are acquainted with the principle what do you care for a myriad instances and applications to a philosopher all news as it is called is gossip and they who edit and read it are old women over their tea yet not a few are greedy after this gossip there was such a rush as i hear the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the last arrival that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the establishment were broken by the pressurenews which i seriously think a ready wit might write a twelvemonth or twelve years beforehand with sufficient accuracy as for spain for instance if you know how to throw in don carlos and the infanta and don pedro and seville and granada from time to time in the right proportionsthey may have changed the names a little since i saw the papersand serve up a bullfight when other entertainments fail it will be true to the letter and give us as good an idea of the exact state or ruin of things in spain as the most succinct and lucid reports under this head in the newspapers and as for england almost the last significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649 and if you have learned the history of her crops for an average year you never need attend to that thing again unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary character if one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers nothing new does ever happen in foreign parts a french revolution not excepted  what news how much more important to know what that is which was never old kieouheyu great dignitary of the state of wei sent a man to khoungtseu to know his news khoungtseu caused the messenger to be seated near him and questioned him in these terms what is your master doing the messenger answered with respect my master desires to diminish the number of his faults but he cannot come to the end of them the messenger being gone the philosopher remarked what a worthy messenger what a worthy messenger the preacher instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on their day of rest at the end of the weekfor sunday is the fit conclusion of an illspent week and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new onewith this one other draggletail of a sermon should shout with thundering voice pause avast why so seeming fast but deadly slow  shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths while reality is fabulous if men would steadily observe realities only and not allow themselves to be deluded life to compare it with such things as we know would be like a fairy tale and the arabian nights entertainments if we respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be music and poetry would resound along the streets when we are unhurried and wise we perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality this is always exhilarating and sublime by closing the eyes and slumbering and consenting to be deceived by shows men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit everywhere which still is built on purely illusory foundations children who play life discern its true law and relations more clearly than men who fail to live it worthily but who think that they are wiser by experience that is by failure i have read in a hindoo book that there was a kings son who being expelled in infancy from his native city was brought up by a forester and growing up to maturity in that state imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived one of his fathers ministers having discovered him revealed to him what he was and the misconception of his character was removed and he knew himself to be a prince so soul continues the hindoo philosopher from the circumstances in which it is placed mistakes its own character until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher and then it knows itself to be brahme i perceive that we inhabitants of new england live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things we think that that is which appears to be if a man should walk through this town and see only the reality where think you would the milldam go to if he should give us an account of the realities he beheld there we should not recognize the place in his description look at a meetinghouse or a courthouse or a jail or a shop or a dwellinghouse and say what that thing really is before a true gaze and they would all go to pieces in your account of them men esteem truth remote in the outskirts of the system behind the farthest star before adam and after the last man in eternity there is indeed something true and sublime but all these times and places and occasions are now and here god himself culminates in the present moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the ages and we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us the universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions whether we travel fast or slow the track is laid for us let us spend our lives in conceiving then the poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it  let us spend one day as deliberately as nature and not be thrown off the track by every nutshell and mosquitos wing that falls on the rails let us rise early and fast or break fast gently and without perturbation let company come and let company go let the bells ring and the children crydetermined to make a day of it why should we knock under and go with the stream let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and whirlpool called a dinner situated in the meridian shallows weather this danger and you are safe for the rest of the way is down hill with unrelaxed nerves with morning vigor sail by it looking another way tied to the mast like ulysses if the engine whistles let it whistle till it is hoarse for its pains if the bell rings why should we run we will consider what kind of music they are like let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and delusion and appearance that alluvion which covers the globe through paris and london through new york and boston and concord through church and state through poetry and philosophy and religion till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place which we can call reality and say this is and no mistake and then begin having a point dappui below freshet and frost and fire a place where you might found a wall or a state or set a lamppost safely or perhaps a gauge not a nilometer but a realometer that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had gathered from time to time if you stand right fronting and face to face to a fact you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces as if it were a cimeter and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow and so you will happily conclude your mortal career be it life or death we crave only reality if we are really dying let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities if we are alive let us go about our business  time is but the stream i go afishing in i drink at it but while i drink i see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is its thin current slides away but eternity remains i would drink deeper fish in the sky whose bottom is pebbly with stars i cannot count one i know not the first letter of the alphabet i have always been regretting that i was not as wise as the day i was born the intellect is a cleaver it discerns and rifts its way into the secret of things i do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary my head is hands and feet i feel all my best faculties concentrated in it my instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing as some creatures use their snout and fore paws and with it i would mine and burrow my way through these hills i think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts so by the diviningrod and thin rising vapors i judge and here i will begin to mine     reading   with a little more deliberation in the choice of their pursuits all men would perhaps become essentially students and observers for certainly their nature and destiny are interesting to all alike in accumulating property for ourselves or our posterity in founding a family or a state or acquiring fame even we are mortal but in dealing with truth we are immortal and need fear no change nor accident the oldest egyptian or hindoo philosopher raised a corner of the veil from the statue of the divinity and still the trembling robe remains raised and i gaze upon as fresh a glory as he did since it was i in him that was then so bold and it is he in me that now reviews the vision no dust has settled on that robe no time has elapsed since that divinity was revealed that time which we really improve or which is improvable is neither past present nor future  my residence was more favorable not only to thought but to serious reading than a university and though i was beyond the range of the ordinary circulating library i had more than ever come within the influence of those books which circulate round the world whose sentences were first written on bark and are now merely copied from time to time on to linen paper says the poet mîr camar uddîn mast being seated to run through the region of the spiritual world i have had this advantage in books to be intoxicated by a single glass of wine i have experienced this pleasure when i have drunk the liquor of the esoteric doctrines i kept homers iliad on my table through the summer though i looked at his page only now and then incessant labor with my hands at first for i had my house to finish and my beans to hoe at the same time made more study impossible yet i sustained myself by the prospect of such reading in future i read one or two shallow books of travel in the intervals of my work till that employment made me ashamed of myself and i asked where it was then that i lived  the student may read homer or Æschylus in the greek without danger of dissipation or luxuriousness for it implies that he in some measure emulate their heroes and consecrate morning hours to their pages the heroic books even if printed in the character of our mother tongue will always be in a language dead to degenerate times and we must laboriously seek the meaning of each word and line conjecturing a larger sense than common use permits out of what wisdom and valor and generosity we have the modern cheap and fertile press with all its translations has done little to bring us nearer to the heroic writers of antiquity they seem as solitary and the letter in which they are printed as rare and curious as ever it is worth the expense of youthful days and costly hours if you learn only some words of an ancient language which are raised out of the trivialness of the street to be perpetual suggestions and provocations it is not in vain that the farmer remembers and repeats the few latin words which he has heard men sometimes speak as if the study of the classics would at length make way for more modern and practical studies but the adventurous student will always study classics in whatever language they may be written and however ancient they may be for what are the classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man they are the only oracles which are not decayed and there are such answers to the most modern inquiry in them as delphi and dodona never gave we might as well omit to study nature because she is old to read well that is to read true books in a true spirit is a noble exercise and one that will task the reader more than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem it requires a training such as the athletes underwent the steady intention almost of the whole life to this object books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written it is not enough even to be able to speak the language of that nation by which they are written for there is a memorable interval between the spoken and the written language the language heard and the language read the one is commonly transitory a sound a tongue a dialect merely almost brutish and we learn it unconsciously like the brutes of our mothers the other is the maturity and experience of that if that is our mother tongue this is our father tongue a reserved and select expression too significant to be heard by the ear which we must be born again in order to speak the crowds of men who merely spoke the greek and latin tongues in the middle ages were not entitled by the accident of birth to read the works of genius written in those languages for these were not written in that greek or latin which they knew but in the select language of literature they had not learned the nobler dialects of greece and rome but the very materials on which they were written were waste paper to them and they prized instead a cheap contemporary literature but when the several nations of europe had acquired distinct though rude written languages of their own sufficient for the purposes of their rising literatures then first learning revived and scholars were enabled to discern from that remoteness the treasures of antiquity what the roman and grecian multitude could not hear after the lapse of ages a few scholars read and a few scholars only are still reading it  however much we may admire the orators occasional bursts of eloquence the noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above the fleeting spoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind the clouds there are the stars and they who can may read them the astronomers forever comment on and observe them they are not exhalations like our daily colloquies and vaporous breath what is called eloquence in the forum is commonly found to be rhetoric in the study the orator yields to the inspiration of a transient occasion and speaks to the mob before him to those who can hear him but the writer whose more equable life is his occasion and who would be distracted by the event and the crowd which inspire the orator speaks to the intellect and health of mankind to all in any age who can understand him  no wonder that alexander carried the iliad with him on his expeditions in a precious casket a written word is the choicest of relics it is something at once more intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art it is the work of art nearest to life itself it may be translated into every language and not only be read but actually breathed from all human lipsnot be represented on canvas or in marble only but be carved out of the breath of life itself the symbol of an ancient mans thought becomes a modern mans speech two thousand summers have imparted to the monuments of grecian literature as to her marbles only a maturer golden and autumnal tint for they have carried their own serene and celestial atmosphere into all lands to protect them against the corrosion of time books are the treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and nations books the oldest and the best stand naturally and rightfully on the shelves of every cottage they have no cause of their own to plead but while they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society and more than kings or emperors exert an influence on mankind when the illiterate and perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and industry his coveted leisure and independence and is admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion he turns inevitably at last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles of intellect and genius and is sensible only of the imperfection of his culture and the vanity and insufficiency of all his riches and further proves his good sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children that intellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels and thus it is that he becomes the founder of a family  those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in which they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the history of the human race for it is remarkable that no transcript of them has ever been made into any modern tongue unless our civilization itself may be regarded as such a transcript homer has never yet been printed in english nor Æschylus nor virgil evenworks as refined as solidly done and as beautiful almost as the morning itself for later writers say what we will of their genius have rarely if ever equalled the elaborate beauty and finish and the lifelong and heroic literary labors of the ancients they only talk of forgetting them who never knew them it will be soon enough to forget them when we have the learning and the genius which will enable us to attend to and appreciate them that age will be rich indeed when those relics which we call classics and the still older and more than classic but even less known scriptures of the nations shall have still further accumulated when the vaticans shall be filled with vedas and zendavestas and bibles with homers and dantes and shakespeares and all the centuries to come shall have successively deposited their trophies in the forum of the world by such a pile we may hope to scale heaven at last  the works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind for only great poets can read them they have only been read as the multitude read the stars at most astrologically not astronomically most men have learned to read to serve a paltry convenience as they have learned to cipher in order to keep accounts and not be cheated in trade but of reading as a noble intellectual exercise they know little or nothing yet this only is reading in a high sense not that which lulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler faculties to sleep the while but what we have to stand on tiptoe to read and devote our most alert and wakeful hours to  i think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is in literature and not be forever repeating our ababs and words of one syllable in the fourth or fifth classes sitting on the lowest and foremost form all our lives most men are satisfied if they read or hear read and perchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good book the bible and for the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate their faculties in what is called easy reading there is a work in several volumes in our circulating library entitled little reading which i thought referred to a town of that name which i had not been to there are those who like cormorants and ostriches can digest all sorts of this even after the fullest dinner of meats and vegetables for they suffer nothing to be wasted if others are the machines to provide this provender they are the machines to read it they read the nine thousandth tale about zebulon and sophronia and how they loved as none had ever loved before and neither did the course of their true love run smoothat any rate how it did run and stumble and get up again and go on how some poor unfortunate got up on to a steeple who had better never have gone up as far as the belfry and then having needlessly got him up there the happy novelist rings the bell for all the world to come together and hear o dear how he did get down again for my part i think that they had better metamorphose all such aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man weathercocks as they used to put heroes among the constellations and let them swing round there till they are rusty and not come down at all to bother honest men with their pranks the next time the novelist rings the bell i will not stir though the meetinghouse burn down the skip of the tiptoehop a romance of the middle ages by the celebrated author of tittletoltan to appear in monthly parts a great rush dont all come together all this they read with saucer eyes and erect and primitive curiosity and with unwearied gizzard whose corrugations even yet need no sharpening just as some little fouryearold bencher his twocent giltcovered edition of cinderellawithout any improvement that i can see in the pronunciation or accent or emphasis or any more skill in extracting or inserting the moral the result is dulness of sight a stagnation of the vital circulations and a general deliquium and sloughing off of all the intellectual faculties this sort of gingerbread is baked daily and more sedulously than pure wheat or ryeandindian in almost every oven and finds a surer market  the best books are not read even by those who are called good readers what does our concord culture amount to there is in this town with a very few exceptions no taste for the best or for very good books even in english literature whose words all can read and spell even the collegebred and socalled liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little or no acquaintance with the english classics and as for the recorded wisdom of mankind the ancient classics and bibles which are accessible to all who will know of them there are the feeblest efforts anywhere made to become acquainted with them i know a woodchopper of middle age who takes a french paper not for news as he says for he is above that but to keep himself in practice he being a canadian by birth and when i ask him what he considers the best thing he can do in this world he says beside this to keep up and add to his english this is about as much as the collegebred generally do or aspire to do and they take an english paper for the purpose one who has just come from reading perhaps one of the best english books will find how many with whom he can converse about it or suppose he comes from reading a greek or latin classic in the original whose praises are familiar even to the socalled illiterate he will find nobody at all to speak to but must keep silence about it indeed there is hardly the professor in our colleges who if he has mastered the difficulties of the language has proportionally mastered the difficulties of the wit and poetry of a greek poet and has any sympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader and as for the sacred scriptures or bibles of mankind who in this town can tell me even their titles most men do not know that any nation but the hebrews have had a scripture a man any man will go considerably out of his way to pick up a silver dollar but here are golden words which the wisest men of antiquity have uttered and whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us ofand yet we learn to read only as far as easy reading the primers and classbooks and when we leave school the little reading and storybooks which are for boys and beginners and our reading our conversation and thinking are all on a very low level worthy only of pygmies and manikins  i aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our concord soil has produced whose names are hardly known here or shall i hear the name of plato and never read his book as if plato were my townsman and i never saw himmy next neighbor and i never heard him speak or attended to the wisdom of his words but how actually is it his dialogues which contain what was immortal in him lie on the next shelf and yet i never read them we are underbred and lowlived and illiterate and in this respect i confess i do not make any very broad distinction between the illiterateness of my townsman who cannot read at all and the illiterateness of him who has learned to read only what is for children and feeble intellects we should be as good as the worthies of antiquity but partly by first knowing how good they were we are a race of titmen and soar but little higher in our intellectual flights than the columns of the daily paper  it is not all books that are as dull as their readers there are probably words addressed to our condition exactly which if we could really hear and understand would be more salutary than the morning or the spring to our lives and possibly put a new aspect on the face of things for us how many a man has dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book the book exists for us perchance which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones the at present unutterable things we may find somewhere uttered these same questions that disturb and puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise men not one has been omitted and each has answered them according to his ability by his words and his life moreover with wisdom we shall learn liberality the solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of concord who has had his second birth and peculiar religious experience and is driven as he believes into the silent gravity and exclusiveness by his faith may think it is not true but zoroaster thousands of years ago travelled the same road and had the same experience but he being wise knew it to be universal and treated his neighbors accordingly and is even said to have invented and established worship among men let him humbly commune with zoroaster then and through the liberalizing influence of all the worthies with jesus christ himself and let our church go by the board  we boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making the most rapid strides of any nation but consider how little this village does for its own culture i do not wish to flatter my townsmen nor to be flattered by them for that will not advance either of us we need to be provokedgoaded like oxen as we are into a trot we have a comparatively decent system of common schools schools for infants only but excepting the halfstarved lyceum in the winter and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the state no school for ourselves we spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or ailment than on our mental aliment it is time that we had uncommon schools that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women it is time that villages were universities and their elder inhabitants the fellows of universities with leisureif they are indeed so well offto pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives shall the world be confined to one paris or one oxford forever cannot students be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of concord can we not hire some abelard to lecture to us alas what with foddering the cattle and tending the store we are kept from school too long and our education is sadly neglected in this country the village should in some respects take the place of the nobleman of europe it should be the patron of the fine arts it is rich enough it wants only the magnanimity and refinement it can spend money enough on such things as farmers and traders value but it is thought utopian to propose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be of far more worth this town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a townhouse thank fortune or politics but probably it will not spend so much on living wit the true meat to put into that shell in a hundred years the one hundred and twentyfive dollars annually subscribed for a lyceum in the winter is better spent than any other equal sum raised in the town if we live in the nineteenth century why should we not enjoy the advantages which the nineteenth century offers why should our life be in any respect provincial if we will read newspapers why not skip the gossip of boston and take the best newspaper in the world at oncenot be sucking the pap of neutral family papers or browsing olive branches here in new england let the reports of all the learned societies come to us and we will see if they know anything why should we leave it to harper  brothers and redding  co to select our reading as the nobleman of cultivated taste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his culturegeniuslearningwitbooks paintingsstatuarymusicphilosophical instruments and the like so let the village donot stop short at a pedagogue a parson a sexton a parish library and three selectmen because our pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with these to act collectively is according to the spirit of our institutions and i am confident that as our circumstances are more flourishing our means are greater than the noblemans new england can hire all the wise men in the world to come and teach her and board them round the while and not be provincial at all that is the uncommon school we want instead of noblemen let us have noble villages of men if it is necessary omit one bridge over the river go round a little there and throw one arch at least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us     sounds   but while we are confined to books though the most select and classic and read only particular written languages which are themselves but dialects and provincial we are in danger of forgetting the language which all things and events speak without metaphor which alone is copious and standard much is published but little printed the rays which stream through the shutter will be no longer remembered when the shutter is wholly removed no method nor discipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert what is a course of history or philosophy or poetry no matter how well selected or the best society or the most admirable routine of life compared with the discipline of looking always at what is to be seen will you be a reader a student merely or a seer read your fate see what is before you and walk on into futurity  i did not read books the first summer i hoed beans nay i often did better than this there were times when i could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of the present moment to any work whether of the head or hands i love a broad margin to my life sometimes in a summer morning having taken my accustomed bath i sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon rapt in a revery amidst the pines and hickories and sumachs in undisturbed solitude and stillness while the birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house until by the sun falling in at my west window or the noise of some travellers wagon on the distant highway i was reminded of the lapse of time i grew in those seasons like corn in the night and they were far better than any work of the hands would have been they were not time subtracted from my life but so much over and above my usual allowance i realized what the orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of works for the most part i minded not how the hours went the day advanced as if to light some work of mine it was morning and lo now it is evening and nothing memorable is accomplished instead of singing like the birds i silently smiled at my incessant good fortune as the sparrow had its trill sitting on the hickory before my door so had i my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might hear out of my nest my days were not days of the week bearing the stamp of any heathen deity nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a clock for i lived like the puri indians of whom it is said that for yesterday today and tomorrow they have only one word and they express the variety of meaning by pointing backward for yesterday forward for tomorrow and overhead for the passing day this was sheer idleness to my fellowtownsmen no doubt but if the birds and flowers had tried me by their standard i should not have been found wanting a man must find his occasions in himself it is true the natural day is very calm and will hardly reprove his indolence  i had this advantage at least in my mode of life over those who were obliged to look abroad for amusement to society and the theatre that my life itself was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel it was a drama of many scenes and without an end if we were always indeed getting our living and regulating our lives according to the last and best mode we had learned we should never be troubled with ennui follow your genius closely enough and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour housework was a pleasant pastime when my floor was dirty i rose early and setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass bed and bedstead making but one budget dashed water on the floor and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it and then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white and by the time the villagers had broken their fast the morning sun had dried my house sufficiently to allow me to move in again and my meditations were almost uninterupted it was pleasant to see my whole household effects out on the grass making a little pile like a gypsys pack and my threelegged table from which i did not remove the books and pen and ink standing amid the pines and hickories they seemed glad to get out themselves and as if unwilling to be brought in i was sometimes tempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there it was worth the while to see the sun shine on these things and hear the free wind blow on them so much more interesting most familiar objects look out of doors than in the house a bird sits on the next bough lifeeverlasting grows under the table and blackberry vines run round its legs pine cones chestnut burs and strawberry leaves are strewn about it looked as if this was the way these forms came to be transferred to our furniture to tables chairs and bedsteadsbecause they once stood in their midst  my house was on the side of a hill immediately on the edge of the larger wood in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and hickories and half a dozen rods from the pond to which a narrow footpath led down the hill in my front yard grew the strawberry blackberry and lifeeverlasting johnswort and goldenrod shrub oaks and sand cherry blueberry and groundnut near the end of may the sand cherry cerasus pumila adorned the sides of the path with its delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short stems which last in the fall weighed down with goodsized and handsome cherries fell over in wreaths like rays on every side i tasted them out of compliment to nature though they were scarcely palatable the sumach rhus glabra grew luxuriantly about the house pushing up through the embankment which i had made and growing five or six feet the first season its broad pinnate tropical leaf was pleasant though strange to look on the large buds suddenly pushing out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead developed themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs an inch in diameter and sometimes as i sat at my window so heedlessly did they grow and tax their weak joints i heard a fresh and tender bough suddenly fall like a fan to the ground when there was not a breath of air stirring broken off by its own weight in august the large masses of berries which when in flower had attracted many wild bees gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson hue and by their weight again bent down and broke the tender limbs                                       as i sit at my window this summer afternoon hawks are circling about my clearing the tantivy of wild pigeons flying by two and threes athwart my view or perching restless on the white pine boughs behind my house gives a voice to the air a fish hawk dimples the glassy surface of the pond and brings up a fish a mink steals out of the marsh before my door and seizes a frog by the shore the sedge is bending under the weight of the reedbirds flitting hither and thither and for the last halfhour i have heard the rattle of railroad cars now dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridge conveying travellers from boston to the country for i did not live so out of the world as that boy who as i hear was put out to a farmer in the east part of the town but ere long ran away and came home again quite down at the heel and homesick he had never seen such a dull and outoftheway place the folks were all gone off why you couldnt even hear the whistle i doubt if there is such a place in massachusetts now        in truth our village has become a butt        for one of those fleet railroad shafts and oer        our peaceful plain its soothing sound isconcord  the fitchburg railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south of where i dwell i usually go to the village along its causeway and am as it were related to society by this link the men on the freight trains who go over the whole length of the road bow to me as to an old acquaintance they pass me so often and apparently they take me for an employee and so i am i too would fain be a trackrepairer somewhere in the orbit of the earth  the whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter sounding like the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmers yard informing me that many restless city merchants are arriving within the circle of the town or adventurous country traders from the other side as they come under one horizon they shout their warning to get off the track to the other heard sometimes through the circles of two towns here come your groceries country your rations countrymen nor is there any man so independent on his farm that he can say them nay and heres your pay for them screams the countrymans whistle timber like long batteringrams going twenty miles an hour against the citys walls and chairs enough to seat all the weary and heavyladen that dwell within them with such huge and lumbering civility the country hands a chair to the city all the indian huckleberry hills are stripped all the cranberry meadows are raked into the city up comes the cotton down goes the woven cloth up comes the silk down goes the woollen up come the books but down goes the wit that writes them  when i meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary motionor rather like a comet for the beholder knows not if with that velocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this system since its orbit does not look like a returning curvewith its steam cloud like a banner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths like many a downy cloud which i have seen high in the heavens unfolding its masses to the lightas if this traveling demigod this cloudcompeller would ere long take the sunset sky for the livery of his train when i hear the iron horse make the hills echo with his snort like thunder shaking the earth with his feet and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils what kind of winged horse or fiery dragon they will put into the new mythology i dont know it seems as if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it if all were as it seems and men made the elements their servants for noble ends if the cloud that hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds or as beneficent as that which floats over the farmers fields then the elements and nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their errands and be their escort  i watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that i do the rising of the sun which is hardly more regular their train of clouds stretching far behind and rising higher and higher going to heaven while the cars are going to boston conceals the sun for a minute and casts my distant field into the shade a celestial train beside which the petty train of cars which hugs the earth is but the barb of the spear the stabler of the iron horse was up early this winter morning by the light of the stars amid the mountains to fodder and harness his steed fire too was awakened thus early to put the vital heat in him and get him off if the enterprise were as innocent as it is early if the snow lies deep they strap on his snowshoes and with the giant plow plow a furrow from the mountains to the seaboard in which the cars like a following drillbarrow sprinkle all the restless men and floating merchandise in the country for seed all day the firesteed flies over the country stopping only that his master may rest and i am awakened by his tramp and defiant snort at midnight when in some remote glen in the woods he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow and he will reach his stall only with the morning star to start once more on his travels without rest or slumber or perchance at evening i hear him in his stable blowing off the superfluous energy of the day that he may calm his nerves and cool his liver and brain for a few hours of iron slumber if the enterprise were as heroic and commanding as it is protracted and unwearied  far through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns where once only the hunter penetrated by day in the darkest night dart these bright saloons without the knowledge of their inhabitants this moment stopping at some brilliant stationhouse in town or city where a social crowd is gathered the next in the dismal swamp scaring the owl and fox the startings and arrivals of the cars are now the epochs in the village day they go and come with such regularity and precision and their whistle can be heard so far that the farmers set their clocks by them and thus one wellconducted institution regulates a whole country have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since the railroad was invented do they not talk and think faster in the depot than they did in the stageoffice there is something electrifying in the atmosphere of the former place i have been astonished at the miracles it has wrought that some of my neighbors who i should have prophesied once for all would never get to boston by so prompt a conveyance are on hand when the bell rings to do things railroad fashion is now the byword and it is worth the while to be warned so often and so sincerely by any power to get off its track there is no stopping to read the riot act no firing over the heads of the mob in this case we have constructed a fate an atropos that never turns aside let that be the name of your engine men are advertised that at a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particular points of the compass yet it interferes with no mans business and the children go to school on the other track we live the steadier for it we are all educated thus to be sons of tell the air is full of invisible bolts every path but your own is the path of fate keep on your own track then  what recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery it does not clasp its hands and pray to jupiter i see these men every day go about their business with more or less courage and content doing more even than they suspect and perchance better employed than they could have consciously devised i am less affected by their heroism who stood up for half an hour in the front line at buena vista than by the steady and cheerful valor of the men who inhabit the snowplow for their winter quarters who have not merely the threeoclockinthemorning courage which bonaparte thought was the rarest but whose courage does not go to rest so early who go to sleep only when the storm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen on this morning of the great snow perchance which is still raging and chilling mens blood i bear the muffled tone of their engine bell from out the fog bank of their chilled breath which announces that the cars are coming without long delay notwithstanding the veto of a new england northeast snowstorm and i behold the plowmen covered with snow and rime their heads peering above the mouldboard which is turning down other than daisies and the nests of field mice like bowlders of the sierra nevada that occupy an outside place in the universe  commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene alert adventurous and unwearied it is very natural in its methods withal far more so than many fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments and hence its singular success i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreign parts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and the extent of the globe i feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palmleaf which will cover so many flaxen new england heads the next summer the manilla hemp and cocoanut husks the old junk gunny bags scrap iron and rusty nails this carload of torn sails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be wrought into paper and printed books who can write so graphically the history of the storms they have weathered as these rents have done they are proofsheets which need no correction here goes lumber from the maine woods which did not go out to sea in the last freshet risen four dollars on the thousand because of what did go out or was split up pine spruce cedarfirst second third and fourth qualities so lately all of one quality to wave over the bear and moose and caribou next rolls thomaston lime a prime lot which will get far among the hills before it gets slacked these rags in bales of all hues and qualities the lowest condition to which cotton and linen descend the final result of dressof patterns which are now no longer cried up

a few shades only on which forsooth will be written tales of real life high and low and founded on fact this closed car smells of salt fish the strong new england and commercial scent reminding me of the grand banks and the fisheries who has not seen a salt fish thoroughly cured for this world so that nothing can spoil it and putting the perseverance of the saints to the blush with which you may sweep or pave the streets and split your kindlings and the teamster shelter himself and his lading against sun wind and rain behind itand the trader as a concord trader once did hang it up by his door for a sign when he commences business until at last his oldest customer cannot tell surely whether it be animal vegetable or mineral and yet it shall be as pure as a snowflake and if it be put into a pot and boiled will come out an excellent dunfish for a saturdays dinner next spanish hides with the tails still preserving their twist and the angle of elevation they had when the oxen that wore them were careering over the pampas of the spanish maina type of all obstinacy and evincing how almost hopeless and incurable are all constitutional vices i confess that practically speaking when i have learned a mans real disposition i have no hopes of changing it for the better or worse in this state of existence as the orientals say a curs tail may be warmed and pressed and bound round with ligatures and after a twelve years labor bestowed upon it still it will retain its natural form the only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these tails exhibit is to make glue of them which i believe is what is usually done with them and then they will stay put and stick here is a hogshead of molasses or of brandy directed to john smith cuttingsville vermont some trader among the green mountains who imports for the farmers near his clearing and now perchance stands over his bulkhead and thinks of the last arrivals on the coast how they may affect the price for him telling his customers this moment as he has told them twenty times before this morning that he expects some by the next train of prime quality it is advertised in the cuttingsville times  while these things go up other things come down warned by the whizzing sound i look up from my book and see some tall pine hewn on far northern hills which has winged its way over the green mountains and the connecticut shot like an arrow through the township within ten minutes and scarce another eye beholds it going                            to be the mast                  of some great ammiral  and hark here comes the cattletrain bearing the cattle of a thousand hills sheepcots stables and cowyards in the air drovers with their sticks and shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks all but the mountain pastures whirled along like leaves blown from the mountains by the september gales the air is filled with the bleating of calves and sheep and the hustling of oxen as if a pastoral valley were going by when the old bellwether at the head rattles his bell the mountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills like lambs a carload of drovers too in the midst on a level with their droves now their vocation gone but still clinging to their useless sticks as their badge of office but their dogs where are they it is a stampede to them they are quite thrown out they have lost the scent methinks i hear them barking behind the peterboro hills or panting up the western slope of the green mountains they will not be in at the death their vocation too is gone their fidelity and sagacity are below par now they will slink back to their kennels in disgrace or perchance run wild and strike a league with the wolf and the fox so is your pastoral life whirled past and away but the bell rings and i must get off the track and let the cars go by                    whats the railroad to me                   i never go to see                   where it ends                   it fills a few hollows                   and makes banks for the swallows                   it sets the sand ablowing                   and the blackberries agrowing  but i cross it like a cartpath in the woods i will not have my eyes put out and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing                                       now that the cars are gone by and all the restless world with them and the fishes in the pond no longer feel their rumbling i am more alone than ever for the rest of the long afternoon perhaps my meditations are interrupted only by the faint rattle of a carriage or team along the distant highway  sometimes on sundays i heard the bells the lincoln acton bedford or concord bell when the wind was favorable a faint sweet and as it were natural melody worth importing into the wilderness at a sufficient distance over the woods this sound acquires a certain vibratory hum as if the pine needles in the horizon were the strings of a harp which it swept all sound heard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect a vibration of the universal lyre just as the intervening atmosphere makes a distant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to it there came to me in this case a melody which the air had strained and which had conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood that portion of the sound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from vale to vale the echo is to some extent an original sound and therein is the magic and charm of it it is not merely a repetition of what was worth repeating in the bell but partly the voice of the wood the same trivial words and notes sung by a woodnymph  at evening the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the woods sounded sweet and melodious and at first i would mistake it for the voices of certain minstrels by whom i was sometimes serenaded who might be straying over hill and dale but soon i was not unpleasantly disappointed when it was prolonged into the cheap and natural music of the cow i do not mean to be satirical but to express my appreciation of those youths singing when i state that i perceived clearly that it was akin to the music of the cow and they were at length one articulation of nature  regularly at halfpast seven in one part of the summer after the evening train had gone by the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for half an hour sitting on a stump by my door or upon the ridgepole of the house they would begin to sing almost with as much precision as a clock within five minutes of a particular time referred to the setting of the sun every evening i had a rare opportunity to become acquainted with their habits sometimes i heard four or five at once in different parts of the wood by accident one a bar behind another and so near me that i distinguished not only the cluck after each note but often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spiders web only proportionally louder sometimes one would circle round and round me in the woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string when probably i was near its eggs they sang at intervals throughout the night and were again as musical as ever just before and about dawn  when other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain like mourning women their ancient ululu their dismal scream is truly ben jonsonian wise midnight hags it is no honest and blunt tuwhit tuwho of the poets but without jesting a most solemn graveyard ditty the mutual consolations of suicide lovers remembering the pangs and the delights of supernal love in the infernal groves yet i love to hear their wailing their doleful responses trilled along the woodside reminding me sometimes of music and singing birds as if it were the dark and tearful side of music the regrets and sighs that would fain be sung they are the spirits the low spirits and melancholy forebodings of fallen souls that once in human shape nightwalked the earth and did the deeds of darkness now expiating their sins with their wailing hymns or threnodies in the scenery of their transgressions they give me a new sense of the variety and capacity of that nature which is our common dwelling ohoooo that i never had been borrrrn sighs one on this side of the pond and circles with the restlessness of despair to some new perch on the gray oaks thenthat i never had been borrrrn echoes another on the farther side with tremulous sincerity andborrrrn comes faintly from far in the lincoln woods  i was also serenaded by a hooting owl near at hand you could fancy it the most melancholy sound in nature as if she meant by this to stereotype and make permanent in her choir the dying moans of a human beingsome poor weak relic of mortality who has left hope behind and howls like an animal yet with human sobs on entering the dark valley made more awful by a certain gurgling melodiousnessi find myself beginning with the letters gl when i try to imitate itexpressive of a mind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy stage in the mortification of all healthy and courageous thought it reminded me of ghouls and idiots and insane howlings but now one answers from far woods in a strain made really melodious by distancehoo hoo hoo hoorer hoo and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasing associations whether heard by day or night summer or winter  i rejoice that there are owls let them do the idiotic and maniacal hooting for men it is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight woods which no day illustrates suggesting a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not recognized they represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which all have all day the sun has shone on the surface of some savage swamp where the single spruce stands hung with usnea lichens and small hawks circulate above and the chickadee lisps amid the evergreens and the partridge and rabbit skulk beneath but now a more dismal and fitting day dawns and a different race of creatures awakes to express the meaning of nature there  late in the evening i heard the distant rumbling of wagons over bridgesa sound heard farther than almost any other at nightthe baying of dogs and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barnyard in the meanwhile all the shore rang with the trump of bullfrogs the sturdy spirits of ancient winebibbers and wassailers still unrepentant trying to sing a catch in their stygian lakeif the walden nymphs will pardon the comparison for though there are almost no weeds there are frogs therewho would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old festal tables though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave mocking at mirth and the wine has lost its flavor and become only liquor to distend their paunches and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention the most aldermanic with his chin upon a heartleaf which serves for a napkin to his drooling chaps under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once scorned water and passes round the cup with the ejaculation trrroonk trrroonk trrroonk and straightway comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark and when this observance has made the circuit of the shores then ejaculates the master of ceremonies with satisfaction trrroonk and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended leakiest and flabbiest paunched that there be no mistake and then the howl goes round again and again until the sun disperses the morning mist and only the patriarch is not under the pond but vainly bellowing troonk from time to time and pausing for a reply  i am not sure that i ever heard the sound of cockcrowing from my clearing and i thought that it might be worth the while to keep a cockerel for his music merely as a singing bird the note of this once wild indian pheasant is certainly the most remarkable of any birds and if they could be naturalized without being domesticated it would soon become the most famous sound in our woods surpassing the clangor of the goose and the hooting of the owl and then imagine the cackling of the hens to fill the pauses when their lords clarions rested no wonder that man added this bird to his tame stockto say nothing of the eggs and drumsticks to walk in a winter morning in a wood where these birds abounded their native woods and hear the wild cockerels crow on the trees clear and shrill for miles over the resounding earth drowning the feebler notes of other birdsthink of it it would put nations on the alert who would not be early to rise and rise earlier and earlier every successive day of his life till he became unspeakably healthy wealthy and wise this foreign birds note is celebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their native songsters all climates agree with brave chanticleer he is more indigenous even than the natives his health is ever good his lungs are sound his spirits never flag even the sailor on the atlantic and pacific is awakened by his voice but its shrill sound never roused me from my slumbers i kept neither dog cat cow pig nor hens so that you would have said there was a deficiency of domestic sounds neither the churn nor the spinningwheel nor even the singing of the kettle nor the hissing of the urn nor children crying to comfort one an oldfashioned man would have lost his senses or died of ennui before this not even rats in the wall for they were starved out or rather were never baited inonly squirrels on the roof and under the floor a whippoorwill on the ridgepole a blue jay screaming beneath the window a hare or woodchuck under the house a screech owl or a cat owl behind it a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond and a fox to bark in the night not even a lark or an oriole those mild plantation birds ever visited my clearing no cockerels to crow nor hens to cackle in the yard no yard but unfenced nature reaching up to your very sills a young forest growing up under your meadows and wild sumachs and blackberry vines breaking through into your cellar sturdy pitch pines rubbing and creaking against the shingles for want of room their roots reaching quite under the house instead of a scuttle or a blind blown off in the galea pine tree snapped off or torn up by the roots behind your house for fuel instead of no path to the frontyard gate in the great snowno gateno frontyardand no path to the civilized world     solitude   this is a delicious evening when the whole body is one sense and imbibes delight through every pore i go and come with a strange liberty in nature a part of herself as i walk along the stony shore of the pond in my shirtsleeves though it is cool as well as cloudy and windy and i see nothing special to attract me all the elements are unusually congenial to me the bullfrogs trump to usher in the night and the note of the whippoorwill is borne on the rippling wind from over the water sympathy with the fluttering alder and poplar leaves almost takes away my breath yet like the lake my serenity is rippled but not ruffled these small waves raised by the evening wind are as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface though it is now dark the wind still blows and roars in the wood the waves still dash and some creatures lull the rest with their notes the repose is never complete the wildest animals do not repose but seek their prey now the fox and skunk and rabbit now roam the fields and woods without fear they are natures watchmenlinks which connect the days of animated life  when i return to my house i find that visitors have been there and left their cards either a bunch of flowers or a wreath of evergreen or a name in pencil on a yellow walnut leaf or a chip they who come rarely to the woods take some little piece of the forest into their hands to play with by the way which they leave either intentionally or accidentally one has peeled a willow wand woven it into a ring and dropped it on my table i could always tell if visitors had called in my absence either by the bended twigs or grass or the print of their shoes and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by some slight trace left as a flower dropped or a bunch of grass plucked and thrown away even as far off as the railroad half a mile distant or by the lingering odor of a cigar or pipe nay i was frequently notified of the passage of a traveller along the highway sixty rods off by the scent of his pipe  there is commonly sufficient space about us our horizon is never quite at our elbows the thick wood is not just at our door nor the pond but somewhat is always clearing familiar and worn by us appropriated and fenced in some way and reclaimed from nature for what reason have i this vast range and circuit some square miles of unfrequented forest for my privacy abandoned to me by men my nearest neighbor is a mile distant and no house is visible from any place but the hilltops within half a mile of my own i have my horizon bounded by woods all to myself a distant view of the railroad where it touches the pond on the one hand and of the fence which skirts the woodland road on the other but for the most part it is as solitary where i live as on the prairies it is as much asia or africa as new england i have as it were my own sun and moon and stars and a little world all to myself at night there was never a traveller passed my house or knocked at my door more than if i were the first or last man unless it were in the spring when at long intervals some came from the village to fish for poutsthey plainly fished much more in the walden pond of their own natures and baited their hooks with darknessbut they soon retreated usually with light baskets and left the world to darkness and to me and the black kernel of the night was never profaned by any human neighborhood i believe that men are generally still a little afraid of the dark though the witches are all hung and christianity and candles have been introduced  yet i experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender the most innocent and encouraging society may be found in any natural object even for the poor misanthrope and most melancholy man there can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of nature and has his senses still there was never yet such a storm but it was Æolian music to a healthy and innocent ear nothing can rightly compel a simple and brave man to a vulgar sadness while i enjoy the friendship of the seasons i trust that nothing can make life a burden to me the gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house today is not drear and melancholy but good for me too though it prevents my hoeing them it is of far more worth than my hoeing if it should continue so long as to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low lands it would still be good for the grass on the uplands and being good for the grass it would be good for me sometimes when i compare myself with other men it seems as if i were more favored by the gods than they beyond any deserts that i am conscious of as if i had a warrant and surety at their hands which my fellows have not and were especially guided and guarded i do not flatter myself but if it be possible they flatter me i have never felt lonesome or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude but once and that was a few weeks after i came to the woods when for an hour i doubted if the near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life to be alone was something unpleasant but i was at the same time conscious of a slight insanity in my mood and seemed to foresee my recovery in the midst of a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed i was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in nature in the very pattering of the drops and in every sound and sight around my house an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me as made the fancied advantages of human neighborhood insignificant and i have never thought of them since every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me i was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something kindred to me even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary and also that the nearest of blood to me and humanest was not a person nor a villager that i thought no place could ever be strange to me again            mourning untimely consumes the sad            few are their days in the land of the living            beautiful daughter of toscar  some of my pleasantest hours were during the long rainstorms in the spring or fall which confined me to the house for the afternoon as well as the forenoon soothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting when an early twilight ushered in a long evening in which many thoughts had time to take root and unfold themselves in those driving northeast rains which tried the village houses so when the maids stood ready with mop and pail in front entries to keep the deluge out i sat behind my door in my little house which was all entry and thoroughly enjoyed its protection in one heavy thundershower the lightning struck a large pitch pine across the pond making a very conspicuous and perfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom an inch or more deep and four or five inches wide as you would groove a walkingstick i passed it again the other day and was struck with awe on looking up and beholding that mark now more distinct than ever where a terrific and resistless bolt came down out of the harmless sky eight years ago men frequently say to me i should think you would feel lonesome down there and want to be nearer to folks rainy and snowy days and nights especially i am tempted to reply to suchthis whole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space how far apart think you dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder star the breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments why should i feel lonely is not our planet in the milky way this which you put seems to me not to be the most important question what sort of space is that which separates a man from his fellows and makes him solitary i have found that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another what do we want most to dwell near to not to many men surely the depot the postoffice the barroom the meetinghouse the schoolhouse the grocery beacon hill or the five points where men most congregate but to the perennial source of our life whence in all our experience we have found that to issue as the willow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that direction this will vary with different natures but this is the place where a wise man will dig his cellar i one evening overtook one of my townsmen who has accumulated what is called a handsome propertythough i never got a fair view of iton the walden road driving a pair of cattle to market who inquired of me how i could bring my mind to give up so many of the comforts of life i answered that i was very sure i liked it passably well i was not joking and so i went home to my bed and left him to pick his way through the darkness and the mud to brightonor brighttownwhich place he would reach some time in the morning  any prospect of awakening or coming to life to a dead man makes indifferent all times and places the place where that may occur is always the same and indescribably pleasant to all our senses for the most part we allow only outlying and transient circumstances to make our occasions they are in fact the cause of our distraction nearest to all things is that power which fashions their being next to us the grandest laws are continually being executed next to us is not the workman whom we have hired with whom we love so well to talk but the workman whose work we are  how vast and profound is the influence of the subtile powers of heaven and of earth  we seek to perceive them and we do not see them we seek to hear them and we do not hear them identified with the substance of things they cannot be separated from them  they cause that in all the universe men purify and sanctify their hearts and clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offer sacrifices and oblations to their ancestors it is an ocean of subtile intelligences they are everywhere above us on our left on our right they environ us on all sides  we are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting to me can we not do without the society of our gossips a little while under these circumstanceshave our own thoughts to cheer us confucius says truly virtue does not remain as an abandoned orphan it must of necessity have neighbors  with thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense by a conscious effort of the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their consequences and all things good and bad go by us like a torrent we are not wholly involved in nature i may be either the driftwood in the stream or indra in the sky looking down on it i may be affected by a theatrical exhibition on the other hand i may not be affected by an actual event which appears to concern me much more i only know myself as a human entity the scene so to speak of thoughts and affections and am sensible of a certain doubleness by which i can stand as remote from myself as from another however intense my experience i am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of me which as it were is not a part of me but spectator sharing no experience but taking note of it and that is no more i than it is you when the play it may be the tragedy of life is over the spectator goes his way it was a kind of fiction a work of the imagination only so far as he was concerned this doubleness may easily make us poor neighbors and friends sometimes  i find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time to be in company even with the best is soon wearisome and dissipating i love to be alone i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude we are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers a man thinking or working is always alone let him be where he will solitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between a man and his fellows the really diligent student in one of the crowded hives of cambridge college is as solitary as a dervish in the desert the farmer can work alone in the field or the woods all day hoeing or chopping and not feel lonesome because he is employed but when he comes home at night he cannot sit down in a room alone at the mercy of his thoughts but must be where he can see the folks and recreate and as he thinks remunerate himself for his days solitude and hence he wonders how the student can sit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennui and the blues but he does not realize that the student though in the house is still at work in his field and chopping in his woods as the farmer in his and in turn seeks the same recreation and society that the latter does though it may be a more condensed form of it  society is commonly too cheap we meet at very short intervals not having had time to acquire any new value for each other we meet at meals three times a day and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are we have had to agree on a certain set of rules called etiquette and politeness to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war we meet at the postoffice and at the sociable and about the fireside every night we live thick and are in each others way and stumble over one another and i think that we thus lose some respect for one another certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications consider the girls in a factorynever alone hardly in their dreams it would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile as where i live the value of a man is not in his skin that we should touch him  i have heard of a man lost in the woods and dying of famine and exhaustion at the foot of a tree whose loneliness was relieved by the grotesque visions with which owing to bodily weakness his diseased imagination surrounded him and which he believed to be real so also owing to bodily and mental health and strength we may be continually cheered by a like but more normal and natural society and come to know that we are never alone  i have a great deal of company in my house especially in the morning when nobody calls let me suggest a few comparisons that some one may convey an idea of my situation i am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs so loud or than walden pond itself what company has that lonely lake i pray and yet it has not the blue devils but the blue angels in it in the azure tint of its waters the sun is alone except in thick weather when there sometimes appear to be two but one is a mock sun god is alonebut the devil he is far from being alone he sees a great deal of company he is legion i am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture or a bean leaf or sorrel or a horsefly or a bumblebee i am no more lonely than the mill brook or a weathercock or the north star or the south wind or an april shower or a january thaw or the first spider in a new house  i have occasional visits in the long winter evenings when the snow falls fast and the wind howls in the wood from an old settler and original proprietor who is reported to have dug walden pond and stoned it and fringed it with pine woods who tells me stories of old time and of new eternity and between us we manage to pass a cheerful evening with social mirth and pleasant views of things even without apples or cidera most wise and humorous friend whom i love much who keeps himself more secret than ever did goffe or whalley and though he is thought to be dead none can show where he is buried an elderly dame too dwells in my neighborhood invisible to most persons in whose odorous herb garden i love to stroll sometimes gathering simples and listening to her fables for she has a genius of unequalled fertility and her memory runs back farther than mythology and she can tell me the original of every fable and on what fact every one is founded for the incidents occurred when she was young a ruddy and lusty old dame who delights in all weathers and seasons and is likely to outlive all her children yet  the indescribable innocence and beneficence of natureof sun and wind and rain of summer and wintersuch health such cheer they afford forever and such sympathy have they ever with our race that all nature would be affected and the suns brightness fade and the winds would sigh humanely and the clouds rain tears and the woods shed their leaves and put on mourning in midsummer if any man should ever for a just cause grieve shall i not have intelligence with the earth am i not partly leaves and vegetable mould myself  what is the pill which will keep us well serene contented not my or thy greatgrandfathers but our greatgrandmother natures universal vegetable botanic medicines by which she has kept herself young always outlived so many old parrs in her day and fed her health with their decaying fatness for my panacea instead of one of those quack vials of a mixture dipped from acheron and the dead sea which come out of those long shallow blackschooner looking wagons which we sometimes see made to carry bottles let me have a draught of undiluted morning air morning air if men will not drink of this at the fountainhead of the day why then we must even bottle up some and sell it in the shops for the benefit of those who have lost their subscription ticket to morning time in this world but remember it will not keep quite till noonday even in the coolest cellar but drive out the stopples long ere that and follow westward the steps of aurora i am no worshipper of hygeia who was the daughter of that old herbdoctor Æsculapius and who is represented on monuments holding a serpent in one hand and in the other a cup out of which the serpent sometimes drinks but rather of hebe cupbearer to jupiter who was the daughter of juno and wild lettuce and who had the power of restoring gods and men to the vigor of youth she was probably the only thoroughly soundconditioned healthy and robust young lady that ever walked the globe and wherever she came it was spring     visitors   i think that i love society as much as most and am ready enough to fasten myself like a bloodsucker for the time to any fullblooded man that comes in my way i am naturally no hermit but might possibly sit out the sturdiest frequenter of the barroom if my business called me thither  i had three chairs in my house one for solitude two for friendship three for society when visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers there was but the third chair for them all but they generally economized the room by standing up it is surprising how many great men and women a small house will contain i have had twentyfive or thirty souls with their bodies at once under my roof and yet we often parted without being aware that we had come very near to one another many of our houses both public and private with their almost innumerable apartments their huge halls and their cellars for the storage of wines and other munitions of peace appear to be extravagantly large for their inhabitants they are so vast and magnificent that the latter seem to be only vermin which infest them i am surprised when the herald blows his summons before some tremont or astor or middlesex house to see come creeping out over the piazza for all inhabitants a ridiculous mouse which soon again slinks into some hole in the pavement  one inconvenience i sometimes experienced in so small a house the difficulty of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we began to utter the big thoughts in big words you want room for your thoughts to get into sailing trim and run a course or two before they make their port the bullet of your thought must have overcome its lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its last and steady course before it reaches the ear of the hearer else it may plow out again through the side of his head also our sentences wanted room to unfold and form their columns in the interval individuals like nations must have suitable broad and natural boundaries even a considerable neutral ground between them i have found it a singular luxury to talk across the pond to a companion on the opposite side in my house we were so near that we could not begin to hearwe could not speak low enough to be heard as when you throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each others undulations if we are merely loquacious and loud talkers then we can afford to stand very near together cheek by jowl and feel each others breath but if we speak reservedly and thoughtfully we want to be farther apart that all animal heat and moisture may have a chance to evaporate if we would enjoy the most intimate society with that in each of us which is without or above being spoken to we must not only be silent but commonly so far apart bodily that we cannot possibly hear each others voice in any case referred to this standard speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of hearing but there are many fine things which we cannot say if we have to shout as the conversation began to assume a loftier and grander tone we gradually shoved our chairs farther apart till they touched the wall in opposite corners and then commonly there was not room enough  my best room however my withdrawing room always ready for company on whose carpet the sun rarely fell was the pine wood behind my house thither in summer days when distinguished guests came i took them and a priceless domestic swept the floor and dusted the furniture and kept the things in order  if one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal and it was no interruption to conversation to be stirring a hastypudding or watching the rising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes in the meanwhile but if twenty came and sat in my house there was nothing said about dinner though there might be bread enough for two more than if eating were a forsaken habit but we naturally practised abstinence and this was never felt to be an offence against hospitality but the most proper and considerate course the waste and decay of physical life which so often needs repair seemed miraculously retarded in such a case and the vital vigor stood its ground i could entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty and if any ever went away disappointed or hungry from my house when they found me at home they may depend upon it that i sympathized with them at least so easy is it though many housekeepers doubt it to establish new and better customs in the place of the old you need not rest your reputation on the dinners you give for my own part i was never so effectually deterred from frequenting a mans house by any kind of cerberus whatever as by the parade one made about dining me which i took to be a very polite and roundabout hint never to trouble him so again i think i shall never revisit those scenes i should be proud to have for the motto of my cabin those lines of spenser which one of my visitors inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card         arrivèd there the little house they fill            ne looke for entertainment where none was         rest is their feast and all things at their will            the noblest mind the best contentment has  when winslow afterward governor of the plymouth colony went with a companion on a visit of ceremony to massasoit on foot through the woods and arrived tired and hungry at his lodge they were well received by the king but nothing was said about eating that day when the night arrived to quote their own wordshe laid us on the bed with himself and his wife they at the one end and we at the other it being only planks laid a foot from the ground and a thin mat upon them two more of his chief men for want of room pressed by and upon us so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our journey at one oclock the next day massasoit brought two fishes that he had shot about thrice as big as a bream these being boiled there were at least forty looked for a share in them the most eat of them this meal only we had in two nights and a day and had not one of us bought a partridge we had taken our journey fasting fearing that they would be lightheaded for want of food and also sleep owing to the savages barbarous singing for they use to sing themselves asleep and that they might get home while they had strength to travel they departed as for lodging it is true they were but poorly entertained though what they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor but as far as eating was concerned i do not see how the indians could have done better they had nothing to eat themselves and they were wiser than to think that apologies could supply the place of food to their guests so they drew their belts tighter and said nothing about it another time when winslow visited them it being a season of plenty with them there was no deficiency in this respect  as for men they will hardly fail one anywhere i had more visitors while i lived in the woods than at any other period in my life i mean that i had some i met several there under more favorable circumstances than i could anywhere else but fewer came to see me on trivial business in this respect my company was winnowed by my mere distance from town i had withdrawn so far within the great ocean of solitude into which the rivers of society empty that for the most part so far as my needs were concerned only the finest sediment was deposited around me beside there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored and uncultivated continents on the other side  who should come to my lodge this morning but a true homeric or paphlagonian manhe had so suitable and poetic a name that i am sorry i cannot print it herea canadian a woodchopper and postmaker who can hole fifty posts in a day who made his last supper on a woodchuck which his dog caught he too has heard of homer and if it were not for books would not know what to do rainy days though perhaps he has not read one wholly through for many rainy seasons some priest who could pronounce the greek itself taught him to read his verse in the testament in his native parish far away and now i must translate to him while he holds the book achilles reproof to patroclus for his sad countenancewhy are you in tears patroclus like a young girl        or have you alone heard some news from phthia        they say that menoetius lives yet son of actor        and peleus lives son of Æacus among the myrmidons        either of whom having died we should greatly grieve  he says thats good he has a great bundle of white oak bark under his arm for a sick man gathered this sunday morning i suppose theres no harm in going after such a thing today says he to him homer was a great writer though what his writing was about he did not know a more simple and natural man it would be hard to find vice and disease which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world seemed to have hardly any existence for him he was about twentyeight years old and had left canada and his fathers house a dozen years before to work in the states and earn money to buy a farm with at last perhaps in his native country he was cast in the coarsest mould a stout but sluggish body yet gracefully carried with a thick sunburnt neck dark bushy hair and dull sleepy blue eyes which were occasionally lit up with expression he wore a flat gray cloth cap a dingy woolcolored greatcoat and cowhide boots he was a great consumer of meat usually carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my housefor he chopped all summerin a tin pail cold meats often cold woodchucks and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from his belt and sometimes he offered me a drink he came along early crossing my beanfield though without anxiety or haste to get to his work such as yankees exhibit he wasnt agoing to hurt himself he didnt care if he only earned his board frequently he would leave his dinner in the bushes when his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way and go back a mile and a half to dress it and leave it in the cellar of the house where he boarded after deliberating first for half an hour whether he could not sink it in the pond safely till nightfallloving to dwell long upon these themes he would say as he went by in the morning how thick the pigeons are if working every day were not my trade i could get all the meat i should want by huntingpigeons woodchucks rabbits partridgesby gosh i could get all i should want for a week in one day  he was a skilful chopper and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments in his art he cut his trees level and close to the ground that the sprouts which came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might slide over the stumps and instead of leaving a whole tree to support his corded wood he would pare it away to a slender stake or splinter which you could break off with your hand at last  he interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal a well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes his mirth was without alloy sometimes i saw him at his work in the woods felling trees and he would greet me with a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction and a salutation in canadian french though he spoke english as well when i approached him he would suspend his work and with halfsuppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a pine which he had felled and peeling off the inner bark roll it up into a ball and chew it while he laughed and talked such an exuberance of animal spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the ground with laughter at anything which made him think and tickled him looking round upon the trees he would exclaimby george i can enjoy myself well enough here chopping i want no better sport sometimes when at leisure he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket pistol firing salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked in the winter he had a fire by which at noon he warmed his coffee in a kettle and as he sat on a log to eat his dinner the chickadees would sometimes come round and alight on his arm and peck at the potato in his fingers and he said that he liked to have the little fellers about him  in him the animal man chiefly was developed in physical endurance and contentment he was cousin to the pine and the rock i asked him once if he was not sometimes tired at night after working all day and he answered with a sincere and serious look gorrappit i never was tired in my life but the intellectual and what is called spiritual man in him were slumbering as in an infant he had been instructed only in that innocent and ineffectual way in which the catholic priests teach the aborigines by which the pupil is never educated to the degree of consciousness but only to the degree of trust and reverence and a child is not made a man but kept a child when nature made him she gave him a strong body and contentment for his portion and propped him on every side with reverence and reliance that he might live out his threescore years and ten a child he was so genuine and unsophisticated that no introduction would serve to introduce him more than if you introduced a woodchuck to your neighbor he had got to find him out as you did he would not play any part men paid him wages for work and so helped to feed and clothe him but he never exchanged opinions with them he was so simply and naturally humbleif he can be called humble who never aspiresthat humility was no distinct quality in him nor could he conceive of it wiser men were demigods to him if you told him that such a one was coming he did as if he thought that anything so grand would expect nothing of himself but take all the responsibility on itself and let him be forgotten still he never heard the sound of praise he particularly reverenced the writer and the preacher their performances were miracles when i told him that i wrote considerably he thought for a long time that it was merely the handwriting which i meant for he could write a remarkably good hand himself i sometimes found the name of his native parish handsomely written in the snow by the highway with the proper french accent and knew that he had passed i asked him if he ever wished to write his thoughts he said that he had read and written letters for those who could not but he never tried to write thoughtsno he could not he could not tell what to put first it would kill him and then there was spelling to be attended to at the same time  i heard that a distinguished wise man and reformer asked him if he did not want the world to be changed but he answered with a chuckle of surprise in his canadian accent not knowing that the question had ever been entertained before no i like it well enough it would have suggested many things to a philosopher to have dealings with him to a stranger he appeared to know nothing of things in general yet i sometimes saw in him a man whom i had not seen before and i did not know whether he was as wise as shakespeare or as simply ignorant as a child whether to suspect him of a fine poetic consciousness or of stupidity a townsman told me that when he met him sauntering through the village in his small closefitting cap and whistling to himself he reminded him of a prince in disguise  his only books were an almanac and an arithmetic in which last he was considerably expert the former was a sort of cyclopaedia to him which he supposed to contain an abstract of human knowledge as indeed it does to a considerable extent i loved to sound him on the various reforms of the day and he never failed to look at them in the most simple and practical light he had never heard of such things before could he do without factories i asked he had worn the homemade vermont gray he said and that was good could he dispense with tea and coffee did this country afford any beverage beside water he had soaked hemlock leaves in water and drank it and thought that was better than water in warm weather when i asked him if he could do without money he showed the convenience of money in such a way as to suggest and coincide with the most philosophical accounts of the origin of this institution and the very derivation of the word pecunia if an ox were his property and he wished to get needles and thread at the store he thought it would be inconvenient and impossible soon to go on mortgaging some portion of the creature each time to that amount he could defend many institutions better than any philosopher because in describing them as they concerned him he gave the true reason for their prevalence and speculation had not suggested to him any other at another time hearing platos definition of a mana biped without feathersand that one exhibited a cock plucked and called it platos man he thought it an important difference that the knees bent the wrong way he would sometimes exclaim how i love to talk by george i could talk all day i asked him once when i had not seen him for many months if he had got a new idea this summer good lordsaid he a man that has to work as i do if he does not forget the ideas he has had he will do well may be the man you hoe with is inclined to race then by gorry your mind must be there you think of weeds he would sometimes ask me first on such occasions if i had made any improvement one winter day i asked him if he was always satisfied with himself wishing to suggest a substitute within him for the priest without and some higher motive for living satisfied said he some men are satisfied with one thing and some with another one man perhaps if he has got enough will be satisfied to sit all day with his back to the fire and his belly to the table by george yet i never by any manoeuvring could get him to take the spiritual view of things the highest that he appeared to conceive of was a simple expediency such as you might expect an animal to appreciate and this practically is true of most men if i suggested any improvement in his mode of life he merely answered without expressing any regret that it was too late yet he thoroughly believed in honesty and the like virtues  there was a certain positive originality however slight to be detected in him and i occasionally observed that he was thinking for himself and expressing his own opinion a phenomenon so rare that i would any day walk ten miles to observe it and it amounted to the reorigination of many of the institutions of society though he hesitated and perhaps failed to express himself distinctly he always had a presentable thought behind yet his thinking was so primitive and immersed in his animal life that though more promising than a merely learned mans it rarely ripened to anything which can be reported he suggested that there might be men of genius in the lowest grades of life however permanently humble and illiterate who take their own view always or do not pretend to see at all who are as bottomless even as walden pond was thought to be though they may be dark and muddy  many a traveller came out of his way to see me and the inside of my house and as an excuse for calling asked for a glass of water i told them that i drank at the pond and pointed thither offering to lend them a dipper far off as i lived i was not exempted from the annual visitation which occurs methinks about the first of april when everybody is on the move and i had my share of good luck though there were some curious specimens among my visitors halfwitted men from the almshouse and elsewhere came to see me but i endeavored to make them exercise all the wit they had and make their confessions to me in such cases making wit the theme of our conversation and so was compensated indeed i found some of them to be wiser than the socalled overseers of the poor and selectmen of the town and thought it was time that the tables were turned with respect to wit i learned that there was not much difference between the half and the whole one day in particular an inoffensive simpleminded pauper whom with others i had often seen used as fencing stuff standing or sitting on a bushel in the fields to keep cattle and himself from straying visited me and expressed a wish to live as i did he told me with the utmost simplicity and truth quite superior or rather inferior to anything that is called humility that he was deficient in intellect these were his words the lord had made him so yet he supposed the lord cared as much for him as for another i have always been so said he from my childhood i never had much mind i was not like other children i am weak in the head it was the lords will i suppose and there he was to prove the truth of his words he was a metaphysical puzzle to me i have rarely met a fellowman on such promising groundit was so simple and sincere and so true all that he said and true enough in proportion as he appeared to humble himself was he exalted i did not know at first but it was the result of a wise policy it seemed that from such a basis of truth and frankness as the poor weakheaded pauper had laid our intercourse might go forward to something better than the intercourse of sages  i had some guests from those not reckoned commonly among the towns poor but who should be who are among the worlds poor at any rate guests who appeal not to your hospitality but to your hospitalality who earnestly wish to be helped and preface their appeal with the information that they are resolved for one thing never to help themselves i require of a visitor that he be not actually starving though he may have the very best appetite in the world however he got it objects of charity are not guests men who did not know when their visit had terminated though i went about my business again answering them from greater and greater remoteness men of almost every degree of wit called on me in the migrating season some who had more wits than they knew what to do with runaway slaves with plantation manners who listened from time to time like the fox in the fable as if they heard the hounds abaying on their track and looked at me beseechingly as much as to say             o christian will you send me back  one real runaway slave among the rest whom i helped to forward toward the north star men of one idea like a hen with one chicken and that a duckling men of a thousand ideas and unkempt heads like those hens which are made to take charge of a hundred chickens all in pursuit of one bug a score of them lost in every mornings dewand become frizzled and mangy in consequence men of ideas instead of legs a sort of intellectual centipede that made you crawl all over one man proposed a book in which visitors should write their names as at the white mountains but alas i have too good a memory to make that necessary  i could not but notice some of the peculiarities of my visitors girls and boys and young women generally seemed glad to be in the woods they looked in the pond and at the flowers and improved their time men of business even farmers thought only of solitude and employment and of the great distance at which i dwelt from something or other and though they said that they loved a ramble in the woods occasionally it was obvious that they did not restless committed men whose time was an taken up in getting a living or keeping it ministers who spoke of god as if they enjoyed a monopoly of the subject who could not bear all kinds of opinions doctors lawyers uneasy housekeepers who pried into my cupboard and bed when i was outhow came mrsto know that my sheets were not as clean as hersyoung men who had ceased to be young and had concluded that it was safest to follow the beaten track of the professionsall these generally said that it was not possible to do so much good in my position ay there was the rub the old and infirm and the timid of whatever age or sex thought most of sickness and sudden accident and death to them life seemed full of dangerwhat danger is there if you dont think of anyand they thought that a prudent man would carefully select the safest position where dr b might be on hand at a moments warning to them the village was literally a community a league for mutual defence and you would suppose that they would not go ahuckleberrying without a medicine chest the amount of it is if a man is alive there is always danger that he may die though the danger must be allowed to be less in proportion as he is deadandalive to begin with a man sits as many risks as he runs finally there were the selfstyled reformers the greatest bores of all who thought that i was forever singing         this is the house that i built        this is the man that lives in the house that i built  but they did not know that the third line was                these are the folks that worry the man               that lives in the house that i built  i did not fear the henharriers for i kept no chickens but i feared the menharriers rather  i had more cheering visitors than the last children come aberrying railroad men taking a sunday morning walk in clean shirts fishermen and hunters poets and philosophers in short all honest pilgrims who came out to the woods for freedoms sake and really left the village behind i was ready to greet withwelcome englishmen welcome englishmen for i had had communication with that race     the beanfield   meanwhile my beans the length of whose rows added together was seven miles already planted were impatient to be hoed for the earliest had grown considerably before the latest were in the ground indeed they were not easily to be put off what was the meaning of this so steady and selfrespecting this small herculean labor i knew not i came to love my rows my beans though so many more than i wanted they attached me to the earth and so i got strength like antaeus but why should i raise them only heaven knows this was my curious labor all summerto make this portion of the earths surface which had yielded only cinquefoil blackberries johnswort and the like before sweet wild fruits and pleasant flowers produce instead this pulse what shall i learn of beans or beans of me i cherish them i hoe them early and late i have an eye to them and this is my days work it is a fine broad leaf to look on my auxiliaries are the dews and rains which water this dry soil and what fertility is in the soil itself which for the most part is lean and effete my enemies are worms cool days and most of all woodchucks the last have nibbled for me a quarter of an acre clean but what right had i to oust johnswort and the rest and break up their ancient herb garden soon however the remaining beans will be too tough for them and go forward to meet new foes  when i was four years old as i well remember i was brought from boston to this my native town through these very woods and this field to the pond it is one of the oldest scenes stamped on my memory and now tonight my flute has waked the echoes over that very water the pines still stand here older than i or if some have fallen i have cooked my supper with their stumps and a new growth is rising all around preparing another aspect for new infant eyes almost the same johnswort springs from the same perennial root in this pasture and even i have at length helped to clothe that fabulous landscape of my infant dreams and one of the results of my presence and influence is seen in these bean leaves corn blades and potato vines  i planted about two acres and a half of upland and as it was only about fifteen years since the land was cleared and i myself had got out two or three cords of stumps i did not give it any manure but in the course of the summer it appeared by the arrowheads which i turned up in hoeing that an extinct nation had anciently dwelt here and planted corn and beans ere white men came to clear the land and so to some extent had exhausted the soil for this very crop  before yet any woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road or the sun had got above the shrub oaks while all the dew was on though the farmers warned me against iti would advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is oni began to level the ranks of haughty weeds in my beanfield and throw dust upon their heads early in the morning i worked barefooted dabbling like a plastic artist in the dewy and crumbling sand but later in the day the sun blistered my feet there the sun lighted me to hoe beans pacing slowly backward and forward over that yellow gravelly upland between the long green rows fifteen rods the one end terminating in a shrub oak copse where i could rest in the shade the other in a blackberry field where the green berries deepened their tints by the time i had made another bout removing the weeds putting fresh soil about the bean stems and encouraging this weed which i had sown making the yellow soil express its summer thought in bean leaves and blossoms rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass making the earth say beans instead of grassthis was my daily work as i had little aid from horses or cattle or hired men or boys or improved implements of husbandry i was much slower and became much more intimate with my beans than usual but labor of the hands even when pursued to the verge of drudgery is perhaps never the worst form of idleness it has a constant and imperishable moral and to the scholar it yields a classic result a very agricola laboriosus was i to travellers bound westward through lincoln and wayland to nobody knows where they sitting at their ease in gigs with elbows on knees and reins loosely hanging in festoons i the homestaying laborious native of the soil but soon my homestead was out of their sight and thought it was the only open and cultivated field for a great distance on either side of the road so they made the most of it and sometimes the man in the field heard more of travellers gossip and comment than was meant for his ear beans so late peas so latefor i continued to plant when others had begun to hoethe ministerial husbandman had not suspected it corn my boy for fodder corn for fodder does he live there asks the black bonnet of the gray coat and the hardfeatured farmer reins up his grateful dobbin to inquire what you are doing where he sees no manure in the furrow and recommends a little chip dirt or any little waste stuff or it may be ashes or plaster but here were two acres and a half of furrows and only a hoe for cart and two hands to draw itthere being an aversion to other carts and horsesand chip dirt far away fellowtravellers as they rattled by compared it aloud with the fields which they had passed so that i came to know how i stood in the agricultural world this was one field not in mr colemans report and by the way who estimates the value of the crop which nature yields in the still wilder fields unimproved by man the crop of english hay is carefully weighed the moisture calculated the silicates and the potash but in all dells and pondholes in the woods and pastures and swamps grows a rich and various crop only unreaped by man mine was as it were the connecting link between wild and cultivated fields as some states are civilized and others halfcivilized and others savage or barbarous so my field was though not in a bad sense a halfcultivated field they were beans cheerfully returning to their wild and primitive state that i cultivated and my hoe played the ranz des vaches for them  near at hand upon the topmost spray of a birch sings the brown thrasheror red mavis as some love to call himall the morning glad of your society that would find out another farmers field if yours were not here while you are planting the seed he criesdrop it drop itcover it up cover it uppull it up pull it up pull it up but this was not corn and so it was safe from such enemies as he you may wonder what his rigmarole his amateur paganini performances on one string or on twenty have to do with your planting and yet prefer it to leached ashes or plaster it was a cheap sort of top dressing in which i had entire faith  as i drew a still fresher soil about the rows with my hoe i disturbed the ashes of unchronicled nations who in primeval years lived under these heavens and their small implements of war and hunting were brought to the light of this modern day they lay mingled with other natural stones some of which bore the marks of having been burned by indian fires and some by the sun and also bits of pottery and glass brought hither by the recent cultivators of the soil when my hoe tinkled against the stones that music echoed to the woods and the sky and was an accompaniment to my labor which yielded an instant and immeasurable crop it was no longer beans that i hoed nor i that hoed beans and i remembered with as much pity as pride if i remembered at all my acquaintances who had gone to the city to attend the oratorios the nighthawk circled overhead in the sunny afternoonsfor i sometimes made a day of itlike a mote in the eye or in heavens eye falling from time to time with a swoop and a sound as if the heavens were rent torn at last to very rags and tatters and yet a seamless cope remained small imps that fill the air and lay their eggs on the ground on bare sand or rocks on the tops of hills where few have found them graceful and slender like ripples caught up from the pond as leaves are raised by the wind to float in the heavens such kindredship is in nature the hawk is aerial brother of the wave which he sails over and surveys those his perfect airinflated wings answering to the elemental unfledged pinions of the sea or sometimes i watched a pair of henhawks circling high in the sky alternately soaring and descending approaching and leaving one another as if they were the embodiment of my own thoughts or i was attracted by the passage of wild pigeons from this wood to that with a slight quivering winnowing sound and carrier haste or from under a rotten stump my hoe turned up a sluggish portentous and outlandish spotted salamander a trace of egypt and the nile yet our contemporary when i paused to lean on my hoe these sounds and sights i heard and saw anywhere in the row a part of the inexhaustible entertainment which the country offers  on gala days the town fires its great guns which echo like popguns to these woods and some waifs of martial music occasionally penetrate thus far to me away there in my beanfield at the other end of the town the big guns sounded as if a puffball had burst and when there was a military turnout of which i was ignorant i have sometimes had a vague sense all the day of some sort of itching and disease in the horizon as if some eruption would break out there soon either scarlatina or cankerrash until at length some more favorable puff of wind making haste over the fields and up the wayland road brought me information of the trainers it seemed by the distant hum as if somebodys bees had swarmed and that the neighbors according to virgils advice by a faint tintinnabulum upon the most sonorous of their domestic utensils were endeavoring to call them down into the hive again and when the sound died quite away and the hum had ceased and the most favorable breezes told no tale i knew that they had got the last drone of them all safely into the middlesex hive and that now their minds were bent on the honey with which it was smeared  i felt proud to know that the liberties of massachusetts and of our fatherland were in such safe keeping and as i turned to my hoeing again i was filled with an inexpressible confidence and pursued my labor cheerfully with a calm trust in the future  when there were several bands of musicians it sounded as if all the village was a vast bellows and all the buildings expanded and collapsed alternately with a din but sometimes it was a really noble and inspiring strain that reached these woods and the trumpet that sings of fame and i felt as if i could spit a mexican with a good relishfor why should we always stand for triflesand looked round for a woodchuck or a skunk to exercise my chivalry upon these martial strains seemed as far away as palestine and reminded me of a march of crusaders in the horizon with a slight tantivy and tremulous motion of the elm tree tops which overhang the village this was one of the great days though the sky had from my clearing only the same everlastingly great look that it wears daily and i saw no difference in it  it was a singular experience that long acquaintance which i cultivated with beans what with planting and hoeing and harvesting and threshing and picking over and selling themthe last was the hardest of alli might add eating for i did taste i was determined to know beans when they were growing i used to hoe from five oclock in the morning till noon and commonly spent the rest of the day about other affairs consider the intimate and curious acquaintance one makes with various kinds of weedsit will bear some iteration in the account for there was no little iteration in the labordisturbing their delicate organizations so ruthlessly and making such invidious distinctions with his hoe levelling whole ranks of one species and sedulously cultivating another thats roman wormwoodthats pigweedthats sorrelthats pipergrasshave at him chop him up turn his roots upward to the sun dont let him have a fibre in the shade if you do hell turn himself t other side up and be as green as a leek in two days a long war not with cranes but with weeds those trojans who had sun and rain and dews on their side daily the beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe and thin the ranks of their enemies filling up the trenches with weedy dead many a lusty crestwaving hector that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades fell before my weapon and rolled in the dust  those summer days which some of my contemporaries devoted to the fine arts in boston or rome and others to contemplation in india and others to trade in london or new york i thus with the other farmers of new england devoted to husbandry not that i wanted beans to eat for i am by nature a pythagorean so far as beans are concerned whether they mean porridge or voting and exchanged them for rice but perchance as some must work in fields if only for the sake of tropes and expression to serve a parablemaker one day it was on the whole a rare amusement which continued too long might have become a dissipation though i gave them no manure and did not hoe them all once i hoed them unusually well as far as i went and was paid for it in the end there being in truth as evelyn says no compost or laetation whatsoever comparable to this continual motion repastination and turning of the mould with the spade the earth he adds elsewhere especially if fresh has a certain magnetism in it by which it attracts the salt power or virtue call it either which gives it life and is the logic of all the labor and stir we keep about it to sustain us all dungings and other sordid temperings being but the vicars succedaneous to this improvement moreover this being one of those wornout and exhausted lay fields which enjoy their sabbath had perchance as sir kenelm digby thinks likely attracted vital spirits from the air i harvested twelve bushels of beans  but to be more particular for it is complained that mr coleman has reported chiefly the expensive experiments of gentlemen farmers my outgoes were      for a hoe  054     plowing harrowing and furrowing  750  too much     beans for seed

                                                   in all 147212  my income was patrem familias vendacem non emacem esse oportet from      nine bushels and twelve quarts of beans sold 1694     five        large potatoes 250     nine        small 225     grass 100     stalks 075                                                            in all 2344     leaving a pecuniary profit         as i have elsewhere said of 87112  this is the result of my experience in raising beans plant the common small white bush bean about the first of june in rows three feet by eighteen inches apart being careful to select fresh round and unmixed seed first look out for worms and supply vacancies by planting anew then look out for woodchucks if it is an exposed place for they will nibble off the earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go and again when the young tendrils make their appearance they have notice of it and will shear them off with both buds and young pods sitting erect like a squirrel but above all harvest as early as possible if you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop you may save much loss by this means  this further experience also i gained i said to myself i will not plant beans and corn with so much industry another summer but such seeds if the seed is not lost as sincerity truth simplicity faith innocence and the like and see if they will not grow in this soil even with less toil and manurance and sustain me for surely it has not been exhausted for these crops alas i said this to myself but now another summer is gone and another and another and i am obliged to say to you reader that the seeds which i planted if indeed they were the seeds of those virtues were wormeaten or had lost their vitality and so did not come up commonly men will only be brave as their fathers were brave or timid this generation is very sure to plant corn and beans each new year precisely as the indians did centuries ago and taught the first settlers to do as if there were a fate in it i saw an old man the other day to my astonishment making the holes with a hoe for the seventieth time at least and not for himself to lie down in but why should not the new englander try new adventures and not lay so much stress on his grain his potato and grass crop and his orchardsraise other crops than these why concern ourselves so much about our beans for seed and not be concerned at all about a new generation of men we should really be fed and cheered if when we met a man we were sure to see that some of the qualities which i have named which we all prize more than those other productions but which are for the most part broadcast and floating in the air had taken root and grown in him here comes such a subtile and ineffable quality for instance as truth or justice though the slightest amount or new variety of it along the road our ambassadors should be instructed to send home such seeds as these and congress help to distribute them over all the land we should never stand upon ceremony with sincerity we should never cheat and insult and banish one another by our meanness if there were present the kernel of worth and friendliness we should not meet thus in haste most men i do not meet at all for they seem not to have time they are busy about their beans we would not deal with a man thus plodding ever leaning on a hoe or a spade as a staff between his work not as a mushroom but partially risen out of the earth something more than erect like swallows alighted and walking on the ground          and as he spake his wings would now and then          spread as he meant to fly then close again  so that we should suspect that we might be conversing with an angel bread may not always nourish us but it always does us good it even takes stiffness out of our joints and makes us supple and buoyant when we knew not what ailed us to recognize any generosity in man or nature to share any unmixed and heroic joy  ancient poetry and mythology suggest at least that husbandry was once a sacred art but it is pursued with irreverent haste and heedlessness by us our object being to have large farms and large crops merely we have no festival nor procession nor ceremony not excepting our cattleshows and socalled thanksgivings by which the farmer expresses a sense of the sacredness of his calling or is reminded of its sacred origin it is the premium and the feast which tempt him he sacrifices not to ceres and the terrestrial jove but to the infernal plutus rather by avarice and selfishness and a grovelling habit from which none of us is free of regarding the soil as property or the means of acquiring property chiefly the landscape is deformed husbandry is degraded with us and the farmer leads the meanest of lives he knows nature but as a robber cato says that the profits of agriculture are particularly pious or just maximeque pius quaestus and according to varro the old romans called the same earth mother and ceres and thought that they who cultivated it led a pious and useful life and that they alone were left of the race of king saturn  we are wont to forget that the sun looks on our cultivated fields and on the prairies and forests without distinction they all reflect and absorb his rays alike and the former make but a small part of the glorious picture which he beholds in his daily course in his view the earth is all equally cultivated like a garden therefore we should receive the benefit of his light and heat with a corresponding trust and magnanimity what though i value the seed of these beans and harvest that in the fall of the year this broad field which i have looked at so long looks not to me as the principal cultivator but away from me to influences more genial to it which water and make it green these beans have results which are not harvested by me do they not grow for woodchucks partly the ear of wheat in latin spica obsoletely speca from spe hope should not be the only hope of the husbandman its kernel or grain granum from gerendo bearing is not all that it bears how then can our harvest fail shall i not rejoice also at the abundance of the weeds whose seeds are the granary of the birds it matters little comparatively whether the fields fill the farmers barns the true husbandman will cease from anxiety as the squirrels manifest no concern whether the woods will bear chestnuts this year or not and finish his labor with every day relinquishing all claim to the produce of his fields and sacrificing in his mind not only his first but his last fruits also     the village   after hoeing or perhaps reading and writing in the forenoon i usually bathed again in the pond swimming across one of its coves for a stint and washed the dust of labor from my person or smoothed out the last wrinkle which study had made and for the afternoon was absolutely free every day or two i strolled to the village to hear some of the gossip which is incessantly going on there circulating either from mouth to mouth or from newspaper to newspaper and which taken in homoeopathic doses was really as refreshing in its way as the rustle of leaves and the peeping of frogs as i walked in the woods to see the birds and squirrels so i walked in the village to see the men and boys instead of the wind among the pines i heard the carts rattle in one direction from my house there was a colony of muskrats in the river meadows under the grove of elms and buttonwoods in the other horizon was a village of busy men as curious to me as if they had been prairiedogs each sitting at the mouth of its burrow or running over to a neighbors to gossip i went there frequently to observe their habits the village appeared to me a great news room and on one side to support it as once at redding  companys on state street they kept nuts and raisins or salt and meal and other groceries some have such a vast appetite for the former commodity that is the news and such sound digestive organs that they can sit forever in public avenues without stirring and let it simmer and whisper through them like the etesian winds or as if inhaling ether it only producing numbness and insensibility to painotherwise it would often be painful to bearwithout affecting the consciousness i hardly ever failed when i rambled through the village to see a row of such worthies either sitting on a ladder sunning themselves with their bodies inclined forward and their eyes glancing along the line this way and that from time to time with a voluptuous expression or else leaning against a barn with their hands in their pockets like caryatides as if to prop it up they being commonly out of doors heard whatever was in the wind these are the coarsest mills in which all gossip is first rudely digested or cracked up before it is emptied into finer and more delicate hoppers within doors i observed that the vitals of the village were the grocery the barroom the postoffice and the bank and as a necessary part of the machinery they kept a bell a big gun and a fireengine at convenient places and the houses were so arranged as to make the most of mankind in lanes and fronting one another so that every traveller had to run the gauntlet and every man woman and child might get a lick at him of course those who were stationed nearest to the head of the line where they could most see and be seen and have the first blow at him paid the highest prices for their places and the few straggling inhabitants in the outskirts where long gaps in the line began to occur and the traveller could get over walls or turn aside into cowpaths and so escape paid a very slight ground or window tax signs were hung out on all sides to allure him some to catch him by the appetite as the tavern and victualling cellar some by the fancy as the dry goods store and the jewellers and others by the hair or the feet or the skirts as the barber the shoemaker or the tailor besides there was a still more terrible standing invitation to call at every one of these houses and company expected about these times for the most part i escaped wonderfully from these dangers either by proceeding at once boldly and without deliberation to the goal as is recommended to those who run the gauntlet or by keeping my thoughts on high things like orpheus who loudly singing the praises of the gods to his lyre drowned the voices of the sirens and kept out of danger sometimes i bolted suddenly and nobody could tell my whereabouts for i did not stand much about gracefulness and never hesitated at a gap in a fence i was even accustomed to make an irruption into some houses where i was well entertained and after learning the kernels and very last sieveful of newswhat had subsided the prospects of war and peace and whether the world was likely to hold together much longeri was let out through the rear avenues and so escaped to the woods again  it was very pleasant when i stayed late in town to launch myself into the night especially if it was dark and tempestuous and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room with a bag of rye or indian meal upon my shoulder for my snug harbor in the woods having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts leaving only my outer man at the helm or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing i had many a genial thought by the cabin fire as i sailed i was never cast away nor distressed in any weather though i encountered some severe storms it is darker in the woods even in common nights than most suppose i frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route and where there was no cartpath to feel with my feet the faint track which i had worn or steer by the known relation of particular trees which i felt with my hands passing between two pines for instance not more than eighteen inches apart in the midst of the woods invariably in the darkest night sometimes after coming home thus late in a dark and muggy night when my feet felt the path which my eyes could not see dreaming and absentminded all the way until i was aroused by having to raise my hand to lift the latch i have not been able to recall a single step of my walk and i have thought that perhaps my body would find its way home if its master should forsake it as the hand finds its way to the mouth without assistance several times when a visitor chanced to stay into evening and it proved a dark night i was obliged to conduct him to the cartpath in the rear of the house and then point out to him the direction he was to pursue and in keeping which he was to be guided rather by his feet than his eyes one very dark night i directed thus on their way two young men who had been fishing in the pond they lived about a mile off through the woods and were quite used to the route a day or two after one of them told me that they wandered about the greater part of the night close by their own premises and did not get home till toward morning by which time as there had been several heavy showers in the meanwhile and the leaves were very wet they were drenched to their skins i have heard of many going astray even in the village streets when the darkness was so thick that you could cut it with a knife as the saying is some who live in the outskirts having come to town ashopping in their wagons have been obliged to put up for the night and gentlemen and ladies making a call have gone half a mile out of their way feeling the sidewalk only with their feet and not knowing when they turned it is a surprising and memorable as well as valuable experience to be lost in the woods any time often in a snowstorm even by day one will come out upon a wellknown road and yet find it impossible to tell which way leads to the village though he knows that he has travelled it a thousand times he cannot recognize a feature in it but it is as strange to him as if it were a road in siberia by night of course the perplexity is infinitely greater in our most trivial walks we are constantly though unconsciously steering like pilots by certain wellknown beacons and headlands and if we go beyond our usual course we still carry in our minds the bearing of some neighboring cape and not till we are completely lost or turned roundfor a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to be lostdo we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of nature every man has to learn the points of compass again as often as he awakes whether from sleep or any abstraction not till we are lost in other words not till we have lost the world do we begin to find ourselves and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations  one afternoon near the end of the first summer when i went to the village to get a shoe from the cobblers i was seized and put into jail because as i have elsewhere related i did not pay a tax to or recognize the authority of the state which buys and sells men women and children like cattle at the door of its senatehouse i had gone down to the woods for other purposes but wherever a man goes men will pursue and paw him with their dirty institutions and if they can constrain him to belong to their desperate oddfellow society it is true i might have resisted forcibly with more or less effect might have run amok against society but i preferred that society should run amok against me it being the desperate party however i was released the next day obtained my mended shoe and returned to the woods in season to get my dinner of huckleberries on fair haven hill i was never molested by any person but those who represented the state i had no lock nor bolt but for the desk which held my papers not even a nail to put over my latch or windows i never fastened my door night or day though i was to be absent several days not even when the next fall i spent a fortnight in the woods of maine and yet my house was more respected than if it had been surrounded by a file of soldiers the tired rambler could rest and warm himself by my fire the literary amuse himself with the few books on my table or the curious by opening my closet door see what was left of my dinner and what prospect i had of a supper yet though many people of every class came this way to the pond i suffered no serious inconvenience from these sources and i never missed anything but one small book a volume of homer which perhaps was improperly gilded and this i trust a soldier of our camp has found by this time i am convinced that if all men were to live as simply as i then did thieving and robbery would be unknown these take place only in communities where some have got more than is sufficient while others have not enough the popes homers would soon get properly distributed                        nec bella fuerunt          faginus astabat dum scyphus ante dapes                           nor wars did men molest          when only beechen bowls were in request  you who govern public affairs what need have you to employ punishments love virtue and the people will be virtuous the virtues of a superior man are like the wind the virtues of a common man are like the grassthe grass when the wind passes over it bends     the ponds   sometimes having had a surfeit of human society and gossip and worn out all my village friends i rambled still farther westward than i habitually dwell into yet more unfrequented parts of the town to fresh woods and pastures new or while the sun was setting made my supper of huckleberries and blueberries on fair haven hill and laid up a store for several days the fruits do not yield their true flavor to the purchaser of them nor to him who raises them for the market there is but one way to obtain it yet few take that way if you would know the flavor of huckleberries ask the cowboy or the partridge it is a vulgar error to suppose that you have tasted huckleberries who never plucked them a huckleberry never reaches boston they have not been known there since they grew on her three hills the ambrosial and essential part of the fruit is lost with the bloom which is rubbed off in the market cart and they become mere provender as long as eternal justice reigns not one innocent huckleberry can be transported thither from the countrys hills  occasionally after my hoeing was done for the day i joined some impatient companion who had been fishing on the pond since morning as silent and motionless as a duck or a floating leaf and after practising various kinds of philosophy had concluded commonly by the time i arrived that he belonged to the ancient sect of cænobites there was one older man an excellent fisher and skilled in all kinds of woodcraft who was pleased to look upon my house as a building erected for the convenience of fishermen and i was equally pleased when he sat in my doorway to arrange his lines once in a while we sat together on the pond he at one end of the boat and i at the other but not many words passed between us for he had grown deaf in his later years but he occasionally hummed a psalm which harmonized well enough with my philosophy our intercourse was thus altogether one of unbroken harmony far more pleasing to remember than if it had been carried on by speech when as was commonly the case i had none to commune with i used to raise the echoes by striking with a paddle on the side of my boat filling the surrounding woods with circling and dilating sound stirring them up as the keeper of a menagerie his wild beasts until i elicited a growl from every wooded vale and hillside  in warm evenings i frequently sat in the boat playing the flute and saw the perch which i seem to have charmed hovering around me and the moon travelling over the ribbed bottom which was strewed with the wrecks of the forest formerly i had come to this pond adventurously from time to time in dark summer nights with a companion and making a fire close to the waters edge which we thought attracted the fishes we caught pouts with a bunch of worms strung on a thread and when we had done far in the night threw the burning brands high into the air like skyrockets which coming down into the pond were quenched with a loud hissing and we were suddenly groping in total darkness through this whistling a tune we took our way to the haunts of men again but now i had made my home by the shore  sometimes after staying in a village parlor till the family had all retired i have returned to the woods and partly with a view to the next days dinner spent the hours of midnight fishing from a boat by moonlight serenaded by owls and foxes and hearing from time to time the creaking note of some unknown bird close at hand these experiences were very memorable and valuable to meanchored in forty feet of water and twenty or thirty rods from the shore surrounded sometimes by thousands of small perch and shiners dimpling the surface with their tails in the moonlight and communicating by a long flaxen line with mysterious nocturnal fishes which had their dwelling forty feet below or sometimes dragging sixty feet of line about the pond as i drifted in the gentle night breeze now and then feeling a slight vibration along it indicative of some life prowling about its extremity of dull uncertain blundering purpose there and slow to make up its mind at length you slowly raise pulling hand over hand some horned pout squeaking and squirming to the upper air it was very queer especially in dark nights when your thoughts had wandered to vast and cosmogonal themes in other spheres to feel this faint jerk which came to interrupt your dreams and link you to nature again it seemed as if i might next cast my line upward into the air as well as downward into this element which was scarcely more dense thus i caught two fishes as it were with one hook                                       the scenery of walden is on a humble scale and though very beautiful does not approach to grandeur nor can it much concern one who has not long frequented it or lived by its shore yet this pond is so remarkable for its depth and purity as to merit a particular description it is a clear and deep green well half a mile long and a mile and three quarters in circumference and contains about sixtyone and a half acres a perennial spring in the midst of pine and oak woods without any visible inlet or outlet except by the clouds and evaporation the surrounding hills rise abruptly from the water to the height of forty to eighty feet though on the southeast and east they attain to about one hundred and one hundred and fifty feet respectively within a quarter and a third of a mile they are exclusively woodland all our concord waters have two colors at least one when viewed at a distance and another more proper close at hand the first depends more on the light and follows the sky in clear weather in summer they appear blue at a little distance especially if agitated and at a great distance all appear alike in stormy weather they are sometimes of a dark slatecolor the sea however is said to be blue one day and green another without any perceptible change in the atmosphere i have seen our river when the landscape being covered with snow both water and ice were almost as green as grass some consider blue to be the color of pure water whether liquid or solid but looking directly down into our waters from a boat they are seen to be of very different colors walden is blue at one time and green at another even from the same point of view lying between the earth and the heavens it partakes of the color of both viewed from a hilltop it reflects the color of the sky but near at hand it is of a yellowish tint next the shore where you can see the sand then a light green which gradually deepens to a uniform dark green in the body of the pond in some lights viewed even from a hilltop it is of a vivid green next the shore some have referred this to the reflection of the verdure but it is equally green there against the railroad sandbank and in the spring before the leaves are expanded and it may be simply the result of the prevailing blue mixed with the yellow of the sand such is the color of its iris this is that portion also where in the spring the ice being warmed by the heat of the sun reflected from the bottom and also transmitted through the earth melts first and forms a narrow canal about the still frozen middle like the rest of our waters when much agitated in clear weather so that the surface of the waves may reflect the sky at the right angle or because there is more light mixed with it it appears at a little distance of a darker blue than the sky itself and at such a time being on its surface and looking with divided vision so as to see the reflection i have discerned a matchless and indescribable light blue such as watered or changeable silks and sword blades suggest more cerulean than the sky itself alternating with the original dark green on the opposite sides of the waves which last appeared but muddy in comparison it is a vitreous greenish blue as i remember it like those patches of the winter sky seen through cloud vistas in the west before sundown yet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air it is well known that a large plate of glass will have a green tint owing as the makers say to its body but a small piece of the same will be colorless how large a body of walden water would be required to reflect a green tint i have never proved the water of our river is black or a very dark brown to one looking directly down on it and like that of most ponds imparts to the body of one bathing in it a yellowish tinge but this water is of such crystalline purity that the body of the bather appears of an alabaster whiteness still more unnatural which as the limbs are magnified and distorted withal produces a monstrous effect making fit studies for a michael angelo  the water is so transparent that the bottom can easily be discerned at the depth of twentyfive or thirty feet paddling over it you may see many feet beneath the surface the schools of perch and shiners perhaps only an inch long yet the former easily distinguished by their transverse bars and you think that they must be ascetic fish that find a subsistence there once in the winter many years ago when i had been cutting holes through the ice in order to catch pickerel as i stepped ashore i tossed my axe back on to the ice but as if some evil genius had directed it it slid four or five rods directly into one of the holes where the water was twentyfive feet deep out of curiosity i lay down on the ice and looked through the hole until i saw the axe a little on one side standing on its head with its helve erect and gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond and there it might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off if i had not disturbed it making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which i had and cutting down the longest birch which i could find in the neighborhood with my knife i made a slipnoose which i attached to its end and letting it down carefully passed it over the knob of the handle and drew it by a line along the birch and so pulled the axe out again  the shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like pavingstones excepting one or two short sand beaches and is so steep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your head and were it not for its remarkable transparency that would be the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side some think it is bottomless it is nowhere muddy and a casual observer would say that there were no weeds at all in it and of noticeable plants except in the little meadows recently overflowed which do not properly belong to it a closer scrutiny does not detect a flag nor a bulrush nor even a lily yellow or white but only a few small heartleaves and potamogetons and perhaps a watertarget or two all which however a bather might not perceive and these plants are clean and bright like the element they grow in the stones extend a rod or two into the water and then the bottom is pure sand except in the deepest parts where there is usually a little sediment probably from the decay of the leaves which have been wafted on to it so many successive falls and a bright green weed is brought up on anchors even in midwinter  we have one other pond just like this white pond in nine acre corner about two and a half miles westerly but though i am acquainted with most of the ponds within a dozen miles of this centre i do not know a third of this pure and welllike character successive nations perchance have drank at admired and fathomed it and passed away and still its water is green and pellucid as ever not an intermitting spring perhaps on that spring morning when adam and eve were driven out of eden walden pond was already in existence and even then breaking up in a gentle spring rain accompanied with mist and a southerly wind and covered with myriads of ducks and geese which had not heard of the fall when still such pure lakes sufficed them even then it had commenced to rise and fall and had clarified its waters and colored them of the hue they now wear and obtained a patent of heaven to be the only walden pond in the world and distiller of celestial dews who knows in how many unremembered nations literatures this has been the castalian fountain or what nymphs presided over it in the golden age it is a gem of the first water which concord wears in her coronet  yet perchance the first who came to this well have left some trace of their footsteps i have been surprised to detect encircling the pond even where a thick wood has just been cut down on the shore a narrow shelflike path in the steep hillside alternately rising and falling approaching and receding from the waters edge as old probably as the race of man here worn by the feet of aboriginal hunters and still from time to time unwittingly trodden by the present occupants of the land this is particularly distinct to one standing on the middle of the pond in winter just after a light snow has fallen appearing as a clear undulating white line unobscured by weeds and twigs and very obvious a quarter of a mile off in many places where in summer it is hardly distinguishable close at hand the snow reprints it as it were in clear white type altorelievo the ornamented grounds of villas which will one day be built here may still preserve some trace of this  the pond rises and falls but whether regularly or not and within what period nobody knows though as usual many pretend to know it is commonly higher in the winter and lower in the summer though not corresponding to the general wet and dryness i can remember when it was a foot or two lower and also when it was at least five feet higher than when i lived by it there is a narrow sandbar running into it with very deep water on one side on which i helped boil a kettle of chowder some six rods from the main shore about the year 1824 which it has not been possible to do for twentyfive years and on the other hand my friends used to listen with incredulity when i told them that a few years later i was accustomed to fish from a boat in a secluded cove in the woods fifteen rods from the only shore they knew which place was long since converted into a meadow but the pond has risen steadily for two years and now in the summer of 52 is just five feet higher than when i lived there or as high as it was thirty years ago and fishing goes on again in the meadow this makes a difference of level at the outside of six or seven feet and yet the water shed by the surrounding hills is insignificant in amount and this overflow must be referred to causes which affect the deep springs this same summer the pond has begun to fall again it is remarkable that this fluctuation whether periodical or not appears thus to require many years for its accomplishment i have observed one rise and a part of two falls and i expect that a dozen or fifteen years hence the water will again be as low as i have ever known it flints pond a mile eastward allowing for the disturbance occasioned by its inlets and outlets and the smaller intermediate ponds also sympathize with walden and recently attained their greatest height at the same time with the latter the same is true as far as my observation goes of white pond  this rise and fall of walden at long intervals serves this use at least the water standing at this great height for a year or more though it makes it difficult to walk round it kills the shrubs and trees which have sprung up about its edge since the last risepitch pines birches alders aspens and othersand falling again leaves an unobstructed shore for unlike many ponds and all waters which are subject to a daily tide its shore is cleanest when the water is lowest on the side of the pond next my house a row of pitch pines fifteen feet high has been killed and tipped over as if by a lever and thus a stop put to their encroachments and their size indicates how many years have elapsed since the last rise to this height by this fluctuation the pond asserts its title to a shore and thus the shore is shorn and the trees cannot hold it by right of possession these are the lips of the lake on which no beard grows it licks its chaps from time to time when the water is at its height the alders willows and maples send forth a mass of fibrous red roots several feet long from all sides of their stems in the water and to the height of three or four feet from the ground in the effort to maintain themselves and i have known the high blueberry bushes about the shore which commonly produce no fruit bear an abundant crop under these circumstances  some have been puzzled to tell how the shore became so regularly paved my townsmen have all heard the traditionthe oldest people tell me that they heard it in their youththat anciently the indians were holding a powwow upon a hill here which rose as high into the heavens as the pond now sinks deep into the earth and they used much profanity as the story goes though this vice is one of which the indians were never guilty and while they were thus engaged the hill shook and suddenly sank and only one old squaw named walden escaped and from her the pond was named it has been conjectured that when the hill shook these stones rolled down its side and became the present shore it is very certain at any rate that once there was no pond here and now there is one and this indian fable does not in any respect conflict with the account of that ancient settler whom i have mentioned who remembers so well when he first came here with his diviningrod saw a thin vapor rising from the sward and the hazel pointed steadily downward and he concluded to dig a well here as for the stones many still think that they are hardly to be accounted for by the action of the waves on these hills but i observe that the surrounding hills are remarkably full of the same kind of stones so that they have been obliged to pile them up in walls on both sides of the railroad cut nearest the pond and moreover there are most stones where the shore is most abrupt so that unfortunately it is no longer a mystery to me i detect the paver if the name was not derived from that of some english localitysaffron walden for instanceone might suppose that it was called originally walledin pond  the pond was my well ready dug for four months in the year its water is as cold as it is pure at all times and i think that it is then as good as any if not the best in the town in the winter all water which is exposed to the air is colder than springs and wells which are protected from it the temperature of the pond water which had stood in the room where i sat from five oclock in the afternoon till noon the next day the sixth of march 1846 the thermometer having been up to 65º or 70º some of the time owing partly to the sun on the roof was 42º or one degree colder than the water of one of the coldest wells in the village just drawn the temperature of the boiling spring the same day was 45º or the warmest of any water tried though it is the coldest that i know of in summer when beside shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it moreover in summer walden never becomes so warm as most water which is exposed to the sun on account of its depth in the warmest weather i usually placed a pailful in my cellar where it became cool in the night and remained so during the day though i also resorted to a spring in the neighborhood it was as good when a week old as the day it was dipped and had no taste of the pump whoever camps for a week in summer by the shore of a pond needs only bury a pail of water a few feet deep in the shade of his camp to be independent of the luxury of ice  there have been caught in walden pickerel one weighing seven poundsto say nothing of another which carried off a reel with great velocity which the fisherman safely set down at eight pounds because he did not see himperch and pouts some of each weighing over two pounds shiners chivins or roach leuciscus pulchellus a very few breams and a couple of eels one weighing four poundsi am thus particular because the weight of a fish is commonly its only title to fame and these are the only eels i have heard of herealso i have a faint recollection of a little fish some five inches long with silvery sides and a greenish back somewhat dacelike in its character which i mention here chiefly to link my facts to fable nevertheless this pond is not very fertile in fish its pickerel though not abundant are its chief boast i have seen at one time lying on the ice pickerel of at least three different kinds a long and shallow one steelcolored most like those caught in the river a bright golden kind with greenish reflections and remarkably deep which is the most common here and another goldencolored and shaped like the last but peppered on the sides with small dark brown or black spots intermixed with a few faint bloodred ones very much like a trout the specific name reticulatus would not apply to this it should be guttatus rather these are all very firm fish and weigh more than their size promises the shiners pouts and perch also and indeed all the fishes which inhabit this pond are much cleaner handsomer and firmerfleshed than those in the river and most other ponds as the water is purer and they can easily be distinguished from them probably many ichthyologists would make new varieties of some of them there are also a clean race of frogs and tortoises and a few mussels in it muskrats and minks leave their traces about it and occasionally a travelling mudturtle visits it sometimes when i pushed off my boat in the morning i disturbed a great mudturtle which had secreted himself under the boat in the night ducks and geese frequent it in the spring and fall the whitebellied swallows hirundo bicolor skim over it and the peetweets totanus macularius teeter along its stony shores all summer i have sometimes disturbed a fish hawk sitting on a white pine over the water but i doubt if it is ever profaned by the wind of a gull like fair haven at most it tolerates one annual loon these are all the animals of consequence which frequent it now  you may see from a boat in calm weather near the sandy eastern shore where the water is eight or ten feet deep and also in some other parts of the pond some circular heaps half a dozen feet in diameter by a foot in height consisting of small stones less than a hens egg in size where all around is bare sand at first you wonder if the indians could have formed them on the ice for any purpose and so when the ice melted they sank to the bottom but they are too regular and some of them plainly too fresh for that they are similar to those found in rivers but as there are no suckers nor lampreys here i know not by what fish they could be made perhaps they are the nests of the chivin these lend a pleasing mystery to the bottom  the shore is irregular enough not to be monotonous i have in my minds eye the western indented with deep bays the bolder northern and the beautifully scalloped southern shore where successive capes overlap each other and suggest unexplored coves between the forest has never so good a setting nor is so distinctly beautiful as when seen from the middle of a small lake amid hills which rise from the waters edge for the water in which it is reflected not only makes the best foreground in such a case but with its winding shore the most natural and agreeable boundary to it there is no rawness nor imperfection in its edge there as where the axe has cleared a part or a cultivated field abuts on it the trees have ample room to expand on the water side and each sends forth its most vigorous branch in that direction there nature has woven a natural selvage and the eye rises by just gradations from the low shrubs of the shore to the highest trees there are few traces of mans hand to be seen the water laves the shore as it did a thousand years ago  a lake is the landscapes most beautiful and expressive feature it is earths eye looking into which the beholder measures the depth of his own nature the fluviatile trees next the shore are the slender eyelashes which fringe it and the wooded hills and cliffs around are its overhanging brows  standing on the smooth sandy beach at the east end of the pond in a calm september afternoon when a slight haze makes the opposite shoreline indistinct i have seen whence came the expression the glassy surface of a lake when you invert your head it looks like a thread of finest gossamer stretched across the valley and gleaming against the distant pine woods separating one stratum of the atmosphere from another you would think that you could walk dry under it to the opposite hills and that the swallows which skim over might perch on it indeed they sometimes dive below this line as it were by mistake and are undeceived as you look over the pond westward you are obliged to employ both your hands to defend your eyes against the reflected as well as the true sun for they are equally bright and if between the two you survey its surface critically it is literally as smooth as glass except where the skater insects at equal intervals scattered over its whole extent by their motions in the sun produce the finest imaginable sparkle on it or perchance a duck plumes itself or as i have said a swallow skims so low as to touch it it may be that in the distance a fish describes an arc of three or four feet in the air and there is one bright flash where it emerges and another where it strikes the water sometimes the whole silvery arc is revealed or here and there perhaps is a thistledown floating on its surface which the fishes dart at and so dimple it again it is like molten glass cooled but not congealed and the few motes in it are pure and beautiful like the imperfections in glass you may often detect a yet smoother and darker water separated from the rest as if by an invisible cobweb boom of the water nymphs resting on it from a hilltop you can see a fish leap in almost any part for not a pickerel or shiner picks an insect from this smooth surface but it manifestly disturbs the equilibrium of the whole lake it is wonderful with what elaborateness this simple fact is advertisedthis piscine murder will outand from my distant perch i distinguish the circling undulations when they are half a dozen rods in diameter you can even detect a waterbug gyrinus ceaselessly progressing over the smooth surface a quarter of a mile off for they furrow the water slightly making a conspicuous ripple bounded by two diverging lines but the skaters glide over it without rippling it perceptibly when the surface is considerably agitated there are no skaters nor waterbugs on it but apparently in calm days they leave their havens and adventurously glide forth from the shore by short impulses till they completely cover it it is a soothing employment on one of those fine days in the fall when all the warmth of the sun is fully appreciated to sit on a stump on such a height as this overlooking the pond and study the dimpling circles which are incessantly inscribed on its otherwise invisible surface amid the reflected skies and trees over this great expanse there is no disturbance but it is thus at once gently smoothed away and assuaged as when a vase of water is jarred the trembling circles seek the shore and all is smooth again not a fish can leap or an insect fall on the pond but it is thus reported in circling dimples in lines of beauty as it were the constant welling up of its fountain the gentle pulsing of its life the heaving of its breast the thrills of joy and thrills of pain are undistinguishable how peaceful the phenomena of the lake again the works of man shine as in the spring ay every leaf and twig and stone and cobweb sparkles now at midafternoon as when covered with dew in a spring morning every motion of an oar or an insect produces a flash of light and if an oar falls how sweet the echo  in such a day in september or october walden is a perfect forest mirror set round with stones as precious to my eye as if fewer or rarer nothing so fair so pure and at the same time so large as a lake perchance lies on the surface of the earth sky water it needs no fence nations come and go without defiling it it is a mirror which no stone can crack whose quicksilver will never wear off whose gilding nature continually repairs no storms no dust can dim its surface ever fresha mirror in which all impurity presented to it sinks swept and dusted by the suns hazy brushthis the light dustclothwhich retains no breath that is breathed on it but sends its own to float as clouds high above its surface and be reflected in its bosom still  a field of water betrays the spirit that is in the air it is continually receiving new life and motion from above it is intermediate in its nature between land and sky on land only the grass and trees wave but the water itself is rippled by the wind i see where the breeze dashes across it by the streaks or flakes of light it is remarkable that we can look down on its surface we shall perhaps look down thus on the surface of air at length and mark where a still subtler spirit sweeps over it  the skaters and waterbugs finally disappear in the latter part of october when the severe frosts have come and then and in november usually in a calm day there is absolutely nothing to ripple the surface one november afternoon in the calm at the end of a rainstorm of several days duration when the sky was still completely overcast and the air was full of mist i observed that the pond was remarkably smooth so that it was difficult to distinguish its surface though it no longer reflected the bright tints of october but the sombre november colors of the surrounding hills though i passed over it as gently as possible the slight undulations produced by my boat extended almost as far as i could see and gave a ribbed appearance to the reflections but as i was looking over the surface i saw here and there at a distance a faint glimmer as if some skater insects which had escaped the frosts might be collected there or perchance the surface being so smooth betrayed where a spring welled up from the bottom paddling gently to one of these places i was surprised to find myself surrounded by myriads of small perch about five inches long of a rich bronze color in the green water sporting there and constantly rising to the surface and dimpling it sometimes leaving bubbles on it in such transparent and seemingly bottomless water reflecting the clouds i seemed to be floating through the air as in a balloon and their swimming impressed me as a kind of flight or hovering as if they were a compact flock of birds passing just beneath my level on the right or left their fins like sails set all around them there were many such schools in the pond apparently improving the short season before winter would draw an icy shutter over their broad skylight sometimes giving to the surface an appearance as if a slight breeze struck it or a few raindrops fell there when i approached carelessly and alarmed them they made a sudden splash and rippling with their tails as if one had struck the water with a brushy bough and instantly took refuge in the depths at length the wind rose the mist increased and the waves began to run and the perch leaped much higher than before half out of water a hundred black points three inches long at once above the surface even as late as the fifth of december one year i saw some dimples on the surface and thinking it was going to rain hard immediately the air being full of mist i made haste to take my place at the oars and row homeward already the rain seemed rapidly increasing though i felt none on my cheek and i anticipated a thorough soaking but suddenly the dimples ceased for they were produced by the perch which the noise of my oars had seared into the depths and i saw their schools dimly disappearing so i spent a dry afternoon after all  an old man who used to frequent this pond nearly sixty years ago when it was dark with surrounding forests tells me that in those days he sometimes saw it all alive with ducks and other waterfowl and that there were many eagles about it he came here afishing and used an old log canoe which he found on the shore it was made of two white pine logs dug out and pinned together and was cut off square at the ends it was very clumsy but lasted a great many years before it became waterlogged and perhaps sank to the bottom he did not know whose it was it belonged to the pond he used to make a cable for his anchor of strips of hickory bark tied together an old man a potter who lived by the pond before the revolution told him once that there was an iron chest at the bottom and that he had seen it sometimes it would come floating up to the shore but when you went toward it it would go back into deep water and disappear i was pleased to hear of the old log canoe which took the place of an indian one of the same material but more graceful construction which perchance had first been a tree on the bank and then as it were fell into the water to float there for a generation the most proper vessel for the lake i remember that when i first looked into these depths there were many large trunks to be seen indistinctly lying on the bottom which had either been blown over formerly or left on the ice at the last cutting when wood was cheaper but now they have mostly disappeared  when i first paddled a boat on walden it was completely surrounded by thick and lofty pine and oak woods and in some of its coves grapevines had run over the trees next the water and formed bowers under which a boat could pass the hills which form its shores are so steep and the woods on them were then so high that as you looked down from the west end it had the appearance of an amphitheatre for some land of sylvan spectacle i have spent many an hour when i was younger floating over its surface as the zephyr willed having paddled my boat to the middle and lying on my back across the seats in a summer forenoon dreaming awake until i was aroused by the boat touching the sand and i arose to see what shore my fates had impelled me to days when idleness was the most attractive and productive industry many a forenoon have i stolen away preferring to spend thus the most valued part of the day for i was rich if not in money in sunny hours and summer days and spent them lavishly nor do i regret that i did not waste more of them in the workshop or the teachers desk but since i left those shores the woodchoppers have still further laid them waste and now for many a year there will be no more rambling through the aisles of the wood with occasional vistas through which you see the water my muse may be excused if she is silent henceforth how can you expect the birds to sing when their groves are cut down  now the trunks of trees on the bottom and the old log canoe and the dark surrounding woods are gone and the villagers who scarcely know where it lies instead of going to the pond to bathe or drink are thinking to bring its water which should be as sacred as the ganges at least to the village in a pipe to wash their dishes withto earn their walden by the turning of a cock or drawing of a plug that devilish iron horse whose earrending neigh is heard throughout the town has muddied the boiling spring with his foot and he it is that has browsed off all the woods on walden shore that trojan horse with a thousand men in his belly introduced by mercenary greeks where is the countrys champion the moore of moore hill to meet him at the deep cut and thrust an avenging lance between the ribs of the bloated pest  nevertheless of all the characters i have known perhaps walden wears best and best preserves its purity many men have been likened to it but few deserve that honor though the woodchoppers have laid bare first this shore and then that and the irish have built their sties by it and the railroad has infringed on its border and the icemen have skimmed it once it is itself unchanged the same water which my youthful eyes fell on all the change is in me it has not acquired one permanent wrinkle after all its ripples it is perennially young and i may stand and see a swallow dip apparently to pick an insect from its surface as of yore it struck me again tonight as if i had not seen it almost daily for more than twenty yearswhy here is walden the same woodland lake that i discovered so many years ago where a forest was cut down last winter another is springing up by its shore as lustily as ever the same thought is welling up to its surface that was then it is the same liquid joy and happiness to itself and its maker ay and it may be to me it is the work of a brave man surely in whom there was no guile he rounded this water with his hand deepened and clarified it in his thought and in his will bequeathed it to concord i see by its face that it is visited by the same reflection and i can almost say walden is it you                it is no dream of mine               to ornament a line               i cannot come nearer to god and heaven               than i live to walden even               i am its stony shore               and the breeze that passes oer               in the hollow of my hand               are its water and its sand               and its deepest resort               lies high in my thought  the cars never pause to look at it yet i fancy that the engineers and firemen and brakemen and those passengers who have a season ticket and see it often are better men for the sight the engineer does not forget at night or his nature does not that he has beheld this vision of serenity and purity once at least during the day though seen but once it helps to wash out state street and the engines soot one proposes that it be called gods drop  i have said that walden has no visible inlet nor outlet but it is on the one hand distantly and indirectly related to flints pond which is more elevated by a chain of small ponds coming from that quarter and on the other directly and manifestly to concord river which is lower by a similar chain of ponds through which in some other geological period it may have flowed and by a little digging which god forbid it can be made to flow thither again if by living thus reserved and austere like a hermit in the woods so long it has acquired such wonderful purity who would not regret that the comparatively impure waters of flints pond should be mingled with it or itself should ever go to waste its sweetness in the ocean wave                                       flints or sandy pond in lincoln our greatest lake and inland sea lies about a mile east of walden it is much larger being said to contain one hundred and ninetyseven acres and is more fertile in fish but it is comparatively shallow and not remarkably pure a walk through the woods thither was often my recreation it was worth the while if only to feel the wind blow on your cheek freely and see the waves run and remember the life of mariners i went achestnutting there in the fall on windy days when the nuts were dropping into the water and were washed to my feet and one day as i crept along its sedgy shore the fresh spray blowing in my face i came upon the mouldering wreck of a boat the sides gone and hardly more than the impression of its flat bottom left amid the rushes yet its model was sharply defined as if it were a large decayed pad with its veins it was as impressive a wreck as one could imagine on the seashore and had as good a moral it is by this time mere vegetable mould and undistinguishable pond shore through which rushes and flags have pushed up i used to admire the ripple marks on the sandy bottom at the north end of this pond made firm and hard to the feet of the wader by the pressure of the water and the rushes which grew in indian file in waving lines corresponding to these marks rank behind rank as if the waves had planted them there also i have found in considerable quantities curious balls composed apparently of fine grass or roots of pipewort perhaps from half an inch to four inches in diameter and perfectly spherical these wash back and forth in shallow water on a sandy bottom and are sometimes cast on the shore they are either solid grass or have a little sand in the middle at first you would say that they were formed by the action of the waves like a pebble yet the smallest are made of equally coarse materials half an inch long and they are produced only at one season of the year moreover the waves i suspect do not so much construct as wear down a material which has already acquired consistency they preserve their form when dry for an indefinite period  flints pond such is the poverty of our nomenclature what right had the unclean and stupid farmer whose farm abutted on this sky water whose shores he has ruthlessly laid bare to give his name to it some skinflint who loved better the reflecting surface of a dollar or a bright cent in which he could see his own brazen face who regarded even the wild ducks which settled in it as trespassers his fingers grown into crooked and bony talons from the long habit of grasping harpylikeso it is not named for me i go not there to see him nor to hear of him who never saw it who never bathed in it who never loved it who never protected it who never spoke a good word for it nor thanked god that he had made it rather let it be named from the fishes that swim in it the wild fowl or quadrupeds which frequent it the wild flowers which grow by its shores or some wild man or child the thread of whose history is interwoven with its own not from him who could show no title to it but the deed which a likeminded neighbor or legislature gave himhim who thought only of its money value whose presence perchance cursed all the shores who exhausted the land around it and would fain have exhausted the waters within it who regretted only that it was not english hay or cranberry meadowthere was nothing to redeem it forsooth in his eyesand would have drained and sold it for the mud at its bottom it did not turn his mill and it was no privilege to him to behold it i respect not his labors his farm where everything has its price who would carry the landscape who would carry his god to market if he could get anything for him who goes to market for his god as it is on whose farm nothing grows free whose fields bear no crops whose meadows no flowers whose trees no fruits but dollars who loves not the beauty of his fruits whose fruits are not ripe for him till they are turned to dollars give me the poverty that enjoys true wealth farmers are respectable and interesting to me in proportion as they are poorpoor farmers a model farm where the house stands like a fungus in a muckheap chambers for men horses oxen and swine cleansed and uncleansed all contiguous to one another stocked with men a great greasespot redolent of manures and buttermilk under a high state of cultivation being manured with the hearts and brains of men as if you were to raise your potatoes in the churchyard such is a model farm  no no if the fairest features of the landscape are to be named after men let them be the noblest and worthiest men alone let our lakes receive as true names at least as the icarian sea where still the shore a brave attempt resounds                                       goose pond of small extent is on my way to flints fair haven an expansion of concord river said to contain some seventy acres is a mile southwest and white pond of about forty acres is a mile and a half beyond fair haven this is my lake country these with concord river are my water privileges and night and day year in year out they grind such grist as i carry to them  since the woodcutters and the railroad and i myself have profaned walden perhaps the most attractive if not the most beautiful of all our lakes the gem of the woods is white ponda poor name from its commonness whether derived from the remarkable purity of its waters or the color of its sands in these as in other respects however it is a lesser twin of walden they are so much alike that you would say they must be connected under ground it has the same stony shore and its waters are of the same hue as at walden in sultry dogday weather looking down through the woods on some of its bays which are not so deep but that the reflection from the bottom tinges them its waters are of a misty bluishgreen or glaucous color many years since i used to go there to collect the sand by cartloads to make sandpaper with and i have continued to visit it ever since one who frequents it proposes to call it virid lake perhaps it might be called yellow pine lake from the following circumstance about fifteen years ago you could see the top of a pitch pine of the kind called yellow pine hereabouts though it is not a distinct species projecting above the surface in deep water many rods from the shore it was even supposed by some that the pond had sunk and this was one of the primitive forest that formerly stood there i find that even so long ago as 1792 in a topographical description of the town of concord by one of its citizens in the collections of the massachusetts historical society the author after speaking of walden and white ponds adds in the middle of the latter may be seen when the water is very low a tree which appears as if it grew in the place where it now stands although the roots are fifty feet below the surface of the water the top of this tree is broken off and at that place measures fourteen inches in diameter in the spring of 49 i talked with the man who lives nearest the pond in sudbury who told me that it was he who got out this tree ten or fifteen years before as near as he could remember it stood twelve or fifteen rods from the shore where the water was thirty or forty feet deep it was in the winter and he had been getting out ice in the forenoon and had resolved that in the afternoon with the aid of his neighbors he would take out the old yellow pine he sawed a channel in the ice toward the shore and hauled it over and along and out on to the ice with oxen but before he had gone far in his work he was surprised to find that it was wrong end upward with the stumps of the branches pointing down and the small end firmly fastened in the sandy bottom it was about a foot in diameter at the big end and he had expected to get a good sawlog but it was so rotten as to be fit only for fuel if for that he had some of it in his shed then there were marks of an axe and of woodpeckers on the butt he thought that it might have been a dead tree on the shore but was finally blown over into the pond and after the top had become waterlogged while the buttend was still dry and light had drifted out and sunk wrong end up his father eighty years old could not remember when it was not there several pretty large logs may still be seen lying on the bottom where owing to the undulation of the surface they look like huge water snakes in motion  this pond has rarely been profaned by a boat for there is little in it to tempt a fisherman instead of the white lily which requires mud or the common sweet flag the blue flag iris versicolor grows thinly in the pure water rising from the stony bottom all around the shore where it is visited by hummingbirds in june and the color both of its bluish blades and its flowers and especially their reflections is in singular harmony with the glaucous water  white pond and walden are great crystals on the surface of the earth lakes of light if they were permanently congealed and small enough to be clutched they would perchance be carried off by slaves like precious stones to adorn the heads of emperors but being liquid and ample and secured to us and our successors forever we disregard them and run after the diamond of kohinoor they are too pure to have a market value they contain no muck how much more beautiful than our lives how much more transparent than our characters are they we never learned meanness of them how much fairer than the pool before the farmers door in which his ducks swim hither the clean wild ducks come nature has no human inhabitant who appreciates her the birds with their plumage and their notes are in harmony with the flowers but what youth or maiden conspires with the wild luxuriant beauty of nature she flourishes most alone far from the towns where they reside talk of heaven ye disgrace earth     baker farm   sometimes i rambled to pine groves standing like temples or like fleets at sea fullrigged with wavy boughs and rippling with light so soft and green and shady that the druids would have forsaken their oaks to worship in them or to the cedar wood beyond flints pond where the trees covered with hoary blue berries spiring higher and higher are fit to stand before valhalla and the creeping juniper covers the ground with wreaths full of fruit or to swamps where the usnea lichen hangs in festoons from the white spruce trees and toadstools round tables of the swamp gods cover the ground and more beautiful fungi adorn the stumps like butterflies or shells vegetable winkles where the swamppink and dogwood grow the red alderberry glows like eyes of imps the waxwork grooves and crushes the hardest woods in its folds and the wild holly berries make the beholder forget his home with their beauty and he is dazzled and tempted by nameless other wild forbidden fruits too fair for mortal taste instead of calling on some scholar i paid many a visit to particular trees of kinds which are rare in this neighborhood standing far away in the middle of some pasture or in the depths of a wood or swamp or on a hilltop such as the black birch of which we have some handsome specimens two feet in diameter its cousin the yellow birch with its loose golden vest perfumed like the first the beech which has so neat a bole and beautifully lichenpainted perfect in all its details of which excepting scattered specimens i know but one small grove of sizable trees left in the township supposed by some to have been planted by the pigeons that were once baited with beechnuts near by it is worth the while to see the silver grain sparkle when you split this wood the bass the hornbeam the celtis occidentalis or false elm of which we have but one wellgrown some taller mast of a pine a shingle tree or a more perfect hemlock than usual standing like a pagoda in the midst of the woods and many others i could mention these were the shrines i visited both summer and winter  once it chanced that i stood in the very abutment of a rainbows arch which filled the lower stratum of the atmosphere tinging the grass and leaves around and dazzling me as if i looked through colored crystal it was a lake of rainbow light in which for a short while i lived like a dolphin if it had lasted longer it might have tinged my employments and life as i walked on the railroad causeway i used to wonder at the halo of light around my shadow and would fain fancy myself one of the elect one who visited me declared that the shadows of some irishmen before him had no halo about them that it was only natives that were so distinguished benvenuto cellini tells us in his memoirs that after a certain terrible dream or vision which he had during his confinement in the castle of st angelo a resplendent light appeared over the shadow of his head at morning and evening whether he was in italy or france and it was particularly conspicuous when the grass was moist with dew this was probably the same phenomenon to which i have referred which is especially observed in the morning but also at other times and even by moonlight though a constant one it is not commonly noticed and in the case of an excitable imagination like cellinis it would be basis enough for superstition beside he tells us that he showed it to very few but are they not indeed distinguished who are conscious that they are regarded at all                                       i set out one afternoon to go afishing to fair haven through the woods to eke out my scanty fare of vegetables my way led through pleasant meadow an adjunct of the baker farm that retreat of which a poet has since sung beginning                 thy entry is a pleasant field                 which some mossy fruit trees yield                 partly to a ruddy brook                 by gliding musquash undertook                 and mercurial trout                 darting about  i thought of living there before i went to walden i hooked the apples leaped the brook and scared the musquash and the trout it was one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely long before one in which many events may happen a large portion of our natural life though it was already half spent when i started by the way there came up a shower which compelled me to stand half an hour under a pine piling boughs over my head and wearing my handkerchief for a shed and when at length i had made one cast over the pickerelweed standing up to my middle in water i found myself suddenly in the shadow of a cloud and the thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that i could do no more than listen to it the gods must be proud thought i with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman so i made haste for shelter to the nearest hut which stood half a mile from any road but so much the nearer to the pond and had long been uninhabited                   and here a poet builded                      in the completed years                   for behold a trivial cabin                      that to destruction steers  so the muse fables but therein as i found dwelt now john field an irishman and his wife and several children from the broadfaced boy who assisted his father at his work and now came running by his side from the bog to escape the rain to the wrinkled sibyllike coneheaded infant that sat upon its fathers knee as in the palaces of nobles and looked out from its home in the midst of wet and hunger inquisitively upon the stranger with the privilege of infancy not knowing but it was the last of a noble line and the hope and cynosure of the world instead of john fields poor starveling brat there we sat together under that part of the roof which leaked the least while it showered and thundered without i had sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to america an honest hardworking but shiftless man plainly was john field and his wife she too was brave to cook so many successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove with round greasy face and bare breast still thinking to improve her condition one day with the never absent mop in one hand and yet no effects of it visible anywhere the chickens which had also taken shelter here from the rain stalked about the room like members of the family too humanized methought to roast well they stood and looked in my eye or pecked at my shoe significantly meanwhile my host told me his story how hard he worked bogging for a neighboring farmer turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and the use of the land with manure for one year and his little broadfaced son worked cheerfully at his fathers side the while not knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made i tried to help him with my experience telling him that he was one of my nearest neighbors and that i too who came afishing here and looked like a loafer was getting my living like himself that i lived in a tight light and clean house which hardly cost more than the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to and how if he chose he might in a month or two build himself a palace of his own that i did not use tea nor coffee nor butter nor milk nor fresh meat and so did not have to work to get them again as i did not work hard i did not have to eat hard and it cost me but a trifle for my food but as he began with tea and coffee and butter and milk and beef he had to work hard to pay for them and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again to repair the waste of his systemand so it was as broad as it was long indeed it was broader than it was long for he was discontented and wasted his life into the bargain and yet he had rated it as a gain in coming to america that here you could get tea and coffee and meat every day but the only true america is that country where you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these and where the state does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous expenses which directly or indirectly result from the use of such things for i purposely talked to him as if he were a philosopher or desired to be one i should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in a wild state if that were the consequence of mens beginning to redeem themselves a man will not need to study history to find out what is best for his own culture but alas the culture of an irishman is an enterprise to be undertaken with a sort of moral bog hoe i told him that as he worked so hard at bogging he required thick boots and stout clothing which yet were soon soiled and worn out but i wore light shoes and thin clothing which cost not half so much though he might think that i was dressed like a gentleman which however was not the case and in an hour or two without labor but as a recreation i could if i wished catch as many fish as i should want for two days or earn enough money to support me a week if he and his family would live simply they might all go ahuckleberrying in the summer for their amusement john heaved a sigh at this and his wife stared with arms akimbo and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough to begin such a course with or arithmetic enough to carry it through it was sailing by dead reckoning to them and they saw not clearly how to make their port so therefore i suppose they still take life bravely after their fashion face to face giving it tooth and nail not having skill to split its massive columns with any fine entering wedge and rout it in detailthinking to deal with it roughly as one should handle a thistle but they fight at an overwhelming disadvantageliving john field alas without arithmetic and failing so  do you ever fish i asked oh yes i catch a mess now and then when i am lying by good perch i catchwhats your bait i catch shiners with fishworms and bait the perch with them youd better go now john said his wife with glistening and hopeful face but john demurred  the shower was now over and a rainbow above the eastern woods promised a fair evening so i took my departure when i had got without i asked for a drink hoping to get a sight of the well bottom to complete my survey of the premises but there alas are shallows and quicksands and rope broken withal and bucket irrecoverable meanwhile the right culinary vessel was selected water was seemingly distilled and after consultation and long delay passed out to the thirsty onenot yet suffered to cool not yet to settle such gruel sustains life here i thought so shutting my eyes and excluding the motes by a skilfully directed undercurrent i drank to genuine hospitality the heartiest draught i could i am not squeamish in such cases when manners are concerned  as i was leaving the irishmans roof after the rain bending my steps again to the pond my haste to catch pickerel wading in retired meadows in sloughs and bogholes in forlorn and savage places appeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school and college but as i ran down the hill toward the reddening west with the rainbow over my shoulder and some faint tinkling sounds borne to my ear through the cleansed air from i know not what quarter my good genius seemed to saygo fish and hunt far and wide day by dayfarther and widerand rest thee by many brooks and hearthsides without misgiving remember thy creator in the days of thy youth rise free from care before the dawn and seek adventures let the noon find thee by other lakes and the night overtake thee everywhere at home there are no larger fields than these no worthier games than may here be played grow wild according to thy nature like these sedges and brakes which will never become english bay let the thunder rumble what if it threaten ruin to farmers crops that is not its errand to thee take shelter under the cloud while they flee to carts and sheds let not to get a living be thy trade but thy sport enjoy the land but own it not through want of enterprise and faith men are where they are buying and selling and spending their lives

own breath over again their shadows morning and evening reach farther than their daily steps we should come home from far from adventures and perils and discoveries every day with new experience and character  before i had reached the pond some fresh impulse had brought out john field with altered mind letting go bogging ere this sunset but he poor man disturbed only a couple of fins while i was catching a fair string and he said it was his luck but when we changed seats in the boat luck changed seats too poor john fieldi trust he does not read this unless he will improve by itthinking to live by some derivative oldcountry mode in this primitive new countryto catch perch with shiners it is good bait sometimes i allow with his horizon all his own yet he a poor man born to be poor with his inherited irish poverty or poor life his adams grandmother and boggy ways not to rise in this world he nor his posterity till their wading webbed bogtrotting feet get talaria to their heels     higher laws   as i came home through the woods with my string of fish trailing my pole it being now quite dark i caught a glimpse of a woodchuck stealing across my path and felt a strange thrill of savage delight and was strongly tempted to seize and devour him raw not that i was hungry then except for that wildness which he represented once or twice however while i lived at the pond i found myself ranging the woods like a halfstarved hound with a strange abandonment seeking some kind of venison which i might devour and no morsel could have been too savage for me the wildest scenes had become unaccountably familiar i found in myself and still find an instinct toward a higher or as it is named spiritual life as do most men and another toward a primitive rank and savage one and i reverence them both i love the wild not less than the good the wildness and adventure that are in fishing still recommended it to me i like sometimes to take rank hold on life and spend my day more as the animals do perhaps i have owed to this employment and to hunting when quite young my closest acquaintance with nature they early introduce us to and detain us in scenery with which otherwise at that age we should have little acquaintance fishermen hunters woodchoppers and others spending their lives in the fields and woods in a peculiar sense a part of nature themselves are often in a more favorable mood for observing her in the intervals of their pursuits than philosophers or poets even who approach her with expectation she is not afraid to exhibit herself to them the traveller on the prairie is naturally a hunter on the head waters of the missouri and columbia a trapper and at the falls of st mary a fisherman he who is only a traveller learns things at secondhand and by the halves and is poor authority we are most interested when science reports what those men already know practically or instinctively for that alone is a true humanity or account of human experience  they mistake who assert that the yankee has few amusements because he has not so many public holidays and men and boys do not play so many games as they do in england for here the more primitive but solitary amusements of hunting fishing and the like have not yet given place to the former almost every new england boy among my contemporaries shouldered a fowlingpiece between the ages of ten and fourteen and his hunting and fishing grounds were not limited like the preserves of an english nobleman but were more boundless even than those of a savage no wonder then that he did not oftener stay to play on the common but already a change is taking place owing not to an increased humanity but to an increased scarcity of game for perhaps the hunter is the greatest friend of the animals hunted not excepting the humane society  moreover when at the pond i wished sometimes to add fish to my fare for variety i have actually fished from the same kind of necessity that the first fishers did whatever humanity i might conjure up against it was all factitious and concerned my philosophy more than my feelings i speak of fishing only now for i had long felt differently about fowling and sold my gun before i went to the woods not that i am less humane than others but i did not perceive that my feelings were much affected i did not pity the fishes nor the worms this was habit as for fowling during the last years that i carried a gun my excuse was that i was studying ornithology and sought only new or rare birds but i confess that i am now inclined to think that there is a finer way of studying ornithology than this it requires so much closer attention to the habits of the birds that if for that reason only i have been willing to omit the gun yet notwithstanding the objection on the score of humanity i am compelled to doubt if equally valuable sports are ever substituted for these and when some of my friends have asked me anxiously about their boys whether they should let them hunt i have answered yesremembering that it was one of the best parts of my educationmake them hunters though sportsmen only at first if possible mighty hunters at last so that they shall not find game large enough for them in this or any vegetable wildernesshunters as well as fishers of men thus far i am of the opinion of chaucers nun who                   yave not of the text a pulled hen             that saith that hunters ben not holy men  there is a period in the history of the individual as of the race when the hunters are the best men as the algonquins called them we cannot but pity the boy who has never fired a gun he is no more humane while his education has been sadly neglected this was my answer with respect to those youths who were bent on this pursuit trusting that they would soon outgrow it no humane being past the thoughtless age of boyhood will wantonly murder any creature which holds its life by the same tenure that he does the hare in its extremity cries like a child i warn you mothers that my sympathies do not always make the usual philanthropic distinctions  such is oftenest the young mans introduction to the forest and the most original part of himself he goes thither at first as a hunter and fisher until at last if he has the seeds of a better life in him he distinguishes his proper objects as a poet or naturalist it may be and leaves the gun and fishpole behind the mass of men are still and always young in this respect in some countries a hunting parson is no uncommon sight such a one might make a good shepherds dog but is far from being the good shepherd i have been surprised to consider that the only obvious employment except woodchopping icecutting or the like business which ever to my knowledge detained at walden pond for a whole halfday any of my fellowcitizens whether fathers or children of the town with just one exception was fishing commonly they did not think that they were lucky or well paid for their time unless they got a long string of fish though they had the opportunity of seeing the pond all the while they might go there a thousand times before the sediment of fishing would sink to the bottom and leave their purpose pure but no doubt such a clarifying process would be going on all the while the governor and his council faintly remember the pond for they went afishing there when they were boys but now they are too old and dignified to go afishing and so they know it no more forever yet even they expect to go to heaven at last if the legislature regards it it is chiefly to regulate the number of hooks to be used there but they know nothing about the hook of hooks with which to angle for the pond itself impaling the legislature for a bait thus even in civilized communities the embryo man passes through the hunter stage of development  i have found repeatedly of late years that i cannot fish without falling a little in selfrespect i have tried it again and again i have skill at it and like many of my fellows a certain instinct for it which revives from time to time but always when i have done i feel that it would have been better if i had not fished i think that i do not mistake it is a faint intimation yet so are the first streaks of morning there is unquestionably this instinct in me which belongs to the lower orders of creation yet with every year i am less a fisherman though without more humanity or even wisdom at present i am no fisherman at all but i see that if i were to live in a wilderness i should again be tempted to become a fisher and hunter in earnest beside there is something essentially unclean about this diet and all flesh and i began to see where housework commences and whence the endeavor which costs so much to wear a tidy and respectable appearance each day to keep the house sweet and free from all ill odors and sights having been my own butcher and scullion and cook as well as the gentleman for whom the dishes were served up i can speak from an unusually complete experience the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth like many of my contemporaries i had rarely for many years used animal food or tea or coffee etc not so much because of any ill effects which i had traced to them as because they were not agreeable to my imagination the repugnance to animal food is not the effect of experience but is an instinct it appeared more beautiful to live low and fare hard in many respects and though i never did so i went far enough to please my imagination i believe that every man who has ever been earnest to preserve his higher or poetic faculties in the best condition has been particularly inclined to abstain from animal food and from much food of any kind it is a significant fact stated by entomologistsi find it in kirby and spencethat some insects in their perfect state though furnished with organs of feeding make no use of them and they lay it down as a general rule that almost all insects in this state eat much less than in that of larvæ the voracious caterpillar when transformed into a butterfly and the gluttonous maggot when become a fly content themselves with a drop or two of honey or some other sweet liquid the abdomen under the wings of the butterfly still represents the larva this is the tidbit which tempts his insectivorous fate the gross feeder is a man in the larva state and there are whole nations in that condition nations without fancy or imagination whose vast abdomens betray them  it is hard to provide and cook so simple and clean a diet as will not offend the imagination but this i think is to be fed when we feed the body they should both sit down at the same table yet perhaps this may be done the fruits eaten temperately need not make us ashamed of our appetites nor interrupt the worthiest pursuits but put an extra condiment into your dish and it will poison you it is not worth the while to live by rich cookery most men would feel shame if caught preparing with their own hands precisely such a dinner whether of animal or vegetable food as is every day prepared for them by others yet till this is otherwise we are not civilized and if gentlemen and ladies are not true men and women this certainly suggests what change is to be made it may be vain to ask why the imagination will not be reconciled to flesh and fat i am satisfied that it is not is it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal true he can and does live in a great measure by preying on other animals but this is a miserable wayas any one who will go to snaring rabbits or slaughtering lambs may learnand he will be regarded as a benefactor of his race who shall teach man to confine himself to a more innocent and wholesome diet whatever my own practice may be i have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race in its gradual improvement to leave off eating animals as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized  if one listens to the faintest but constant suggestions of his genius which are certainly true he sees not to what extremes or even insanity it may lead him and yet that way as he grows more resolute and faithful his road lies the faintest assured objection which one healthy man feels will at length prevail over the arguments and customs of mankind no man ever followed his genius till it misled him though the result were bodily weakness yet perhaps no one can say that the consequences were to be regretted for these were a life in conformity to higher principles if the day and the night are such that you greet them with joy and life emits a fragrance like flowers and sweetscented herbs is more elastic more starry more immortalthat is your success all nature is your congratulation and you have cause momentarily to bless yourself the greatest gains and values are farthest from being appreciated we easily come to doubt if they exist we soon forget them they are the highest reality perhaps the facts most astounding and most real are never communicated by man to man the true harvest of my daily life is somewhat as intangible and indescribable as the tints of morning or evening it is a little stardust caught a segment of the rainbow which i have clutched  yet for my part i was never unusually squeamish i could sometimes eat a fried rat with a good relish if it were necessary i am glad to have drunk water so long for the same reason that i prefer the natural sky to an opiumeaters heaven i would fain keep sober always and there are infinite degrees of drunkenness i believe that water is the only drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor and think of dashing the hopes of a morning with a cup of warm coffee or of an evening with a dish of tea ah how low i fall when i am tempted by them even music may be intoxicating such apparently slight causes destroyed greece and rome and will destroy england and america of all ebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes i have found it to be the most serious objection to coarse labors long continued that they compelled me to eat and drink coarsely also but to tell the truth i find myself at present somewhat less particular in these respects i carry less religion to the table ask no blessing not because i am wiser than i was but i am obliged to confess because however much it is to be regretted with years i have grown more coarse and indifferent perhaps these questions are entertained only in youth as most believe of poetry my practice is nowhere my opinion is here nevertheless i am far from regarding myself as one of those privileged ones to whom the ved refers when it says that he who has true faith in the omnipresent supreme being may eat all that exists that is is not bound to inquire what is his food or who prepares it and even in their case it is to be observed as a hindoo commentator has remarked that the vedant limits this privilege to the time of distress  who has not sometimes derived an inexpressible satisfaction from his food in which appetite had no share i have been thrilled to think that i owed a mental perception to the commonly gross sense of taste that i have been inspired through the palate that some berries which i had eaten on a hillside had fed my genius the soul not being mistress of herself says thsengtseu one looks and one does not see one listens and one does not hear one eats and one does not know the savor of food he who distinguishes the true savor of his food can never be a glutton he who does not cannot be otherwise a puritan may go to his brownbread crust with as gross an appetite as ever an alderman to his turtle not that food which entereth into the mouth defileth a man but the appetite with which it is eaten it is neither the quality nor the quantity but the devotion to sensual savors when that which is eaten is not a viand to sustain our animal or inspire our spiritual life but food for the worms that possess us if the hunter has a taste for mudturtles muskrats and other such savage tidbits the fine lady indulges a taste for jelly made of a calfs foot or for sardines from over the sea and they are even he goes to the millpond she to her preservepot the wonder is how they how you and i can live this slimy beastly life eating and drinking  our whole life is startlingly moral there is never an instants truce between virtue and vice goodness is the only investment that never fails in the music of the harp which trembles round the world it is the insisting on this which thrills us the harp is the travelling patterer for the universes insurance company recommending its laws and our little goodness is all the assessment that we pay though the youth at last grows indifferent the laws of the universe are not indifferent but are forever on the side of the most sensitive listen to every zephyr for some reproof for it is surely there and he is unfortunate who does not hear it we cannot touch a string or move a stop but the charming moral transfixes us many an irksome noise go a long way off is heard as music a proud sweet satire on the meanness of our lives  we are conscious of an animal in us which awakens in proportion as our higher nature slumbers it is reptile and sensual and perhaps cannot be wholly expelled like the worms which even in life and health occupy our bodies possibly we may withdraw from it but never change its nature i fear that it may enjoy a certain health of its own that we may be well yet not pure the other day i picked up the lower jaw of a hog with white and sound teeth and tusks which suggested that there was an animal health and vigor distinct from the spiritual this creature succeeded by other means than temperance and purity that in which men differ from brute beasts says mencius is a thing very inconsiderable the common herd lose it very soon superior men preserve it carefully who knows what sort of life would result if we had attained to purity if i knew so wise a man as could teach me purity i would go to seek him forthwith a command over our passions and over the external senses of the body and good acts are declared by the ved to be indispensable in the minds approximation to god yet the spirit can for the time pervade and control every member and function of the body and transmute what in form is the grossest sensuality into purity and devotion the generative energy which when we are loose dissipates and makes us unclean when we are continent invigorates and inspires us chastity is the flowering of man and what are called genius heroism holiness and the like are but various fruits which succeed it man flows at once to god when the channel of purity is open by turns our purity inspires and our impurity casts us down he is blessed who is assured that the animal is dying out in him day by day and the divine being established perhaps there is none but has cause for shame on account of the inferior and brutish nature to which he is allied i fear that we are such gods or demigods only as fauns and satyrs the divine allied to beasts the creatures of appetite and that to some extent our very life is our disgrace              how happys he who hath due place assigned              to his beasts and disafforested his mind                                               can use this horse goat wolf and evry beast              and is not ass himself to all the rest              else man not only is the herd of swine              but hes those devils too which did incline              them to a headlong rage and made them worse  all sensuality is one though it takes many forms all purity is one it is the same whether a man eat or drink or cohabit or sleep sensually they are but one appetite and we only need to see a person do any one of these things to know how great a sensualist he is the impure can neither stand nor sit with purity when the reptile is attacked at one mouth of his burrow he shows himself at another if you would be chaste you must be temperate what is chastity how shall a man know if he is chaste he shall not know it we have heard of this virtue but we know not what it is we speak conformably to the rumor which we have heard from exertion come wisdom and purity from sloth ignorance and sensuality in the student sensuality is a sluggish habit of mind an unclean person is universally a slothful one one who sits by a stove whom the sun shines on prostrate who reposes without being fatigued if you would avoid uncleanness and all the sins work earnestly though it be at cleaning a stable nature is hard to be overcome but she must be overcome what avails it that you are christian if you are not purer than the heathen if you deny yourself no more if you are not more religious i know of many systems of religion esteemed heathenish whose precepts fill the reader with shame and provoke him to new endeavors though it be to the performance of rites merely  i hesitate to say these things but it is not because of the subjecti care not how obscene my words arebut because i cannot speak of them without betraying my impurity we discourse freely without shame of one form of sensuality and are silent about another we are so degraded that we cannot speak simply of the necessary functions of human nature in earlier ages in some countries every function was reverently spoken of and regulated by law nothing was too trivial for the hindoo lawgiver however offensive it may be to modern taste he teaches how to eat drink cohabit void excrement and urine and the like elevating what is mean and does not falsely excuse himself by calling these things trifles  every man is the builder of a temple called his body to the god he worships after a style purely his own nor can he get off by hammering marble instead we are all sculptors and painters and our material is our own flesh and blood and bones any nobleness begins at once to refine a mans features any meanness or sensuality to imbrute them  john farmer sat at his door one september evening after a hard days work his mind still running on his labor more or less having bathed he sat down to recreate his intellectual man it was a rather cool evening and some of his neighbors were apprehending a frost he had not attended to the train of his thoughts long when he heard some one playing on a flute and that sound harmonized with his mood still he thought of his work but the burden of his thought was that though this kept running in his head and he found himself planning and contriving it against his will yet it concerned him very little it was no more than the scurf of his skin which was constantly shuffled off but the notes of the flute came home to his ears out of a different sphere from that he worked in and suggested work for certain faculties which slumbered in him they gently did away with the street and the village and the state in which he lived a voice said to himwhy do you stay here and live this mean moiling life when a glorious existence is possible for you those same stars twinkle over other fields than thesebut how to come out of this condition and actually migrate thither all that he could think of was to practise some new austerity to let his mind descend into his body and redeem it and treat himself with ever increasing respect     brute neighbors   sometimes i had a companion in my fishing who came through the village to my house from the other side of the town and the catching of the dinner was as much a social exercise as the eating of it  hermit i wonder what the world is doing now i have not heard so much as a locust over the sweetfern these three hours the pigeons are all asleep upon their roostsno flutter from them was that a farmers noon horn which sounded from beyond the woods just now the hands are coming in to boiled salt beef and cider and indian bread why will men worry themselves so he that does not eat need not work i wonder how much they have reaped who would live there where a body can never think for the barking of bose and oh the housekeeping to keep bright the devils doorknobs and scour his tubs this bright day better not keep a house say some hollow tree and then for morning calls and dinnerparties only a woodpecker tapping oh they swarm the sun is too warm there they are born too far into life for me i have water from the spring and a loaf of brown bread on the shelfhark i hear a rustling of the leaves is it some illfed village hound yielding to the instinct of the chase or the lost pig which is said to be in these woods whose tracks i saw after the rain it comes on apace my sumachs and sweetbriers trembleeh mr poet is it you how do you like the world today  poet see those clouds how they hang thats the greatest thing i have seen today theres nothing like it in old paintings nothing like it in foreign landsunless when we were off the coast of spain thats a true mediterranean sky i thought as i have my living to get and have not eaten today that i might go afishing thats the true industry for poets it is the only trade i have learned come lets along  hermit i cannot resist my brown bread will soon be gone i will go with you gladly soon but i am just concluding a serious meditation i think that i am near the end of it leave me alone then for a while but that we may not be delayed you shall be digging the bait meanwhile angleworms are rarely to be met with in these parts where the soil was never fattened with manure the race is nearly extinct the sport of digging the bait is nearly equal to that of catching the fish when ones appetite is not too keen and this you may have all to yourself today i would advise you to set in the spade down yonder among the groundnuts where you see the johnswort waving i think that i may warrant you one worm to every three sods you turn up if you look well in among the roots of the grass as if you were weeding or if you choose to go farther it will not be unwise for i have found the increase of fair bait to be very nearly as the squares of the distances  hermit alone let me see where was i methinks i was nearly in this frame of mind the world lay about at this angle shall i go to heaven or afishing if i should soon bring this meditation to an end would another so sweet occasion be likely to offer i was as near being resolved into the essence of things as ever i was in my life i fear my thoughts will not come back to me if it would do any good i would whistle for them when they make us an offer is it wise to say we will think of it my thoughts have left no track and i cannot find the path again what was it that i was thinking of it was a very hazy day i will just try these three sentences of confutsee they may fetch that state about again i know not whether it was the dumps or a budding ecstasy mem there never is but one opportunity of a kind  poet how now hermit is it too soon i have got just thirteen whole ones beside several which are imperfect or undersized but they will do for the smaller fry they do not cover up the hook so much those village worms are quite too large a shiner may make a meal off one without finding the skewer  hermit well then lets be off shall we to the concord theres good sport there if the water be not too high                                       why do precisely these objects which we behold make a world why has man just these species of animals for his neighbors as if nothing but a mouse could have filled this crevice i suspect that pilpay  co have put animals to their best use for they are all beasts of burden in a sense made to carry some portion of our thoughts  the mice which haunted my house were not the common ones which are said to have been introduced into the country but a wild native kind not found in the village i sent one to a distinguished naturalist and it interested him much when i was building one of these had its nest underneath the house and before i had laid the second floor and swept out the shavings would come out regularly at lunch time and pick up the crumbs at my feet it probably had never seen a man before and it soon became quite familiar and would run over my shoes and up my clothes it could readily ascend the sides of the room by short impulses like a squirrel which it resembled in its motions at length as i leaned with my elbow on the bench one day it ran up my clothes and along my sleeve and round and round the paper which held my dinner while i kept the latter close and dodged and played at bopeep with it and when at last i held still a piece of cheese between my thumb and finger it came and nibbled it sitting in my hand and afterward cleaned its face and paws like a fly and walked away  a phœbe soon built in my shed and a robin for protection in a pine which grew against the house in june the partridge tetrao umbellus which is so shy a bird led her brood past my windows from the woods in the rear to the front of my house clucking and calling to them like a hen and in all her behavior proving herself the hen of the woods the young suddenly disperse on your approach at a signal from the mother as if a whirlwind had swept them away and they so exactly resemble the dried leaves and twigs that many a traveler has placed his foot in the midst of a brood and heard the whir of the old bird as she flew off and her anxious calls and mewing or seen her trail her wings to attract his attention without suspecting their neighborhood the parent will sometimes roll and spin round before you in such a dishabille that you cannot for a few moments detect what kind of creature it is the young squat still and flat often running their heads under a leaf and mind only their mothers directions given from a distance nor will your approach make them run again and betray themselves you may even tread on them or have your eyes on them for a minute without discovering them i have held them in my open hand at such a time and still their only care obedient to their mother and their instinct was to squat there without fear or trembling so perfect is this instinct that once when i had laid them on the leaves again and one accidentally fell on its side it was found with the rest in exactly the same position ten minutes afterward they are not callow like the young of most birds but more perfectly developed and precocious even than chickens the remarkably adult yet innocent expression of their open and serene eyes is very memorable all intelligence seems reflected in them they suggest not merely the purity of infancy but a wisdom clarified by experience such an eye was not born when the bird was but is coeval with the sky it reflects the woods do not yield another such a gem the traveller does not often look into such a limpid well the ignorant or reckless sportsman often shoots the parent at such a time and leaves these innocents to fall a prey to some prowling beast or bird or gradually mingle with the decaying leaves which they so much resemble it is said that when hatched by a hen they will directly disperse on some alarm and so are lost for they never hear the mothers call which gathers them again these were my hens and chickens  it is remarkable how many creatures live wild and free though secret in the woods and still sustain themselves in the neighborhood of towns suspected by hunters only how retired the otter manages to live here he grows to be four feet long as big as a small boy perhaps without any human being getting a glimpse of him i formerly saw the raccoon in the woods behind where my house is built and probably still heard their whinnering at night commonly i rested an hour or two in the shade at noon after planting and ate my lunch and read a little by a spring which was the source of a swamp and of a brook oozing from under bristers hill half a mile from my field the approach to this was through a succession of descending grassy hollows full of young pitch pines into a larger wood about the swamp there in a very secluded and shaded spot under a spreading white pine there was yet a clean firm sward to sit on i had dug out the spring and made a well of clear gray water where i could dip up a pailful without roiling it and thither i went for this purpose almost every day in midsummer when the pond was warmest thither too the woodcock led her brood to probe the mud for worms flying but a foot above them down the bank while they ran in a troop beneath but at last spying me she would leave her young and circle round and round me nearer and nearer till within four or five feet pretending broken wings and legs to attract my attention and get off her young who would already have taken up their march with faint wiry peep single file through the swamp as she directed or i heard the peep of the young when i could not see the parent bird there too the turtle doves sat over the spring or fluttered from bough to bough of the soft white pines over my head or the red squirrel coursing down the nearest bough was particularly familiar and inquisitive you only need sit still long enough in some attractive spot in the woods that all its inhabitants may exhibit themselves to you by turns  i was witness to events of a less peaceful character one day when i went out to my woodpile or rather my pile of stumps i observed two large ants the one red the other much larger nearly half an inch long and black fiercely contending with one another having once got hold they never let go but struggled and wrestled and rolled on the chips incessantly looking farther i was surprised to find that the chips were covered with such combatants that it was not a duellum but a bellum a war between two races of ants the red always pitted against the black and frequently two red ones to one black the legions of these myrmidons covered all the hills and vales in my woodyard and the ground was already strewn with the dead and dying both red and black it was the only battle which i have ever witnessed the only battlefield i ever trod while the battle was raging internecine war the red republicans on the one hand and the black imperialists on the other on every side they were engaged in deadly combat yet without any noise that i could hear and human soldiers never fought so resolutely i watched a couple that were fast locked in each others embraces in a little sunny valley amid the chips now at noonday prepared to fight till the sun went down or life went out the smaller red champion had fastened himself like a vice to his adversarys front and through all the tumblings on that field never for an instant ceased to gnaw at one of his feelers near the root having already caused the other to go by the board while the stronger black one dashed him from side to side and as i saw on looking nearer had already divested him of several of his members they fought with more pertinacity than bulldogs neither manifested the least disposition to retreat it was evident that their battlecry was conquer or die in the meanwhile there came along a single red ant on the hillside of this valley evidently full of excitement who either had despatched his foe or had not yet taken part in the battle probably the latter for he had lost none of his limbs whose mother had charged him to return with his shield or upon it or perchance he was some achilles who had nourished his wrath apart and had now come to avenge or rescue his patroclus he saw this unequal combat from afarfor the blacks were nearly twice the size of the redhe drew near with rapid pace till he stood on his guard within half an inch of the combatants then watching his opportunity he sprang upon the black warrior and commenced his operations near the root of his right fore leg leaving the foe to select among his own members and so there were three united for life as if a new kind of attraction had been invented which put all other locks and cements to shame i should not have wondered by this time to find that they had their respective musical bands stationed on some eminent chip and playing their national airs the while to excite the slow and cheer the dying combatants i was myself excited somewhat even as if they had been men the more you think of it the less the difference and certainly there is not the fight recorded in concord history at least if in the history of america that will bear a moments comparison with this whether for the numbers engaged in it or for the patriotism and heroism displayed for numbers and for carnage it was an austerlitz or dresden concord fight two killed on the patriots side and luther blanchard wounded why here every ant was a buttrickfire for gods sake fireand thousands shared the fate of davis and hosmer there was not one hireling there i have no doubt that it was a principle they fought for as much as our ancestors and not to avoid a threepenny tax on their tea and the results of this battle will be as important and memorable to those whom it concerns as those of the battle of bunker hill at least  i took up the chip on which the three i have particularly described were struggling carried it into my house and placed it under a tumbler on my windowsill in order to see the issue holding a microscope to the firstmentioned red ant i saw that though he was assiduously gnawing at the near fore leg of his enemy having severed his remaining feeler his own breast was all torn away exposing what vitals he had there to the jaws of the black warrior whose breastplate was apparently too thick for him to pierce and the dark carbuncles of the sufferers eyes shone with ferocity such as war only could excite they struggled half an hour longer under the tumbler and when i looked again the black soldier had severed the heads of his foes from their bodies and the still living heads were hanging on either side of him like ghastly trophies at his saddlebow still apparently as firmly fastened as ever and he was endeavoring with feeble struggles being without feelers and with only the remnant of a leg and i know not how many other wounds to divest himself of them which at length after half an hour more he accomplished i raised the glass and he went off over the windowsill in that crippled state whether he finally survived that combat and spent the remainder of his days in some hotel des invalides i do not know but i thought that his industry would not be worth much thereafter i never learned which party was victorious nor the cause of the war but i felt for the rest of that day as if i had had my feelings excited and harrowed by witnessing the struggle the ferocity and carnage of a human battle before my door  kirby and spence tell us that the battles of ants have long been celebrated and the date of them recorded though they say that huber is the only modern author who appears to have witnessed them Æneas sylvius say they after giving a very circumstantial account of one contested with great obstinacy by a great and small species on the trunk of a pear tree adds that this action was fought in the pontificate of eugenius the fourth in the presence of nicholas pistoriensis an eminent lawyer who related the whole history of the battle with the greatest fidelity a similar engagement between great and small ants is recorded by olaus magnus in which the small ones being victorious are said to have buried the bodies of their own soldiers but left those of their giant enemies a prey to the birds this event happened previous to the expulsion of the tyrant christiern the second from sweden the battle which i witnessed took place in the presidency of polk five years before the passage of websters fugitiveslave bill  many a village bose fit only to course a mudturtle in a victualling cellar sported his heavy quarters in the woods without the knowledge of his master and ineffectually smelled at old fox burrows and woodchucks holes led perchance by some slight cur which nimbly threaded the wood and might still inspire a natural terror in its denizensnow far behind his guide barking like a canine bull toward some small squirrel which had treed itself for scrutiny then cantering off bending the bushes with his weight imagining that he is on the track of some stray member of the jerbilla family once i was surprised to see a cat walking along the stony shore of the pond for they rarely wander so far from home the surprise was mutual nevertheless the most domestic cat which has lain on a rug all her days appears quite at home in the woods and by her sly and stealthy behavior proves herself more native there than the regular inhabitants once when berrying i met with a cat with young kittens in the woods quite wild and they all like their mother had their backs up and were fiercely spitting at me a few years before i lived in the woods there was what was called a winged cat in one of the farmhouses in lincoln nearest the pond mr gilian bakers when i called to see her in june 1842 she was gone ahunting in the woods as was her wont i am not sure whether it was a male or female and so use the more common pronoun but her mistress told me that she came into the neighborhood a little more than a year before in april and was finally taken into their house that she was of a dark brownishgray color with a white spot on her throat and white feet and had a large bushy tail like a fox that in the winter the fur grew thick and flatted out along her sides forming stripes ten or twelve inches long by two and a half wide and under her chin like a muff the upper side loose the under matted like felt and in the spring these appendages dropped off they gave me a pair of her wings which i keep still there is no appearance of a membrane about them some thought it was part flying squirrel or some other wild animal which is not impossible for according to naturalists prolific hybrids have been produced by the union of the marten and domestic cat this would have been the right kind of cat for me to keep if i had kept any for why should not a poets cat be winged as well as his horse  in the fall the loon colymbus glacialis came as usual to moult and bathe in the pond making the woods ring with his wild laughter before i had risen at rumor of his arrival all the milldam sportsmen are on the alert in gigs and on foot two by two and three by three with patent rifles and conical balls and spyglasses they come rustling through the woods like autumn leaves at least ten men to one loon some station themselves on this side of the pond some on that for the poor bird cannot be omnipresent if he dive here he must come up there but now the kind october wind rises rustling the leaves and rippling the surface of the water so that no loon can be heard or seen though his foes sweep the pond with spyglasses and make the woods resound with their discharges the waves generously rise and dash angrily taking sides with all waterfowl and our sportsmen must beat a retreat to town and shop and unfinished jobs but they were too often successful when i went to get a pail of water early in the morning i frequently saw this stately bird sailing out of my cove within a few rods if i endeavored to overtake him in a boat in order to see how he would manoeuvre he would dive and be completely lost so that i did not discover him again sometimes till the latter part of the day but i was more than a match for him on the surface he commonly went off in a rain  as i was paddling along the north shore one very calm october afternoon for such days especially they settle on to the lakes like the milkweed down having looked in vain over the pond for a loon suddenly one sailing out from the shore toward the middle a few rods in front of me set up his wild laugh and betrayed himself i pursued with a paddle and he dived but when he came up i was nearer than before he dived again but i miscalculated the direction he would take and we were fifty rods apart when he came to the surface this time for i had helped to widen the interval and again he laughed long and loud and with more reason than before he manoeuvred so cunningly that i could not get within half a dozen rods of him each time when he came to the surface turning his head this way and that he cooly surveyed the water and the land and apparently chose his course so that he might come up where there was the widest expanse of water and at the greatest distance from the boat it was surprising how quickly he made up his mind and put his resolve into execution he led me at once to the widest part of the pond and could not be driven from it while he was thinking one thing in his brain i was endeavoring to divine his thought in mine it was a pretty game played on the smooth surface of the pond a man against a loon suddenly your adversarys checker disappears beneath the board and the problem is to place yours nearest to where his will appear again sometimes he would come up unexpectedly on the opposite side of me having apparently passed directly under the boat so longwinded was he and so unweariable that when he had swum farthest he would immediately plunge again nevertheless and then no wit could divine where in the deep pond beneath the smooth surface he might be speeding his way like a fish for he had time and ability to visit the bottom of the pond in its deepest part it is said that loons have been caught in the new york lakes eighty feet beneath the surface with hooks set for troutthough walden is deeper than that how surprised must the fishes be to see this ungainly visitor from another sphere speeding his way amid their schools yet he appeared to know his course as surely under water as on the surface and swam much faster there once or twice i saw a ripple where he approached the surface just put his head out to reconnoitre and instantly dived again i found that it was as well for me to rest on my oars and wait his reappearing as to endeavor to calculate where he would rise for again and again when i was straining my eyes over the surface one way i would suddenly be startled by his unearthly laugh behind me but why after displaying so much cunning did he invariably betray himself the moment he came up by that loud laugh did not his white breast enough betray him he was indeed a silly loon i thought i could commonly hear the splash of the water when he came up and so also detected him but after an hour he seemed as fresh as ever dived as willingly and swam yet farther than at first it was surprising to see how serenely he sailed off with unruffled breast when he came to the surface doing all the work with his webbed feet beneath his usual note was this demoniac laughter yet somewhat like that of a waterfowl but occasionally when he had balked me most successfully and come up a long way off he uttered a longdrawn unearthly howl probably more like that of a wolf than any bird as when a beast puts his muzzle to the ground and deliberately howls this was his looningperhaps the wildest sound that is ever heard here making the woods ring far and wide i concluded that he laughed in derision of my efforts confident of his own resources though the sky was by this time overcast the pond was so smooth that i could see where he broke the surface when i did not hear him his white breast the stillness of the air and the smoothness of the water were all against him at length having come up fifty rods off he uttered one of those prolonged howls as if calling on the god of loons to aid him and immediately there came a wind from the east and rippled the surface and filled the whole air with misty rain and i was impressed as if it were the prayer of the loon answered and his god was angry with me and so i left him disappearing far away on the tumultuous surface  for hours in fall days i watched the ducks cunningly tack and veer and hold the middle of the pond far from the sportsman tricks which they will have less need to practise in louisiana bayous when compelled to rise they would sometimes circle round and round and over the pond at a considerable height from which they could easily see to other ponds and the river like black motes in the sky and when i thought they had gone off thither long since they would settle down by a slanting flight of a quarter of a mile on to a distant part which was left free but what beside safety they got by sailing in the middle of walden i do not know unless they love its water for the same reason that i do     housewarming   in october i went agraping to the river meadows and loaded myself with clusters more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food there too i admired though i did not gather the cranberries small waxen gems pendants of the meadow grass pearly and red which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only and sells the spoils of the meads to boston and new york destined to be jammed to satisfy the tastes of lovers of nature there so butchers rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass regardless of the torn and drooping plant the barberrys brilliant fruit was likewise food for my eyes merely but i collected a small store of wild apples for coddling which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked when chestnuts were ripe i laid up half a bushel for winter it was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of lincolnthey now sleep their long sleep under the railroadwith a bag on my shoulder and a stick to open burs with in my hand for i did not always wait for the frost amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red squirrels and the jays whose halfconsumed nuts i sometimes stole for the burs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones occasionally i climbed and shook the trees they grew also behind my house and one large tree which almost overshadowed it was when in flower a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit the last coming in flocks early in the morning and picking the nuts out of the burs before they fell i relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut these nuts as far as they went were a good substitute for bread many other substitutes might perhaps be found digging one day for fishworms i discovered the groundnut apios tuberosa on its string the potato of the aborigines a sort of fabulous fruit which i had begun to doubt if i had ever dug and eaten in childhood as i had told and had not dreamed it i had often since seen its crumpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the same cultivation has wellnigh exterminated it it has a sweetish taste much like that of a frostbitten potato and i found it better boiled than roasted this tuber seemed like a faint promise of nature to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future period in these days of fatted cattle and waving grainfields this humble root which was once the totem of an indian tribe is quite forgotten or known only by its flowering vine but let wild nature reign here once more and the tender and luxurious english grains will probably disappear before a myriad of foes and without the care of man the crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great cornfield of the indians god in the southwest whence he is said to have brought it but the now almost exterminated groundnut will perhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness prove itself indigenous and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the hunter tribe some indian ceres or minerva must have been the inventor and bestower of it and when the reign of poetry commences here its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of art  already by the first of september i had seen two or three small maples turned scarlet across the pond beneath where the white stems of three aspens diverged at the point of a promontory next the water ah many a tale their color told and gradually from week to week the character of each tree came out and it admired itself reflected in the smooth mirror of the lake each morning the manager of this gallery substituted some new picture distinguished by more brilliant or harmonious coloring for the old upon the walls  the wasps came by thousands to my lodge in october as to winter quarters and settled on my windows within and on the walls overhead sometimes deterring visitors from entering each morning when they were numbed with cold i swept some of them out but i did not trouble myself much to get rid of them i even felt complimented by their regarding my house as a desirable shelter they never molested me seriously though they bedded with me and they gradually disappeared into what crevices i do not know avoiding winter and unspeakable cold  like the wasps before i finally went into winter quarters in november i used to resort to the northeast side of walden which the sun reflected from the pitch pine woods and the stony shore made the fireside of the pond it is so much pleasanter and wholesomer to be warmed by the sun while you can be than by an artificial fire i thus warmed myself by the still glowing embers which the summer like a departed hunter had left                                       when i came to build my chimney i studied masonry my bricks being secondhand ones required to be cleaned with a trowel so that i learned more than usual of the qualities of bricks and trowels the mortar on them was fifty years old and was said to be still growing harder but this is one of those sayings which men love to repeat whether they are true or not such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age and it would take many blows with a trowel to clean an old wiseacre of them many of the villages of mesopotamia are built of secondhand bricks of a very good quality obtained from the ruins of babylon and the cement on them is older and probably harder still however that may be i was struck by the peculiar toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being worn out as my bricks had been in a chimney before though i did not read the name of nebuchadnezzar on them i picked out as many fireplace bricks as i could find to save work and waste and i filled the spaces between the bricks about the fireplace with stones from the pond shore and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place i lingered most about the fireplace as the most vital part of the house indeed i worked so deliberately that though i commenced at the ground in the morning a course of bricks raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at night yet i did not get a stiff neck for it that i remember my stiff neck is of older date i took a poet to board for a fortnight about those times which caused me to be put to it for room he brought his own knife though i had two and we used to scour them by thrusting them into the earth he shared with me the labors of cooking i was pleased to see my work rising so square and solid by degrees and reflected that if it proceeded slowly it was calculated to endure a long time the chimney is to some extent an independent structure standing on the ground and rising through the house to the heavens even after the house is burned it still stands sometimes and its importance and independence are apparent this was toward the end of summer it was now november                                       the north wind had already begun to cool the pond though it took many weeks of steady blowing to accomplish it it is so deep when i began to have a fire at evening before i plastered my house the chimney carried smoke particularly well because of the numerous chinks between the boards yet i passed some cheerful evenings in that cool and airy apartment surrounded by the rough brown boards full of knots and rafters with the bark on high overhead my house never pleased my eye so much after it was plastered though i was obliged to confess that it was more comfortable should not every apartment in which man dwells be lofty enough to create some obscurity overhead where flickering shadows may play at evening about the rafters these forms are more agreeable to the fancy and imagination than fresco paintings or other the most expensive furniture i now first began to inhabit my house i may say when i began to use it for warmth as well as shelter i had got a couple of old firedogs to keep the wood from the hearth and it did me good to see the soot form on the back of the chimney which i had built and i poked the fire with more right and more satisfaction than usual my dwelling was small and i could hardly entertain an echo in it but it seemed larger for being a single apartment and remote from neighbors all the attractions of a house were concentrated in one room it was kitchen chamber parlor and keepingroom and whatever satisfaction parent or child master or servant derive from living in a house i enjoyed it all cato says the master of a family patremfamilias must have in his rustic villa cellam oleariam vinariam dolia multa uti lubeat caritatem expectare et rei et virtuti et gloriae erit that is an oil and wine cellar many casks so that it may be pleasant to expect hard times it will be for his advantage and virtue and glory i had in my cellar a firkin of potatoes about two quarts of peas with the weevil in them and on my shelf a little rice a jug of molasses and of rye and indian meal a peck each  i sometimes dream of a larger and more populous house standing in a golden age of enduring materials and without gingerbread work which shall still consist of only one room a vast rude substantial primitive hall without ceiling or plastering with bare rafters and purlins supporting a sort of lower heaven over ones headuseful to keep off rain and snow where the king and queen posts stand out to receive your homage when you have done reverence to the prostrate saturn of an older dynasty on stepping over the sill a cavernous house wherein you must reach up a torch upon a pole to see the roof where some may live in the fireplace some in the recess of a window and some on settles some at one end of the hall some at another and some aloft on rafters with the spiders if they choose a house which you have got into when you have opened the outside door and the ceremony is over where the weary traveller may wash and eat and converse and sleep without further journey such a shelter as you would be glad to reach in a tempestuous night containing all the essentials of a house and nothing for housekeeping where you can see all the treasures of the house at one view and everything hangs upon its peg that a man should use at once kitchen pantry parlor chamber storehouse and garret where you can see so necessary a thing as a barrel or a ladder so convenient a thing as a cupboard and hear the pot boil and pay your respects to the fire that cooks your dinner and the oven that bakes your bread and the necessary furniture and utensils are the chief ornaments where the washing is not put out nor the fire nor the mistress and perhaps you are sometimes requested to move from off the trapdoor when the cook would descend into the cellar and so learn whether the ground is solid or hollow beneath you without stamping a house whose inside is as open and manifest as a birds nest and you cannot go in at the front door and out at the back without seeing some of its inhabitants where to be a guest is to be presented with the freedom of the house and not to be carefully excluded from seven eighths of it shut up in a particular cell and told to make yourself at home therein solitary confinement nowadays the host does not admit you to his hearth but has got the mason to build one for yourself somewhere in his alley and hospitality is the art of keeping you at the greatest distance there is as much secrecy about the cooking as if he had a design to poison you i am aware that i have been on many a mans premises and might have been legally ordered off but i am not aware that i have been in many mens houses i might visit in my old clothes a king and queen who lived simply in such a house as i have described if i were going their way but backing out of a modern palace will be all that i shall desire to learn if ever i am caught in one  it would seem as if the very language of our parlors would lose all its nerve and degenerate into palaver wholly our lives pass at such remoteness from its symbols and its metaphors and tropes are necessarily so far fetched through slides and dumbwaiters as it were in other words the parlor is so far from the kitchen and workshop the dinner even is only the parable of a dinner commonly as if only the savage dwelt near enough to nature and truth to borrow a trope from them how can the scholar who dwells away in the north west territory or the isle of man tell what is parliamentary in the kitchen  however only one or two of my guests were ever bold enough to stay and eat a hastypudding with me but when they saw that crisis approaching they beat a hasty retreat rather as if it would shake the house to its foundations nevertheless it stood through a great many hastypuddings  i did not plaster till it was freezing weather i brought over some whiter and cleaner sand for this purpose from the opposite shore of the pond in a boat a sort of conveyance which would have tempted me to go much farther if necessary my house had in the meanwhile been shingled down to the ground on every side in lathing i was pleased to be able to send home each nail with a single blow of the hammer and it was my ambition to transfer the plaster from the board to the wall neatly and rapidly i remembered the story of a conceited fellow who in fine clothes was wont to lounge about the village once giving advice to workmen venturing one day to substitute deeds for words he turned up his cuffs seized a plasterers board and having loaded his trowel without mishap with a complacent look toward the lathing overhead made a bold gesture thitherward and straightway to his complete discomfiture received the whole contents in his ruffled bosom i admired anew the economy and convenience of plastering which so effectually shuts out the cold and takes a handsome finish and i learned the various casualties to which the plasterer is liable i was surprised to see how thirsty the bricks were which drank up all the moisture in my plaster before i had smoothed it and how many pailfuls of water it takes to christen a new hearth i had the previous winter made a small quantity of lime by burning the shells of the unio fluviatilis which our river affords for the sake of the experiment so that i knew where my materials came from i might have got good limestone within a mile or two and burned it myself if i had cared to do so                                       the pond had in the meanwhile skimmed over in the shadiest and shallowest coves some days or even weeks before the general freezing the first ice is especially interesting and perfect being hard dark and transparent and affords the best opportunity that ever offers for examining the bottom where it is shallow for you can lie at your length on ice only an inch thick like a skater insect on the surface of the water and study the bottom at your leisure only two or three inches distant like a picture behind a glass and the water is necessarily always smooth then there are many furrows in the sand where some creature has travelled about and doubled on its tracks and for wrecks it is strewn with the cases of caddisworms made of minute grains of white quartz perhaps these have creased it for you find some of their cases in the furrows though they are deep and broad for them to make but the ice itself is the object of most interest though you must improve the earliest opportunity to study it if you examine it closely the morning after it freezes you find that the greater part of the bubbles which at first appeared to be within it are against its under surface and that more are continually rising from the bottom while the ice is as yet comparatively solid and dark that is you see the water through it these bubbles are from an eightieth to an eighth of an inch in diameter very clear and beautiful and you see your face reflected in them through the ice there may be thirty or forty of them to a square inch there are also already within the ice narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long sharp cones with the apex upward or oftener if the ice is quite fresh minute spherical bubbles one directly above another like a string of beads but these within the ice are not so numerous nor obvious as those beneath i sometimes used to cast on stones to try the strength of the ice and those which broke through carried in air with them which formed very large and conspicuous white bubbles beneath one day when i came to the same place fortyeight hours afterward i found that those large bubbles were still perfect though an inch more of ice had formed as i could see distinctly by the seam in the edge of a cake but as the last two days had been very warm like an indian summer the ice was not now transparent showing the dark green color of the water and the bottom but opaque and whitish or gray and though twice as thick was hardly stronger than before for the air bubbles had greatly expanded under this heat and run together and lost their regularity they were no longer one directly over another but often like silvery coins poured from a bag one overlapping another or in thin flakes as if occupying slight cleavages the beauty of the ice was gone and it was too late to study the bottom being curious to know what position my great bubbles occupied with regard to the new ice i broke out a cake containing a middling sized one and turned it bottom upward the new ice had formed around and under the bubble so that it was included between the two ices it was wholly in the lower ice but close against the upper and was flattish or perhaps slightly lenticular with a rounded edge a quarter of an inch deep by four inches in diameter and i was surprised to find that directly under the bubble the ice was melted with great regularity in the form of a saucer reversed to the height of five eighths of an inch in the middle leaving a thin partition there between the water and the bubble hardly an eighth of an inch thick and in many places the small bubbles in this partition had burst out downward and probably there was no ice at all under the largest bubbles which were a foot in diameter i inferred that the infinite number of minute bubbles which i had first seen against the under surface of the ice were now frozen in likewise and that each in its degree had operated like a burningglass on the ice beneath to melt and rot it these are the little airguns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop                                       at length the winter set in good earnest just as i had finished plastering and the wind began to howl around the house as if it had not had permission to do so till then night after night the geese came lumbering in the dark with a clangor and a whistling of wings even after the ground was covered with snow some to alight in walden and some flying low over the woods toward fair haven bound for mexico several times when returning from the village at ten or eleven oclock at night i heard the tread of a flock of geese or else ducks on the dry leaves in the woods by a pondhole behind my dwelling where they had come up to feed and the faint honk or quack of their leader as they hurried off in 1845 walden froze entirely over for the first time on the night of the 22d of december flints and other shallower ponds and the river having been frozen ten days or more in 46 the 16th in 49 about the 31st and in 50 about the 27th of december in 52 the 5th of january in 53 the 31st of december the snow had already covered the ground since the 25th of november and surrounded me suddenly with the scenery of winter i withdrew yet farther into my shell and endeavored to keep a bright fire both within my house and within my breast my employment out of doors now was to collect the dead wood in the forest bringing it in my hands or on my shoulders or sometimes trailing a dead pine tree under each arm to my shed an old forest fence which had seen its best days was a great haul for me i sacrificed it to vulcan for it was past serving the god terminus how much more interesting an event is that mans supper who has just been forth in the snow to hunt nay you might say steal the fuel to cook it with his bread and meat are sweet there are enough fagots and waste wood of all kinds in the forests of most of our towns to support many fires but which at present warm none and some think hinder the growth of the young wood there was also the driftwood of the pond in the course of the summer i had discovered a raft of pitch pine logs with the bark on pinned together by the irish when the railroad was built this i hauled up partly on the shore after soaking two years and then lying high six months it was perfectly sound though waterlogged past drying i amused myself one winter day with sliding this piecemeal across the pond nearly half a mile skating behind with one end of a log fifteen feet long on my shoulder and the other on the ice or i tied several logs together with a birch withe and then with a longer birch or alder which had a hook at the end dragged them across though completely waterlogged and almost as heavy as lead they not only burned long but made a very hot fire nay i thought that they burned better for the soaking as if the pitch being confined by the water burned longer as in a lamp  gilpin in his account of the forest borderers of england says that the encroachments of trespassers and the houses and fences thus raised on the borders of the forest were considered as great nuisances by the old forest law and were severely punished under the name of purprestures as tending ad terrorem ferarumad nocumentum forestae etc to the frightening of the game and the detriment of the forest but i was interested in the preservation of the venison and the vert more than the hunters or woodchoppers and as much as though i had been the lord warden himself and if any part was burned though i burned it myself by accident i grieved with a grief that lasted longer and was more inconsolable than that of the proprietors nay i grieved when it was cut down by the proprietors themselves i would that our farmers when they cut down a forest felt some of that awe which the old romans did when they came to thin or let in the light to a consecrated grove lucum conlucare that is would believe that it is sacred to some god the roman made an expiatory offering and prayed whatever god or goddess thou art to whom this grove is sacred be propitious to me my family and children etc  it is remarkable what a value is still put upon wood even in this age and in this new country a value more permanent and universal than that of gold after all our discoveries and inventions no man will go by a pile of wood it is as precious to us as it was to our saxon and norman ancestors if they made their bows of it we make our gunstocks of it michaux more than thirty years ago says that the price of wood for fuel in new york and philadelphia nearly equals and sometimes exceeds that of the best wood in paris though this immense capital annually requires more than three hundred thousand cords and is surrounded to the distance of three hundred miles by cultivated plains in this town the price of wood rises almost steadily and the only question is how much higher it is to be this year than it was the last mechanics and tradesmen who come in person to the forest on no other errand are sure to attend the wood auction and even pay a high price for the privilege of gleaning after the woodchopper it is now many years that men have resorted to the forest for fuel and the materials of the arts the new englander and the new hollander the parisian and the celt the farmer and robin hood goody blake and harry gill in most parts of the world the prince and the peasant the scholar and the savage equally require still a few sticks from the forest to warm them and cook their food neither could i do without them  every man looks at his woodpile with a kind of affection i love to have mine before my window and the more chips the better to remind me of my pleasing work i had an old axe which nobody claimed with which by spells in winter days on the sunny side of the house i played about the stumps which i had got out of my beanfield as my driver prophesied when i was plowing they warmed me twiceonce while i was splitting them and again when they were on the fire so that no fuel could give out more heat as for the axe i was advised to get the village blacksmith to jump it but i jumped him and putting a hickory helve from the woods into it made it do if it was dull it was at least hung true  a few pieces of fat pine were a great treasure it is interesting to remember how much of this food for fire is still concealed in the bowels of the earth in previous years i had often gone prospecting over some bare hillside where a pitch pine wood had formerly stood and got out the fat pine roots they are almost indestructible stumps thirty or forty years old at least will still be sound at the core though the sapwood has all become vegetable mould as appears by the scales of the thick bark forming a ring level with the earth four or five inches distant from the heart with axe and shovel you explore this mine and follow the marrowy store yellow as beef tallow or as if you had struck on a vein of gold deep into the earth but commonly i kindled my fire with the dry leaves of the forest which i had stored up in my shed before the snow came green hickory finely split makes the woodchoppers kindlings when he has a camp in the woods once in a while i got a little of this when the villagers were lighting their fires beyond the horizon i too gave notice to the various wild inhabitants of walden vale by a smoky streamer from my chimney that i was awake             lightwinged smoke icarian bird            melting thy pinions in thy upward flight            lark without song and messenger of dawn            circling above the hamlets as thy nest            or else departing dream and shadowy form            of midnight vision gathering up thy skirts            by night starveiling and by day            darkening the light and blotting out the sun            go thou my incense upward from this hearth            and ask the gods to pardon this clear flame  hard green wood just cut though i used but little of that answered my purpose better than any other i sometimes left a good fire when i went to take a walk in a winter afternoon and when i returned three or four hours afterward it would be still alive and glowing my house was not empty though i was gone it was as if i had left a cheerful housekeeper behind it was i and fire that lived there and commonly my housekeeper proved trustworthy one day however as i was splitting wood i thought that i would just look in at the window and see if the house was not on fire it was the only time i remember to have been particularly anxious on this score so i looked and saw that a spark had caught my bed and i went in and extinguished it when it had burned a place as big as my hand but my house occupied so sunny and sheltered a position and its roof was so low that i could afford to let the fire go out in the middle of almost any winter day  the moles nested in my cellar nibbling every third potato and making a snug bed even there of some hair left after plastering and of brown paper for even the wildest animals love comfort and warmth as well as man and they survive the winter only because they are so careful to secure them some of my friends spoke as if i was coming to the woods on purpose to freeze myself the animal merely makes a bed which he warms with his body in a sheltered place but man having discovered fire boxes up some air in a spacious apartment and warms that instead of robbing himself makes that his bed in which he can move about divested of more cumbrous clothing maintain a kind of summer in the midst of winter and by means of windows even admit the light and with a lamp lengthen out the day thus he goes a step or two beyond instinct and saves a little time for the fine arts though when i had been exposed to the rudest blasts a long time my whole body began to grow torpid when i reached the genial atmosphere of my house i soon recovered my faculties and prolonged my life but the most luxuriously housed has little to boast of in this respect nor need we trouble ourselves to speculate how the human race may be at last destroyed it would be easy to cut their threads any time with a little sharper blast from the north we go on dating from cold fridays and great snows but a little colder friday or greater snow would put a period to mans existence on the globe  the next winter i used a small cookingstove for economy since i did not own the forest but it did not keep fire so well as the open fireplace cooking was then for the most part no longer a poetic but merely a chemic process it will soon be forgotten in these days of stoves that we used to roast potatoes in the ashes after the indian fashion the stove not only took up room and scented the house but it concealed the fire and i felt as if i had lost a companion you can always see a face in the fire the laborer looking into it at evening purifies his thoughts of the dross and earthiness which they have accumulated during the day but i could no longer sit and look into the fire and the pertinent words of a poet recurred to me with new force       never bright flame may be denied to me       thy dear life imaging close sympathy       what but my hopes shot upward eer so bright       what but my fortunes sunk so low in night       why art thou banished from our hearth and hall       thou who art welcomed and beloved by all       was thy existence then too fanciful       for our lifes common light who are so dull       did thy bright gleam mysterious converse hold       with our congenial souls secrets too bold        well we are safe and strong for now we sit       beside a hearth where no dim shadows flit       where nothing cheers nor saddens but a fire       warms feet and handsnor does to more aspire       by whose compact utilitarian heap       the present may sit down and go to sleep       nor fear the ghosts who from the dim past walked       and with us by the unequal light of the old wood fire talked     former inhabitants and winter visitors   i weathered some merry snowstorms and spent some cheerful winter evenings by my fireside while the snow whirled wildly without and even the hooting of the owl was hushed for many weeks i met no one in my walks but those who came occasionally to cut wood and sled it to the village the elements however abetted me in making a path through the deepest snow in the woods for when i had once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my tracks where they lodged and by absorbing the rays of the sun melted the snow and so not only made a my bed for my feet but in the night their dark line was my guide for human society i was obliged to conjure up the former occupants of these woods within the memory of many of my townsmen the road near which my house stands resounded with the laugh and gossip of inhabitants and the woods which border it were notched and dotted here and there with their little gardens and dwellings though it was then much more shut in by the forest than now in some places within my own remembrance the pines would scrape both sides of a chaise at once and women and children who were compelled to go this way to lincoln alone and on foot did it with fear and often ran a good part of the distance though mainly but a humble route to neighboring villages or for the woodmans team it once amused the traveller more than now by its variety and lingered longer in his memory where now firm open fields stretch from the village to the woods it then ran through a maple swamp on a foundation of logs the remnants of which doubtless still underlie the present dusty highway from the stratton now the almshouse farm to bristers hill  east of my beanfield across the road lived cato ingraham slave of duncan ingraham esquire gentleman of concord village who built his slave a house and gave him permission to live in walden woodscato not uticensis but concordiensis some say that he was a guinea negro there are a few who remember his little patch among the walnuts which he let grow up till he should be old and need them but a younger and whiter speculator got them at last he too however occupies an equally narrow house at present catos halfobliterated cellarhole still remains though known to few being concealed from the traveller by a fringe of pines it is now filled with the smooth sumach rhus glabra and one of the earliest species of goldenrod solidago stricta grows there luxuriantly  here by the very corner of my field still nearer to town zilpha a colored woman had her little house where she spun linen for the townsfolk making the walden woods ring with her shrill singing for she had a loud and notable voice at length in the war of 1812 her dwelling was set on fire by english soldiers prisoners on parole when she was away and her cat and dog and hens were all burned up together she led a hard life and somewhat inhumane one old frequenter of these woods remembers that as he passed her house one noon he heard her muttering to herself over her gurgling potye are all bones bones i have seen bricks amid the oak copse there  down the road on the right hand on bristers hill lived brister freeman a handy negro slave of squire cummings oncethere where grow still the apple trees which brister planted and tended large old trees now but their fruit still wild and ciderish to my taste not long since i read his epitaph in the old lincoln buryingground a little on one side near the unmarked graves of some british grenadiers who fell in the retreat from concordwhere he is styled sippio bristerscipio africanus he had some title to be calleda man of color as if he were discolored it also told me with staring emphasis when he died which was but an indirect way of informing me that he ever lived with him dwelt fenda his hospitable wife who told fortunes yet pleasantlylarge round and black blacker than any of the children of night such a dusky orb as never rose on concord before or since  farther down the hill on the left on the old road in the woods are marks of some homestead of the stratton family whose orchard once covered all the slope of bristers hill but was long since killed out by pitch pines excepting a few stumps whose old roots furnish still the wild stocks of many a thrifty village tree  nearer yet to town you come to breeds location on the other side of the way just on the edge of the wood ground famous for the pranks of a demon not distinctly named in old mythology who has acted a prominent and astounding part in our new england life and deserves as much as any mythological character to have his biography written one day who first comes in the guise of a friend or hired man and then robs and murders the whole familynewengland rum but history must not yet tell the tragedies enacted here let time intervene in some measure to assuage and lend an azure tint to them here the most indistinct and dubious tradition says that once a tavern stood the well the same which tempered the travellers beverage and refreshed his steed here then men saluted one another and heard and told the news and went their ways again  breeds hut was standing only a dozen years ago though it had long been unoccupied it was about the size of mine it was set on fire by mischievous boys one election night if i do not mistake i lived on the edge of the village then and had just lost myself over davenants gondibert that winter that i labored with a lethargywhich by the way i never knew whether to regard as a family complaint having an uncle who goes to sleep shaving himself and is obliged to sprout potatoes in a cellar sundays in order to keep awake and keep the sabbath or as the consequence of my attempt to read chalmers collection of english poetry without skipping it fairly overcame my nervii i had just sunk my head on this when the bells rung fire and in hot haste the engines rolled that way led by a straggling troop of men and boys and i among the foremost for i had leaped the brook we thought it was far south over the woodswe who had run to fires beforebarn shop or dwellinghouse or all together its bakers barn cried one it is the codman place affirmed another and then fresh sparks went up above the wood as if the roof fell in and we all shouted concord to the rescue wagons shot past with furious speed and crushing loads bearing perchance among the rest the agent of the insurance company who was bound to go however far and ever and anon the engine bell tinkled behind more slow and sure and rearmost of all as it was afterward whispered came they who set the fire and gave the alarm thus we kept on like true idealists rejecting the evidence of our senses until at a turn in the road we heard the crackling and actually felt the heat of the fire from over the wall and realized alas that we were there the very nearness of the fire but cooled our ardor at first we thought to throw a frogpond on to it but concluded to let it burn it was so far gone and so worthless so we stood round our engine jostled one another expressed our sentiments through speakingtrumpets or in lower tone referred to the great conflagrations which the world has witnessed including bascoms shop and between ourselves we thought that were we there in season with our tub and a full frogpond by we could turn that threatened last and universal one into another flood we finally retreated without doing any mischiefreturned to sleep and gondibert but as for gondibert i would except that passage in the preface about wit being the souls powderbut most of mankind are strangers to wit as indians are to powder  it chanced that i walked that way across the fields the following night about the same hour and hearing a low moaning at this spot i drew near in the dark and discovered the only survivor of the family that i know the heir of both its virtues and its vices who alone was interested in this burning lying on his stomach and looking over the cellar wall at the still smouldering cinders beneath muttering to himself as is his wont he had been working far off in the river meadows all day and had improved the first moments that he could call his own to visit the home of his fathers and his youth he gazed into the cellar from all sides and points of view by turns always lying down to it as if there was some treasure which he remembered concealed between the stones where there was absolutely nothing but a heap of bricks and ashes the house being gone he looked at what there was left he was soothed by the sympathy which my mere presence implied and showed me as well as the darkness permitted where the well was covered up which thank heaven could never be burned and he groped long about the wall to find the wellsweep which his father had cut and mounted feeling for the iron hook or staple by which a burden had been fastened to the heavy endall that he could now cling toto convince me that it was no common rider i felt it and still remark it almost daily in my walks for by it hangs the history of a family  once more on the left where are seen the well and lilac bushes by the wall in the now open field lived nutting and le grosse but to return toward lincoln  farther in the woods than any of these where the road approaches nearest to the pond wyman the potter squatted and furnished his townsmen with earthenware and left descendants to succeed him neither were they rich in worldly goods holding the land by sufferance while they lived and there often the sheriff came in vain to collect the taxes and attached a chip for forms sake as i have read in his accounts there being nothing else that he could lay his hands on one day in midsummer when i was hoeing a man who was carrying a load of pottery to market stopped his horse against my field and inquired concerning wyman the younger he had long ago bought a potters wheel of him and wished to know what had become of him i had read of the potters clay and wheel in scripture but it had never occurred to me that the pots we use were not such as had come down unbroken from those days or grown on trees like gourds somewhere and i was pleased to hear that so fictile an art was ever practiced in my neighborhood  the last inhabitant of these woods before me was an irishman hugh quoil if i have spelt his name with coil enough who occupied wymans tenementcol quoil he was called rumor said that he had been a soldier at waterloo if he had lived i should have made him fight his battles over again his trade here was that of a ditcher napoleon went to st helena quoil came to walden woods all i know of him is tragic he was a man of manners like one who had seen the world and was capable of more civil speech than you could well attend to he wore a greatcoat in midsummer being affected with the trembling delirium and his face was the color of carmine he died in the road at the foot of bristers hill shortly after i came to the woods so that i have not remembered him as a neighbor before his house was pulled down when his comrades avoided it as an unlucky castle i visited it there lay his old clothes curled up by use as if they were himself upon his raised plank bed his pipe lay broken on the hearth instead of a bowl broken at the fountain the last could never have been the symbol of his death for he confessed to me that though he had heard of bristers spring he had never seen it and soiled cards kings of diamonds spades and hearts were scattered over the floor one black chicken which the administrator could not catch black as night and as silent not even croaking awaiting reynard still went to roost in the next apartment in the rear there was the dim outline of a garden which had been planted but had never received its first hoeing owing to those terrible shaking fits though it was now harvest time it was overrun with roman wormwood and beggarticks which last stuck to my clothes for all fruit the skin of a woodchuck was freshly stretched upon the back of the house a trophy of his last waterloo but no warm cap or mittens would he want more  now only a dent in the earth marks the site of these dwellings with buried cellar stones and strawberries raspberries thimbleberries hazelbushes and sumachs growing in the sunny sward there some pitch pine or gnarled oak occupies what was the chimney nook and a sweetscented black birch perhaps waves where the doorstone was sometimes the well dent is visible where once a spring oozed now dry and tearless grass or it was covered deepnot to be discovered till some late daywith a flat stone under the sod when the last of the race departed what a sorrowful act must that bethe covering up of wells coincident with the opening of wells of tears these cellar dents like deserted fox burrows old holes are all that is left where once were the stir and bustle of human life and fate free will foreknowledge absolute in some form and dialect or other were by turns discussed but all i can learn of their conclusions amounts to just this that cato and brister pulled wool which is about as edifying as the history of more famous schools of philosophy  still grows the vivacious lilac a generation after the door and lintel and the sill are gone unfolding its sweetscented flowers each spring to be plucked by the musing traveller planted and tended once by childrens hands in frontyard plotsnow standing by wallsides in retired pastures and giving place to newrising foreststhe last of that stirp sole survivor of that family little did the dusky children think that the puny slip with its two eyes only which they stuck in the ground in the shadow of the house and daily watered would root itself so and outlive them and house itself in the rear that shaded it and grown mans garden and orchard and tell their story faintly to the lone wanderer a halfcentury after they had grown up and diedblossoming as fair and smelling as sweet as in that first spring i mark its still tender civil cheerful lilac colors  but this small village germ of something more why did it fail while concord keeps its ground were there no natural advantagesno water privileges forsooth ay the deep walden pond and cool bristers springprivilege to drink long and healthy draughts at these all unimproved by these men but to dilute their glass they were universally a thirsty race might not the basket stablebroom matmaking cornparching linenspinning and pottery business have thrived here making the wilderness to blossom like the rose and a numerous posterity have inherited the land of their fathers the sterile soil would at least have been proof against a lowland degeneracy alas how little does the memory of these human inhabitants enhance the beauty of the landscape again perhaps nature will try with me for a first settler and my house raised last spring to be the oldest in the hamlet  i am not aware that any man has ever built on the spot which i occupy deliver me from a city built on the site of a more ancient city whose materials are ruins whose gardens cemeteries the soil is blanched and accursed there and before that becomes necessary the earth itself will be destroyed with such reminiscences i repeopled the woods and lulled myself asleep                                       at this season i seldom had a visitor when the snow lay deepest no wanderer ventured near my house for a week or fortnight at a time but there i lived as snug as a meadow mouse or as cattle and poultry which are said to have survived for a long time buried in drifts even without food or like that early settlers family in the town of sutton in this state whose cottage was completely covered by the great snow of 1717 when he was absent and an indian found it only by the hole which the chimneys breath made in the drift and so relieved the family but no friendly indian concerned himself about me nor needed he for the master of the house was at home the great snow how cheerful it is to hear of when the farmers could not get to the woods and swamps with their teams and were obliged to cut down the shade trees before their houses and when the crust was harder cut off the trees in the swamps ten feet from the ground as it appeared the next spring  in the deepest snows the path which i used from the highway to my house about half a mile long might have been represented by a meandering dotted line with wide intervals between the dots for a week of even weather i took exactly the same number of steps and of the same length coming and going stepping deliberately and with the precision of a pair of dividers in my own deep tracksto such routine the winter reduces usyet often they were filled with heavens own blue but no weather interfered fatally with my walks or rather my going abroad for i frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree or a yellow birch or an old acquaintance among the pines when the ice and snow causing their limbs to droop and so sharpening their tops had changed the pines into fir trees wading to the tops of the highest hills when the show was nearly two feet deep on a level and shaking down another snowstorm on my head at every step or sometimes creeping and floundering thither on my hands and knees when the hunters had gone into winter quarters one afternoon i amused myself by watching a barred owl strix nebulosa sitting on one of the lower dead limbs of a white pine close to the trunk in broad daylight i standing within a rod of him he could hear me when i moved and cronched the snow with my feet but could not plainly see me when i made most noise he would stretch out his neck and erect his neck feathers and open his eyes wide but their lids soon fell again and he began to nod i too felt a slumberous influence after watching him half an hour as he sat thus with his eyes half open like a cat winged brother of the cat there was only a narrow slit left between their lids by which he preserved a peninsular relation to me thus with halfshut eyes looking out from the land of dreams and endeavoring to realize me vague object or mote that interrupted his visions at length on some louder noise or my nearer approach he would grow uneasy and sluggishly turn about on his perch as if impatient at having his dreams disturbed and when he launched himself off and flapped through the pines spreading his wings to unexpected breadth i could not hear the slightest sound from them thus guided amid the pine boughs rather by a delicate sense of their neighborhood than by sight feeling his twilight way as it were with his sensitive pinions he found a new perch where he might in peace await the dawning of his day  as i walked over the long causeway made for the railroad through the meadows i encountered many a blustering and nipping wind for nowhere has it freer play and when the frost had smitten me on one cheek heathen as i was i turned to it the other also nor was it much better by the carriage road from bristers hill for i came to town still like a friendly indian when the contents of the broad open fields were all piled up between the walls of the walden road and half an hour sufficed to obliterate the tracks of the last traveller and when i returned new drifts would have formed through which i floundered where the busy northwest wind had been depositing the powdery snow round a sharp angle in the road and not a rabbits track nor even the fine print the small type of a meadow mouse was to be seen yet i rarely failed to find even in midwinter some warm and springly swamp where the grass and the skunkcabbage still put forth with perennial verdure and some hardier bird occasionally awaited the return of spring  sometimes notwithstanding the snow when i returned from my walk at evening i crossed the deep tracks of a woodchopper leading from my door and found his pile of whittlings on the hearth and my house filled with the odor of his pipe or on a sunday afternoon if i chanced to be at home i heard the cronching of the snow made by the step of a longheaded farmer who from far through the woods sought my house to have a social crack one of the few of his vocation who are men on their farms who donned a frock instead of a professors gown and is as ready to extract the moral out of church or state as to haul a load of manure from his barnyard we talked of rude and simple times when men sat about large fires in cold bracing weather with clear heads and when other dessert failed we tried our teeth on many a nut which wise squirrels have long since abandoned for those which have the thickest shells are commonly empty  the one who came from farthest to my lodge through deepest snows and most dismal tempests was a poet a farmer a hunter a soldier a reporter even a philosopher may be daunted but nothing can deter a poet for he is actuated by pure love who can predict his comings and goings his business calls him out at all hours even when doctors sleep we made that small house ring with boisterous mirth and resound with the murmur of much sober talk making amends then to walden vale for the long silences broadway was still and deserted in comparison at suitable intervals there were regular salutes of laughter which might have been referred indifferently to the lastuttered or the forthcoming jest we made many a bran new theory of life over a thin dish of gruel which combined the advantages of conviviality with the clearheadedness which philosophy requires  i should not forget that during my last winter at the pond there was another welcome visitor who at one time came through the village through snow and rain and darkness till he saw my lamp through the trees and shared with me some long winter evenings one of the last of the philosophersconnecticut gave him to the worldhe peddled first her wares afterwards as he declares his brains these he peddles still prompting god and disgracing man bearing for fruit his brain only like the nut its kernel i think that he must be the man of the most faith of any alive his words and attitude always suppose a better state of things than other men are acquainted with and he will be the last man to be disappointed as the ages revolve he has no venture in the present but though comparatively disregarded now when his day comes laws unsuspected by most will take effect and masters of families and rulers will come to him for advice                 how blind that cannot see serenity  a true friend of man almost the only friend of human progress an old mortality say rather an immortality with unwearied patience and faith making plain the image engraven in mens bodies the god of whom they are but defaced and leaning monuments with his hospitable intellect he embraces children beggars insane and scholars and entertains the thought of all adding to it commonly some breadth and elegance i think that he should keep a caravansary on the worlds highway where philosophers of all nations might put up and on his sign should be printed entertainment for man but not for his beast enter ye that have leisure and a quiet mind who earnestly seek the right road he is perhaps the sanest man and has the fewest crotchets of any i chance to know the same yesterday and tomorrow of yore we had sauntered and talked and effectually put the world behind us for he was pledged to no institution in it freeborn ingenuus whichever way we turned it seemed that the heavens and the earth had met together since he enhanced the beauty of the landscape a bluerobed man whose fittest roof is the overarching sky which reflects his serenity i do not see how he can ever die nature cannot spare him  having each some shingles of thought well dried we sat and whittled them trying our knives and admiring the clear yellowish grain of the pumpkin pine we waded so gently and reverently or we pulled together so smoothly that the fishes of thought were not scared from the stream nor feared any angler on the bank but came and went grandly like the clouds which float through the western sky and the motheropearl flocks which sometimes form and dissolve there there we worked revising mythology rounding a fable here and there and building castles in the air for which earth offered no worthy foundation great looker great expecter to converse with whom was a new england nights entertainment ah such discourse we had hermit and philosopher and the old settler i have spoken ofwe threeit expanded and racked my little house i should not dare to say how many pounds weight there was above the atmospheric pressure on every circular inch it opened its seams so that they had to be calked with much dulness thereafter to stop the consequent leakbut i had enough of that kind of oakum already picked  there was one other with whom i had solid seasons long to be remembered at his house in the village and who looked in upon me from time to time but i had no more for society there  there too as everywhere i sometimes expected the visitor who never comes the vishnu purana says the householder is to remain at eventide in his courtyard as long as it takes to milk a cow or longer if he pleases to await the arrival of a guest i often performed this duty of hospitality waited long enough to milk a whole herd of cows but did not see the man approaching from the town     winter animals   when the ponds were firmly frozen they afforded not only new and shorter routes to many points but new views from their surfaces of the familiar landscape around them when i crossed flints pond after it was covered with snow though i had often paddled about and skated over it it was so unexpectedly wide and so strange that i could think of nothing but baffins bay the lincoln hills rose up around me at the extremity of a snowy plain in which i did not remember to have stood before and the fishermen at an indeterminable distance over the ice moving slowly about with their wolfish dogs passed for sealers or esquimaux or in misty weather loomed like fabulous creatures and i did not know whether they were giants or pygmies i took this course when i went to lecture in lincoln in the evening travelling in no road and passing no house between my own hut and the lecture room in goose pond which lay in my way a colony of muskrats dwelt and raised their cabins high above the ice though none could be seen abroad when i crossed it walden being like the rest usually bare of snow or with only shallow and interrupted drifts on it was my yard where i could walk freely when the snow was nearly two feet deep on a level elsewhere and the villagers were confined to their streets there far from the village street and except at very long intervals from the jingle of sleighbells i slid and skated as in a vast mooseyard well trodden overhung by oak woods and solemn pines bent down with snow or bristling with icicles  for sounds in winter nights and often in winter days i heard the forlorn but melodious note of a hooting owl indefinitely far such a sound as the frozen earth would yield if struck with a suitable plectrum the very lingua vernacula of walden wood and quite familiar to me at last though i never saw the bird while it was making it i seldom opened my door in a winter evening without hearing it hoo hoo hoo hoorer hoo sounded sonorously and the first three syllables accented somewhat like how der do or sometimes hoo hoo only one night in the beginning of winter before the pond froze over about nine oclock i was startled by the loud honking of a goose and stepping to the door heard the sound of their wings like a tempest in the woods as they flew low over my house they passed over the pond toward fair haven seemingly deterred from settling by my light their commodore honking all the while with a regular beat suddenly an unmistakable catowl from very near me with the most harsh and tremendous voice i ever heard from any inhabitant of the woods responded at regular intervals to the goose as if determined to expose and disgrace this intruder from hudsons bay by exhibiting a greater compass and volume of voice in a native and boohoo him out of concord horizon what do you mean by alarming the citadel at this time of night consecrated to me do you think i am ever caught napping at such an hour and that i have not got lungs and a larynx as well as yourself boohoo boohoo boohoo it was one of the most thrilling discords i ever heard and yet if you had a discriminating ear there were in it the elements of a concord such as these plains never saw nor heard  i also heard the whooping of the ice in the pond my great bedfellow in that part of concord as if it were restless in its bed and would fain turn over were troubled with flatulency and had dreams or i was waked by the cracking of the ground by the frost as if some one had driven a team against my door and in the morning would find a crack in the earth a quarter of a mile long and a third of an inch wide  sometimes i heard the foxes as they ranged over the snowcrust in moonlight nights in search of a partridge or other game barking raggedly and demoniacally like forest dogs as if laboring with some anxiety or seeking expression struggling for light and to be dogs outright and run freely in the streets for if we take the ages into our account may there not be a civilization going on among brutes as well as men they seemed to me to be rudimental burrowing men still standing on their defence awaiting their transformation sometimes one came near to my window attracted by my light barked a vulpine curse at me and then retreated  usually the red squirrel sciurus hudsonius waked me in the dawn coursing over the roof and up and down the sides of the house as if sent out of the woods for this purpose in the course of the winter i threw out half a bushel of ears of sweet corn which had not got ripe on to the snowcrust by my door and was amused by watching the motions of the various animals which were baited by it in the twilight and the night the rabbits came regularly and made a hearty meal all day long the red squirrels came and went and afforded me much entertainment by their manoeuvres one would approach at first warily through the shrub oaks running over the snowcrust by fits and starts like a leaf blown by the wind now a few paces this way with wonderful speed and waste of energy making inconceivable haste with his trotters as if it were for a wager and now as many paces that way but never getting on more than half a rod at a time and then suddenly pausing with a ludicrous expression and a gratuitous somerset as if all the eyes in the universe were eyed on himfor all the motions of a squirrel even in the most solitary recesses of the forest imply spectators as much as those of a dancing girlwasting more time in delay and circumspection than would have sufficed to walk the whole distancei never saw one walkand then suddenly before you could say jack robinson he would be in the top of a young pitch pine winding up his clock and chiding all imaginary spectators soliloquizing and talking to all the universe at the same timefor no reason that i could ever detect or he himself was aware of i suspect at length he would reach the corn and selecting a suitable ear frisk about in the same uncertain trigonometrical way to the topmost stick of my woodpile before my window where he looked me in the face and there sit for hours supplying himself with a new ear from time to time nibbling at first voraciously and throwing the halfnaked cobs about till at length he grew more dainty still and played with his food tasting only the inside of the kernel and the ear which was held balanced over the stick by one paw slipped from his careless grasp and fell to the ground when he would look over at it with a ludicrous expression of uncertainty as if suspecting that it had life with a mind not made up whether to get it again or a new one or be off now thinking of corn then listening to hear what was in the wind so the little impudent fellow would waste many an ear in a forenoon till at last seizing some longer and plumper one considerably bigger than himself and skilfully balancing it he would set out with it to the woods like a tiger with a buffalo by the same zigzag course and frequent pauses scratching along with it as if it were too heavy for him and falling all the while making its fall a diagonal between a perpendicular and horizontal being determined to put it through at any ratea singularly frivolous and whimsical fellowand so he would get off with it to where he lived perhaps carry it to the top of a pine tree forty or fifty rods distant and i would afterwards find the cobs strewn about the woods in various directions  at length the jays arrive whose discordant screams were heard long before as they were warily making their approach an eighth of a mile off and in a stealthy and sneaking manner they flit from tree to tree nearer and nearer and pick up the kernels which the squirrels have dropped then sitting on a pitch pine bough they attempt to swallow in their haste a kernel which is too big for their throats and chokes them and after great labor they disgorge it and spend an hour in the endeavor to crack it by repeated blows with their bills they were manifestly thieves and i had not much respect for them but the squirrels though at first shy went to work as if they were taking what was their own  meanwhile also came the chickadees in flocks which picking up the crumbs the squirrels had dropped flew to the nearest twig and placing them under their claws hammered away at them with their little bills as if it were an insect in the bark till they were sufficiently reduced for their slender throats a little flock of these titmice came daily to pick a dinner out of my woodpile or the crumbs at my door with faint flitting lisping notes like the tinkling of icicles in the grass or else with sprightly day day day or more rarely in springlike days a wiry summery phebe from the woodside they were so familiar that at length one alighted on an armful of wood which i was carrying in and pecked at the sticks without fear i once had a sparrow alight upon my shoulder for a moment while i was hoeing in a village garden and i felt that i was more distinguished by that circumstance than i should have been by any epaulet i could have worn the squirrels also grew at last to be quite familiar and occasionally stepped upon my shoe when that was the nearest way  when the ground was not yet quite covered and again near the end of winter when the snow was melted on my south hillside and about my woodpile the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there whichever side you walk in the woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter it is frequently covered up by drifts and it is said sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow where it remains concealed for a day or two i used to start them in the open land also where they had come out of the woods at sunset to bud the wild apple trees they will come regularly every evening to particular trees where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little i am glad that the partridge gets fed at any rate it is natures own bird which lives on buds and diet drink  in dark winter mornings or in short winter afternoons i sometimes heard a pack of hounds threading all the woods with hounding cry and yelp unable to resist the instinct of the chase and the note of the huntinghorn at intervals proving that man was in the rear the woods ring again and yet no fox bursts forth on to the open level of the pond nor following pack pursuing their actæon and perhaps at evening i see the hunters returning with a single brush trailing from their sleigh for a trophy seeking their inn they tell me that if the fox would remain in the bosom of the frozen earth he would be safe or if he would run in a straight line away no foxhound could overtake him but having left his pursuers far behind he stops to rest and listen till they come up and when he runs he circles round to his old haunts where the hunters await him sometimes however he will run upon a wall many rods and then leap off far to one side and he appears to know that water will not retain his scent a hunter told me that he once saw a fox pursued by hounds burst out on to walden when the ice was covered with shallow puddles run part way across and then return to the same shore ere long the hounds arrived but here they lost the scent sometimes a pack hunting by themselves would pass my door and circle round my house and yelp and hound without regarding me as if afflicted by a species of madness so that nothing could divert them from the pursuit thus they circle until they fall upon the recent trail of a fox for a wise hound will forsake everything else for this one day a man came to my hut from lexington to inquire after his hound that made a large track and had been hunting for a week by himself but i fear that he was not the wiser for all i told him for every time i attempted to answer his questions he interrupted me by asking what do you do here he had lost a dog but found a man  one old hunter who has a dry tongue who used to come to bathe in walden once every year when the water was warmest and at such times looked in upon me told me that many years ago he took his gun one afternoon and went out for a cruise in walden wood and as he walked the wayland road he heard the cry of hounds approaching and ere long a fox leaped the wall into the road and as quick as thought leaped the other wall out of the road and his swift bullet had not touched him some way behind came an old hound and her three pups in full pursuit hunting on their own account and disappeared again in the woods late in the afternoon as he was resting in the thick woods south of walden he heard the voice of the hounds far over toward fair haven still pursuing the fox and on they came their hounding cry which made all the woods ring sounding nearer and nearer now from well meadow now from the baker farm for a long time he stood still and listened to their music so sweet to a hunters ear when suddenly the fox appeared threading the solemn aisles with an easy coursing pace whose sound was concealed by a sympathetic rustle of the leaves swift and still keeping the round leaving his pursuers far behind and leaping upon a rock amid the woods he sat erect and listening with his back to the hunter for a moment compassion restrained the latters arm but that was a shortlived mood and as quick as thought can follow thought his piece was levelled and whangthe fox rolling over the rock lay dead on the ground the hunter still kept his place and listened to the hounds still on they came and now the near woods resounded through all their aisles with their demoniac cry at length the old hound burst into view with muzzle to the ground and snapping the air as if possessed and ran directly to the rock but spying the dead fox she suddenly ceased her hounding as if struck dumb with amazement and walked round and round him in silence and one by one her pups arrived and like their mother were sobered into silence by the mystery then the hunter came forward and stood in their midst and the mystery was solved they waited in silence while he skinned the fox then followed the brush a while and at length turned off into the woods again that evening a weston squire came to the concord hunters cottage to inquire for his hounds and told how for a week they had been hunting on their own account from weston woods the concord hunter told him what he knew and offered him the skin but the other declined it and departed he did not find his hounds that night but the next day learned that they had crossed the river and put up at a farmhouse for the night whence having been well fed they took their departure early in the morning  the hunter who told me this could remember one sam nutting who used to hunt bears on fair haven ledges and exchange their skins for rum in concord village who told him even that he had seen a moose there nutting had a famous foxhound named burgoynehe pronounced it buginewhich my informant used to borrow in the wast book of an old trader of this town who was also a captain townclerk and representative i find the following entry jan 18th 17423 john melven cr by 1 grey fox 023 they are not now found here and in his ledger feb 7th 1743 hezekiah stratton has credit by 12 a catt skin 01412 of course a wildcat for stratton was a sergeant in the old french war and would not have got credit for hunting less noble game credit is given for deerskins also and they were daily sold one man still preserves the horns of the last deer that was killed in this vicinity and another has told me the particulars of the hunt in which his uncle was engaged the hunters were formerly a numerous and merry crew here i remember well one gaunt nimrod who would catch up a leaf by the roadside and play a strain on it wilder and more melodious if my memory serves me than any huntinghorn  at midnight when there was a moon i sometimes met with hounds in my path prowling about the woods which would skulk out of my way as if afraid and stand silent amid the bushes till i had passed  squirrels and wild mice disputed for my store of nuts there were scores of pitch pines around my house from one to four inches in diameter which had been gnawed by mice the previous wintera norwegian winter for them for the snow lay long and deep and they were obliged to mix a large proportion of pine bark with their other diet these trees were alive and apparently flourishing at midsummer and many of them had grown a foot though completely girdled but after another winter such were without exception dead it is remarkable that a single mouse should thus be allowed a whole pine tree for its dinner gnawing round instead of up and down it but perhaps it is necessary in order to thin these trees which are wont to grow up densely  the hares lepus americanus were very familiar one had her form under my house all winter separated from me only by the flooring and she startled me each morning by her hasty departure when i began to stirthump thump thump striking her head against the floor timbers in her hurry they used to come round my door at dusk to nibble the potato parings which i had thrown out and were so nearly the color of the ground that they could hardly be distinguished when still sometimes in the twilight i alternately lost and recovered sight of one sitting motionless under my window when i opened my door in the evening off they would go with a squeak and a bounce near at hand they only excited my pity one evening one sat by my door two paces from me at first trembling with fear yet unwilling to move a poor wee thing lean and bony with ragged ears and sharp nose scant tail and slender paws it looked as if nature no longer contained the breed of nobler bloods but stood on her last toes its large eyes appeared young and unhealthy almost dropsical i took a step and lo away it scud with an elastic spring over the snowcrust straightening its body and its limbs into graceful length and soon put the forest between me and itselfthe wild free venison asserting its vigor and the dignity of nature not without reason was its slenderness such then was its nature lepus levipes lightfoot some think  what is a country without rabbits and partridges they are among the most simple and indigenous animal products ancient and venerable families known to antiquity as to modern times of the very hue and substance of nature nearest allied to leaves and to the groundand to one another it is either winged or it is legged it is hardly as if you had seen a wild creature when a rabbit or a partridge bursts away only a natural one as much to be expected as rustling leaves the partridge and the rabbit are still sure to thrive like true natives of the soil whatever revolutions occur if the forest is cut off the sprouts and bushes which spring up afford them concealment and they become more numerous than ever that must be a poor country indeed that does not support a hare our woods teem with them both and around every swamp may be seen the partridge or rabbit walk beset with twiggy fences and horsehair snares which some cowboy tends     the pond in winter   after a still winter night i awoke with the impression that some question had been put to me which i had been endeavoring in vain to answer in my sleep as whathowwhenwhere but there was dawning nature in whom all creatures live looking in at my broad windows with serene and satisfied face and no question on her lips i awoke to an answered question to nature and daylight the snow lying deep on the earth dotted with young pines and the very slope of the hill on which my house is placed seemed to say forward nature puts no question and answers none which we mortals ask she has long ago taken her resolution o prince our eyes contemplate with admiration and transmit to the soul the wonderful and varied spectacle of this universe the night veils without doubt a part of this glorious creation but day comes to reveal to us this great work which extends from earth even into the plains of the ether  then to my morning work first i take an axe and pail and go in search of water if that be not a dream after a cold and snowy night it needed a diviningrod to find it every winter the liquid and trembling surface of the pond which was so sensitive to every breath and reflected every light and shadow becomes solid to the depth of a foot or a foot and a half so that it will support the heaviest teams and perchance the snow covers it to an equal depth and it is not to be distinguished from any level field like the marmots in the surrounding hills it closes its eyelids and becomes dormant for three months or more standing on the snowcovered plain as if in a pasture amid the hills i cut my way first through a foot of snow and then a foot of ice and open a window under my feet where kneeling to drink i look down into the quiet parlor of the fishes pervaded by a softened light as through a window of ground glass with its bright sanded floor the same as in summer there a perennial waveless serenity reigns as in the amber twilight sky corresponding to the cool and even temperament of the inhabitants heaven is under our feet is well as over our heads  early in the morning while all things are crisp with frost men come with fishingreels and slender lunch and let down their fine lines through the snowy field to take pickerel and perch wild men who instinctively follow other fashions and trust other authorities than their townsmen and by their goings and comings stitch towns together in parts where else they would be ripped they sit and eat their luncheon in stout fearnaughts on the dry oak leaves on the shore as wise in natural lore as the citizen is in artificial they never consulted with books and know and can tell much less than they have done the things which they practice are said not yet to be known here is one fishing for pickerel with grown perch for bait you look into his pail with wonder as into a summer pond as if he kept summer locked up at home or knew where she had retreated how pray did he get these in midwinter oh he got worms out of rotten logs since the ground froze and so he caught them his life itself passes deeper in nature than the studies of the naturalist penetrate himself a subject for the naturalist the latter raises the moss and bark gently with his knife in search of insects the former lays open logs to their core with his axe and moss and bark fly far and wide he gets his living by barking trees such a man has some right to fish and i love to see nature carried out in him the perch swallows the grubworm the pickerel swallows the perch and the fisherman swallows the pickerel and so all the chinks in the scale of being are filled  when i strolled around the pond in misty weather i was sometimes amused by the primitive mode which some ruder fisherman had adopted he would perhaps have placed alder branches over the narrow holes in the ice which were four or five rods apart and an equal distance from the shore and having fastened the end of the line to a stick to prevent its being pulled through have passed the slack line over a twig of the alder a foot or more above the ice and tied a dry oak leaf to it which being pulled down would show when he had a bite these alders loomed through the mist at regular intervals as you walked half way round the pond  ah the pickerel of walden when i see them lying on the ice or in the well which the fisherman cuts in the ice making a little hole to admit the water i am always surprised by their rare beauty as if they were fabulous fishes they are so foreign to the streets even to the woods foreign as arabia to our concord life they possess a quite dazzling and transcendent beauty which separates them by a wide interval from the cadaverous cod and haddock whose fame is trumpeted in our streets they are not green like the pines nor gray like the stones nor blue like the sky but they have to my eyes if possible yet rarer colors like flowers and precious stones as if they were the pearls the animalized nuclei or crystals of the walden water they of course are walden all over and all through are themselves small waldens in the animal kingdom waldenses it is surprising that they are caught herethat in this deep and capacious spring far beneath the rattling teams and chaises and tinkling sleighs that travel the walden road this great gold and emerald fish swims i never chanced to see its kind in any market it would be the cynosure of all eyes there easily with a few convulsive quirks they give up their watery ghosts like a mortal translated before his time to the thin air of heaven                                       as i was desirous to recover the long lost bottom of walden pond i surveyed it carefully before the ice broke up early in 46 with compass and chain and sounding line there have been many stories told about the bottom or rather no bottom of this pond which certainly had no foundation for themselves it is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it i have visited two such bottomless ponds in one walk in this neighborhood many have believed that walden reached quite through to the other side of the globe some who have lain flat on the ice for a long time looking down through the illusive medium perchance with watery eyes into the bargain and driven to hasty conclusions by the fear of catching cold in their breasts have seen vast holes into which a load of hay might be driven if there were anybody to drive it the undoubted source of the styx and entrance to the infernal regions from these parts others have gone down from the village with a fiftysix and a wagon load of inch rope but yet have failed to find any bottom for while the fiftysix was resting by the way they were paying out the rope in the vain attempt to fathom their truly immeasurable capacity for marvellousness but i can assure my readers that walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable though at an unusual depth i fathomed it easily with a codline and a stone weighing about a pound and a half and could tell accurately when the stone left the bottom by having to pull so much harder before the water got underneath to help me the greatest depth was exactly one hundred and two feet to which may be added the five feet which it has risen since making one hundred and seven this is a remarkable depth for so small an area yet not an inch of it can be spared by the imagination what if all ponds were shallow would it not react on the minds of men i am thankful that this pond was made deep and pure for a symbol while men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless  a factoryowner hearing what depth i had found thought that it could not be true for judging from his acquaintance with dams sand would not lie at so steep an angle but the deepest ponds are not so deep in proportion to their area as most suppose and if drained would not leave very remarkable valleys they are not like cups between the hills for this one which is so unusually deep for its area appears in a vertical section through its centre not deeper than a shallow plate most ponds emptied would leave a meadow no more hollow than we frequently see william gilpin who is so admirable in all that relates to landscapes and usually so correct standing at the head of loch fyne in scotland which he describes as a bay of salt water sixty or seventy fathoms deep four miles in breadth and about fifty miles long surrounded by mountains observes if we could have seen it immediately after the diluvian crash or whatever convulsion of nature occasioned it before the waters gushed in what a horrid chasm must it have appeared              so high as heaved the tumid hills so low              down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep              capacious bed of waters  but if using the shortest diameter of loch fyne we apply these proportions to walden which as we have seen appears already in a vertical section only like a shallow plate it will appear four times as shallow so much for the increased horrors of the chasm of loch fyne when emptied no doubt many a smiling valley with its stretching cornfields occupies exactly such a horrid chasm from which the waters have receded though it requires the insight and the far sight of the geologist to convince the unsuspecting inhabitants of this fact often an inquisitive eye may detect the shores of a primitive lake in the low horizon hills and no subsequent elevation of the plain have been necessary to conceal their history but it is easiest as they who work on the highways know to find the hollows by the puddles after a shower the amount of it is the imagination give it the least license dives deeper and soars higher than nature goes so probably the depth of the ocean will be found to be very inconsiderable compared with its breadth  as i sounded through the ice i could determine the shape of the bottom with greater accuracy than is possible in surveying harbors which do not freeze over and i was surprised at its general regularity in the deepest part there are several acres more level than almost any field which is exposed to the sun wind and plow in one instance on a line arbitrarily chosen the depth did not vary more than one foot in thirty rods and generally near the middle i could calculate the variation for each one hundred feet in any direction beforehand within three or four inches some are accustomed to speak of deep and dangerous holes even in quiet sandy ponds like this but the effect of water under these circumstances is to level all inequalities the regularity of the bottom and its conformity to the shores and the range of the neighboring hills were so perfect that a distant promontory betrayed itself in the soundings quite across the pond and its direction could be determined by observing the opposite shore cape becomes bar and plain shoal and valley and gorge deep water and channel  when i had mapped the pond by the scale of ten rods to an inch and put down the soundings more than a hundred in all i observed this remarkable coincidence having noticed that the number indicating the greatest depth was apparently in the centre of the map i laid a rule on the map lengthwise and then breadthwise and found to my surprise that the line of greatest length intersected the line of greatest breadth exactly at the point of greatest depth notwithstanding that the middle is so nearly level the outline of the pond far from regular and the extreme length and breadth were got by measuring into the coves and i said to myself who knows but this hint would conduct to the deepest part of the ocean as well as of a pond or puddle is not this the rule also for the height of mountains regarded as the opposite of valleys we know that a hill is not highest at its narrowest part  of five coves three or all which had been sounded were observed to have a bar quite across their mouths and deeper water within so that the bay tended to be an expansion of water within the land not only horizontally but vertically and to form a basin or independent pond the direction of the two capes showing the course of the bar every harbor on the seacoast also has its bar at its entrance in proportion as the mouth of the cove was wider compared with its length the water over the bar was deeper compared with that in the basin given then the length and breadth of the cove and the character of the surrounding shore and you have almost elements enough to make out a formula for all cases  in order to see how nearly i could guess with this experience at the deepest point in a pond by observing the outlines of a surface and the character of its shores alone i made a plan of white pond which contains about fortyone acres and like this has no island in it nor any visible inlet or outlet and as the line of greatest breadth fell very near the line of least breadth where two opposite capes approached each other and two opposite bays receded i ventured to mark a point a short distance from the latter line but still on the line of greatest length as the deepest the deepest part was found to be within one hundred feet of this still farther in the direction to which i had inclined and was only one foot deeper namely sixty feet of course a stream running through or an island in the pond would make the problem much more complicated  if we knew all the laws of nature we should need only one fact or the description of one actual phenomenon to infer all the particular results at that point now we know only a few laws and our result is vitiated not of course by any confusion or irregularity in nature but by our ignorance of essential elements in the calculation our notions of law and harmony are commonly confined to those instances which we detect but the harmony which results from a far greater number of seemingly conflicting but really concurring laws which we have not detected is still more wonderful the particular laws are as our points of view as to the traveller a mountain outline varies with every step and it has an infinite number of profiles though absolutely but one form even when cleft or bored through it is not comprehended in its entireness  what i have observed of the pond is no less true in ethics it is the law of average such a rule of the two diameters not only guides us toward the sun in the system and the heart in man but draws lines through the length and breadth of the aggregate of a mans particular daily behaviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets and where they intersect will be the height or depth of his character perhaps we need only to know how his shores trend and his adjacent country or circumstances to infer his depth and concealed bottom if he is surrounded by mountainous circumstances an achillean shore whose peaks overshadow and are reflected in his bosom they suggest a corresponding depth in him but a low and smooth shore proves him shallow on that side in our bodies a bold projecting brow falls off to and indicates a corresponding depth of thought also there is a bar across the entrance of our every cove or particular inclination each is our harbor for a season in which we are detained and partially landlocked these inclinations are not whimsical usually but their form size and direction are determined by the promontories of the shore the ancient axes of elevation when this bar is gradually increased by storms tides or currents or there is a subsidence of the waters so that it reaches to the surface that which was at first but an inclination in the shore in which a thought was harbored becomes an individual lake cut off from the ocean wherein the thought secures its own conditionschanges perhaps from salt to fresh becomes a sweet sea dead sea or a marsh at the advent of each individual into this life may we not suppose that such a bar has risen to the surface somewhere it is true we are such poor navigators that our thoughts for the most part stand off and on upon a harborless coast are conversant only with the bights of the bays of poesy or steer for the public ports of entry and go into the dry docks of science where they merely refit for this world and no natural currents concur to individualize them  as for the inlet or outlet of walden i have not discovered any but rain and snow and evaporation though perhaps with a thermometer and a line such places may be found for where the water flows into the pond it will probably be coldest in summer and warmest in winter when the icemen were at work here in 467 the cakes sent to the shore were one day rejected by those who were stacking them up there not being thick enough to lie side by side with the rest and the cutters thus discovered that the ice over a small space was two or three inches thinner than elsewhere which made them think that there was an inlet there they also showed me in another place what they thought was a leachhole through which the pond leaked out under a hill into a neighboring meadow pushing me out on a cake of ice to see it it was a small cavity under ten feet of water but i think that i can warrant the pond not to need soldering till they find a worse leak than that one has suggested that if such a leachhole should be found its connection with the meadow if any existed might be proved by conveying some colored powder or sawdust to the mouth of the hole and then putting a strainer over the spring in the meadow which would catch some of the particles carried through by the current  while i was surveying the ice which was sixteen inches thick undulated under a slight wind like water it is well known that a level cannot be used on ice at one rod from the shore its greatest fluctuation when observed by means of a level on land directed toward a graduated staff on the ice was three quarters of an inch though the ice appeared firmly attached to the shore it was probably greater in the middle who knows but if our instruments were delicate enough we might detect an undulation in the crust of the earth when two legs of my level were on the shore and the third on the ice and the sights were directed over the latter a rise or fall of the ice of an almost infinitesimal amount made a difference of several feet on a tree across the pond when i began to cut holes for sounding there were three or four inches of water on the ice under a deep snow which had sunk it thus far but the water began immediately to run into these holes and continued to run for two days in deep streams which wore away the ice on every side and contributed essentially if not mainly to dry the surface of the pond for as the water ran in it raised and floated the ice this was somewhat like cutting a hole in the bottom of a ship to let the water out when such holes freeze and a rain succeeds and finally a new freezing forms a fresh smooth ice over all it is beautifully mottled internally by dark figures shaped somewhat like a spiders web what you may call ice rosettes produced by the channels worn by the water flowing from all sides to a centre sometimes also when the ice was covered with shallow puddles i saw a double shadow of myself one standing on the head of the other one on the ice the other on the trees or hillside                                       while yet it is cold january and snow and ice are thick and solid the prudent landlord comes from the village to get ice to cool his summer drink impressively even pathetically wise to foresee the heat and thirst of july now in januarywearing a thick coat and mittens when so many things are not provided for it may be that he lays up no treasures in this world which will cool his summer drink in the next he cuts and saws the solid pond unroofs the house of fishes and carts off their very element and air held fast by chains and stakes like corded wood through the favoring winter air to wintry cellars to underlie the summer there it looks like solidified azure as far off it is drawn through the streets these icecutters are a merry race full of jest and sport and when i went among them they were wont to invite me to saw pitfashion with them i standing underneath  in the winter of 467 there came a hundred men of hyperborean extraction swoop down on to our pond one morning with many carloads of ungainlylooking farming toolssleds plows drillbarrows turfknives spades saws rakes and each man was armed with a doublepointed pikestaff such as is not described in the newengland farmer or the cultivator i did not know whether they had come to sow a crop of winter rye or some other kind of grain recently introduced from iceland as i saw no manure i judged that they meant to skim the land as i had done thinking the soil was deep and had lain fallow long enough they said that a gentleman farmer who was behind the scenes wanted to double his money which as i understood amounted to half a million already but in order to cover each one of his dollars with another he took off the only coat ay the skin itself of walden pond in the midst of a hard winter they went to work at once plowing barrowing rolling furrowing in admirable order as if they were bent on making this a model farm but when i was looking sharp to see what kind of seed they dropped into the furrow a gang of fellows by my side suddenly began to hook up the virgin mould itself with a peculiar jerk clean down to the sand or rather the waterfor it was a very springy soilindeed all the terra firma there wasand haul it away on sleds and then i guessed that they must be cutting peat in a bog so they came and went every day with a peculiar shriek from the locomotive from and to some point of the polar regions as it seemed to me like a flock of arctic snowbirds but sometimes squaw walden had her revenge and a hired man walking behind his team slipped through a crack in the ground down toward tartarus and he who was so brave before suddenly became but the ninth part of a man almost gave up his animal heat and was glad to take refuge in my house and acknowledged that there was some virtue in a stove or sometimes the frozen soil took a piece of steel out of a plowshare or a plow got set in the furrow and had to be cut out  to speak literally a hundred irishmen with yankee overseers came from cambridge every day to get out the ice they divided it into cakes by methods too well known to require description and these being sledded to the shore were rapidly hauled off on to an ice platform and raised by grappling irons and block and tackle worked by horses on to a stack as surely as so many barrels of flour and there placed evenly side by side and row upon row as if they formed the solid base of an obelisk designed to pierce the clouds they told me that in a good day they could get out a thousand tons which was the yield of about one acre deep ruts and cradleholes were worn in the ice as on terra firma by the passage of the sleds over the same track and the horses invariably ate their oats out of cakes of ice hollowed out like buckets they stacked up the cakes thus in the open air in a pile thirtyfive feet high on one side and six or seven rods square putting hay between the outside layers to exclude the air for when the wind though never so cold finds a passage through it will wear large cavities leaving slight supports or studs only here and there and finally topple it down at first it looked like a vast blue fort or valhalla but when they began to tuck the coarse meadow hay into the crevices and this became covered with rime and icicles it looked like a venerable mossgrown and hoary ruin built of azuretinted marble the abode of winter that old man we see in the almanachis shanty as if he had a design to estivate with us they calculated that not twentyfive per cent of this would reach its destination and that two or three per cent would be wasted in the cars however a still greater part of this heap had a different destiny from what was intended for either because the ice was found not to keep so well as was expected containing more air than usual or for some other reason it never got to market this heap made in the winter of 467 and estimated to contain ten thousand tons was finally covered with hay and boards and though it was unroofed the following july and a part of it carried off the rest remaining exposed to the sun it stood over that summer and the next winter and was not quite melted till september 1848 thus the pond recovered the greater part  like the water the walden ice seen near at hand has a green tint but at a distance is beautifully blue and you can easily tell it from the white ice of the river or the merely greenish ice of some ponds a quarter of a mile off sometimes one of those great cakes slips from the icemans sled into the village street and lies there for a week like a great emerald an object of interest to all passers i have noticed that a portion of walden which in the state of water was green will often when frozen appear from the same point of view blue so the hollows about this pond will sometimes in the winter be filled with a greenish water somewhat like its own but the next day will have frozen blue perhaps the blue color of water and ice is due to the light and air they contain and the most transparent is the bluest ice is an interesting subject for contemplation they told me that they had some in the icehouses at fresh pond five years old which was as good as ever why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid but frozen remains sweet forever it is commonly said that this is the difference between the affections and the intellect  thus for sixteen days i saw from my window a hundred men at work like busy husbandmen with teams and horses and apparently all the implements of farming such a picture as we see on the first page of the almanac and as often as i looked out i was reminded of the fable of the lark and the reapers or the parable of the sower and the like and now they are all gone and in thirty days more probably i shall look from the same window on the pure seagreen walden water there reflecting the clouds and the trees and sending up its evaporations in solitude and no traces will appear that a man has ever stood there perhaps i shall hear a solitary loon laugh as he dives and plumes himself or shall see a lonely fisher in his boat like a floating leaf beholding his form reflected in the waves where lately a hundred men securely labored  thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of charleston and new orleans of madras and bombay and calcutta drink at my well in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvatgeeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the bramin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges with favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of atlantis and the hesperides makes the periplus of hanno and floating by ternate and tidore and the mouth of the persian gulf melts in the tropic gales of the indian seas and is landed in ports of which alexander only heard the names     spring   the opening of large tracts by the icecutters commonly causes a pond to break up earlier for the water agitated by the wind even in cold weather wears away the surrounding ice but such was not the effect on walden that year for she had soon got a thick new garment to take the place of the old this pond never breaks up so soon as the others in this neighborhood on account both of its greater depth and its having no stream passing through it to melt or wear away the ice i never knew it to open in the course of a winter not excepting that of 523 which gave the ponds so severe a trial it commonly opens about the first of april a week or ten days later than flints pond and fair haven beginning to melt on the north side and in the shallower parts where it began to freeze it indicates better than any water hereabouts the absolute progress of the season being least affected by transient changes of temperature a severe cold of a few days duration in march may very much retard the opening of the former ponds while the temperature of walden increases almost uninterruptedly a thermometer thrust into the middle of walden on the 6th of march 1847 stood at 32º or freezing point near the shore at 33º in the middle of flints pond the same day at 32º at a dozen rods from the shore in shallow water under ice a foot thick at 36º this difference of three and a half degrees between the temperature of the deep water and the shallow in the latter pond and the fact that a great proportion of it is comparatively shallow show why it should break up so much sooner than walden the ice in the shallowest part was at this time several inches thinner than in the middle in midwinter the middle had been the warmest and the ice thinnest there so also every one who has waded about the shores of the pond in summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is close to the shore where only three or four inches deep than a little distance out and on the surface where it is deep than near the bottom in spring the sun not only exerts an influence through the increased temperature of the air and earth but its heat passes through ice a foot or more thick and is reflected from the bottom in shallow water and so also warms the water and melts the under side of the ice at the same time that it is melting it more directly above making it uneven and causing the air bubbles which it contains to extend themselves upward and downward until it is completely honeycombed and at last disappears suddenly in a single spring rain ice has its grain as well as wood and when a cake begins to rot or comb that is assume the appearance of honeycomb whatever may be its position the air cells are at right angles with what was the water surface where there is a rock or a log rising near to the surface the ice over it is much thinner and is frequently quite dissolved by this reflected heat and i have been told that in the experiment at cambridge to freeze water in a shallow wooden pond though the cold air circulated underneath and so had access to both sides the reflection of the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanced this advantage when a warm rain in the middle of the winter melts off the snowice from walden and leaves a hard dark or transparent ice on the middle there will be a strip of rotten though thicker white ice a rod or more wide about the shores created by this reflected heat also as i have said the bubbles themselves within the ice operate as burningglasses to melt the ice beneath  the phenomena of the year take place every day in a pond on a small scale every morning generally speaking the shallow water is being warmed more rapidly than the deep though it may not be made so warm after all and every evening it is being cooled more rapidly until the morning the day is an epitome of the year the night is the winter the morning and evening are the spring and fall and the noon is the summer the cracking and booming of the ice indicate a change of temperature one pleasant morning after a cold night february 24th 1850 having gone to flints pond to spend the day i noticed with surprise that when i struck the ice with the head of my axe it resounded like a gong for many rods around or as if i had struck on a tight drumhead the pond began to boom about an hour after sunrise when it felt the influence of the suns rays slanted upon it from over the hills it stretched itself and yawned like a waking man with a gradually increasing tumult which was kept up three or four hours it took a short siesta at noon and boomed once more toward night as the sun was withdrawing his influence in the right stage of the weather a pond fires its evening gun with great regularity but in the middle of the day being full of cracks and the air also being less elastic it had completely lost its resonance and probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by a blow on it the fishermen say that the thundering of the pond scares the fishes and prevents their biting the pond does not thunder every evening and i cannot tell surely when to expect its thundering but though i may perceive no difference in the weather it does who would have suspected so large and cold and thickskinned a thing to be so sensitive yet it has its law to which it thunders obedience when it should as surely as the buds expand in the spring the earth is all alive and covered with papillae the largest pond is as sensitive to atmospheric changes as the globule of mercury in its tube  one attraction in coming to the woods to live was that i should have leisure and opportunity to see the spring come in the ice in the pond at length begins to be honeycombed and i can set my heel in it as i walk fogs and rains and warmer suns are gradually melting the snow the days have grown sensibly longer and i see how i shall get through the winter without adding to my woodpile for large fires are no longer necessary i am on the alert for the first signs of spring to hear the chance note of some arriving bird or the striped squirrels chirp for his stores must be now nearly exhausted or see the woodchuck venture out of his winter quarters on the 13th of march after i had heard the bluebird song sparrow and redwing the ice was still nearly a foot thick as the weather grew warmer it was not sensibly worn away by the water nor broken up and floated off as in rivers but though it was completely melted for half a rod in width about the shore the middle was merely honeycombed and saturated with water so that you could put your foot through it when six inches thick but by the next day evening perhaps after a warm rain followed by fog it would have wholly disappeared all gone off with the fog spirited away one year i went across the middle only five days before it disappeared entirely in 1845 walden was first completely open on the 1st of april in 46 the 25th of march in 47 the 8th of april in 51 the 28th of march in 52 the 18th of april in 53 the 23d of march in 54 about the 7th of april  every incident connected with the breaking up of the rivers and ponds and the settling of the weather is particularly interesting to us who live in a climate of so great extremes when the warmer days come they who dwell near the river hear the ice crack at night with a startling whoop as loud as artillery as if its icy fetters were rent from end to end and within a few days see it rapidly going out so the alligator comes out of the mud with quakings of the earth one old man who has been a close observer of nature and seems as thoroughly wise in regard to all her operations as if she had been put upon the stocks when he was a boy and he had helped to lay her keelwho has come to his growth and can hardly acquire more of natural lore if he should live to the age of methuselahtold meand i was surprised to hear him express wonder at any of natures operations for i thought that there were no secrets between themthat one spring day he took his gun and boat and thought that he would have a little sport with the ducks there was ice still on the meadows but it was all gone out of the river and he dropped down without obstruction from sudbury where he lived to fair haven pond which he found unexpectedly covered for the most part with a firm field of ice it was a warm day and he was surprised to see so great a body of ice remaining not seeing any ducks he hid his boat on the north or back side of an island in the pond and then concealed himself in the bushes on the south side to await them the ice was melted for three or four rods from the shore and there was a smooth and warm sheet of water with a muddy bottom such as the ducks love within and he thought it likely that some would be along pretty soon after he had lain still there about an hour he heard a low and seemingly very distant sound but singularly grand and impressive unlike anything he had ever heard gradually swelling and increasing as if it would have a universal and memorable ending a sullen rush and roar which seemed to him all at once like the sound of a vast body of fowl coming in to settle there and seizing his gun he started up in haste and excited but he found to his surprise that the whole body of the ice had started while he lay there and drifted in to the shore and the sound he had heard was made by its edge grating on the shoreat first gently nibbled and crumbled off but at length heaving up and scattering its wrecks along the island to a considerable height before it came to a standstill  at length the suns rays have attained the right angle and warm winds blow up mist and rain and melt the snowbanks and the sun dispersing the mist smiles on a checkered landscape of russet and white smoking with incense through which the traveller picks his way from islet to islet cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing off  few phenomena gave me more delight than to observe the forms which thawing sand and clay assume in flowing down the sides of a deep cut on the railroad through which i passed on my way to the village a phenomenon not very common on so large a scale though the number of freshly exposed banks of the right material must have been greatly multiplied since railroads were invented the material was sand of every degree of fineness and of various rich colors commonly mixed with a little clay when the frost comes out in the spring and even in a thawing day in the winter the sand begins to flow down the slopes like lava sometimes bursting out through the snow and overflowing it where no sand was to be seen before innumerable little streams overlap and interlace one with another exhibiting a sort of hybrid product which obeys half way the law of currents and half way that of vegetation as it flows it takes the forms of sappy leaves or vines making heaps of pulpy sprays a foot or more in depth and resembling as you look down on them the laciniated lobed and imbricated thalluses of some lichens or you are reminded of coral of leopards paws or birds feet of brains or lungs or bowels and excrements of all kinds it is a truly grotesque vegetation whose forms and color we see imitated in bronze a sort of architectural foliage more ancient and typical than acanthus chiccory ivy vine or any vegetable leaves destined perhaps under some circumstances to become a puzzle to future geologists the whole cut impressed me as if it were a cave with its stalactites laid open to the light the various shades of the sand are singularly rich and agreeable embracing the different iron colors brown gray yellowish and reddish when the flowing mass reaches the drain at the foot of the bank it spreads out flatter into strands the separate streams losing their semicylindrical form and gradually becoming more flat and broad running together as they are more moist till they form an almost flat sand still variously and beautifully shaded but in which you can trace the original forms of vegetation till at length in the water itself they are converted into banks like those formed off the mouths of rivers and the forms of vegetation are lost in the ripple marks on the bottom  the whole bank which is from twenty to forty feet high is sometimes overlaid with a mass of this kind of foliage or sandy rupture for a quarter of a mile on one or both sides the produce of one spring day what makes this sand foliage remarkable is its springing into existence thus suddenly when i see on the one side the inert bankfor the sun acts on one side firstand on the other this luxuriant foliage the creation of an hour i am affected as if in a peculiar sense i stood in the laboratory of the artist who made the world and mehad come to where he was still at work sporting on this bank and with excess of energy strewing his fresh designs about i feel as if i were nearer to the vitals of the globe for this sandy overflow is something such a foliaceous mass as the vitals of the animal body you find thus in the very sands an anticipation of the vegetable leaf no wonder that the earth expresses itself outwardly in leaves it so labors with the idea inwardly the atoms have already learned this law and are pregnant by it the overhanging leaf sees here its prototype internally whether in the globe or animal body it is a moist thick lobe a word especially applicable to the liver and lungs and the leaves of fat γεἱβω labor lapsus to flow or slip downward a lapsing λοβὁς globus lobe globe also lap flap and many other words externally a dry thin leaf even as the f and v are a pressed and dried b the radicals of lobe are lb the soft mass of the b single lobed or b double lobed with the liquid l behind it pressing it forward in globe glb the guttural g adds to the meaning the capacity of the throat the feathers and wings of birds are still drier and thinner leaves thus also you pass from the lumpish grub in the earth to the airy and fluttering butterfly the very globe continually transcends and translates itself and becomes winged in its orbit even ice begins with delicate crystal leaves as if it had flowed into moulds which the fronds of waterplants have impressed on the watery mirror the whole tree itself is but one leaf and rivers are still vaster leaves whose pulp is intervening earth and towns and cities are the ova of insects in their axils  when the sun withdraws the sand ceases to flow but in the morning the streams will start once more and branch and branch again into a myriad of others you here see perchance how bloodvessels are formed if you look closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of softened sand with a droplike point like the ball of the finger feeling its way slowly and blindly downward until at last with more heat and moisture as the sun gets higher the most fluid portion in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert also yields separates from the latter and forms for itself a meandering channel or artery within that in which is seen a little silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or branches to another and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand it is wonderful how rapidly yet perfectly the sand organizes itself as it flows using the best material its mass affords to form the sharp edges of its channel such are the sources of rivers in the silicious matter which the water deposits is perhaps the bony system and in the still finer soil and organic matter the fleshy fibre or cellular tissue what is man but a mass of thawing clay the ball of the human finger is but a drop congealed the fingers and toes flow to their extent from the thawing mass of the body who knows what the human body would expand and flow out to under a more genial heaven is not the hand a spreading palm leaf with its lobes and veins the ear may be regarded fancifully as a lichen umbilicaria on the side of the head with its lobe or drop the liplabium from labor laps or lapses from the sides of the cavernous mouth the nose is a manifest congealed drop or stalactite the chin is a still larger drop the confluent dripping of the face the cheeks are a slide from the brows into the valley of the face opposed and diffused by the cheek bones each rounded lobe of the vegetable leaf too is a thick and now loitering drop larger or smaller the lobes are the fingers of the leaf and as many lobes as it has in so many directions it tends to flow and more heat or other genial influences would have caused it to flow yet farther  thus it seemed that this one hillside illustrated the principle of all the operations of nature the maker of this earth but patented a leaf what champollion will decipher this hieroglyphic for us that we may turn over a new leaf at last this phenomenon is more exhilarating to me than the luxuriance and fertility of vineyards true it is somewhat excrementitious in its character and there is no end to the heaps of liver lights and bowels as if the globe were turned wrong side outward but this suggests at least that nature has some bowels and there again is mother of humanity this is the frost coming out of the ground this is spring it precedes the green and flowery spring as mythology precedes regular poetry i know of nothing more purgative of winter fumes and indigestions it convinces me that earth is still in her swaddlingclothes and stretches forth baby fingers on every side fresh curls spring from the baldest brow there is nothing inorganic these foliaceous heaps lie along the bank like the slag of a furnace showing that nature is in full blast within the earth is not a mere fragment of dead history stratum upon stratum like the leaves of a book to be studied by geologists and antiquaries chiefly but living poetry like the leaves of a tree which precede flowers and fruitnot a fossil earth but a living earth compared with whose great central life all animal and vegetable life is merely parasitic its throes will heave our exuviae from their graves you may melt your metals and cast them into the most beautiful moulds you can they will never excite me like the forms which this molten earth flows out into and not only it but the institutions upon it are plastic like clay in the hands of the potter  ere long not only on these banks but on every hill and plain and in every hollow the frost comes out of the ground like a dormant quadruped from its burrow and seeks the sea with music or migrates to other climes in clouds thaw with his gentle persuasion is more powerful than thor with his hammer the one melts the other but breaks in pieces  when the ground was partially bare of snow and a few warm days had dried its surface somewhat it was pleasant to compare the first tender signs of the infant year just peeping forth with the stately beauty of the withered vegetation which had withstood the winterlifeeverlasting goldenrods pinweeds and graceful wild grasses more obvious and interesting frequently than in summer even as if their beauty was not ripe till then even cottongrass cattails mulleins johnswort hardhack meadowsweet and other strongstemmed plants those unexhausted granaries which entertain the earliest birdsdecent weeds at least which widowed nature wears i am particularly attracted by the arching and sheaflike top of the woolgrass it brings back the summer to our winter memories and is among the forms which art loves to copy and which in the vegetable kingdom have the same relation to types already in the mind of man that astronomy has it is an antique style older than greek or egyptian many of the phenomena of winter are suggestive of an inexpressible tenderness and fragile delicacy we are accustomed to hear this king described as a rude and boisterous tyrant but with the gentleness of a lover he adorns the tresses of summer  at the approach of spring the red squirrels got under my house two at a time directly under my feet as i sat reading or writing and kept up the queerest chuckling and chirruping and vocal pirouetting and gurgling sounds that ever were heard and when i stamped they only chirruped the louder as if past all fear and respect in their mad pranks defying humanity to stop them no you dontchickareechickaree they were wholly deaf to my arguments or failed to perceive their force and fell into a strain of invective that was irresistible  the first sparrow of spring the year beginning with younger hope than ever the faint silvery warblings heard over the partially bare and moist fields from the bluebird the song sparrow and the redwing as if the last flakes of winter tinkled as they fell what at such a time are histories chronologies traditions and all written revelations the brooks sing carols and glees to the spring the marsh hawk sailing low over the meadow is already seeking the first slimy life that awakes the sinking sound of melting snow is heard in all dells and the ice dissolves apace in the ponds the grass flames up on the hillsides like a spring fireet primitus oritur herba imbribus primoribus evocataas if the earth sent forth an inward heat to greet the returning sun not yellow but green is the color of its flamethe symbol of perpetual youth the grassblade like a long green ribbon streams from the sod into the summer checked indeed by the frost but anon pushing on again lifting its spear of last years hay with the fresh life below it grows as steadily as the rill oozes out of the ground it is almost identical with that for in the growing days of june when the rills are dry the grassblades are their channels and from year to year the herds drink at this perennial green stream and the mower draws from it betimes their winter supply so our human life but dies down to its root and still puts forth its green blade to eternity  walden is melting apace there is a canal two rods wide along the northerly and westerly sides and wider still at the east end a great field of ice has cracked off from the main body i hear a song sparrow singing from the bushes on the shoreolit olit olitchip chip chip che charche wiss wiss wiss he too is helping to crack it how handsome the great sweeping curves in the edge of the ice answering somewhat to those of the shore but more regular it is unusually hard owing to the recent severe but transient cold and all watered or waved like a palace floor but the wind slides eastward over its opaque surface in vain till it reaches the living surface beyond it is glorious to behold this ribbon of water sparkling in the sun the bare face of the pond full of glee and youth as if it spoke the joy of the fishes within it and of the sands on its shorea silvery sheen as from the scales of a leuciscus as it were all one active fish such is the contrast between winter and spring walden was dead and is alive again but this spring it broke up more steadily as i have said  the change from storm and winter to serene and mild weather from dark and sluggish hours to bright and elastic ones is a memorable crisis which all things proclaim it is seemingly instantaneous at last suddenly an influx of light filled my house though the evening was at hand and the clouds of winter still overhung it and the eaves were dripping with sleety rain i looked out the window and lo where yesterday was cold gray ice there lay the transparent pond already calm and full of hope as in a summer evening reflecting a summer evening sky in its bosom though none was visible overhead as if it had intelligence with some remote horizon i heard a robin in the distance the first i had heard for many a thousand years methought whose note i shall not forget for many a thousand morethe same sweet and powerful song as of yore o the evening robin at the end of a new england summer day if i could ever find the twig he sits upon i mean he i mean the twig this at least is not the turdus migratorius the pitch pines and shrub oaks about my house which had so long drooped suddenly resumed their several characters looked brighter greener and more erect and alive as if effectually cleansed and restored by the rain i knew that it would not rain any more you may tell by looking at any twig of the forest ay at your very woodpile whether its winter is past or not as it grew darker i was startled by the honking of geese flying low over the woods like weary travellers getting in late from southern lakes and indulging at last in unrestrained complaint and mutual consolation standing at my door i could hear the rush of their wings when driving toward my house they suddenly spied my light and with hushed clamor wheeled and settled in the pond so i came in and shut the door and passed my first spring night in the woods  in the morning i watched the geese from the door through the mist sailing in the middle of the pond fifty rods off so large and tumultuous that walden appeared like an artificial pond for their amusement but when i stood on the shore they at once rose up with a great flapping of wings at the signal of their commander and when they had got into rank circled about over my head twentynine of them and then steered straight to canada with a regular honk from the leader at intervals trusting to break their fast in muddier pools a plump of ducks rose at the same time and took the route to the north in the wake of their noisier cousins  for a week i heard the circling groping clangor of some solitary goose in the foggy mornings seeking its companion and still peopling the woods with the sound of a larger life than they could sustain in april the pigeons were seen again flying express in small flocks and in due time i heard the martins twittering over my clearing though it had not seemed that the township contained so many that it could afford me any and i fancied that they were peculiarly of the ancient race that dwelt in hollow trees ere white men came in almost all climes the tortoise and the frog are among the precursors and heralds of this season and birds fly with song and glancing plumage and plants spring and bloom and winds blow to correct this slight oscillation of the poles and preserve the equilibrium of nature  as every season seems best to us in its turn so the coming in of spring is like the creation of cosmos out of chaos and the realization of the golden age    eurus ad auroram nabathaeaque regna recessit    persidaque et radiis juga subdita matutinis    the eastwind withdrew to aurora and the nabathæn kingdom    and the persian and the ridges placed under the morning rays                                   man was born  whether that artificer of things    the origin of a better world made him from the divine seed    or the earth being recent and lately sundered from the high    ether retained some seeds of cognate heaven  a single gentle rain makes the grass many shades greener so our prospects brighten on the influx of better thoughts we should be blessed if we lived in the present always and took advantage of every accident that befell us like the grass which confesses the influence of the slightest dew that falls on it and did not spend our time in atoning for the neglect of past opportunities which we call doing our duty we loiter in winter while it is already spring in a pleasant spring morning all mens sins are forgiven such a day is a truce to vice while such a sun holds out to burn the vilest sinner may return through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our neighbors you may have known your neighbor yesterday for a thief a drunkard or a sensualist and merely pitied or despised him and despaired of the world but the sun shines bright and warm this first spring morning recreating the world and you meet him at some serene work and see how it is exhausted and debauched veins expand with still joy and bless the new day feel the spring influence with the innocence of infancy and all his faults are forgotten there is not only an atmosphere of good will about him but even a savor of holiness groping for expression blindly and ineffectually perhaps like a newborn instinct and for a short hour the south hillside echoes to no vulgar jest you see some innocent fair shoots preparing to burst from his gnarled rind and try another years life tender and fresh as the youngest plant even he has entered into the joy of his lord why the jailer does not leave open his prison doorswhy the judge does not dismis his casewhy the preacher does not dismiss his congregation it is because they do not obey the hint which god gives them nor accept the pardon which he freely offers to all  a return to goodness produced each day in the tranquil and beneficent breath of the morning causes that in respect to the love of virtue and the hatred of vice one approaches a little the primitive nature of man as the sprouts of the forest which has been felled in like manner the evil which one does in the interval of a day prevents the germs of virtues which began to spring up again from developing themselves and destroys them  after the germs of virtue have thus been prevented many times from developing themselves then the beneficent breath of evening does not suffice to preserve them as soon as the breath of evening does not suffice longer to preserve them then the nature of man does not differ much from that of the brute men seeing the nature of this man like that of the brute think that he has never possessed the innate faculty of reason are those the true and natural sentiments of man     the golden age was first created which without any avenger     spontaneously without law cherished fidelity and rectitude     punishment and fear were not nor were threatening words read     on suspended brass nor did the suppliant crowd fear     the words of their judge but were safe without an avenger     not yet the pine felled on its mountains had descended     to the liquid waves that it might see a foreign world     and mortals knew no shores but their own                                      there was eternal spring and placid zephyrs with warm     blasts soothed the flowers born without seed  on the 29th of april as i was fishing from the bank of the river near the nineacrecorner bridge standing on the quaking grass and willow roots where the muskrats lurk i heard a singular rattling sound somewhat like that of the sticks which boys play with their fingers when looking up i observed a very slight and graceful hawk like a nighthawk alternately soaring like a ripple and tumbling a rod or two over and over showing the under side of its wings which gleamed like a satin ribbon in the sun or like the pearly inside of a shell this sight reminded me of falconry and what nobleness and poetry are associated with that sport the merlin it seemed to me it might be called but i care not for its name it was the most ethereal flight i had ever witnessed it did not simply flutter like a butterfly nor soar like the larger hawks but it sported with proud reliance in the fields of air mounting again and again with its strange chuckle it repeated its free and beautiful fall turning over and over like a kite and then recovering from its lofty tumbling as if it had never set its foot on terra firma it appeared to have no companion in the universesporting there aloneand to need none but the morning and the ether with which it played it was not lonely but made all the earth lonely beneath it where was the parent which hatched it its kindred and its father in the heavens the tenant of the air it seemed related to the earth but by an egg hatched some time in the crevice of a cragor was its native nest made in the angle of a cloud woven of the rainbows trimmings and the sunset sky and lined with some soft midsummer haze caught up from earth its eyry now some cliffy cloud  beside this i got a rare mess of golden and silver and bright cupreous fishes which looked like a string of jewels ah i have penetrated to those meadows on the morning of many a first spring day jumping from hummock to hummock from willow root to willow root when the wild river valley and the woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the dead if they had been slumbering in their graves as some suppose there needs no stronger proof of immortality all things must live in such a light o death where was thy sting o grave where was thy victory then  our village life would stagnate if it were not for the unexplored forests and meadows which surround it we need the tonic of wildnessto wade sometimes in marshes where the bittern and the meadowhen lurk and hear the booming of the snipe to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground at the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things we require that all things be mysterious and unexplorable that land and sea be infinitely wild unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable we can never have enough of nature we must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor vast and titanic features the seacoast with its wrecks the wilderness with its living and its decaying trees the thundercloud and the rain which lasts three weeks and produces freshets we need to witness our own limits transgressed and some life pasturing freely where we never wander we are cheered when we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast there was a dead horse in the hollow by the path to my house which compelled me sometimes to go out of my way especially in the night when the air was heavy but the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and inviolable health of nature was my compensation for this i love to see that nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another that tender organizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like pulptadpoles which herons gobble up and tortoises and toads run over in the road and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood with the liability to accident we must see how little account is to be made of it the impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence poison is not poisonous after all nor are any wounds fatal compassion is a very untenable ground it must be expeditious its pleadings will not bear to be stereotyped  early in may the oaks hickories maples and other trees just putting out amidst the pine woods around the pond imparted a brightness like sunshine to the landscape especially in cloudy days as if the sun were breaking through mists and shining faintly on the hillsides here and there on the third or fourth of may i saw a loon in the pond and during the first week of the month i heard the whippoorwill the brown thrasher the veery the wood pewee the chewink and other birds i had heard the wood thrush long before the phœbe had already come once more and looked in at my door and window to see if my house was cavernlike enough for her sustaining herself on humming wings with clinched talons as if she held by the air while she surveyed the premises the sulphurlike pollen of the pitch pine soon covered the pond and the stones and rotten wood along the shore so that you could have collected a barrelful this is the sulphur showers we hear of even in calidas drama of sacontala we read of rills dyed yellow with the golden dust of the lotus and so the seasons went rolling on into summer as one rambles into higher and higher grass  thus was my first years life in the woods completed and the second year was similar to it i finally left walden september 6th 1847     conclusion   to the sick the doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery thank heaven here is not all the world the buckeye does not grow in new england and the mockingbird is rarely heard here the wild goose is more of a cosmopolite than we he breaks his fast in canada takes a luncheon in the ohio and plumes himself for the night in a southern bayou even the bison to some extent keeps pace with the seasons cropping the pastures of the colorado only till a greener and sweeter grass awaits him by the yellowstone yet we think that if rail fences are pulled down and stone walls piled up on our farms bounds are henceforth set to our lives and our fates decided if you are chosen town clerk forsooth you cannot go to tierra del fuego this summer but you may go to the land of infernal fire nevertheless the universe is wider than our views of it  yet we should oftener look over the tafferel of our craft like curious passengers and not make the voyage like stupid sailors picking oakum the other side of the globe is but the home of our correspondent our voyaging is only greatcircle sailing and the doctors prescribe for diseases of the skin merely one hastens to southern africa to chase the giraffe but surely that is not the game he would be after how long pray would a man hunt giraffes if he could snipes and woodcocks also may afford rare sport but i trust it would be nobler game to shoot ones self            direct your eye right inward and youll find            a thousand regions in your mind            yet undiscovered  travel them and be            expert in homecosmography  what does africawhat does the west stand for is not our own interior white on the chart black though it may prove like the coast when discovered is it the source of the nile or the niger or the mississippi or a northwest passage around this continent that we would find are these the problems which most concern mankind is franklin the only man who is lost that his wife should be so earnest to find him does mr grinnell know where he himself is be rather the mungo park the lewis and clark and frobisher of your own streams and oceans explore your own higher latitudeswith shiploads of preserved meats to support you if they be necessary and pile the empty cans skyhigh for a sign were preserved meats invented to preserve meat merely nay be a columbus to whole new continents and worlds within you opening new channels not of trade but of thought every man is the lord of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the czar is but a petty state a hummock left by the ice yet some can be patriotic who have no selfrespect and sacrifice the greater to the less they love the soil which makes their graves but have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate their clay patriotism is a maggot in their heads what was the meaning of that southsea exploring expedition with all its parade and expense but an indirect recognition of the fact that there are continents and seas in the moral world to which every man is an isthmus or an inlet yet unexplored by him but that it is easier to sail many thousand miles through cold and storm and cannibals in a government ship with five hundred men and boys to assist one than it is to explore the private sea the atlantic and pacific ocean of ones being alone            erret et extremos alter scrutetur iberos            plus habet hic vitae plus habet ille viae     let them wander and scrutinize the outlandish australians    i have more of god they more of the road  it is not worth the while to go round the world to count the cats in zanzibar yet do this even till you can do better and you may perhaps find some symmes hole by which to get at the inside at last england and france spain and portugal gold coast and slave coast all front on this private sea but no bark from them has ventured out of sight of land though it is without doubt the direct way to india if you would learn to speak all tongues and conform to the customs of all nations if you would travel farther than all travellers be naturalized in all climes and cause the sphinx to dash her head against a stone even obey the precept of the old philosopher and explore thyself herein are demanded the eye and the nerve only the defeated and deserters go to the wars cowards that run away and enlist start now on that farthest western way which does not pause at the mississippi or the pacific nor conduct toward a wornout china or japan but leads on direct a tangent to this sphere summer and winter day and night sun down moon down and at last earth down too  it is said that mirabeau took to highway robbery to ascertain what degree of resolution was necessary in order to place ones self in formal opposition to the most sacred laws of society he declared that a soldier who fights in the ranks does not require half so much courage as a footpadthat honor and religion have never stood in the way of a wellconsidered and a firm resolve this was manly as the world goes and yet it was idle if not desperate a saner man would have found himself often enough in formal opposition to what are deemed the most sacred laws of society through obedience to yet more sacred laws and so have tested his resolution without going out of his way it is not for a man to put himself in such an attitude to society but to maintain himself in whatever attitude he find himself through obedience to the laws of his being which will never be one of opposition to a just government if he should chance to meet with such  i left the woods for as good a reason as i went there perhaps it seemed to me that i had several more lives to live and could not spare any more time for that one it is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route and make a beaten track for ourselves i had not lived there a week before my feet wore a path from my door to the pondside and though it is five or six years since i trod it it is still quite distinct it is true i fear that others may have fallen into it and so helped to keep it open the surface of the earth is soft and impressible by the feet of men and so with the paths which the mind travels how worn and dusty then must be the highways of the world how deep the ruts of tradition and conformity i did not wish to take a cabin passage but rather to go before the mast and on the deck of the world for there i could best see the moonlight amid the mountains i do not wish to go below now  i learned this at least by my experiment that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours he will put some things behind will pass an invisible boundary new universal and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him or the old laws be expanded and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense and he will live with the license of a higher order of beings in proportion as he simplifies his life the laws of the universe will appear less complex and solitude will not be solitude nor poverty poverty nor weakness weakness if you have built castles in the air your work need not be lost that is where they should be now put the foundations under them  it is a ridiculous demand which england and america make that you shall speak so that they can understand you neither men nor toadstools grow so as if that were important and there were not enough to understand you without them as if nature could support but one order of understandings could not sustain birds as well as quadrupeds flying as well as creeping things and hush and whoa which bright can understand were the best english as if there were safety in stupidity alone i fear chiefly lest my expression may not be extravagant enough may not wander far enough beyond the narrow limits of my daily experience so as to be adequate to the truth of which i have been convinced extra vagance it depends on how you are yarded the migrating buffalo which seeks new pastures in another latitude is not extravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail leaps the cowyard fence and runs after her calf in milking time i desire to speak somewhere without bounds like a man in a waking moment to men in their waking moments for i am convinced that i cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression who that has heard a strain of music feared then lest he should speak extravagantly any more forever in view of the future or possible we should live quite laxly and undefined in front our outlines dim and misty on that side as our shadows reveal an insensible perspiration toward the sun the volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement their truth is instantly translated its literal monument alone remains the words which express our faith and piety are not definite yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures  why level downward to our dullest perception always and praise that as common sense the commonest sense is the sense of men asleep which they express by snoring sometimes we are inclined to class those who are onceandahalfwitted with the halfwitted because we appreciate only a third part of their wit some would find fault with the morning red if they ever got up early enough they pretend as i hear that the verses of kabir have four different senses illusion spirit intellect and the exoteric doctrine of the vedas but in this part of the world it is considered a ground for complaint if a mans writings admit of more than one interpretation while england endeavors to cure the potatorot will not any endeavor to cure the brainrot which prevails so much more widely and fatally  i do not suppose that i have attained to obscurity but i should be proud if no more fatal fault were found with my pages on this score than was found with the walden ice southern customers objected to its blue color which is the evidence of its purity as if it were muddy and preferred the cambridge ice which is white but tastes of weeds the purity men love is like the mists which envelop the earth and not like the azure ether beyond  some are dinning in our ears that we americans and moderns generally are intellectual dwarfs compared with the ancients or even the elizabethan men but what is that to the purpose a living dog is better than a dead lion shall a man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies and not be the biggest pygmy that he can let every one mind his own business and endeavor to be what he was made  why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises if a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer let him step to the music which he hears however measured or far away it is not important that he should mature as soon as an apple tree or an oak shall he turn his spring into summer if the condition of things which we were made for is not yet what were any reality which we can substitute we will not be shipwrecked on a vain reality shall we with pains erect a heaven of blue glass over ourselves though when it is done we shall be sure to gaze still at the true ethereal heaven far above as if the former were not  there was an artist in the city of kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection one day it came into his mind to make a staff having considered that in an imperfect work time is an ingredient but into a perfect work time does not enter he said to himself it shall be perfect in all respects though i should do nothing else in my life he proceeded instantly to the forest for wood being resolved that it should not be made of unsuitable material and as he searched for and rejected stick after stick his friends gradually deserted him for they grew old in their works and died but he grew not older by a moment his singleness of purpose and resolution and his elevated piety endowed him without his knowledge with perennial youth as he made no compromise with time time kept out of his way and only sighed at a distance because he could not overcome him before he had found a stock in all respects suitable the city of kouroo was a hoary ruin and he sat on one of its mounds to peel the stick before he had given it the proper shape the dynasty of the candahars was at an end and with the point of the stick he wrote the name of the last of that race in the sand and then resumed his work by the time he had smoothed and polished the staff kalpa was no longer the polestar and ere he had put on the ferule and the head adorned with precious stones brahma had awoke and slumbered many times but why do i stay to mention these things when the finishing stroke was put to his work it suddenly expanded before the eyes of the astonished artist into the fairest of all the creations of brahma he had made a new system in making a staff a world with full and fair proportions in which though the old cities and dynasties had passed away fairer and more glorious ones had taken their places and now he saw by the heap of shavings still fresh at his feet that for him and his work the former lapse of time had been an illusion and that no more time had elapsed than is required for a single scintillation from the brain of brahma to fall on and inflame the tinder of a mortal brain the material was pure and his art was pure how could the result be other than wonderful  no face which we can give to a matter will stead us so well at last as the truth this alone wears well for the most part we are not where we are but in a false position through an infinity of our natures we suppose a case and put ourselves into it and hence are in two cases at the same time and it is doubly difficult to get out in sane moments we regard only the facts the case that is say what you have to say not what you ought any truth is better than makebelieve tom hyde the tinker standing on the gallows was asked if he had anything to say tell the tailors said he to remember to make a knot in their thread before they take the first stitch his companions prayer is forgotten  however mean your life is meet it and live it do not shun it and call it hard names it is not so bad as you are it looks poorest when you are richest the faultfinder will find faults even in paradise love your life poor as it is you may perhaps have some pleasant thrilling glorious hours even in a poorhouse the setting sun is reflected from the windows of the almshouse as brightly as from the rich mans abode the snow melts before its door as early in the spring i do not see but a quiet mind may live as contentedly there and have as cheering thoughts as in a palace the towns poor seem to me often to live the most independent lives of any maybe they are simply great enough to receive without misgiving most think that they are above being supported by the town but it oftener happens that they are not above supporting themselves by dishonest means which should be more disreputable cultivate poverty like a garden herb like sage do not trouble yourself much to get new things whether clothes or friends turn the old return to them things do not change we change sell your clothes and keep your thoughts god will see that you do not want society if i were confined to a corner of a garret all my days like a spider the world would be just as large to me while i had my thoughts about me the philosopher said from an army of three divisions one can take away its general and put it in disorder from the man the most abject and vulgar one cannot take away his thought do not seek so anxiously to be developed to subject yourself to many influences to be played on it is all dissipation humility like darkness reveals the heavenly lights the shadows of poverty and meanness gather around us and lo creation widens to our view we are often reminded that if there were bestowed on us the wealth of croesus our aims must still be the same and our means essentially the same moreover if you are restricted in your range by poverty if you cannot buy books and newspapers for instance you are but confined to the most significant and vital experiences you are compelled to deal with the material which yields the most sugar and the most starch it is life near the bone where it is sweetest you are defended from being a trifler no man loses ever on a lower level by magnanimity on a higher superfluous wealth can buy superfluities only money is not required to buy one necessary of the soul  i live in the angle of a leaden wall into whose composition was poured a little alloy of bellmetal often in the repose of my midday there reaches my ears a confused tintinnabulum from without it is the noise of my contemporaries my neighbors tell me of their adventures with famous gentlemen and ladies what notabilities they met at the dinnertable but i am no more interested in such things than in the contents of the daily times the interest and the conversation are about costume and manners chiefly but a goose is a goose still dress it as you will they tell me of california and texas of england and the indies of the hon mrof georgia or of massachusetts all transient and fleeting phenomena till i am ready to leap from their courtyard like the mameluke bey i delight to come to my bearingsnot walk in procession with pomp and parade in a conspicuous place but to walk even with the builder of the universe if i maynot to live in this restless nervous bustling trivial nineteenth century but stand or sit thoughtfully while it goes by what are men celebrating they are all on a committee of arrangements and hourly expect a speech from somebody god is only the president of the day and webster is his orator i love to weigh to settle to gravitate toward that which most strongly and rightfully attracts menot hang by the beam of the scale and try to weigh lessnot suppose a case but take the case that is to travel the only path i can and that on which no power can resist me it affords me no satisfaction to commerce to spring an arch before i have got a solid foundation let us not play at kittlybenders there is a solid bottom everywhere we read that the traveller asked the boy if the swamp before him had a hard bottom the boy replied that it had but presently the travellers horse sank in up to the girths and he observed to the boy i thought you said that this bog had a hard bottom so it has answered the latter but you have not got half way to it yet so it is with the bogs and quicksands of society but he is an old boy that knows it only what is thought said or done at a certain rare coincidence is good i would not be one of those who will foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering such a deed would keep me awake nights give me a hammer and let me feel for the furring do not depend on the putty drive a nail home and clinch it so faithfully that you can wake up in the night and think of your work with satisfactiona work at which you would not be ashamed to invoke the muse so will help you god and so only every nail driven should be as another rivet in the machine of the universe you carrying on the work  rather than love than money than fame give me truth i sat at a table where were rich food and wine in abundance and obsequious attendance but sincerity and truth were not and i went away hungry from the inhospitable board the hospitality was as cold as the ices i thought that there was no need of ice to freeze them they talked to me of the age of the wine and the fame of the vintage but i thought of an older a newer and purer wine of a more glorious vintage which they had not got and could not buy the style the house and grounds and entertainment pass for nothing with me i called on the king but he made me wait in his hall and conducted like a man incapacitated for hospitality there was a man in my neighborhood who lived in a hollow tree his manners were truly regal i should have done better had i called on him  how long shall we sit in our porticoes practising idle and musty virtues which any work would make impertinent as if one were to begin the day with longsuffering and hire a man to hoe his potatoes and in the afternoon go forth to practise christian meekness and charity with goodness aforethought consider the china pride and stagnant selfcomplacency of mankind this generation inclines a little to congratulate itself on being the last of an illustrious line and in boston and london and paris and rome thinking of its long descent it speaks of its progress in art and science and literature with satisfaction there are the records of the philosophical societies and the public eulogies of great men it is the good adam contemplating his own virtue yes we have done great deeds and sung divine songs which shall never diethat is as long as we can remember them the learned societies and great men of assyriawhere are they what youthful philosophers and experimentalists we are there is not one of my readers who has yet lived a whole human life these may be but the spring months in the life of the race if we have had the sevenyears itch we have not seen the seventeenyear locust yet in concord we are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on which we live most have not delved six feet beneath the surface nor leaped as many above it we know not where we are beside we are sound asleep nearly half our time yet we esteem ourselves wise and have an established order on the surface truly we are deep thinkers we are ambitious spirits as i stand over the insect crawling amid the pine needles on the forest floor and endeavoring to conceal itself from my sight and ask myself why it will cherish those humble thoughts and bide its head from me who might perhaps be its benefactor and impart to its race some cheering information i am reminded of the greater benefactor and intelligence that stands over me the human insect  there is an incessant influx of novelty into the world and yet we tolerate incredible dulness i need only suggest what kind of sermons are still listened to in the most enlightened countries there are such words as joy and sorrow but they are only the burden of a psalm sung with a nasal twang while we believe in the ordinary and mean we think that we can change our clothes only it is said that the british empire is very large and respectable and that the united states are a firstrate power we do not believe that a tide rises and falls behind every man which can float the british empire like a chip if he should ever harbor it in his mind who knows what sort of seventeenyear locust will next come out of the ground the government of the world i live in was not framed like that of britain in afterdinner conversations over the wine  the life in us is like the water in the river it may rise this year higher than man has ever known it and flood the parched uplands even this may be the eventful year which will drown out all our muskrats it was not always dry land where we dwell i see far inland the banks which the stream anciently washed before science began to record its freshets every one has heard the story which has gone the rounds of new england of a strong and beautiful bug which came out of the dry leaf of an old table of appletree wood which had stood in a farmers kitchen for sixty years first in connecticut and afterward in massachusettsfrom an egg deposited in the living tree many years earlier still as appeared by counting the annual layers beyond it which was heard gnawing out for several weeks hatched perchance by the heat of an urn who does not feel his faith in a resurrection and immortality strengthened by hearing of this who knows what beautiful and winged life whose egg has been buried for ages under many concentric layers of woodenness in the dead dry life of society deposited at first in the alburnum of the green and living tree which has been gradually converted into the semblance of its wellseasoned tombheard perchance gnawing out now for years by the astonished family of man as they sat round the festive boardmay unexpectedly come forth from amidst societys most trivial and handselled furniture to enjoy its perfect summer life at last  i do not say that john or jonathan will realize all this but such is the character of that morrow which mere lapse of time can never make to dawn the light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us only that day dawns to which we are awake there is more day to dawn the sun is but a morning star     on the duty of civil disobedience   i heartily accept the mottothat government is best which governs least and i should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically carried out it finally amounts to this which also i believethat government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have government is at best but an expedient but most governments are usually and all governments are sometimes inexpedient the objections which have been brought against a standing army and they are many and weighty and deserve to prevail may also at last be brought against a standing government the standing army is only an arm of the standing government the government itself which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it witness the present mexican war the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool for in the outset the people would not have consented to this measure  this american governmentwhat is it but a tradition though a recent one endeavoring to transmit itself unimpaired to posterity but each instant losing some of its integrity it has not the vitality and force of a single living man for a single man can bend it to his will it is a sort of wooden gun to the people themselves but it is not the less necessary for this for the people must have some complicated machinery or other and hear its din to satisfy that idea of government which they have governments show thus how successfully men can be imposed on even impose on themselves for their own advantage it is excellent we must all allow yet this government never of itself furthered any enterprise but by the alacrity with which it got out of its way it does not keep the country free it does not settle the west it does not educate the character inherent in the american people has done all that has been accomplished and it would have done somewhat more if the government had not sometimes got in its way for government is an expedient by which men would fain succeed in letting one another alone and as has been said when it is most expedient the governed are most let alone by it trade and commerce if they were not made of india rubber would never manage to bounce over the obstacles which legislators are continually putting in their way and if one were to judge these men wholly by the effects of their actions and not partly by their intentions they would deserve to be classed and punished with those mischievous persons who put obstructions on the railroads  but to speak practically and as a citizen unlike those who call themselves nogovernment men i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect and that will be one step toward obtaining it  after all the practical reason why when the power is once in the hands of the people a majority are permitted and for a long period continue to rule is not because they are most likely to be in the right nor because this seems fairest to the minority but because they are physically the strongest but a government in which the majority rule in all cases cannot be based on justice even as far as men understand it can there not be a government in which majorities do not virtually decide right and wrong but consciencein which majorities decide only those questions to which the rule of expediency is applicable must the citizen ever for a moment or in the least degree resign his conscience to the legislator why has every man a conscience then i think that we should be men first and subjects afterward it is not desirable to cultivate a respect for the law so much as for the right the only obligation which i have a right to assume is to do at any time what i think right it is truly enough said that a corporation has no conscience but a corporation of conscientious men is a corporation with a conscience law never made men a whit more just and by means of their respect for it even the welldisposed are daily made the agents of injustice a common and natural result of an undue respect for law is that you may see a file of soldiers colonel captain corporal privates powdermonkeys and all marching in admirable order over hill and dale to the wars against their wills ay against their common sense and consciences which makes it very steep marching indeed and produces a palpitation of the heart they have no doubt that it is a damnable business in which they are concerned they are all peaceably inclined now what are they men at all or small movable forts and magazines at the service of some unscrupulous man in power visit the navy yard and behold a marine such a man as an american government can make or such as it can make a man with its black artsa mere shadow and reminiscence of humanity a man laid out alive and standing and already as one may say buried under arms with funeral accompaniments though it may be             not a drum was heard not a funeral note                as his corse to the rampart we hurried             not a soldier discharged his farewell shot                oer the grave where our hero we buried  the mass of men serve the state thus not as men mainly but as machines with their bodies they are the standing army and the militia jailers constables posse comitatus etc in most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well such command no more respect than men of straw or a lump of dirt they have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs yet such as these even are commonly esteemed good citizens others as most legislators politicians lawyers ministers and officeholders serve the state chiefly with their heads and as they rarely make any moral distinctions they are as likely to serve the devil without intending it as god a very few as heroes patriots martyrs reformers in the great sense and men serve the state with their consciences also and so necessarily resist it for the most part and they are commonly treated as enemies by it a wise man will only be useful as a man and will not submit to be clay and stop a hole to keep the wind away but leave that office to his dust at least            i am too highborn to be propertied            to be a secondary at control            or useful servingman and instrument            to any sovereign state throughout the world  he who gives himself entirely to his fellowmen appears to them useless and selfish but he who gives himself partially to them is pronounced a benefactor and philanthropist  how does it become a man to behave toward this american government today i answer that he cannot without disgrace be associated with it i cannot for an instant recognize that political organization as my government which is the slaves government also  all men recognize the right of revolution that is the right to refuse allegiance to and to resist the government when its tyranny or its inefficiency are great and unendurable but almost all say that such is not the case now but such was the case they think in the revolution of 75 if one were to tell me that this was a bad government because it taxed certain foreign commodities brought to its ports it is most probable that i should not make an ado about it for i can do without them all machines have their friction and possibly this does enough good to counterbalance the evil at any rate it is a great evil to make a stir about it but when the friction comes to have its machine and oppression and robbery are organized i say let us not have such a machine any longer in other words when a sixth of the population of a nation which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty are slaves and a whole country is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army and subjected to military law i think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize what makes this duty the more urgent is the fact that the country so overrun is not our own but ours is the invading army  paley a common authority with many on moral questions in his chapter on the duty of submission to civil government resolves all civil obligation into expediency and he proceeds to say that so long as the interest of the whole society requires it that is so long as the established government cannot be resisted or changed without public inconveniency it is the will of god that the established government be obeyed and no longer this principle being admitted the justice of every particular case of resistance is reduced to a computation of the quantity of the danger and grievance on the one side and of the probability and expense of redressing it on the other of this he says every man shall judge for himself but paley appears never to have contemplated those cases to which the rule of expediency does not apply in which a people as well as an individual must do justice cost what it may if i have unjustly wrested a plank from a drowning man i must restore it to him though i drown myself this according to paley would be inconvenient but he that would save his life in such a case shall lose it this people must cease to hold slaves and to make war on mexico though it cost them their existence as a people  in their practice nations agree with paley but does any one think that massachusetts does exactly what is right at the present crisis    a drab of state a clothosilver slut     to have her train borne up and her soul trail in the dirt  practically speaking the opponents to a reform in massachusetts are not a hundred thousand politicians at the south but a hundred thousand merchants and farmers here who are more interested in commerce and agriculture than they are in humanity and are not prepared to do justice to the slave and to mexico cost what it may i quarrel not with faroff foes but with those who near at home cooperate with and do the bidding of those far away and without whom the latter would be harmless we are accustomed to say that the mass of men are unprepared but improvement is slow because the few are not materially wiser or better than the many it is not so important that many should be as good as you as that there be some absolute goodness somewhere for that will leaven the whole lump there are thousands who are in opinion opposed to slavery and to the war who yet in effect do nothing to put an end to them who esteeming themselves children of washington and franklin sit down with their hands in their pockets and say that they know not what to do and do nothing who even postpone the question of freedom to the question of freetrade and quietly read the pricescurrent along with the latest advices from mexico after dinner and it may be fall asleep over them both what is the pricecurrent of an honest man and patriot today they hesitate and they regret and sometimes they petition but they do nothing in earnest and with effect they will wait well disposed for others to remedy the evil that they may no longer have it to regret at most they give only a cheap vote and a feeble countenance and godspeed to the right as it goes by them there are nine hundred and ninetynine patrons of virtue to one virtuous man but it is easier to deal with the real possessor of a thing than with the temporary guardian of it  all voting is a sort of gaming like checkers or backgammon with a slight moral tinge to it a playing with right and wrong with moral questions and betting naturally accompanies it the character of the voters is not staked i cast my vote perchance as i think right but i am not vitally concerned that that right should prevail i am willing to leave it to the majority its obligation therefore never exceeds that of expediency even voting for the right is doing nothing for it it is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it should prevail a wise man will not leave the right to the mercy of chance nor wish it to prevail through the power of the majority there is but little virtue in the action of masses of men when the majority shall at length vote for the abolition of slavery it will be because they are indifferent to slavery or because there is but little slavery left to be abolished by their vote they will then be the only slaves only his vote can hasten the abolition of slavery who asserts his own freedom by his vote  i hear of a convention to be held at baltimore or elsewhere for the selection of a candidate for the presidency made up chiefly of editors and men who are politicians by profession but i think what is it to any independent intelligent and respectable man what decision they may come to shall we not have the advantage of his wisdom and honesty nevertheless can we not count upon some independent votes are there not many individuals in the country who do not attend conventions but no i find that the respectable man so called has immediately drifted from his position and despairs of his country when his country has more reason to despair of him he forthwith adopts one of the candidates thus selected as the only available one thus proving that he is himself available for any purposes of the demagogue his vote is of no more worth than that of any unprincipled foreigner or hireling native who may have been bought oh for a man who is a man and as my neighbor says has a bone in his back which you cannot pass your hand through our statistics are at fault the population has been returned too large how many men are there to a square thousand miles in this country hardly one does not america offer any inducement for men to settle here the american has dwindled into an odd fellowone who may be known by the development of his organ of gregariousness and a manifest lack of intellect and cheerful selfreliance whose first and chief concern on coming into the world is to see that the almshouses are in good repair and before yet he has lawfully donned the virile garb to collect a fund for the support of the widows and orphans that may be who in short ventures to live only by the aid of the mutual insurance company which has promised to bury him decently  it is not a mans duty as a matter of course to devote himself to the eradication of any even the most enormous wrong he may still properly have other concerns to engage him but it is his duty at least to wash his hands of it and if he gives it no thought longer not to give it practically his support if i devote myself to other pursuits and contemplations i must first see at least that i do not pursue them sitting upon another mans shoulders i must get off him first that he may pursue his contemplations too see what gross inconsistency is tolerated i have heard some of my townsmen say i should like to have them order me out to help put down an insurrection of the slaves or to march to mexicosee if i would go and yet these very men have each directly by their allegiance and so indirectly at least by their money furnished a substitute the soldier is applauded who refuses to serve in an unjust war by those who do not refuse to sustain the unjust government which makes the war is applauded by those whose own act and authority he disregards and sets at naught as if the state were penitent to that degree that it hired one to scourge it while it sinned but not to that degree that it left off sinning for a moment thus under the name of order and civil government we are all made at last to pay homage to and support our own meanness after the first blush of sin comes its indifference and from immoral it becomes as it were unmoral and not quite unnecessary to that life which we have made  the broadest and most prevalent error requires the most disinterested virtue to sustain it the slight reproach to which the virtue of patriotism is commonly liable the noble are most likely to incur those who while they disapprove of the character and measures of a government yield to it their allegiance and support are undoubtedly its most conscientious supporters and so frequently the most serious obstacles to reform some are petitioning the state to dissolve the union to disregard the requisitions of the president why do they not dissolve it themselvesthe union between themselves and the stateand refuse to pay their quota into its treasury do not they stand in the same relation to the state that the state does to the union and have not the same reasons prevented the state from resisting the union which have prevented them from resisting the state  how can a man be satisfied to entertain an opinion merely and enjoy it is there any enjoyment in it if his opinion is that he is aggrieved if you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbor you do not rest satisfied with knowing that you are cheated or with saying that you are cheated or even with petitioning him to pay you your due but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount and see that you are never cheated again action from principlethe perception and the performance of rightchanges things and relations it is essentially revolutionary and does not consist wholly with anything which was it not only divides states and churches it divides families ay it divides the individual separating the diabolical in him from the divine  unjust laws exist shall we be content to obey them or shall we endeavor to amend them and obey them until we have succeeded or shall we transgress them at once men generally under such a government as this think that they ought to wait until they have persuaded the majority to alter them they think that if they should resist the remedy would be worse than the evil but it is the fault of the government itself that the remedy is worse than the evil it makes it worse why is it not more apt to anticipate and provide for reform why does it not cherish its wise minority why does it cry and resist before it is hurt why does it not encourage its citizens to be on the alert to point out its faults and do better than it would have them why does it always crucify christ and excommunicate copernicus and luther and pronounce washington and franklin rebels  one would think that a deliberate and practical denial of its authority was the only offence never contemplated by government else why has it not assigned its definite its suitable and proportionate penalty if a man who has no property refuses but once to earn nine shillings for the state he is put in prison for a period unlimited by any law that i know and determined only by the discretion of those who placed him there but if he should steal ninety times nine shillings from the state he is soon permitted to go at large again  if the injustice is part of the necessary friction of the machine of government let it go let it go perchance it will wear smoothcertainly the machine will wear out if the injustice has a spring or a pulley or a rope or a crank exclusively for itself then perhaps you may consider whether the remedy will not be worse than the evil but if it is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another then i say break the law let your life be a counter friction to stop the machine what i have to do is to see at any rate that i do not lend myself to the wrong which i condemn  as for adopting the ways which the state has provided for remedying the evil i know not of such ways they take too much time and a mans life will be gone i have other affairs to attend to i came into this world not chiefly to make this a good place to live in but to live in it be it good or bad a man has not everything to do but something and because he cannot do everything it is not necessary that he should do something wrong it is not my business to be petitioning the governor or the legislature any more than it is theirs to petition me and if they should not hear my petition what should i do then but in this case the state has provided no way its very constitution is the evil this may seem to be harsh and stubborn and unconciliatory but it is to treat with the utmost kindness and consideration the only spirit that can appreciate or deserves it so is an change for the better like birth and death which convulse the body  i do not hesitate to say that those who call themselves abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their support both in person and property from the government of massachusetts and not wait till they constitute a majority of one before they suffer the right to prevail through them i think that it is enough if they have god on their side without waiting for that other one moreover any man more right than his neighbors constitutes a majority of one already  i meet this american government or its representative the state government directly and face to face once a yearno morein the person of its taxgatherer this is the only mode in which a man situated as i am necessarily meets it and it then says distinctly recognize me and the simplest the most effectual and in the present posture of affairs the indispensablest mode of treating with it on this head of expressing your little satisfaction with and love for it is to deny it then my civil neighbor the taxgatherer is the very man i have to deal withfor it is after all with men and not with parchment that i quarreland he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government how shall he ever know well what he is and does as an officer of the government or as a man until he is obliged to consider whether he shall treat me his neighbor for whom he has respect as a neighbor and welldisposed man or as a maniac and disturber of the peace and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action i know this well that if one thousand if one hundred if ten men whom i could nameif ten honest men onlyay if one honest man in this state of massachusetts ceasing to hold slaves were actually to withdraw from this copartnership and be locked up in the county jail therefor it would be the abolition of slavery in america for it matters not how small the beginning may seem to be what is once well done is done forever but we love better to talk about it that we say is our mission reform keeps many scores of newspapers in its service but not one man if my esteemed neighbor the states ambassador who will devote his days to the settlement of the question of human rights in the council chamber instead of being threatened with the prisons of carolina were to sit down the prisoner of massachusetts that state which is so anxious to foist the sin of slavery upon her sisterthough at present she can discover only an act of inhospitality to be the ground of a quarrel with herthe legislature would not wholly waive the subject the following winter  under a government which imprisons any unjustly the true place for a just man is also a prison the proper place today the only place which massachusetts has provided for her freer and less desponding spirits is in her prisons to be put out and locked out of the state by her own act as they have already put themselves out by their principles it is there that the fugitive slave and the mexican prisoner on parole and the indian come to plead the wrongs of his race should find them on that separate but more free and honorable ground where the state places those who are not with her but against herthe only house in a slave state in which a free man can abide with honor if any think that their influence would be lost there and their voices no longer afflict the ear of the state that they would not be as an enemy within its walls they do not know by how much truth is stronger than error nor how much more eloquently and effectively he can combat injustice who has experienced a little in his own person cast your whole vote not a strip of paper merely but your whole influence a minority is powerless while it conforms to the majority it is not even a minority then but it is irresistible when it clogs by its whole weight if the alternative is to keep all just men in prison or give up war and slavery the state will not hesitate which to choose if a thousand men were not to pay their taxbills this year that would not be a violent and bloody measure as it would be to pay them and enable the state to commit violence and shed innocent blood this is in fact the definition of a peaceable revolution if any such is possible if the taxgatherer or any other public officer asks me as one has done but what shall i do my answer is if you really wish to do anything resign your office when the subject has refused allegiance and the officer has resigned his office then the revolution is accomplished but even suppose blood should flow is there not a sort of blood shed when the conscience is wounded through this wound a mans real manhood and immortality flow out and he bleeds to an everlasting death i see this blood flowing now  i have contemplated the imprisonment of the offender rather than the seizure of his goodsthough both will serve the same purposebecause they who assert the purest right and consequently are most dangerous to a corrupt state commonly have not spent much time in accumulating property to such the state renders comparatively small service and a slight tax is wont to appear exorbitant particularly if they are obliged to earn it by special labor with their hands if there were one who lived wholly without the use of money the state itself would hesitate to demand it of him but the rich mannot to make any invidious comparisonis always sold to the institution which makes him rich absolutely speaking the more money the less virtue for money comes between a man and his objects and obtains them for him and it was certainly no great virtue to obtain it it puts to rest many questions which he would otherwise be taxed to answer while the only new question which it puts is the hard but superfluous one how to spend it thus his moral ground is taken from under his feet the opportunities of living are diminished in proportion as what are called the means are increased the best thing a man can do for his culture when he is rich is to endeavor to carry out those schemes which he entertained when he was poor christ answered the herodians according to their condition show me the tributemoney said heand one took a penny out of his pocketif you use money which has the image of cæsar on it and which he has made current and valuable that is if you are men of the state and gladly enjoy the advantages of cæsars government then pay him back some of his own when he demands it render therefore to cæsar that which is cæsars and to god those things which are godsleaving them no wiser than before as to which was which for they did not wish to know  when i converse with the freest of my neighbors i perceive that whatever they may say about the magnitude and seriousness of the question and their regard for the public tranquillity the long and the short of the matter is that they cannot spare the protection of the existing government and they dread the consequences to their property and families of disobedience to it for my own part i should not like to think that i ever rely on the protection of the state but if i deny the authority of the state when it presents its taxbill it will soon take and waste all my property and so harass me and my children without end this is hard this makes it impossible for a man to live honestly and at the same time comfortably in outward respects it will not be worth the while to accumulate property that would be sure to go again you must hire or squat somewhere and raise but a small crop and eat that soon you must live within yourself and depend upon yourself always tucked up and ready for a start and not have many affairs a man may grow rich in turkey even if he will be in all respects a good subject of the turkish government confucius said if a state is governed by the principles of reason poverty and misery are subjects of shame if a state is not governed by the principles of reason riches and honors are the subjects of shame no until i want the protection of massachusetts to be extended to me in some distant southern port where my liberty is endangered or until i am bent solely on building up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise i can afford to refuse allegiance to massachusetts and her right to my property and life it costs me less in every sense to incur the penalty of disobedience to the state than it would to obey i should feel as if i were worth less in that case  some years ago the state met me in behalf of the church and commanded me to pay a certain sum toward the support of a clergyman whose preaching my father attended but never i myself pay it said or be locked up in the jail i declined to pay but unfortunately another man saw fit to pay it i did not see why the schoolmaster should be taxed to support the priest and not the priest the schoolmaster for i was not the states schoolmaster but i supported myself by voluntary subscription i did not see why the lyceum should not present its taxbill and have the state to back its demand as well as the church however at the request of the selectmen i condescended to make some such statement as this in writingknow all men by these presents that i henry thoreau do not wish to be regarded as a member of any incorporated society which i have not joined this i gave to the town clerk and he has it the state having thus learned that i did not wish to be regarded as a member of that church has never made a like demand on me since though it said that it must adhere to its original presumption that time if i had known how to name them i should then have signed off in detail from all the societies which i never signed on to but i did not know where to find a complete list  i have paid no polltax for six years i was put into a jail once on this account for one night and as i stood considering the walls of solid stone two or three feet thick the door of wood and iron a foot thick and the iron grating which strained the light i could not help being struck with the foolishness of that institution which treated me as if i were mere flesh and blood and bones to be locked up i wondered that it should have concluded at length that this was the best use it could put me to and had never thought to avail itself of my services in some way i saw that if there was a wall of stone between me and my townsmen there was a still more difficult one to climb or break through before they could get to be as free as i was i did not for a moment feel confined and the walls seemed a great waste of stone and mortar i felt as if i alone of all my townsmen had paid my tax they plainly did not know how to treat me but behaved like persons who are underbred in every threat and in every compliment there was a blunder for they thought that my chief desire was to stand the other side of that stone wall i could not but smile to see how industriously they locked the door on my meditations which followed them out again without let or hindrance and they were really all that was dangerous as they could not reach me they had resolved to punish my body just as boys if they cannot come at some person against whom they have a spite will abuse his dog i saw that the state was halfwitted that it was timid as a lone woman with her silver spoons and that it did not know its friends from its foes and i lost all my remaining respect for it and pitied it  thus the state never intentionally confronts a mans sense intellectual or moral but only his body his senses it is not armed with superior wit or honesty but with superior physical strength i was not born to be forced i will breathe after my own fashion let us see who is the strongest what force has a multitude they only can force me who obey a higher law than i they force me to become like themselves i do not hear of men being forced to have this way or that by masses of men what sort of life were that to live when i meet a government which says to me your money or your life why should i be in haste to give it my money it may be in a great strait and not know what to do i cannot help that it must help itself do as i do it is not worth the while to snivel about it i am not responsible for the successful working of the machinery of society i am not the son of the engineer i perceive that when an acorn and a chestnut fall side by side the one does not remain inert to make way for the other but both obey their own laws and spring and grow and flourish as best they can till one perchance overshadows and destroys the other if a plant cannot live according to its nature it dies and so a man  the night in prison was novel and interesting enough the prisoners in their shirtsleeves were enjoying a chat and the evening air in the doorway when i entered but the jailer said come boys it is time to lock up and so they dispersed and i heard the sound of their steps returning into the hollow apartments my roommate was introduced to me by the jailer as a firstrate fellow and a clever man when the door was locked he showed me where to hang my hat and how he managed matters there the rooms were whitewashed once a month and this one at least was the whitest most simply furnished and probably the neatest apartment in the town he naturally wanted to know where i came from and what brought me there and when i had told him i asked him in my turn how he came there presuming him to be an honest man of course and as the world goes i believe he was why said he they accuse me of burning a barn but i never did it as near as i could discover he had probably gone to bed in a barn when drunk and smoked his pipe there and so a barn was burnt he had the reputation of being a clever man had been there some three months waiting for his trial to come on and would have to wait as much longer but he was quite domesticated and contented since he got his board for nothing and thought that he was well treated  he occupied one window and i the other and i saw that if one stayed there long his principal business would be to look out the window i had soon read all the tracts that were left there and examined where former prisoners had broken out and where a grate had been sawed off and heard the history of the various occupants of that room for i found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed which are afterward printed in a circular form but not published i was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape who avenged themselves by singing them  i pumped my fellowprisoner as dry as i could for fear i should never see him again but at length he showed me which was my bed and left me to blow out the lamp  it was like travelling into a far country such as i had never expected to behold to lie there for one night it seemed to me that i never had heard the townclock strike before nor the evening sounds of the village for we slept with the windows open which were inside the grating it was to see my native village in the light of the middle ages and our concord was turned into a rhine stream and visions of knights and castles passed before me they were the voices of old burghers that i heard in the streets i was an involuntary spectator and auditor of whatever was done and said in the kitchen of the adjacent villageinna wholly new and rare experience to me it was a closer view of my native town i was fairly inside of it i never had seen its institutions before this is one of its peculiar institutions for it is a shire town i began to comprehend what its inhabitants were about  in the morning our breakfasts were put through the hole in the door in small oblongsquare tin pans made to fit and holding a pint of chocolate with brown bread and an iron spoon when they called for the vessels again i was green enough to return what bread i had left but my comrade seized it and said that i should lay that up for lunch or dinner soon after he was let out to work at haying in a neighboring field whither he went every day and would not be back till noon so he bade me goodday saying that he doubted if he should see me again  when i came out of prisonfor some one interfered and paid that taxi did not perceive that great changes had taken place on the common such as he observed who went in a youth and emerged a tottering and grayheaded man and yet a change had to my eyes come over the scenethe town and state and countrygreater than any that mere time could effect i saw yet more distinctly the state in which i lived i saw to what extent the people among whom i lived could be trusted as good neighbors and friends that their friendship was for summer weather only that they did not greatly propose to do right that they were a distinct race from me by their prejudices and superstitions as the chinamen and malays are that in their sacrifices to humanity they ran no risks not even to their property that after all they were not so noble but they treated the thief as he had treated them and hoped by a certain outward observance and a few prayers and by walking in a particular straight though useless path from time to time to save their souls this may be to judge my neighbors harshly for i believe that many of them are not aware that they have such an institution as the jail in their village  it was formerly the custom in our village when a poor debtor came out of jail for his acquaintances to salute him looking through their fingers which were crossed to represent the grating of a jail window how do ye do my neighbors did not thus salute me but first looked at me and then at one another as if i had returned from a long journey i was put into jail as i was going to the shoemakers to get a shoe which was mended when i was let out the next morning i proceeded to finish my errand and having put on my mended shoe joined a huckleberry party who were impatient to put themselves under my conduct and in half an hourfor the horse was soon tackledwas in the midst of a huckleberry field on one of our highest hills two miles off and then the state was nowhere to be seen  this is the whole history of my prisons                                       i have never declined paying the highway tax because i am as desirous of being a good neighbor as i am of being a bad subject and as for supporting schools i am doing my part to educate my fellowcountrymen now it is for no particular item in the taxbill that i refuse to pay it i simply wish to refuse allegiance to the state to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually i do not care to trace the course of my dollar if i could till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one withthe dollar is innocentbut i am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance in fact i quietly declare war with the state after my fashion though i will still make what use and get what advantage of her i can as is usual in such cases  if others pay the tax which is demanded of me from a sympathy with the state they do but what they have already done in their own case or rather they abet injustice to a greater extent than the state requires if they pay the tax from a mistaken interest in the individual taxed to save his property or prevent his going to jail it is because they have not considered wisely how far they let their private feelings interfere with the public good  this then is my position at present but one cannot be too much on his guard in such a case lest his action be biased by obstinacy or an undue regard for the opinions of men let him see that he does only what belongs to himself and to the hour  i think sometimes why this people mean well they are only ignorant they would do better if they knew how why give your neighbors this pain to treat you as they are not inclined to but i think again this is no reason why i should do as they do or permit others to suffer much greater pain of a different kind again i sometimes say to myself when many millions of men without heat without illwill without personal feeling of any kind demand of you a few shillings only without the possibility such is their constitution of retracting or altering their present demand and without the possibility on your side of appeal to any other millions why expose yourself to this overwhelming brute force you do not resist cold and hunger the winds and the waves thus obstinately you quietly submit to a thousand similar necessities you do not put your head into the fire but just in proportion as i regard this as not wholly a brute force but partly a human force and consider that i have relations to those millions as to so many millions of men and not of mere brute or inanimate things i see that appeal is possible first and instantaneously from them to the maker of them and secondly from them to themselves but if i put my head deliberately into the fire there is no appeal to fire or to the maker of fire and i have only myself to blame if i could convince myself that i have any right to be satisfied with men as they are and to treat them accordingly and not according in some respects to my requisitions and expectations of what they and i ought to be then like a good mussulman and fatalist i should endeavor to be satisfied with things as they are and say it is the will of god and above all there is this difference between resisting this and a purely brute or natural force that i can resist this with some effect but i cannot expect like orpheus to change the nature of the rocks and trees and beasts  i do not wish to quarrel with any man or nation i do not wish to split hairs to make fine distinctions or set myself up as better than my neighbors i seek rather i may say even an excuse for conforming to the laws of the land i am but too ready to conform to them indeed i have reason to suspect myself on this head and each year as the taxgatherer comes round i find myself disposed to review the acts and position of the general and state governments and the spirit of the people to discover a pretext for conformity              we must affect our country as our parents              and if at any time we alienate              our love or industry from doing it honor              we must respect effects and teach the soul              matter of conscience and religion              and not desire of rule or benefit  i believe that the state will soon be able to take all my work of this sort out of my hands and then i shall be no better a patriot than my fellowcountrymen seen from a lower point of view the constitution with all its faults is very good the law and the courts are very respectable even this state and this american government are in many respects very admirable and rare things to be thankful for such as a great many have described them but seen from a point of view a little higher they are what i have described them seen from a higher still and the highest who shall say what they are or that they are worth looking at or thinking of at all  however the government does not concern me much and i shall bestow the fewest possible thoughts on it it is not many moments that i live under a government even in this world if a man is thoughtfree fancyfree imaginationfree that which is not never for a long time appearing to be to him unwise rulers or reformers cannot fatally interrupt him  i know that most men think differently from myself but those whose lives are by profession devoted to the study of these or kindred subjects content me as little as any statesmen and legislators standing so completely within the institution never distinctly and nakedly behold it they speak of moving society but have no restingplace without it they may be men of a certain experience and discrimination and have no doubt invented ingenious and even useful systems for which we sincerely thank them but all their wit and usefulness lie within certain not very wide limits they are wont to forget that the world is not governed by policy and expediency webster never goes behind government and so cannot speak with authority about it his words are wisdom to those legislators who contemplate no essential reform in the existing government but for thinkers and those who legislate for all time he never once glances at the subject i know of those whose serene and wise speculations on this theme would soon reveal the limits of his minds range and hospitality yet compared with the cheap professions of most reformers and the still cheaper wisdom and eloquence of politicians in general his are almost the only sensible and valuable words and we thank heaven for him comparatively he is always strong original and above all practical still his quality is not wisdom but prudence the lawyers truth is not truth but consistency or a consistent expediency truth is always in harmony with herself and is not concerned chiefly to reveal the justice that may consist with wrongdoing he well deserves to be called as he has been called the defender of the constitution there are really no blows to be given by him but defensive ones he is not a leader but a follower his leaders are the men of 87 i have never made an effort he says and never propose to make an effort i have never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance an effort to disturb the arrangement as originally made by which the various states came into the union still thinking of the sanction which the constitution gives to slavery he says because it was a part of the original compactlet it stand notwithstanding his special acuteness and ability he is unable to take a fact out of its merely political relations and behold it as it lies absolutely to be disposed of by the intellectwhat for instance it behooves a man to do here in america today with regard to slavery but ventures or is driven to make some such desperate answer as the following while professing to speak absolutely and as a private manfrom which what new and singular code of social duties might be inferred the manner says he in which the governments of those states where slavery exists are to regulate it is for their own consideration under their responsibility to their constituents to the general laws of propriety humanity and justice and to god associations formed elsewhere springing from a feeling of humanity or any other cause have nothing whatever to do with it they have never received any encouragement from me and they never will  they who know of no purer sources of truth who have traced up its stream no higher stand and wisely stand by the bible and the constitution and drink at it there with reverence and humility but they who behold where it comes trickling into this lake or that pool gird up their loins once more and continue their pilgrimage toward its fountainhead  no man with a genius for legislation has appeared in america they are rare in the history of the world there are orators politicians and eloquent men by the thousand but the speaker has not yet opened his mouth to speak who is capable of settling the muchvexed questions of the day we love eloquence for its own sake and not for any truth which it may utter or any heroism it may inspire our legislators have not yet learned the comparative value of freetrade and of freedom of union and of rectitude to a nation they have no genius or talent for comparatively humble questions of taxation and finance commerce and manufacturers and agriculture if we were left solely to the wordy wit of legislators in congress for our guidance uncorrected by the seasonable experience and the effectual complaints of the people america would not long retain her rank among the nations for eighteen hundred years though perchance i have no right to say it the new testament has been written yet where is the legislator who has wisdom and practical talent enough to avail himself of the light which it sheds on the science of legislation  the authority of government even such as i am willing to submit tofor i will cheerfully obey those who know and can do better than i and in many things even those who neither know nor can do so wellis still an impure one to be strictly just it must have the sanction and consent of the governed it can have no pure right over my person and property but what i concede to it the progress from an absolute to a limited monarchy from a limited monarchy to a democracy is a progress toward a true respect for the individual even the chinese philosopher was wise enough to regard the individual as the basis of the empire is a democracy such as we know it the last improvement possible in government is it not possible to take a step further towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its own power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly i please myself with imagining a state at least which can afford to be just to all men and to treat the individual with respect as a neighbor which even would not think it inconsistent with its own repose if a few were to live aloof from it not meddling with it nor embraced by it who fulfilled all the duties of neighbors and fellowmen a state which bore this kind of fruit and suffered it to drop off as fast as it ripened would prepare the way for a still more perfect and glorious state which also i have imagined but not yet anywhere seen
