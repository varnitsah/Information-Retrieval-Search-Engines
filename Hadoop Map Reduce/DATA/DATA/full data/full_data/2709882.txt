responsibility of this story upon another  at the corner of a long straight brickbuilt street in the far east end of londonone of those lifeless streets made of two drab walls upon which the level lines formed by the precisely even windowsills and doorsteps stretch in weary perspective from end to end suggesting petrified diagrams proving dead problemsstands a house that ever draws me to it so that often when least conscious of my footsteps i awake to find myself hurrying through noisy crowded thoroughfares where flaring naphtha lamps illumine fierce patient leadencoloured faces through dimlit empty streets where monstrous shadows come and go upon the closedrawn blinds through narrow noisome streets where the gutters swarm with children and each everopen doorway vomits riot past reeking corners and across waste places till at last i reach the dreary goal of my memorydriven desire and coming to a halt beside the broken railings find rest  the house larger than its fellows built when the street was still a country lane edging the marshes strikes a strange note of individuality amid the surrounding harmony of hideousness it is encompassed on two sides by what was once a garden though now but a barren patch of stones and dust where clothesit is odd any one should have thought of washinghang in perpetuity while about the door continue the remnants of a porch which the stucco falling has left exposed in all its naked insincerity  occasionally i drift hitherward in the day time when slatternly women gossip round the area gates and the silence is broken by the hoarse wailing cry of coalsany coalsthree and sixpence a sackcoooals chanted in a tone that absence of response has stamped with chronic melancholy but then the street knows me not and my old friend of the corner ashamed of its shabbiness in the unpitying sunlight turns its face away and will not see me as i pass  not until the night merciful alone of all things to the ugly draws her veil across its sordid features will it as some fond old nurse sought out in after years open wide its arms to welcome me then the teeming life it now shelters hushed for a time within its walls the flickering flare from the king of prussia opposite extinguished will it talk with me of the past asking me many questions reminding me of many things i had forgotten then into the silent street come the wellremembered footsteps in and out the creaking gate pass not seeing me the wellremembered faces and we talk concerning them as two cronies turning the torn leaves of some old album where the faded portraits in forgotten fashions speak together in low tones of those now dead or scattered with now a smile and now a sigh and many an ah me or dear dear  this bent worn man coming towards us with quick impatient steps which yet cease every fifty yards or so while he pauses leaning heavily upon his high malacca cane it is a handsome face is it not i ask as i gaze upon it shadow framed  aye handsome enough answers the old house and handsomer still it must have been before you and i knew it before mean care had furrowed it with fretful lines  i never could make out continues the old house musingly whom you took after for they were a handsome pair your father and your mother though lord what a couple of children  children i say in surprise for my father must have been past five and thirty before the house could have known him and my mothers face is very close to mine in the darkness so that i see the many grey hairs mingling with the bonny brown  children repeats the old house irritably so it seems to me not liking perhaps its opinions questioned a failing common to old folk the most helpless pair of children i ever set eyes upon who but a child i should like to know would have conceived the notion of repairing his fortune by becoming a solicitor at thirtyeight or having conceived such a notion would have selected the outskirts of poplar as a likely centre in which to put up his doorplate  it was considered to be a rising neighbourhood i reply a little resentful no son cares to hear the family wisdom criticised even though at the bottom of his heart he may be in agreement with the critic all sorts and conditions of men whose affairs were in connection with the sea would it was thought come to reside hereabout so as to be near to the new docks and had they it is not unreasonable to suppose they would have quarrelled and disputed with one another much to the advantage of a cute solicitor convenient to their hand  stuff and nonsense retorts the old house shortly why the mere smell of the place would have been sufficient to keep a sensible man away andthe grim brick face before me twists itself into a goblin smilehe of all men in the world as the cute solicitor giving advice to shady clients eager to get out of trouble by the shortest way can you fancy it he who for two years starved himself living on five shillings a weekthat was before you came to london when he was here alone even your mother knew nothing of it till years afterwardsso that no man should be a penny the poorer for having trusted his good name do you think the crew of chandlers and brokers dock hustlers and freight wreckers would have found him a useful man of business even had they come to settle here  i have no answer nor does the old house wait for any but talks on  and your mother would any but a child have taken that softtongued wanton to her bosom and not have seen through acting so transparent would any but the veriest child that never ought to have been let out into the world by itself have thought to dree her weird in such folly children poor babies they were both of them  tell me i sayfor at such times all my stock of common sense is not sufficient to convince me that the old house is but clay from its walls so full of voices from its floors so thick with footsteps surely it has learned to live as a violin long played on comes to learn at last a music of its own tell me i was but a child to whom life speaks in a strange tongue was there any truth in the story  truth snaps out the old house just truth enough to plant a lie upon and lord knows not much ground is needed for that weed i saw what i saw and i know what i know your mother had a good man and your father a true wife but it was the old story a mans way is not a womans way and a womans way is not a mans way so there lives ever doubt between them  but they came together in the end i say remembering  aye in the end answers the house that is when you begin to understand you men and women when you come to the end  the grave face of a not too recently washed angel peeps shyly at me through the railings then as i turn my head darts back and disappears  what has become of her i ask  she oh she is well enough replies the house she lives close here you must have passed the shop you might have seen her had you looked in she weighs fourteen stone about and has nine children living she would be pleased to see you  thank you i say with a laugh that is not wholly a laugh i do not think i will call but i still hear the pitpat of her tiny feet dying down the long street  the faces thicken round me a large looming rubicund visage smiles kindly on me bringing back into my heart the old odd mingling of instinctive liking held in check by conscientious disapproval i turn from it and see a massive cleanshaven face with the ugliest mouth and the loveliest eyes i ever have known in a man  was he as bad do you think as they said i ask of my ancient friend  shouldnt wonder the old house answers i never knew a worsenor a better  the wind whisks it aside leaving to view a little old woman hobbling nimbly by aid of a stick three corkscrew curls each side of her head bob with each step she takes and as she draws near to me making the most alarming grimaces i hear her whisper as though confiding to herself some fascinating secret id like to skin em id like to skin em all id like to skin em all alive  it sounds a fiendish sentiment yet i only laugh and the little old lady with a final facial contortion surpassing all dreams limps beyond my ken  then as though choosing contrasts follows a fair laughing face i saw it in the life only a few hours agoat least not it but the poor daub that evil has painted over it hating the sweetness underlying and as i stand gazing at it wishing it were of the dead who change not there drifts back from the shadows that other face the one of the wicked mouth and the tender eyes so that i stand again helpless between the two i loved so well he from whom i learned my first steps in manhood she from whom i caught my first glimpse of the beauty and the mystery of woman and again the cry rises from my heart whose fault was ityours or hers and again i hear his mocking laugh as he answers whose fault god made us and thinking of her and of the love i bore her which was as the love of a young pilgrim to a saint it comes into my blood to hate him but when i look into his eyes and see the pain that lives there my pity grows stronger than my misery and i can only echo his words god made us  merry faces and sad fair faces and foul they ride upon the wind but the centre round which they circle remains always the one a little lad with golden curls more suitable to a girl than to a boy with shy awkward ways and a silent tongue and a grave oldfashioned face  and turning from him to my old brick friend i ask would he know me could he see me do you think  how should he answers the old house you are so different to what he would expect would you recognise your own ghost think you  it is sad to think he would not recognise me i say  it might be sadder if he did grumbles the old house  we both remained silent for awhile but i know of what the old house is thinking soon it speaks as i expected  youwriter of stories why dont you write a book about him there is something that you know  it is the favourite theme of the old house i never visit it but it suggests to me this idea  but he has done nothing i say  he has lived answers the old house is not that enough  aye but only in london in these prosaic modern times i persist how of such can one make a story that shall interest the people  the old house waxes impatient of me  the people it retorts what are you all but children in a dimlit room waiting until one by one you are called out to sleep and one mounts upon a stool and tells a tale to the others who have gathered round who shall say what will please them what will not  returning home with musing footsteps through the softly breathing streets i ponder the words of the old house is it but as some foolish mother thinking all the world interested in her child or may there lie wisdom in its counsel then to my guidance or misguidance comes the thought of a certain small section of the public who often of an evening commands of me a story and who when i have told her of the dreadful giants and of the gallant youths who slay them of the woodcutters sons who rescue maidens from ogreguarded castles of the princesses the most beautiful in all the world of the princes with magic swords still unsatisfied creeps closer yet saying now tell me a real story adding for my comprehending you know about a little girl who lived in a big house with her father and mother and who was sometimes naughty you know  so perhaps among the many there may be some who for a moment will turn aside from tales of haughty heroes ruffling it in court and camp to listen to the story of a very ordinary lad who lived with very ordinary folk in a modern london street and who grew up to be a very ordinary sort of man loving a little and grieving a little helping a few and harming a few struggling and failing and hoping and if any such there be let them come round me  but let not those who come to me grow indignant as they listen saying this rascal tells us but a humdrum story where nothing is as it should be for i warn all beforehand that i tell but of things that i have seen my villains i fear are but poor sinners not altogether bad and my good men but sorry saints my princes do not always slay their dragons alas sometimes the dragon eats the prince the wicked fairies often prove more powerful than the good the magic thread leads sometimes wrong and even the hero is not always brave and true  so let those come round me only who will be content to hear but their own story told by another saying as they listen so dreamt i ah yes that is true i remember    chapter i  paul arrived in a strange land learns many things and goes to meet the man in grey  fate intended me for a singularly fortunate man properly i ought to have been born in june which being as is well known the luckiest month in all the year for such events should by thoughtful parents be more generally selected how it was i came to be born in may which is on the other hand of all the twelve the most unlucky as i have proved i leave to those more conversant with the subject to explain an early nurse the first human being of whom i have any distinct recollection unhesitatingly attributed the unfortunate fact to my natural impatience which quality she at the same time predicted would lead me into even greater trouble a prophecy impressed by future events with the stamp of prescience it was from this same bony lady that i likewise learned the manner of my coming it seems that i arrived quite unexpectedly two hours after news had reached the house of the ruin of my fathers mines through inundation misfortunes as it was expounded to me never coming singly in this world to any one that all things might be of a piece my poor mother attempting to reach the bell fell against and broke the chevalglass thus further saddening herself with the convictionfor no amount of reasoning ever succeeded in purging her welsh blood of its natural superstitionthat whatever might be the result of future battles with my evil star the first seven years of tiny existence had been by her act doomed to disaster  and i must confess added the knobbly mrs fursey with a sigh it does look as though there must be some truth in the saying after all  then aint i a lucky little boy i asked for hitherto it had been mrs furseys method to impress upon me my exceptional good fortune that i could and did involuntarily retire to bed at six while less happily placed children were deprived of their natural rest until eight or nine oclock had always been held up to me as an astounding piece of luck some little boys had not a bed at all for the which in my more riotous moments i envied them again that at the first sign of a cold it became my unavoidable privilege to lunch off linseed gruel and sup off brimstone and treaclea compound named with deliberate intent to deceive the innocent the treacle so far as taste is concerned being wickedly subordinated to the brimstonewas another example of fortunes favouritism other little boys were so astoundingly unlucky as to be left alone when they felt ill if further proof were needed to convince that i had been signalled out by providence as its especial protege there remained always the circumstance that i possessed mrs fursey for my nurse the suggestion that i was not altogether the luckiest of children was a new departure  the good dame evidently perceived her error and made haste to correct it  oh you you are lucky enough she replied i was thinking of your poor mother  isnt mamma lucky  well she hasnt been too lucky since you came  wasnt it lucky her having me  i cant say it was at that particular time  didnt she want me  mrs fursey was one of those wellmeaning persons who are of opinion that the only reasonable attitude of childhood should be that of perpetual apology for its existence  well i daresay she could have done without you was the answer  i can see the picture plainly still i am sitting on a low chair before the nursery fire one knee supported in my locked hands meanwhile mrs furseys needle grated with monotonous regularity against her thimble at that moment knocked at my small soul for the first time the problem of life  suddenly without moving i said  then why did she take me in  the rasping click of the needle on the thimble ceased abruptly  took you in whats the child talking about whos took you in  why mamma if she didnt want me why did she take me in  but even while with heart full of dignified resentment i propounded this as i proudly felt logically unanswerable question i was glad that she had the vision of my being refused at the bedroom window presented itself to my imagination i saw the stork perplexed and annoyed looking as i had sometimes seen tom pinfold look when the fish he had been holding out by the tail had been sniffed at by anna and the kitchen door shut in his face would the stork also have gone away thoughtfully scratching his head with one of those long compasslike legs of his and muttering to himself and here incidentally i fell awondering how the stork had carried me in the garden i had often watched a blackbird carrying a worm and the worm though no doubt really safe enough had always appeared to me nervous and uncomfortable had i wriggled and squirmed in like fashion and where would the stork have taken me to then possibly to mrs furseys their cottage was the nearest but i felt sure mrs fursey would not have taken me in and next to them at the first house in the village lived mr chumdley the cobbler who was lame and who sat all day hammering boots with very dirty hands in a little cave half under the ground his whole appearance suggesting a poorspirited ogre i should have hated being his little boy possibly nobody would have taken me in i grew pensive thinking of myself as the rejected of all the village what would the stork have done with me left on his hands so to speak the reflection prompted a fresh question  nurse where did i come from  why ive told you often the stork brought you  yes i know but where did the stork get me from mrs fursey paused for quite a long while before replying possibly she was reflecting whether such answer might not make me unduly conceited eventually she must have decided to run that risk other opportunities could be relied upon for neutralising the effect  oh from heaven  but i thought heaven was a place where you went to i answered not where you comed from i know i said comed for i remember that at this period my irregular verbs were a bewildering anxiety to my poor mother comed and goned which i had worked out for myself were particular favourites of mine  mrs fursey passed over my grammar in dignified silence she had been pointedly requested not to trouble herself with that part of my education my mother holding that diverging opinions upon the same subject only confused a child  you came from heaven repeated mrs fursey and youll go to heavenif youre good  do all little boys and girls come from heaven  so they say mrs furseys tone implied that she was stating what might possibly be but a popular fallacy for which she individually took no responsibility  and did you come from heaven mrs fursey mrs furseys reply to this was decidedly more emphatic  of course i did where do you think i came from  at once i am ashamed to say heaven lost its exalted position in my eyes even before this it had puzzled me that everybody i knew should be going therefor so i was always assured now connected as it appeared to be with the origin of mrs fursey much of its charm disappeared  but this was not all mrs furseys information had suggested to me a fresh grief i stopped not to console myself with the reflection that my fate had been but the fate of all little boys and girls with a childs egoism i seized only upon my own particular case  didnt they want me in heaven then either i asked werent they fond of me up there  the misery in my voice must have penetrated even mrs furseys bosom for she answered more sympathetically than usual  oh they liked you well enough i daresay i like you but i like to get rid of you sometimes there could be no doubt as to this last even at the time i often doubted whether that six oclock bedtime was not occasionally halfpast five  the answer comforted me not it remained clear that i was not wanted either in heaven nor upon the earth god did not want me he was glad to get rid of me my mother did not want me she could have done without me nobody wanted me why was i here  and then as the sudden opening and shutting of the door of a dark room came into my childish brain the feeling that something somewhere must have need of me or i could not be something i felt i belonged to and that belonged to me something that was as much a part of me as i of it the feeling came back to me more than once during my childhood though i could never put it into words years later the son of the portuguese jew explained to me my thought but all that i myself could have told was that in that moment i knew for the first time that i lived that i was i  the next instant all was dark again and i once more a puzzled little boy sitting by a nursery fire asking of a village dame questions concerning life  suddenly a new thought came to me or rather the recollection of an old  nurse why havent we got a husband  mrs fursey left off her sewing and stared at me  what maggot has the child got into its head now was her observation who hasnt got a husband  why mamma  dont talk nonsense master paul you know your mamma has got a husband  no she aint  and dont contradict your mammas husband is your papa who lives in london  whats the good of him  mrs furseys reply appeared to me to be unnecessarily vehement  you wicked child you wheres your commandments your father is in london working hard to earn money to keep you in idleness and you sit there and say whats the good of him id be ashamed to be such an ungrateful little brat  i had not meant to be ungrateful my words were but the repetition of a conversation i had overheard the day before between my mother and my aunt  had said my aunt there she goes moping again drat me if ever i saw such a thing to mope as a woman  my aunt was entitled to preach on the subject she herself grumbled all day about all things but she did it cheerfully  my mother was standing with her hands clasped behind hera favourite attitude of hersgazing through the high french window into the garden beyond it must have been spring time for i remember the white and yellow crocuses decking the grass  i want a husband had answered my mother in a tone so ludicrously childish that at sound of it i had looked up from the fairy story i was reading half expectant to find her changed into a little girl i hate not having a husband  help us and save us my aunt had retorted how many more does a girl want shes got one  whats the good of him all that way off had pouted my mother i want him here where i can get at him  i had often heard of this father of mine who lived far away in london and to whom we owed all the blessings of life but my childish endeavours to square information with reflection had resulted in my assigning to him an entirely spiritual existence i agreed with my mother that such an one however to be revered was no substitute for the flesh and blood father possessed by luckier folkthe big strong masculine thing that would carry a fellow pigaback round the garden or take a chap to sail in boats  you dont understand me nurse i explained what i mean is a husband you can get at  well and youll get at him poor gentleman one of these days answered mrs fursey when hes ready for you hell send for you and then youll go to him in london  i felt that still mrs fursey didnt understand but i foresaw that further explanation would only shock her so contented myself with a simple matteroffact question  how do you get to london do you have to die first  i do think said mrs fursey in the voice of resigned despair rather than of surprise that without exception you are the silliest little boy i ever came across ive no patience with you  i am very sorry nurse i answered i thought  then interrupted mrs fursey in the voice of many generations you shouldnt think london continued the good dame her experience no doubt suggesting that the shortest road to peace would be through my understanding of this matter is a big town and you go there in a train some timesoon nowyour father will write to your mother that everything is ready then you and your mother and your aunt will leave this place and go to london and i shall be rid of you  and shant we come back here ever any more  never again  and ill never play in the garden again never go down to the pebbleridge to tea or to jacobs tower  never again i think mrs fursey took a pleasure in the phrase it sounded as she said it like something out of the prayerbook  and ill never see anna or tom pinfold or old yeo or pincher or you ever any more in this moment of the crumbling from under me of all my footholds i would have clung even to that dry tuft mrs fursey herself  never any more youll go away and begin an entirely new life and i do hope master paul added mrs fursey piously it may be a better one that you will make up your mind to  but mrs furseys wellmeant exhortations whatever they may have been fell upon deaf ears here was i face to face with yet another problem this life into which i had fallen it was understandable one went away leaving the pleasant places that one knew never to return to them one left ones labour and ones play to enter upon a new existence in a strange land one parted from the friends one had always known one saw them never again life was indeed a strange thing and would a body comprehend it then must a body sit staring into the fire thinking very hard unheedful of all idle chatter  that night when my mother came to kiss me goodnight i turned my face to the wall and pretended to be asleep for children as well as grownups have their foolish moods but when i felt the soft curls brush my cheek my pride gave way and clasping my arms about her neck and drawing her face still closer down to mine i voiced the question that all the evening had been knocking at my heart  i suppose you couldnt send me back now could you you see youve had me so long  send you back  yes id be too big for the stork to carry now wouldnt i  my mother knelt down beside the bed so that her face and mine were on a level and looking into her eyes the fear that had been haunting me fell from me  who has been talking foolishly to a foolish little boy asked my mother keeping my arms still clasped about her neck  oh nurse and i were discussing things you know i answered and she said you could have done without me somehow i did not mind repeating the words now clearly it could have been but mrs furseys fun  my mother drew me closer to her  and what made her think that  well you see i replied i came at a very awkward time didnt i when you had a lot of other troubles  my mother laughed but the next moment looked grave again  i did not know you thought about such things she said we must be more together you and i paul and you shall tell me all you think because nurse does not quite understand you it is true what she said about the trouble it came just at that time but i could not have done without you i was very unhappy and you were sent to comfort me and help me to bear it i liked this explanation better  then it was lucky your having me i said again my mother laughed and again there followed that graver look upon her childish face  will you remember what i am going to say she spoke so earnestly that i wriggling into a sitting posture became earnest also  ill try i answered but i aint got a very good memory have i  not very smiled my mother but if you think about it a good deal it will not leave you when you are a good boy and later on when you are a good man then i am the luckiest little mother in all the world and every time you fail that means bad luck for me you will remember that after im gone when you are a big man wont you paul  so both of us quite serious i promised and though i smile now when i remember seeing before me those two earnest childish faces yet i think however little success it may be i have to boast of it would perhaps have been still less had i entirely forgotten  from that day my mother waxes in my memory mrs fursey of the many promontories waning there were sunny mornings in the neglected garden where the leaves played round us while we worked and read twilight evenings in the window seat where half hidden by the dark red curtains we would talk in whispers why i know not of good men and noble women ogres fairies saints and demons they were pleasant days  possibly our curriculum lacked method maybe it was too varied and extensive for my age in consequence of which chronology became confused within my brain and fact and fiction more confounded than has usually been considered permissible even in history i saw aphrodite ready armed and risen from the sea move with stately grace to meet king canute who throned upon the sand bade her come no further lest she should wet his feet in forest glade i saw king rufus fall from a poisoned arrow shot by robin hood but thanks to sweet queen eleanor who sucked the poison from his wound i knew he lived oliver cromwell having killed king charles married his widow and was in turn stabbed by hamlet ulysses in the argo it was fixed upon my mind had discovered america romulus and remus had slain the wolf and rescued little red riding hood good king arthur for letting the cakes burn had been murdered by his uncle in the tower of london prometheus bound to the rock had been saved by good st george paris had given the apple to william tell what matter the information was there it needed rearranging that was all  sometimes of an afternoon we would climb the steep winding pathway through the woods past awful precipices spirithaunted by grassy swards where fairies danced o nights by briar and bracken sheltered caves where fearsome creatures lurked till high above the creeping sea we would reach the open plateau where rose old jacobs ruined tower jacobs folly it was more often called about the country side and by some the devils tower for legend had it that there old jacob and his master the devil had often met in windy weather to wave false wrecking lights to troubled ships who old jacob was i never that i can remember learned nor how nor why he built the tower certain only it is his memory was unpopular and the fisher folk would swear that still on stormy nights strange lights would gleam and flash from the ivycurtained windows of his folly  but in day time no spot was more inviting the short mossgrass before its shattered door the lichen on its crumbling stones from its topmost platform one saw the distant mountains faint like spectres and the silent ships that came and vanished and about ones feet the pleasant farm lands and the grave sweet river  smaller and poorer the world has grown since then now behind those hills lie naught but smoky towns and dingy villages but then they screened a land of wonder where princesses dwelt in castles where the cities were of gold now the ocean is but six days journey wide ending at the new york custom house then had one set ones sail upon it one would have travelled far and far beyond the golden moonlight beyond the gate of clouds to the magic land of the blood red shore tother side o the sun i never dreamt in those days a world could be so small  upon the topmost platform a wooden seat ran round within the parapet and sitting there hand in hand sheltered from the wind which ever blew about the tower my mother would people for me all the earth and air with the forms of myth and legendperhaps unwisely yet i do not know i took no harm from it good rather i think they were beautiful fancies most of them or so my mother turned them making for love and pity as do all the tales that live whether poems or old wives fables but at that time of course they had no meaning for me other than the literal so that my mother looking into my eyes would often hasten to add but that you know is only an old superstition and of course there are no such things nowadays yet forgetful sometimes of the time and overtaken homeward by the shadows we would hasten swiftly through the darkening path holding each other tightly by the hand  spring had waxed to summer summer waned to autumn then my aunt and i one morning waiting at the breakfast table saw through the open window my mother skipping dancing pirouetting up the garden path she held a letter open in her hand which as she drew near she waved about her head singing  saturday sunday monday tuesday then comes wednesday morning  she caught me to her and began dancing with me round the room  observed my aunt who continued steadily to eat bread and butter  just like em all goes mad with joy what for because shes going to leave a decent house to live in a poky hole in the east end of london and keep one servant  to my aunt the second person ever remained a grammatical superfluity invariably she spoke not to but of a person throwing out her conversation in the form of commentary this had the advantage of permitting the party intended to ignore it as mere impersonal philosophy seeing it was generally uncomplimentary most people preferred so to regard it but my mother had never succeeded in schooling herself to indifference  its not a poky hole she replied its an oldfashioned house near the river  plaistow marshes ejaculated my aunt calls it the river  so it is the river returned my mother the river is the other side of the marshes  lets hope it will always stop there said my aunt  and its got a garden continued my mother ignoring my aunts last remark which is quite an unusual feature in a london house and it isnt the east end of london it is a rising suburb and you wont make me miserable because i am too happy  drat the woman said my aunt why cant she sit down and give us our tea before its all cold  you are a disagreeable thing said my mother  not half milk said my aunt my aunt was never in the least disturbed by other peoples opinion of her which was perhaps well for her  for three days my mother packed and sang and a dozen times a day unpacked and laughed looking for things wanted that were always found at the very bottom of the very last box looked into so that anna waiting for a certain undergarment of my aunts which shall be nameless suggested a saving of time  if i were you maam said anna id look into the last box youre going to look into first  but it was found eventually in the first boxthe box that is my mother had intended to search first but which acting on annas suggestion she had reserved till the last this caused my mother to be quite short with anna who she said had wasted her time but by tuesday afternoon all stood ready we were to start early wednesday morning  that evening missing my mother in the house i sought her in the garden and found her as i had expected on her favourite seat under the great lime tree but to my surprise there were tears in her eyes  but i thought you were glad we were going i said  so i am answered my mother drying her eyes only to make room for fresh tears  then why are you crying  because im sorry to leave here  grownup folks with their contradictory ways were a continual puzzle to me in those days i am not sure i quite understand them even now myself included  we were up and off next day before the dawn the sun rose as the wagon reached the top of the hill and there we paused and took our farewell look at old jacobs tower my mother cried a little behind her veil but my aunt only said i never did care for earwigs in my tea and as for myself i was too excited and expectant to feel much sentiment about anything  on the journey i sat next to an exceptionally large and heavy man who in his sleepand he slept oftenimagined me to be a piece of stuffing out of place then grunting and wriggling he would endeavour to rub me out until the continued irritation of my head between the window and his back would cause him to awake when he would look down upon me reprovingly but not unkindly observing to the carriage generally its a funny thing aint it nobodys ever made a boy yet that could keep still for ten seconds after which he would pat me heartily on the head to show he was not vexed with me and fall to sleep again upon me he was a goodtempered man  my mother sat occupied chiefly with her own thoughts and my aunt had found a congenial companion in a lady who had had her cap basket sat upon so i was left mainly to my own resources when i could get my head free of the big mans back i gazed out of the window and watched the flying fragments as we shed the world now a village would fall from us now the yellow cornland would cling to us for awhile or a wood catch at our rushing feet and sometimes a strong town would stop us and hold us panting for a space or my eyes weary i would sit and listen to the hoarse singing of the wheels beneath my feet it was a monotonous chaunt ever the same two lines       here we suffer grief and pain      here we meet to part again  followed by a low rumbling laugh sometimes fortissimo sometimes pianissimo now vivace now largo but ever those same two lines and ever followed by the same low rumbling laugh still to this day the iron wheels sing to me that same song  later on i also must have slept for i dreamt that as the result of my having engaged in single combat with a dragon the dragon ignoring all the rules of fairyland had swallowed me it was hot and stuffy in the dragons stomach he had so it appeared to me disgracefully overeaten himself there were hundreds of us there entirely undigested including mother hubbard and a gentleman named johnson against whom at that period i entertained a strong prejudice by reason of our divergent views upon the subject of spelling even in this hour of our mutual discomfort johnson would not leave me alone but persisted in asking me how i spelt jonah nobody was looking so i kicked him he sprang up and came after me i tried to run away but became wedged between hopomythumb and julius caesar i suppose our tearing about must have hurt the dragon for at that moment he gave vent to a most fearful scream and i awoke to find the fat man rubbing his left shin while we struggled slowly with steps growing ever feebler against a sea of brick that every moment closed in closer round us  we scrambled out of the carriage into a great echoing cave that might have been the dragons home where to my alarm my mother was immediately swooped down upon by a strange man in grey  whys he do that i asked of my aunt  because hes a fool answered my aunt they all are  he put my mother down and came towards us he was a tall thin man with eyes one felt one would never be afraid of and instinctively even then i associated him in my mind with windmills and a lank white horse  why how hes grown said the grey man raising me in his arms until my mother beside me appeared to me in a new light as quite a little person and solid too  my mother whispered something i think from her face for i knew the signs it was praise of me  and hes going to be our new fortune she added aloud as the grey man lowered me  then said my aunt who had this while been sitting rigid upon a flat black box dont drop him down a coalmine thats all i say  i wondered at the time why the grey mans pale face should flush so crimson and why my mother should whisper angrily  flow can you be so wicked fanny how dare you say such a thing  i only said dont drop him down a coalmine returned my aunt apparently much surprised you dont want to drop him down a coalmine do you  we passed through glittering joyous streets piled high each side with all the good things of the earth toys and baubles jewels and gold things good to eat and good to drink things good to wear and good to see through pleasant ways where fountains splashed and flowers bloomed the people wore bright clothes had happy faces they rode in beautiful carriages they strolled about greeting one another with smiles the children ran and laughed london thought i to myself is the city of the fairies  it passed and we sank into a grim city of hoarse roaring streets wherein the endless throngs swirled and surged as i had seen the yellow waters curve and fret contending where the river pauses rockbound here were no bright costumes no bright faces none stayed to greet another all was stern and swift and voiceless london then said i to myself is the city of the giants they must live in these towering castles side by side and these hurrying thousands are their driven slaves  but this passed also and we sank lower yet until we reached a third city where a pale mist filled each sombre street none of the beautiful things of the world were to be seen here but only the things coarse and ugly and wearily to and fro its sunless passages trudged with heavy steps a weary people coarseclad and with dull listless faces and london i knew was the city of the gnomes who labour sadly all their lives imprisoned underground and a terror seized me lest i too should remain chained here deep down below the fairy city that was already but a dream  we stopped at last in a long unfinished street i remember our pushing our way through a group of dirty urchins all of whom my aunt remarked in passing ought to be skinned it was my aunts one prescription for all to whom she took objection but really in the present instance i think it would have been of service nothing else whatever could have restored them to cleanliness then the door closed behind us with an echoing clang and the small cold rooms came forward stiffly to greet us  the man in grey went to the one window and drew back the curtain it was growing dusk now my aunt sat on a straight hard chair and stared fixedly at the threearmed gaselier my mother stood in the centre of the room with one small ungloved hand upon the table and i noticedfor i was very nearthat the poor little onelegged thing was trembling  of course its not what youve been accustomed to maggie said the man in grey but its only for a little while  he spoke in a new angry voice but i could not see his face his back being to the light  my mother drew his arms around us both  it is the best home in all the world she said and thus we stayed for awhile  nonsense said my aunt suddenly and this aroused us its a poky hole as i told her it would be let her thank the lord shes got a man clever enough to get her out of it i know him he never could rest where he was put now hes at the bottom hell go up  it sounded to me a very disagreeable speech but the grey man laughedi had not heard him laugh till thenand my mother ran to my aunt and kissed her and somehow the room seemed to become lighter  for some reason i slept downstairs that night on the floor behind a screen improvised out of a clothes horse and a blanket and later in the evening the clatter of knives and forks and the sound of subdued voices awoke me my aunt had apparently gone to bed my mother and the man in grey were talking together over their supper  we must buy land said the voice of the grey man london is coming this way the somebodies i forget the name my father mentioned made all their money by buying up land round new york for a mere song then as the city spread they became worth millions  but where will you get the money from luke asked the voice of my mother  the voice of the grey man answered airily  oh thats merely a matter of business you grant a mortgage the property goes up in value you borrow more then you buy moreand so on  i see said my mother  being on the spot gives one such an advantage said the grey man i shall know just when to buy its a great thing being on the spot  of course it must be said my mother  i suppose i must have dozed for the next words i heard the grey man say were  of course you have the park opposite but then the house is small  but shall we need a very large one asked my mother  one never knows said the grey man if i should go into parliament  at this point a hissing sound arose from the neighbourhood of the fire  it looks said my mother as if it were done  if you will hold the dish said the grey man i think i can pour it in without spilling  again i must have dozed  it depends said the grey man upon what he is going to be for the classics of course oxford  hes going to be very clever said my mother she spoke as one who knows  well hope so said the grey man  i shouldnt be surprised said my mother if he turned out a poet  the grey man said something in a low tone that i did not hear  im not so sure answered my mother its in the blood ive often thought that you luke ought to have been a poet  i never had the time said the grey man there were one or two little things  they were very beautiful interrupted my mother the clatter of the knives and forks continued undisturbed for a few moments then continued the grey man  there would be no harm provided i made enough its the law of nature one generation earns the next spends we must see in any case i think i should prefer oxford for him  it will be so hard parting from him said my mother  there will be the vacations said the grey man when we shall travel    chapter ii  in which paul makes acquaintance of the man with the ugly mouth  the case of my father and mother was not normal you understand they had been separated for some years and though they were not young in ageindeed before my childish eyes they loomed quite ancient folk and in fact my father must have been nearly forty and my mother quit of thirtyyet as you will come to think yourself no doubt during the course of my story they were in all the essentials of life little more than boy and girl this i came to see later on but at that time had i been consulted by enquiring maid or bachelor i might unwittingly have given wrong impressions concerning marriage in the general i should have described a husband as a man who could never rest quite content unless his wife were by his side who twenty times a day would call from his office door maggie are you doing anything important i want to talk to you about a matter of business  maggie are you alone oh all right ill come down of a wife i should have said she was a woman whose eyes were ever lovelit when resting on her man who was glad where he was and troubled where he was not but in every case this might not have been correct  also i should have had something to say concerning the alarms and excursions attending residence with any married couple i should have recommended the holding up of feet under the table lest mistaken for other feet they should be trodden on and pressed also i should have advised against entry into any room unpreceded by what in stageland is termed noise without it is somewhat disconcerting to the nervous incomer to be met the door still in his hand by a sound as of people springing suddenly into the air followed by a weird scuttling of feet and then to discover the occupants sitting stiffly in opposite corners deeply engaged in book or needlework but as i have said with regard to some households such precautions might be needless  personally i fear i exercised little or no controlling influence upon my parents in this respect my intrusions coming soon to be greeted with oh its only spud in a tone of relief accompanied generally by the sofa cushion but of my aunt they stood more in awe not that she ever said anything and indeed to do her justice in her efforts to spare their feelings she erred if at all on the side of excess never did she move a footstep about the house except to the music of a sustained and penetrating cough as my father once remarked ungratefully i must confess the volume of bark produced by my aunt in a single day would have done credit to the dying efforts of a hospital load of consumptives to a robust and perfectly healthy lady the cost in nervous force must have been prodigious also that no fear should live with them that her eyes had seen aught not intended for them she would invariably enter backwards any room in which they might be closing the door loudly and with difficulty before turning round and through dark passages she would walk singing no woman alive could have done more yetsuch is human natureneither my father nor my mother was grateful to her so far as i could judge  indeed strange as it may appear the more sympathetic towards them she showed herself the more irritated against her did they become  i believe fanny you hate seeing luke and me happy together said my mother one day coming up from the kitchen to find my aunt preparing for entry into the drawingroom by dropping teaspoons at fivesecond intervals outside the door dont make yourself so ridiculous my mother spoke really quite unkindly  hate it replied my aunt why should i why shouldnt a pair of turtle doves bill and coo when their united age is only a little over seventy the pretty dears the mildness of my aunts answers often surprised me  as for my father he grew positively vindictive i remember the occasion well it was the first though not the last time i knew him lose his temper what brought up the subject i forget but my father stopped suddenly we were walking by the canal bank  your auntmy father may not have intended it but his tone and manner when speaking of my aunt always conveyed to me the impression that he regarded me as personally responsible for her existence this used to weigh upon me your aunt is the most cantankerous the most he broke off and shook his fist towards the setting sun i wish to god said my father your aunt had a comfortable little income of her own with a freehold cottage in the country by god i do but the next moment ashamed i suppose of his brutality not but what sometimes of course she can be very nice you know he added dont tell your mother what i said just now  another who followed with sympathetic interest the domestic comedy was susan our maidofallwork the first of a long and varied series extending unto the advent of amy to whom the blessing of heaven susan was a stout and elderly female liable to sudden fits of sleepiness the result we were given to understand of trouble but her heart it was her own proud boast was always in the right place she could never look at my father and mother sitting anywhere near each other but she must flop down and weep awhile the sight of connubial bliss always reminding her so she would explain of the past glories of her own married state  though an earnest enquirer i was never able myself to grasp the ins and outs of this past married life of susans whether her answers were purposely framed to elude curiosity or whether they were the result of a naturally incoherent mind i cannot say their tendency was to convey confusion  on monday i have seen susan shed tears of regret into the brussels sprouts that she had been debarred by the pressure of other duties from lately watering his grave which i gathered was at manor park while on tuesday i have listened blood chilled to the recital of her intentions should she ever again enjoy the luxury of getting her fingers near the scruff of his neck  but i thought susan he was dead was my very natural comment upon this outbreak  so did i master paul was susans rejoinder that was his artfulness  then he isnt buried in manor park cemetery  not yet but hell wish he was the halfbaked monkey when i get hold of him  then he wasnt a good man  who  your husband  who says he aint a good man it was susans flying leaps from tense to tense that most bewildered me if anybody says he aint ill gouge their eye out  i hastened to assure susan that my observation had been intended in the nature of enquiry not of assertion  brings me a bottle of ginfor my headachesevery time he comes home continued susan showing cause for opinion every blessed time  and at some such point as this i would retire to the clearer atmosphere of german grammar or mixed fractions  we suffered a good deal from susan one way and another for having regard to the admirable position of her heart we all felt it our duty to overlook mere failings of the fleshall but my aunt that is who never made any pretence of being a sentimentalist  shes a lazy hussy was the opinion expressed of her one morning by my aunt who was rinsing a gulping snorting lazy hussy thats what she is there was some excuse for my aunts indignation it was then eleven oclock and susan was still sleeping off an attack of what she called newralgy  she has seen a good deal of trouble said my mother who was wiping  and if she was my cook and housemaid replied my aunt she would see more the slut  shes not a good servant in many respects admitted my mother but i think shes goodhearted  oh drat her heart was my aunts retort the right place for that heart of hers is on the doorstep and thats where id put it and her and her box alongside it if i had my way  the departure of susan did take place not long afterwards it occurred one saturday night my mother came upstairs looking pale  luke she said do please run for the doctor  whats the matter asked my father  susan gasped my mother shes lying on the kitchen floor breathing in the strangest fashion and quite unable to speak  ill go for washburn said my father if i am quick i shall catch him at the dispensary  five minutes later my father came back panting followed by the doctor this was a big blackbearded man added to which he had the knack of looking bigger than even he really was he came down the kitchen stairs two at a time shaking the whole house he brushed my mother aside and bent over the unconscious susan who was on her back with her mouth wide open then he rose and looked at my father and mother who were watching him with troubled faces and then he opened his mouth and there came from it a roar of laughter the like of which sound i had never heard  the next moment he had seized a pail half full of water and had flung it over the woman she opened her eyes and sat up  feeling better said the doctor with the pail still in his hand have another dose  susan began to gather herself together with the evident intention of expressing her feelings but before she could find the first word he had pushed the three of us outside and slammed the door behind us  from the top of the stairs we could hear susans thick rancorous voice raging fiercer and fiercer drowned every now and then by the mans savage roar of laughter and when for want of breath she would flag for a moment he would yell out encouragement to her shouting bravo go it my beauty give it tongue bark bark i love to hear you applauding her clapping his hands and stamping his feet  what a beast of a man said my mother  he is really a most interesting man when you come to know him explained my father  replied my mother stiffly i dont ever mean to know him but it is only concerning the past that we possess knowledge  the riot from below ceased at length and was followed by a new voice speaking quietly and emphatically and then we heard the doctors step again upon the stairs  my mother held her purse open in her hand and as the man entered the room she went forward to meet him  how much do we owe you doctor said my mother she spoke in a voice trembling with severity  he closed the purse and gently pushed it back towards her  a glass of beer and a chop mrs kelver he answered which i am coming back in an hour to cook for myself and as you will be without any servant he continued while my mother stood staring at him incapable of utterance you had better let me cook some for you at the same time i am an expert at grilling chops  but really doctor my mother began he laid his huge hand upon her shoulder and my mother sat down upon the nearest chair  my dear lady he said shes a person you never ought to have had inside your house shes promised me to be gone in half an hour and im coming back to see she keeps her word give her a months wages and have a clear fire ready for me and before my mother could reply he had slammed the front door  what a very odd sort of a man said my mother recovering herself  hes a character said my father you might not think it but hes worshipped about here  i hardly know what to make of him said my mother i suppose i had better go out and get some chops which she did  susan went as sober as a judge on friday as the saying is her great anxiety being to get out of the house before the doctor returned the doctor himself arrived true to his time and i lay awakefor no human being ever slept or felt he wanted to sleep while dr washburn was anywhere nearand listened to the gusts of laughter that swept continually through the house even my aunt laughed that supper time and when the doctor himself laughed it seemed to me that the bed shook under me not liking to be out of it i did what spoilt little boys and even spoilt little girls sometimes will do under similar stress of feeling wrapped the blanket round my legs and pattered down with my face set to express the sudden desire of a sensitive and possibly shortlived child for parents love my mother pretended to be angry but that i knew was only her company manners besides i really had if not exactly a pain an extremely uncomfortable sensation one common to me about that period as of having swallowed the dome of st pauls the doctor said it was a frequent complaint with children the result of too early hours and too much study and taking me on his knee wrote then and there a diet chart for me which included one tablespoonful of golden syrup four times a day and one ounce of sherbet to be placed upon the tongue and taken neat ten minutes before each meal  that evening will always live in my remembrance my mother was brighter than i had ever seen her a flush was on her cheek and a sparkle in her eye and looking across at her as she sat holding a small painted screen to shield her face from the fire the sense of beauty became suddenly born within me and answering an impulse i could not have explained i slipped down still with my blanket around me from the doctors knee and squatted on the edge of the fender from where when i thought no one was noticing me i could steal furtive glances up into her face  so also my father seemed to me to have become all at once bigger and more dignified talking with a vigour and an enjoyment that sat newly on him aunt fan was quite witty and agreeablefor her and even i asked one or two questions at which for some reason or another everybody laughed which determined me to remember and ask those same questions again on some future occasion  that was the great charm of the man that by the magnetic spell of his magnificent vitality he drew from everyone their best in his company clever people waxed intellectual giants while the dull sat amazed at their own originality conversing with him podsnap might have been piquant dogberry incisive but better than all else i found it listening to his own talk of what he spoke i could tell you no more than could the children of hamelin have told the tune the pied piper played i only know that at the tangled music of his strong voice the walls of the mean room faded away and that beyond i saw a brave laughing world that called to me a world full of joyous fight where some won and some lost but that mattered not a jot because whatever else came of it there was a right royal game for all a world where merry gentlemen feared neither life nor death and fate was but the master of the revels  such was my first introduction to dr washburn or to give him the name by which he was known in every slum and alley of that quarter dr fighting hal and in a minor key that evening was an index to the whole man often he would wrinkle his nose as a dog before it bites and then he was more brute than manbrutish in his instincts in his appetites brutish in his pleasure brutish in his fun or his deep blue eyes would grow soft as a mothers and then you might have thought him an angel in a soft felt hat and a coat so loosefitting as to suggest the possibility of his wings being folded away underneath often have i tried to make up my mind whether it has been better for me or worse that i ever came to know him but as easy would it be for the tree to say whether the rushing winds and the wild rains have shaped it or misshaped  susans place remained vacant for some time my mother would explain to the few friends who occasionally came from afar to see us that her housemaid she had been compelled to suddenly discharge and that we were waiting for the arrival of a new and better specimen but the months passed and we still waited and my father on the rare days when a client would ring the office bell would after pausing a decent interval open the front door himself and then call downstairs indignantly and loudly to know why jane or mary could not attend to their work and my mother that the breadboy or the milkman might not put it about the neighbourhood that the kelvers in the big corner house kept no servant would hide herself behind a thick veil and fetch all things herself from streets a long way off  for this family of whom i am writing were i confess weak and human their poverty they were ashamed of as though it were a crime and in consequence their life was more full of paltry and useless subterfuge than should be perhaps the life of brave men and women the larder i fancy was very often bare but the port and sherry with the sweet biscuits stood always on the sideboard and the fire had often to be low in the grate that my fathers tall hat might shine resplendent and my mothers black silk rustle on sundays  but i would not have you sneer at them thinking all pretence must spring from snobbishness and never from mistaken selfrespect some fine gentleman writers there bemen whose world is bounded on the east by bond streetwho see in the struggles of poverty to hide its darns only matter for jest but myself i cannot laugh at them i know the long hopes and fears that centre round the hired waiter the long cost of the cream and the ice jelly ordered the week before from the confectioners but to me it is pathetic not ridiculous heroism is not all of one pattern dr washburn had the prince of wales come to see him would have put his bread and cheese and jug of beer upon the table and helped his royal highness to half but my father and mothers tea was very weak that mr jones or mr smith might have a glass of wine should they come to dinner i remember the one egg for breakfast my mother arguing that my father should have it because he had his business to attend to my father insisting that my mother should eat it she having to go out shopping a compromise being effected by their dividing it between them each clamouring for the white as the most nourishing and i know however little the meal looked upon the table when we started i always rose well satisfied these are small things to speak of but then you must bear in mind this is a story moving in narrow ways  to me this life came as a good time that i was encouraged to eat treacle in preference to butter seemed to me admirable personally i preferred sausages for dinner and a supper of fried fish and potatoes brought in stealthily in a carpet bag was infinitely more enjoyable than the set meal where nothing was of interest till one came to the dessert what fun there was about it all the cleaning of the doorstep by night when from the illlit street a gentleman with a piece of sacking round his legs might very well pass for a somewhat tall charwoman i would keep watch at the gate to give warning should any one looking like a possible late caller turn the corner of the street coming back now and then in answer to a low whistle to help my father grope about in the dark for the hearthstone he was always mislaying the hearthstone how much better helping to clean the knives or running errands than wasting all ones morning dwelling upon the shocking irregularity of certain classes of french verbs or making useless calculations as to how long x walking four and a quarter miles an hour would be overtaking y whose powers were limited to three and a half but who had started two and three quarter hours sooner the whole argument being reduced to sheer pedantry by reason of no information being afforded to the student concerning the respective thirstiness of x and y  even my father and mother were able to take it lightly with plenty of laughter and no groaning that i ever heard for over all lay the morning light of hope and what prisoner escaping from his dungeon ever stayed to think of his torn hands and knees when beyond the distant opening he could see the sunlight glinting through the brambles  i had no idea said my mother there was so much to do in a house in future i shall arrange for the servants to have regular hours and a little time to themselves for rest dont you think it right luke  quite right replied my father and ill tell you another thing well do i shall insist on the landlords putting a marble doorstep to the next house we take you pass a sponge over marble and it is always clean  or tesselated suggested my mother  or tesselated agreed my father but marble is more uncommon  only once can i recall a cloud that was one sunday when my mother speaking across the table in the middle of dinner said to my father we might save the rest of that stew luke theres an omelette coming  my father laid down the spoon an omelette  yes said my mother i thought i would like to try again  my father stepped into the back kitchenwe dined in the kitchen as a rule it saved much carriagereturning with the wood chopper  what ever are you going to do luke with the chopper said my mother  divide the omelette replied my father  my mother began to cry  why maggie said my father  i know the other one was leathery said my mother but it was the fault of the oven you know it was luke  my dear said my father i only meant it as a joke  i dont like that sort of joke said my mother it isnt nice of you luke  i dont think to be candid my mother liked much any joke that was against herself indeed when i come to think of it i have never met a woman who did nor man either  there had soon grown up a comradeship between my father and myself for he was the youngest thing i had met with as yet sometimes my mother seemed very young and later i met boys and girls nearer to my own age in years but they grew while my father remained always the same the hair about his temples was turning grey and when you looked close you saw many crows feet and lines especially about the mouth but his eyes were the eyes of a boy his laugh the laugh of a boy and his heart the heart of a boy so we were very close to each other  in a narrow strip of ground we called our garden we would play a cricket of our own encompassed about by many novel rules rendered necessary by the locality for instance all hitting to leg was forbidden as tending to endanger neighbouring windows while hitting to off was likewise not to be encouraged as causing a temporary adjournment of the game while batter and bowler went through the house and out into the street to recover the ball from some predatory crowd of urchins to whom it had evidently appeared as a gift direct from heaven sometimes rising very early we would walk across the marshes to bathe in a small creek that led down to the river but this was muddy work necessitating much washing of legs on the return home and on rare days we would taking the train to hackney and walking to the bridge row up the river lea perhaps as far as ponders end  but these sports being hedged around with difficulties more commonly for recreation we would take long walks there were pleasant nooks even in the neighbourhood of plaistow marshes in those days here and there a graceful elm still clung to the troubled soil surrounded on all sides by hideousness picturesque inns still remained hidden within green walls where if you were careful not to pry too curiously you might sit and sip your glass of beer beneath the oak and dream yourself where reeking chimneys and mean streets were not during such walks my father would talk to me as he would talk to my mother telling me all his wild hopeful plans discussing with me how i was to lodge at oxford to what particular branches of study and of sport i was to give my preference speaking always with such catching confidence that i came to regard my sojourn in this brick and mortar prison as only a question of months  one day talking of this future and laughing as we walked briskly through the shrill streets i told him the words my mother had saidlong ago as it seemed to me for life is as a stone rolling downhill and moves but slowly at first she and i sitting on the moss at the foot of old jacobs follythat he was our prince fighting to deliver us from the grim castle called hard times guarded by the dragon poverty  my father laughed and his boyish face flushed with pleasure  and she was right paul he whispered pressing my small hand in hisit was necessary to whisper for the street where we were was very crowded but i knew that he wanted to shout i will fight him and i will slay him my father made passes in the air with his walkingstick and it was evident from the way they drew aside that the people round about fancied he was mad i will batter down the iron gates and she shall be free i will god help me i will  the gallant gentleman how long and how bravely he fought but in the end it was the dragon triumphed the knight that lay upon the ground his great heart still i have read how with the sword of honest industry one may always conquer this grim dragon but such was in foolish books in truth only with the sword of chicanery and the stout buckler of unscrupulousness shall you be certain of victory over him if you care not to use these pray to your gods and take what comes with a stout heart    chapter iii  how good luck knocked at the door of the man in grey  louisa roared my father down the kitchen stairs are you all asleep here have i had to answer the front door myself then my father strode into his office and the door slammed my father could be very angry when nobody was by  quarter of an hour later his bell rang with a quick authoritative jangle my mother who was peeling potatoes with difficulty in washleather gloves looked at my aunt who was shelling peas the bell rang again louder still this time  once for louisa twice for james isnt it enquired my aunt  you go paul said my mother say that louisa but with the words a sudden flush overspread my mothers face and before i could lay down my slate she had drawn off her gloves and had passed me no dont stop your lessons ill go myself she said and ran out  a few minutes later the kitchen door opened softly and my mothers hand appearing through the jar beckoned to me mysteriously  walk on your toes whispered my mother setting the example as she led the way up the stairs which after the manner of stairs showed their disapproval of deception by creaking louder and more often than under any other circumstances and in this manner we reached my parents bedroom where in the oldfashioned wardrobe relic of better days reposed my best suit of clothes or to be strictly grammatical my better  never before had i worn these on a weekday morning but all conversation not germane to the question of getting into them quickly my mother swept aside and when i was complete down even to the new shoesbluchers we called them in those daystook me by the hand and together we crept down as we had crept up silent stealthy and alert my mother led me to the street door and opened it  shant i want my cap i whispered but my mother only shook her head and closed the door with a bang and then the explanation of the pantomime came to me for with such businesscomic shall i call it or tragici was becoming familiar and my mothers hand upon my shoulder we entered my fathers office  whether from the fact that so often of an eveningour drawingroom being reserved always as a showroom in case of chance visitors cowpers poems open facedownwards on the wobbly loo table the halffinished crochet work suggestive of elegant leisure thrown carelessly over the arm of the smaller easychairthis office would become our sittingroom its books and papers as things of no account being huddled out of sight or whether from the readiness with which my father would come out of it at all times to play at something elseat cricket in the back garden on dry days or ninepins in the passage on wet charging back into it again whenever a knock sounded at the front door i cannot say but i know that as a child it never occurred to me to regard my fathers profession as a serious affair to me he was merely playing there surrounded by big books and bundles of documents labelled profusely but consisting only of blank papers by japanned tin boxes lettered imposingly but for the most part empty sutton hampden esq i remember was practically my mothers workbox the drayton estates yielded apparently nothing but apples a fruit of which my father was fond while mortgages it was not until later in life i discovered had no connection with poems in manuscript some in course of correction others completed  now as the door opened he rose and came towards us his hair stood up from his head for it was a habit of his to rumple it as he talked and this added to his evident efforts to compose his face into an expression of businesslike gravity added emphasis if such were needed to the suggestion of the over long schoolboy making believe  this is the youngster said my father taking me from my mother and passing me on tall for his age isnt he  with a twist of his thick lips he rolled the evilsmelling cigar he was smoking from the left corner of his mouth to the right and held out a fat and not too clean hand which as it closed round mine brought to my mind the picture of the walrus in my natural history book with the other he flapped me kindly on the head  like is mother wonderfully like is mother aint e he observed still holding my hand and that he added with a wink of one of his small eyes towards my father is about the ighest compliment i can pay im eh  his eyes were remarkably small but marvellously bright and piercing so much so that when he turned them again upon me i tried to think quickly of something nice about him feeling sure that he could see right into me  and where are you thinkin of sendin im he continued eton or arrow  we havent quite made up our minds as yet replied my father at present we are educating him at home  you take my tip said the fat man and learn all you can look at me if id ad the opportunity of being a schollard i wouldnt be here offering your father an extravagant price for doin my work id be able to do it myself  you seem to have got on very well without it laughed my father and in truth his air of prosperity might have justified greater selfcomplacency rings sparkled on his blunt fingers and upon the swelling billows of his waistcoat rose and sank a massive gold cable  id ave done better with it he grunted  but you look very clever i said and though divining with a childs cuteness that it was desired i should make a favourable impression upon him i hoped this would please him the words were yet spontaneous  he laughed heartily his whole body shaking like some huge jelly  well old noel haslucks not exactly a fool he assented but id like myself better if i could talk about something else than business and didnt drop my aitches and so would my little gell  you have a daughter asked my mother with whom a child as a bond of sympathy with the stranger took the place assigned by most women to disrespectful cooks and incompetent housemaids  i wont tell you about er but ill just bring er to see you now and then maam if you dont mind answered mr hasluck she dont often meet gentlefolks an itll do er good  my mother glanced across at my father but the man intercepting her question replied to it himself  you neednt be afraid maam that shes anything like me he assured her quite goodtemperedly nobody ever believes shes my daughter except me and the old woman shes a little lady she is freak o nature i call it  we shall be delighted explained my mother  well you will when you see er replied mr hasluck quite contentedly  he pushed halfacrown into my hand overriding my parents susceptibilities with the easy goodtemper of a man accustomed to have his way in all things  no squanderin it on the eathen was his parting injunction as i left the room you spend that on a christian tradesman  it was the first money i ever remember having to spend that halfcrown of old haslucks suggestions of the delights to be derived from a new pair of gloves for sunday from a latin grammar which would then be all my own and so on having hitherto displaced all less exalted visions concerning the disposal of chance coins coming into my small hands but on this occasion i was left free to decide for myself  the anxiety it gave me the long tossing hours in bed the tramping of the bewildering streets even advice when asked for was denied me  you must learn to think for yourself said my father who spoke eloquently on the necessity of early acquiring sound judgment and what he called commercial aptitude  no dear said my mother mr hasluck wanted you to spend it as you like if i told you that would be spending it as i liked your father and i want to see what you will do with it  the good little boys in the books bought presents or gave away to people in distress for this i hated them with the malignity the lower nature ever feels towards the higher i consulted my aunt fan  if somebody gave you halfacrown i put it to her what would you buy with it  sidecombs said my aunt she was always losing or breaking her sidecombs  but i mean if you were me i explained  drat the child said my aunt how do i know what he wants if he dont know himself idiot  the shop windows into which i stared my nose glued to the pane the things i asked the price of the things i made up my mind to buy and then decided that i wouldnt buy even my patient mother began to show signs of irritation it was rapidly assuming the dimensions of a family curse was old haslucks halfcrown  then one day i made up my mind and so ended the trouble in the window of a small plumbers shop in a back street near stood on view among brass taps rolls of lead piping and cistern requisites various squares of coloured glass the sort of thing chiefly used i believe for lavatory doors and staircase windows some had stars in the centre and others more elaborate were enriched with designs severe but inoffensive i purchased a dozen of these the plumber an affable man who appeared glad to see me throwing in two extra out of sheer generosity  why i bought them i did not know at the time and i do not know now my mother cried when she saw them my father could get no further than but what are you going to do with them to which i was unable to reply my aunt alone attempted comfort  if a person fancies coloured glass said my aunt then hes a fool not to buy coloured glass when he gets the chance we havent all the same tastes  in the end i cut myself badly with them and consented to their being thrown into the dustbin but looking back i have come to regard myself rather as the victim of fate than of folly many folks have i met since recipients of haslucks halfcrownsmany a man who has slapped his pocket and blessed the day he first met that napoleon of finance as later he came to be known among his friendsbut it ever ended so coloured glass and cut fingers is it fairy gold that he and his kind fling round it would seem to be  next time old hasluck knocked at our front door a maid in cap and apron opened it to him and this was but the beginning of change new oilcloth glistened in the passage lace curtains such as in that neighbourhood were the hallmark of the plutocrat advertised our rising fortunes to the street and greatest marvel of all at least to my awed eyes my fathers sunday clothes came into weekday wear new ones taking their place in the great wardrobe that hitherto had been the stronghold of our gentility to which we had ever turned for comfort when rendered despondent by contemplation of the weakness of our outer walls seeing that everything was all right is how my mother would explain it she would lay the lilac silk upon the bed fondly soothing down its rustling undulations lingering lovingly over its deep frosted flounces of rich honiton maybe she had entered the room weary looking and depressed but soon there would proceed from her a gentle humming as from some small winged thing when the sun first touches it and warms it and sometimes by the time the indian shawl which could go through a wedding ring but never would when it was wanted to had been refolded and fastened again with the great cameo brooch and the poke bonnet like some fractious child shaken and petted into good condition she would be singing softly to herself nodding her head to the words which were generally to the effect that somebody was too old and somebody else too bold and another too cold so he wouldnt do for me and stepping lightly as though the burden of the years had fallen from her  one eveningit was before the advent of this haslucki remember climbing out of bed for trouble was within me creatures indescribable but heavy had sat upon my chest after which i had fallen downstairs slowly and reasonably for the first few hundred flights then with haste for the next million miles or so until i found myself in the street with nothing on but my nightshirt personally i was shocked but nobody else seemed to mind and i hailed a twopenny bus and climbed in but when i tried to pay i found i hadnt any pockets so i jumped out and ran away and the conductor came after me my feet were like lead and with every step he gained on me till with a scream i made one mighty effort and awoke  feeling the need of comfort after these unpleasant but by no means unfamiliar experiences i wrapped some clothes round me and crept downstairs the office was dark but to my surprise a light shone from under the drawingroom door and i opened it  the candles in the silver candlesticks were lighted and in state one in each easychair sat my father and mother both in their best clothes my father in the buckled shoes and the frilled shirt that i had never seen him wear before my mother with the indian shawl about her shoulders and upon her head the cap of ceremony that reposed three hundred and sixty days out of the year in its round wickerwork nest lined with silk they started guiltily as i pushed open the door but i congratulate myself that i had sense enoughor was it instinctto ask no questions  the last time i had seen them three hours ago they had been engaged the lights carefully extinguished cleaning the ground floor windows my father the outside my mother within and it astonished me the change not only in their appearance but in their manner and bearing and even in their very voices my father brought over from the sideboard the sherry and sweet biscuits and poured out and handed a glass to my mother and he and my mother drank to each other while i between them ate the biscuits and the conversation was of byrons poems and the great glass palace in hyde park  i wonder am i disloyal setting this down maybe to others it shows but a foolish man and woman and that is far from my intention i dwell upon such trifles because to me the memory of them is very tender the virtues of our loved ones we admire yet after all tis but what we expected of them how could they do otherwise their failings we would forget no one of us is perfect but over their follies we love to linger smiling  to me personally old haslucks coming and all that followed thereupon made perhaps more difference than to any one else my father now was busy all the day if not in his office then away in the grim city of the giants as i still thought of it while to my mother came every day more social and domestic duties so that for a time i was left much to my own resources  ramblingbummelling as the germans term itwas my bent this my mother would have checked but my father said  dont mollycoddle him let him learn to be smart  i dont think the smart people are always the nicest demurred my mother i dont call you at all smart luke  my father appeared surprised but reflected  i should call myself smartin a sense he explained after consideration  perhaps you are right dear replied my mother and of course boys are different from girls  sometimes i would wander victoria park way which was then surrounded by many small cottages in leafy gardens or even reach as far as clapton where old red brick georgian houses still stood behind high palings and tall elms gave to the wide road on sunny afternoons an oldworld air of peace but such excursions were the exception for strange though it may read the narrow squalid streets had greater hold on me not the few main thoroughfares filled ever with a dull deep throbbing as of some tireless iron machine where the endless human files streaming ever up and down crossing and recrossing seemed mere rushing chains of flesh and blood working upon unseen wheels but the dim weary lifeless streetsthe dark tortuous roots as i fancied them of that grim forest of entangled brick mystery lurked in their gloom fear whispered from behind their silence dumb figures flitted swiftly to and fro never pausing never glancing right nor left faroff footsteps rising swiftly into sound as swiftly fading echoed round their lonely comers dreading yet drawn on i would creep along their pavements as through some city of the dead thinking of the eyes i saw not watching from the thousand windows starting at each muffled sound penetrating the long dreary walls behind which that closepacked writhing life lay hid  one day there came a cry from behind a curtained window i stood still for a moment and then ran but before i could get far enough away i heard it again a long piercing cry growing fiercer before it ceased so that i ran faster still not heeding where i went till i found myself in a raw unfinished street ending in black waste land bordering the river i stopped panting wondering how i should find my way again to recover myself and think i sat upon the doorstep of an empty house and there came dancing down the road with a curious halfrunning halfhopping stepsomething like a water wagtailsa child a boy about my own age who after eyeing me strangely sat down beside me  we watched each other for a few minutes and i noticed that his mouth kept opening and shutting though he said nothing suddenly edging closer to me he spoke in a thick whisper it sounded as though his mouth were full of wool  wot appens to yer when yer dead  if youre good you go to heaven if youre bad you go to hell  long way off both of em aint they  yes millions of miles  they cant come after yer cant fetch yer back again  no never  the doorstep that we occupied was the last a yard beyond began the black waste of mud from the other end of the street now growing dark he never took his staring eyes for an instant  ever seen a stiff una dead un  no  i avestuck a pin into im e never felt it dont feel anything when yer dead do yer  all the while he kept swaying his body to and fro twisting his arms and legs and making faces comical figures made of gingerbread with quaintly curved limbs and grinning features were to be bought then in bakers shops he made me hungry reminding me of such  of course not when you are dead youre not there you know our bodies are but senseless clay i was glad i remembered that line i tried to think of the next one which was about food for worms but it evaded me  i like you he said and making a fist he gave me a punch in the chest it was the token of palship among the youth of that neighbourhood and gravely i returned it meaning it for friendship with children is an affair of the instant or not at all and i knew him for my first chum  he wormed himself up  yer wont tell he said  i had no notion what i was not to tell but our compact demanded that i should agree  say i swear  i swear  the heroes of my favourite fiction bound themselves by such like secret oaths here evidently was a comrade after my own heart  goodbye cockey  but he turned again and taking from his pocket an old knife thrust it into my hand then with that extraordinary hopping movement of his ran off across the mud  i stood watching him wondering where he could be going he stumbled a little further where the mud began to get softer and deeper but struggling up again went hopping on towards the river  i shouted to him but he never looked back at every few yards he would sink down almost to his knees in the black mud but wrenching himself free would flounder forward then still some distance from the river he fell upon his face and did not rise again i saw his arms beating feebler and feebler as he sank till at last the oily slime closed over him and i could detect nothing but a faint heaving underneath the mud and after a time even that ceased  it was late before i reached home and fortunately my father and mother were still out i did not tell any one what i had seen having sworn not to and as time went on the incident haunted me less and less until it became subservient to my will but of my fancy for those silent lifeless streets it cured me for the time from behind their still walls i would hear that long cry down their narrow vistas see that writhing figure like some animated gingerbread hopping springing falling  yet in the more crowded streets another trouble awaited me one more tangible  have you ever noticed a pack of sparrows round some crumbs perchance that you have thrown out from your window suddenly the rest of the flock will set upon one there is a tremendous lilliputian hubbub a tossing of tiny wings and heads a babel of shrill chirps it is comical  spiteful little imps they are you say to yourself much amused  so i have heard goodtempered men and women calling out to one another with a laugh  there go those young devils chivvying that poor little beggar again ought to be ashamed of theirselves  but oh the anguish of the poor little beggar can any one who has not been through it imagine it reduced to its actualities what was it gibes and jeers that after all break no bones a few pinches kicks and slaps at worst a few hard knocks but the dreading of it beforehand terror lived in every street hid waiting for me round each corner the halfdozen wrangling over their marbleshad they seen me the boy whistling as he stood staring into the print shop would i get past him without his noticing me or would he swinging round upon his heel raise the shrill whoop that brought them from every doorway to hunt me  the shame when caught at last and cornered the grinning face that would stop to watch the careless jokes of passersby regarding the whole thing but as a sparrows squabble worst of all perhaps the rare pity the after humiliation when finally released i would dart away followed by shouted taunts and laughter every eye turned to watch me shrinking by my whole small carcass shaking with dry sobs of bitterness and rage  if only i could have turned and faced them so far as the mere bearing of pain was concerned i knew myself brave the physical suffering resulting from any number of standup fights would have been trivial compared with the mental agony i endured that i the comrade of a hundred heroesi who nightly rode with richard coeur de lion who against sir lancelot himself had couched a lance and that not altogether unsuccessful i to whom all damsels in distress were wont to look for succourthat i should run from varlets such as these  my friend my bosom friend good robin hood how would he have behaved under similar circumstances how ivanhoe my chosen companion in all quests of knightly enterprise howto come to modern timesjack harkaway mere schoolboy though he might be would not one and all have welcomed such incident with a joyous shout and in a trice have scattered to the winds the worthless herd  but alas upon my pale lips the joyous shout sank into an unheard whisper and the thing that became scattered to the wind was myself the first opening that occurred  sometimes the blood boiling in my veins i would turn thinking to go back and at all risk defying my tormentors prove to myself i was no coward but before i had retraced my steps a dozen paces i would see in imagination the whole scene again before me the laughing crowd the halting passersby the spiteful mocking little faces every way i turned and so instead would creep on home and climbing stealthily up into my own room cry my heart out in the dark upon my bed  until one blessed day when a blessed fairy in the form of a small kitten lifted the spell that bound me and set free my limbs  i have always had a passionate affection for the dumb world if it be dumb my first playmate i remember was a water rat a stream ran at the bottom of our garden and sometimes escaping the vigilant eye of mrs fursey i would steal out with my supper and join him on the banks there hidden behind the osiers we would play at banquets he it is true doing most of the banqueting and i the makebelieve but it was a good game added to which it was the only game i could ever get him to play though i tried he was a oneideaed rat  later i came into the possession of a white specimen all my own he lived chiefly in the outside breast pocket of my jacket in company with my handkerchief so that glancing down i could generally see his little pink eyes gleaming up at me except on very cold days when it would be only his tail that i could see and when i felt miserable somehow he would know it and swarming up push his little cold snout against my ear he died just so clinging round my neck and from many of my fellowmen and women have i parted with less pain it sounds callous to say so but after all our feelings are not under our own control and i have never been able to understand the use of pretending to emotions one has not all this however comes later let me return now to my fairy kitten  i heard its cry of pain from afar and instinctively hastened my steps three or four times i heard it again and at each call i ran faster till breathless i arrived upon the scene the opening of a narrow court leading out of a bystreet at first i saw nothing but the backs of a small mob of urchins then from the centre of them came another wailing appeal for help and without waiting for any invitation i pushed my way into the group  what i saw was hecuba to megave me the motive and the cue for passion transformed me from the dull and muddymettled little johnadreams i had been into a small blind fury pale thought that mental emetic banished from my system i became the healthy unreasoning animal and acted as such  from my methods i frankly admit science was absent in simple primitive fashion that would have charmed a darwinian disciple to observe i went for the whole crowd to employ the expressive idiom of the neighbourhood i was all over it and inside something clung about my feet by kicking myself free and then standing on it i gained the advantage of quite an extra foot in height i dont know what it was and didnt care i fought with my arms and i fought with my legs where i could get in with my head i did i fought whatever came to hand in a spirit of simple thankfulness grateful for what i could reach and indifferent to what was beyond me  that the showif again i may be permitted the local idiomwas not entirely mine i was well aware that not alone my person but my property also was being damaged in the rear became dimly conveyed to me through the sensation of draught already the world to the left of me was mere picturesque perspective while the growing importance of my nose was threatening the absorption of all my other features these things did not trouble me i merely noted them as phenomena and continued to punch steadily  until i found that i was punching something soft and yet unyielding i looked up to see what this foreign matter that thus mysteriously had entered into the mixture might be and discovered it to be a policeman still i did not care the felons dock the prison cell a fig for such mere bogies an impudent word an insulting look and i would have gone for the law itself pale thoughtit must have been a livid green by this timestill trembled at respectful distance from me  fortunately for all of us he was not impertinent and though he spoke the language of his order his tone disarmed offence  now then now then what is all this about  there was no need for me to answer a dozen voluble tongues were ready to explain to him and to explain wholly in my favour this time the crowd was with me let a man school himself to bear dispraise for thereby alone shall he call his soul his own but let no man lie saying he is indifferent to popular opinion that was my first taste of public applause the public was not select and the applause might by the sticklers for english pure and undefiled have been deemed illworded but to me it was the sweetest music i had ever heard or have heard since i was called a plucky little devil a fair ot un not only a good un but a good un preceded by the adjective that in the east bestows upon its principal every admirable quality that can possibly apply under the circumstances it likewise fitted me literally but i knew it was intended rather in its complimentary sense  kind if dirty hands wiped my face a neighbouring butcher presented me with a choice morsel of steak not to eat but to wear and i found it if i may so express myself without infringing copyright grateful and comforting my enemies had long since scooted some of them i had rejoiced to notice with lame and halting steps the mutilated kitten had been restored to its owner a lady of ample bosom who carried beyond judgment by emotion publicly offered to adopt me on the spot the law suggested not for the first time that everybody should now move on and slowly followed by feminine commendation mingled with masculine advice as to improved methods for the future i was allowed to drift away  my bones ached my flesh stung me yet i walked as upon air gradually i became conscious that i was not alone a light pattering step was trying to keep pace with me graciously i slacked my speed and the pattering step settled down beside me every now and again she would run ahead and then turn round to look up into my face much as your small dog does when he happens not to be misbehaving himself and desires you to note the fact evidently she approved of me i was not at my best as far as appearance was concerned but women are kittle cattle and i think she preferred me so thus we walked for quite a long distance without speaking i drinking in the tribute of her worship and enjoying it then gaining confidence she shyly put her hand into mine and finding i did not repel her promptly assumed possession of me according to womans way  for her age and station she must have been a person of means for having tried in vain various methods to make me more acceptable to followers and such as having passed would turn their heads she said  i know gelatines and disappearing into a sweetstuff shop returned with quite a quantity with these first sucked till glutinous we joined my many tatters i still attracted attention but felt warmer  she informed me that her name was cissy and that her fathers shop was in three colt street i informed her that my name was paul and that my father was a lawyer i also pointed out to her that a lawyer is much superior in social position to a shopkeeper which she acknowledged cheerfully we parted at the corner of the stainsby road and i let her kiss me once it was understood that in the stainsby road we might meet again  i left eliza gaping after me the front door in her hand and ran straight up into my own room robinson crusoe king arthur the last of the barons rob roy i looked them all in the face and was not ashamed i also was a gentleman  my mother was much troubled when she saw me but my father hearing the story approved  but he looks so awful said my mother in this world said my father one must occasionally be aggressiveif necessary brutal  my father would at times be quite savage in his sentiments    chapter iv  paul falling in with a goodly company of pilgrims learns of them the road that he must travel and meets the princess of the golden locks  the east india dock road is nowadays a busy crowded thoroughfare the jingle of the trambell and the rattle of the omnibus and cart mingle continuously with the rain of many feet beating ceaselessly upon its pavements but at the time of which i write it was an empty voiceless way bounded on the one side by the long echoing wall of the docks and on the other by occasional small houses isolated amid market gardens drying grounds and rubbish heaps only one thing remainsor did remain last time i passed along it connecting it with its former selfand that is the onestoreyed brick cottage at the commencement of the bridge and which was formerly the tollhouse i remember this tollhouse so well because it was there that my childhood fell from me and sad and frightened i saw the world beyond  i cannot explain it better i had been that afternoon to plaistow on a visit to the family dentist it was an outoftheway place in which to keep him but there existed advantages of a counterbalancing nature  have the halfcrown in your hand my mother would direct me while making herself sure that the purse containing it was safe at the bottom of my knickerbocker pocket but of course if he wont take it why you must bring it home again  i am not sure but i think he was some distant connection of ours at all events i know he was a kind friend i seated in the velvet chair of state he would unroll his case of instruments before me and ask me to choose recommending with affectionate eulogisms the most murderous looking  but on my opening my mouth to discuss the fearful topic lo a pair would shoot from under his coatsleeve and almost before i knew what had happened the trouble would be over after that we would have tea together he was an old bachelor and his house stood in a great gardenfor plaistow in those days was a picturesque villageand out of the plentiful fruit thereof his housekeeper made the most wonderful of jams and jellies oh they were good those teas generally our conversation was of my mother who it appeared was once a little girl not at all the sort of little girl i should have imagined her on the contrary a prankish wilful little girl though good company i should say if all the tales he told of her were true and i am inclined to think they were in spite of the fact that my mother when i repeated them to her would laugh saying she was sure she had no recollection of anything of the kind adding severely that it was a pity he and i could not find something better to gossip about yet her next question would be  and what else did he say if you please explaining impatiently when my answer was not of the kind expected no no i mean about me  the tea things cleared away he would bring out his great microscope to me it was a peephole into a fairy world where dwelt strange dragons mighty monsters so that i came to regard him as a sort of harmless magician it was his pet study and looking back i cannot help associating his enthusiasm for all things microscopical with the fact that he was an exceptionally little man himself but one of the biggest hearted that ever breathed  on leaving i would formally hand him my halfcrown with mammas compliments and he would formally accept it but on putting my hand into my jacket pocket when outside the gate i would invariably find it there the first time i took it back to him but unblushingly he repudiated all knowledge  must be another halfcrown he suggested such things do happen one puts change into a pocket and overlooks it slippery things halfcrowns  returning home on this particular day of days i paused upon the bridge and watched for awhile the lazy barges manoeuvring their way between the piers it was one of those hushed summer evenings when the air even of grim cities is full of whispering voices and as turning away from the river i passed through the white tollgate i had a sense of leaving myself behind me on the bridge so vivid was the impression that i looked back half expecting to see myself still leaning over the iron parapet looking down into the sunlit water  it sounds foolish but i leave it standing wondering if to others a like experience has ever come the little chap never came back to me he passed away from me as a mans body may possibly pass away from him leaving him only remembrance and regret for a time i tried to play his games to dream his dreams but the substance was wanting i was only a thin ghost making believe  it troubled me for quite a spell of time even to the point of tears this feeling that my childhood lay behind me this sudden realisation that i was travelling swiftly the strange road called growing up i did not want to grow up could nothing be done to stop it rather would i be always as i had been playing dreaming the dark way frightened me must i go forward  then gradually but very slowly with the long months and years came to me the consciousness of a new being new pulsations sensories throbbings rooted in but differing widely from the old and little paul the paul of whom i have hitherto spoken faded from my life  so likewise must i let him fade with sorrow from this book but before i part with him entirely let me recall what else i can remember of him thus we shall be quit of him and he will interfere with us no more  chief among the pictures that i see is that of my aunt fan crouching over the kitchen fire her skirt and crinoline rolled up round her waist leaving as sacrifice to custom only her petticoat up and down her body sways in rhythmic motion her hands stroking affectionately her own knees the while i with paper knife for sword or horse of broomstick stand opposite her flourishing and declaiming sometimes i am a knight and she a wicked ogre she is slain growling and swearing and at once becomes the beautiful princess that i secure and bear away with me upon the prancing broomstick so long as the princess is merely holding sweet converse with me from her highbarred window the scene is realistic at least to sufficiency but the bearing away has to be makebelieve for my aunt cannot be persuaded to leave her chair before the fire and the everlasting rubbing of her knees  at other times with the assistance of the meat chopper i am an indian brave and then she is laughing water or singing sunshine and we go out scalping together or in less bloodthirsty moods i am the fairy prince and she the sleeping beauty but in such parts she is not at her best better when seated in the centre of the upturned table i am captain cook and she the cannibal chief  i shall skin him and hang him in the larder till sunday week says my aunt smacking her lips then hell be just in right condition not too tough and not too high she was always strong in detail was my aunt fan  i do not wish to deprive my aunt of any credit due to her but the more i exercise my memory for evidence the more i am convinced that her compliance on these occasions was not conceived entirely in the spirit of selfsacrifice often would she suggest the game and even the theme in such case casting herself invariably for what in old theatrical parlance would have been termed the heavy lead the dragons and the wicked uncles the fussy necromancers and the uninvited fairies as authoress of a new cookery book for use in giantland my aunt i am sure would have been successful most recipes that one reads are so monotonously meagre boil him put her on the spit and roast her for supper cook em in a piewith plenty of gravy but my aunt into the domestic economy of ogredom introduced variety and daintiness  i think my dear my aunt would direct well have him stuffed with chestnuts and served on toast and dont forget the giblets they make such excellent sauce  with regard to the diet of imprisoned maidens she would advise  not too much fishit spoils the flesh for roasting  the things that she would turn people intokings sons rightful princesses such sort of peoplepeople who after a time one would think must have quite forgotten what they started as to let her have her way was a lesson to me in natural history both present and prehistoric the most beautiful damsel that ever lived she would without a moments hesitation turn into a glyptodon or a hippocrepian afterwards when i could guess at the spelling i would look these creatures up in the illustrated dictionary and feel that under no circumstances could i have loved the lady ever again warriors and kings she would delight in transforming into plaice or prawns and haughty queens into brussels sprouts  with gusto would she plan a complicated slaughter paying heed to every detail the sharpening of the knives the having ready of mops and pails of water for purposes of after cleaning up as a writer she would have followed the realistic school  her death with which we invariably wound up the afternoon was another conscientious effort indeed her groans and writhings would sometimes frighten me i always welcomed the last gurgle that finished but not a moment before my aunt would let down her skirtin this way suggesting the fall of the curtain upon our playand set to work to get the tea  another frequently recurring picture that i see is of myself in glazedpeaked cap explaining many things the while we walk through dingy streets to yet a smaller figure curly haired and open eyed still every now and then she runs ahead to turn and look admiringly into my face as on the day she first became captive to the praise and fame of me  i was glad of her company for more reasons than she knew of for one she protected me against my baser self with her beside me i should not have dared to flee from sudden foes indeed together we courted adventure for once you get used to it this standing hazard of attack adds a charm to outdoor exercise that older folk in districts better policed enjoy not so possibly my dog feels when together we take the air to me it is a simple walk maybe a little tiresome suggested rather by contemplation of my waistband than by desire for walking for mere walkings sake to him an expedition full of danger and surprises the gentleman asleep with one eye open on the chequers doorstep will he greet me with a friendly sniff or try to bite my head off this crosseyed lopeared loafer lurching against the lamppost shall we pass with a careless wag and a howdo or become locked in a life and death struggle impossible to say this coming corner now ware is anybody waiting round there to kill me or not  but the trusting face beside me nerved me as reward in lonely places i would let her hold my hand  a second advantage i derived from her company was that of being less trampled on less walked over less swept aside into doorway or gutter than when alone a pretty winsome face had this little maid if memory plays me not kindly false but also she had a vocabulary and when the blind idiot male or female instead of passing us by walking round us would after the custom of the blind idiot seek to gain the other side of us by walking through us she would use it  now then where yer coming to old glasseye we aint sperrits cant yer see us  and if they attempted reply her childs treble so strangely at variance with her dainty appearance would only rise more shrill  garn theyd run out of eads when they was making you thats only a turnip wot youve got stuck on top of yer i offer but specimens  nor was it of the slightest use attempting personal chastisement as sometimes an irate lady or gentleman would be foolish enough to do as well might an hippopotamus attempt to reprove a terrier the only result was to provide comedy for the entire street  on these occasions our positions were reversed i being the admiring spectator of her prowess yet to me she was ever meek almost irritatingly submissive she found out where i lived and would often come and wait for me for hours her little face pressed tight against the iron railings until either i came out or shook my head at her from my bedroom window when she would run off the dying away into silence of her pattering feet leaving me a little sad  i think i cared for her in a way yet she never entered into my daydreams which means that she existed for me only in the outer world of shadows that lay round about me and was not of my real life  also i think she was unwise introducing me to the shop for children and dogsone seems unconsciously to bracket them in ones thoughtsare snobbish little wretches if only her father had been a dealer in firewood i could have soothed myself by imagining mistakes it was a common occurrence as i well knew for children of quite the best families to be brought up by wood choppers fairies the best intentioned in the world but born muddlers were generally responsible for these mishaps which however always became righted in time for the wedding or even had he been a pork butcher and there were many in the neighbourhood i could have thought of him as a swineherd and so found precedent for hope  but a fishmongerfrom six in the evening a fried fishmonger i searched history in vain fried fishmongers were without the pale  so gradually our meetings became less frequent though i knew that every afternoon she waited in the quiet stainsby road where dwelt in semidetached sixroomed villas the aristocracy of poplar and that after awhile for arriving late at times i have been witness to the sad fact tears would trace pathetic patterns upon her dustbesprinkled cheeks and with the advent of the worldilluminating barbara to which event i am drawing near they ceased altogether  so began and ended my first romance one of these dayssome quiet summers afternoon when even the air of pigott street vibrates with tenderness beneath the whispered sighs of memory i shall walk into the little grocers shop and boldly ask to see her so far have i already gone as to trace her and often have i tried to catch sight of her through the glass door but hitherto in vain i know she is the more or less troubled mother of a numerous progeny i am told she has grown stout and probable enough it is that her tongue has gained rather than lost in sharpness yet under all the unrealities the clumsyhanded world has built about her i shall see i know the lithesome little maid with fond admiring eyes what help they were to me i never knew till i had lost them how hard to gain such eyes i have learned since were we to write the truth in our confession books should we not admit the quality we most admire in others is admiration of ourselves and is it not a wise selection if you would have me admirable my friend admire me and speak your commendation without stint that in the sunshine of your praises i may wax for indifference maketh an indifferent man and contempt a contemptible man come is it not true does not all that is worthy in us grow best by honour  chief among the remaining figures on my childhoods stage were the many servants of our house the generals as they were termed so rapid as a rule was their transit through our kitchen that only one or two conspicuous by reason of their lingering remain upon my view it was a neighbourhood in which domestic servants were not much required those intending to take up the calling seriously went westward the local ranks were recruited mainly from the discontented or the disappointed from those who unappreciated at home hoped from the stranger more discernment or from the lovelorn the jilted and the jealous who took the cap and apron as in an earlier age their like would have taken the veil maybe to the comparative seclusion of our basement as contrasted with the alternative frivolity of shop or factory they felt in such mood more attuned with the advent of the new or the recovery of the old young man they would plunge again into the vain world leaving my poor mother to search afresh amid the legions of the cursed  with these i made such comradeship as i could for i had no child friends kind creatures were most of them at least so i found them they were poor at making believe but would always squeeze ten minutes from their work to romp with me and that perhaps was healthier for me what perhaps was not so good for me was that staggered at the amount of booklearning implied by my conversation for the journalistic instinct i am inclined to think was early displayed in me they would listen openmouthed to all my information regarding me as a precocious oracle sometimes they would obtain permission to take me home with them to tea generously eager that their friends should also profit by me then encouraged by admiring grinning faces i would hold forth keenly enjoying the sound of my own proud piping  as good as a book aint he was the tribute most often paid to me  as good as a play one enthusiastic listener an old greengrocer went so far as to say  already i regarded myself as among the immortals  one girl a dear wholesome creature named janet stayed with us for months and might have stayed years but for her addiction to strong language the only and wellbeloved child of the captain of the barge nancy jane trading between purfleet and ponders end her conversation was at once my terror and delight  janet my mother would exclaim in agony her hands going up instinctively to guard her ears how can you use such words  what words mum  the things you have just called the gas man  him well did you see what he did mum walked straight into my clean kitchen without even wiping his boots the and before my mother could stop her janet had relieved her feelings by calling him itor rather themagain without any idea that she had done aught else than express in fitting phraseology a natural human emotion  we were good friends janet and i and therefore it was that i personally undertook her reformation it was not an occasion for mincing ones words the stake at issue was i felt too important i told her bluntly that if she persisted in using such language she would inevitably go to hell  then wheres my father going demanded janet  does he use language  i gathered from janet that no one who had enjoyed the privilege of hearing her father could ever again take interest in the feeble efforts of herself  i am afraid janet i explained that if he doesnt give it up  but its the only way he can talk interrupted janet he dont mean anything by it  i sighed yet set my face against weakness you see janet people who swear do go there  but janet would not believe  god send my dear kind father to hell just because he cant talk like the gentlefolks dont you believe it of him master paul hes got more sense  i hope i pain no one by quoting janets common sense for that i should be sorry i remember her words because so often when sinking in sloughs of childish despond they afforded me firm foothold more often than i can tell when compelled to listen to the sententious voice of immeasurable folly glibly explaining the eternal mysteries has it comforted me to whisper to myself i dont believe it of him hes got more sense  and about that period i had need of all the comfort i could get as we descend the road of life the journey demanding so much of our attention becomes of more importance than the journeys end but to the child standing at the valleys gate the terminating hills are clearly visible what lies beyond them is his constant wonder i never questioned my parents directly on the subject shrinking as so strangely we all do both young and old from discussion of the very matters of most moment to us and they on their part not guessing my need contented themselves with the vague generalities with which we seek to hide even from ourselves the poverty of our beliefs but there were foolish voices about me less reticent while the literature illustrated and otherwise provided in those days for seriousminded youth answered all questionings with blunt brutality if you did wrong you burnt in a fiery furnace for ever and ever were your imagination weak you could turn to the accompanying illustration and see at a glance how you yourself would writhe and shrink and scream while cheerful devils well organised were busy stoking i had been burnt once rather badly in consequence of live coals in course of transit on a shovel being let fall upon me i imagined these burning coals not confined to a mere part of my body but pressing upon me everywhere not snatched swiftly off by loving hands the pain assuaged by applications of soft soap and the blue bag but left there eating into my flesh and veins and this continued for eternity you suffered for an hour a day a thousand years and were no nearer to the end ten thousand a million years and yet as at the very first it was for ever and for ever still it would always be for ever i suffered also from insomnia about this period  then be good replied the foolish voices round me never do wrong and so avoid this endless agony  but it was so easy to do wrong there were so many wrong things to do and the doing of them was so natural  then repent said the voices always ready  but how did one repent what was repentance did i hate my sin as i was instructed i must or merely hate the idea of going to hell for it because the latter even my childs sense told me was no true repentance yet how could one know the difference  above all else there haunted me the fear of the unforgivable sin what this was i was never able to discover i dreaded to enquire too closely lest i should find i had committed it day and night the terror of it clung to me  believe said the voices so only shall you be saved how believe how know you did believe hours would i kneel in the dark repeating in a whispered scream  i believe i believe oh i do believe and then rise with white knuckles wondering if i really did believe  another question rose to trouble me in the course of my meanderings i had made the acquaintance of an old sailor one of the most disreputable specimens possible to find and had learned to love him our first meeting had been outside a confectioners window in the commercial road where he had discovered me standing my nose against the glass a mere palpitating appetite on legs he had seized me by the collar and hauled me into the shop there dropping me upon a stool he bade me eat pride of race prompted me politely to decline but his language became so awful that in fear and trembling i obeyed so soon as i was finishedit cost him two and fourpence i rememberwe walked down to the docks together and he told me stories of the sea and land that made my blood run cold altogether in the course of three weeks or a month we met about half a dozen times when much the same programme was gone through i think i was a fairly frank child but i said nothing about him at home feeling instinctively that if i did there would be an end of our comradeship which was dear to me not merely by reason of the pastry though i admit that was a consideration but also for his wondrous tales i believed them all implicitly and so came to regard him as one of the most interesting criminals as yet unhanged and what was sad about the case as i felt myself was that his recital of his many iniquities instead of repelling attracted me to him if ever there existed a sinner here was one he chewed tobaccoone of the hundred or so deadly sins according to my theological libraryand was generally more or less drunk not that a stranger would have noticed this the only difference being that when sober he appeared constrainedwas less his natural genial self in a burst of confidence he once admitted to me that he was the biggest blackguard in the merchant service unacquainted with the merchant service as at the time i was i saw no reason to doubt him  one night in a state of intoxication he walked over a gangway and was drowned our mutual friend the confectioner seeing me pass the window came out to tell me so and having heard i walked on heavy of heart and pondering  about his eternal destination there could be no question the known facts precluded the least ray of hope how could i be happy in heaven supposing i eventually did succeed in slipping in knowing that he the lovable old scamp was burning for ever in hell  how could janet taking it that she reformed and thus escaped damnation be contented knowing the father she loved doomed to torment the heavenly hosts so i argued could be composed only of the callous and indifferent  i wondered how people could go about their business eat drink and be merry with tremendous fate hanging thus ever suspended over their heads when for a little space i myself forgot it always it fell back upon me with increased weight  nor was the contemplation of heaven itself particularly attractive to me for it was a foolish paradise these foolish voices had fashioned out of their folly you stood about and sang hymnsfor ever i was assured that my fear of finding the programme monotonous was due only to my state of original sin that when i got there i should discover i liked it but i would have given much for the hope of avoiding both their heaven and their hell  fortunately for my sanity i was not left long to brood unoccupied upon such themes our worldly affairs under the sunshine of old haslucks round red face prosperedfor awhile and one afternoon my father who had been away from home since breakfast time calling me into his office where also sat my mother informed me that the longtalkedof school was become at last a concrete thing  the term commences next week explained my father it is not exactly what i had intended but it will dofor the present later of course you will go to one of the big public schools your mother and i have not yet quite decided which  you will meet other boys there good and bad said my mother who sat clasping and unclasping her hands be very careful dear how you choose your companions  you will learn to take your own part said my father school is an epitome of the world one must assert oneself or one is sat upon  i knew not what to reply the vista thus opened out to me was so unexpected my blood rejoiced but my heart sank  take one of your long walks said my father smiling and think it over  and if you are in any doubt you know where to go for guidance dont you whispered my mother who was very grave  yet i went to bed dreaming of quite other things that night of queens of beauty bending down to crown my brows with laurel of wronged princesses for whose cause i rode to death or victory for on my return home being called into the drawingroom by my father i stood transfixed my cap in hand staring with all my eyes at the vision that i saw  no such wonder had i ever seen before at all events not to my remembrance the maidens that one meets in poplar streets may be fair enough in their way but their millinery displays them not to advantage and the few lady visitors that came to us were of a staid and matronly appearance only out of pictures hitherto had such witchery looked upon me and from these the spell faded as one gazed  i heard old haslucks smoky voice saying my little gell barbara and i went nearer to her moving unconsciously  you can kiss er said the smoky voice again she wont bite but i did not kiss her nor ever felt i wanted to upon the mouth  i suppose she must have been about fourteen and i a little over ten though tall for my age later i came to know she had that rare gold hair that holds the light so that upon her face which seemed of dainty porcelain there ever fell a softened radiance as from some shining aureole those blue eyes where dwell mysteries shadow veiled at the time i knew nothing but that it seemed to me as though the fairytales had all come true  she smiled understanding and well pleased with my confusion child though i waslittle more than child though she was it flattered her vanity  fair and sweet you had but that one fault would it had been another less cruel to you yourself    chapter v  in which there comes by one bent upon pursuing his own way  correct is i think the adjective by which i can best describe doctor florret and all his attributes he was a large man but not too largejust the size one would select for the headmaster of an important middleclass school stout not fat suggesting comfort not grossness his hands were white and well shaped on the left he wore a fine diamond ring but it shone rather than sparkled he spoke of commonplace things in a voice that lent dignity even to the weather his face which was cleanshaven radiated benignity tempered by discretion  so likewise all about him his wife the feminine counterpart of himself seeing them side by side one felt tempted to believe that for his special benefit original methods had been reverted to and she fashioned as his particular helpmeet out of one of his own ribs his furniture was solid meant for use not decoration his pictures following the rule laid down for dress graced without drawing attention to his walls he ever said the correct thing at the correct time in the correct manner doubtful of the correct thing to do one could always learn it by waiting till he did it when one at once felt that nothing else could possibly have been correct he held on all matters the correct views to differ from him was to discover oneself a revolutionary  in practice as i learned at the cost of four more or less wasted years he of course followed the methods considered correct by english schoolmen from the days of edward vi onwards  heaven knows i worked hard i wanted to learn ambitionthe all containing ambition of a boy that has its centre everywhere nor cares to fix itself to form stirred within me did i pass a speaker at some corner hatless perspiring pointing utopias in the air to restless hungry eyes at once i saw myself a demosthenes swaying multitudes a statesman holding the house of commons spellbound the prime minister of england worshipped by the entire country even the opposition papers had i known of them i should have imagined forced to reluctant admiration did the echo of a distant drum fall upon my ear then before me rose picturesque fields of carnage one figure ever conspicuous myself well to the front isolated promotion in the british army of my dream being a matter purely of merit i returned commanderinchief vast crowds thronged every flagdecked street i saw white waving hands from every roof and window i heard the dull deep roar of welcome as with superb seat upon my snowwhite chargeror should it be coalblack the point cost me much consideration so anxious was i that the day should be without a flawi slowly paced at the head of my victorious troops between wild waves of upturned faces walked into a lamppost or on to the toes of some irascible old gentleman and awoke a drunken sailor stormed from between swing doors and tacked tumultuously down the street the factory chimney belching smoke became a swaying mast the costers round about me shouted ay ay sir ready ay ready i was christopher columbus drake nelson rolled into one spurning the presumption of modern geographers i discovered new continents i defeated the frenchthose useful french i died in the moment of victory a nation mourned me and i was buried in westminster abbey also i lived and was created a duke either alternative had its charm personally i was indifferent boys who on november the ninth as explained by letters from their mothers read by doctor florret with a snort were suffering from a severe toothache told me on november the tenth of the glories of lord mayors shows i heard their chatter fainter and fainter as from an everincreasing distance the bells of bow were ringing in my ears i saw myself a merchant prince though still young nobles crowded my counting house i lent them millions and married their daughters i listened unobserved in a corner to discussion on some new book immediately i was a famous author all men praised me for of reviewers and their density i in those days knew nothing poetry fiction history i wrote them all and all men read and wondered only here was a crumpled rose leaf in the pillow on which i laid my swelling head penmanship was vexation to me and spelling puzzled me so that i wrote with sorrow and many blots and scratchings out almost i put aside the idea of becoming an author  but along whichever road i might fight my way to the elysian fields of fame education i dimly but most certainly comprehended was a necessary weapon to my hand and so with aching heart and aching head i pored over my many books i see myself now in my small bedroom my elbows planted on the shaky onelegged table startled every now and again by the frizzling of my hair coming in contact with the solitary candle on cold nights i wear my overcoat turned up about the neck a blanket round my legs and often i must sit with my fingers in my ears the better to shut out the sounds of life rising importunately from below a song of a song to a song a song o song i love thou lovest he she or it loves i should or would love over and over again till my own voice seems some strange buzzing thing about me while my head grows smaller and smaller till i put my hands up frightened wondering if it still be entire upon my shoulders  was i more stupid than the average or is a boys brain physically incapable of the work our educational system demands of it  latin and greek i hear repeating the suave tones of doctor florret echoing as ever the solemn croak of correctness are useful as mental gymnastics my dear doctor florret and co cannot you out of the vast storehouse of really necessary knowledge select apparatus better fitted to strengthen and not overstrain the mental muscles of tentofourteen you gentle reader with brain fully grown trained by years of practice to its subtlest uses take me from your bookshelf say your browning or even your shakespeare come you know this language well you have not merely learned it is your mother tongue construe for me this short passage these few verses parse analyse resolve into component parts and now will you maintain that it is good for tommy tearstained inkbespattered little brat to be given aesops fables ovids metamorphoses to treat in like manner would it not be just as sensible to insist upon his practising his skinny little arms with hundred pounds dumbbells  we were the sons of city men of not welltodo professional men of minor officials clerks shopkeepers our roads leading through the workaday world yet quite half our time was taken up in studies utterly useless to us how i hated them these youthtormenting shades homer how i wished the fishermen had asked him that absurd riddle earlier horace why could not that shipwreck have succeeded it would have in the case of any one but a classic  until one blessed day there fell into my hands a wondrous talisman  hearken unto me ye heavy burdened little brethren of mine waste not your substance upon tops and marbles nor yet upon tuck do ye still call it tuck but scrape and save for in the neighbourhood of paternoster row there dwells a good magician who for silver will provide you with a key that shall open wide for you the gates of hades  by its aid the frogs of aristophanes became my merry friends with ulysses i wandered eagerly through wonderland doctor florret was charmed with my progress which was real for now at last i was studying according to the laws of common sense understanding first explaining afterwards let youth that the folly of age would imprison in ignorance provide itself with keys  but let me not seem to claim credit due to another dan it wasdan of the strong arm and the soft smile dan the wise hater of all useless labour sharpwitted easygoing dan who made this grand discovery  dan followed me a term later into the lower fourth but before he had been there a week was handling latin verse with an ease and dexterity suggestive of unholy dealings with the devil in a lonely corner of regents park first making sure no one was within earshot he revealed to me his magic  dont tell the others he commanded or it will get out and then nobody will be any the better  but is it right i asked  look here young un said dan what are you here forwhats your father paying school fees for it was the appeal to our conscientiousness most often employed by dr florret himself for you to play a silly game or to learn something  because if its only a gamewe boys against the masters continued dan then lets play according to rule if were here to learnwell youve been in the class four months and ive just come and i bet i know more ovid than you do already which was true  so i thanked dan and shared with him his key and all the latin i remember for whatever good it may be to me i take it i owe to him  and knowledge of yet greater value do i owe to the good fortune that his sound mother wit was ever at my disposal to correct my dreamy unfeasibility for from first to last he was my friend and to have been the chosen friend of dan shrewd judge of man and boy i deem no unimportant feather in my cap he took to me he said because i was so jolly greensuch a rummy little mug no other reason would he ever give me save only a sweet smile and a tumbling of my hair with his great hand but i think i understood and i loved him because he was big and strong and handsome and kind no one but a little boy knows how brutal or how kind a big boy can be i was still somewhat of an effeminate little chap nervous and shy with a pink and white face and hair that no amount of wetting would make straight i was growing too fast which took what strength i had and my journey every day added to school work and home work maybe was too much for my years every morning i had to be up at six leaving the house before seven to catch the seven fifteen from poplar station and from chalk farm i had to walk yet another couple of miles but that i did not mind for at chalk farm station dan was always waiting for me in the afternoon we walked back together also and when i was tired and my back achedjust as if some one had cut a piece out of it i felthe would put his arm round me for he always knew and oh how strong and restful it was to lean against so that one walked as in an easychair  it seems to me remembering how i would walk thus by his side looking up shyly into his face thinking how strong and good he was feeling so glad he liked me i can understand a little how a woman loves he was so solid with his arm round me it was good to feel weak  at first we were in the same class the lower third he had no business there he was head and shoulders taller than any of us and years older it was a disgrace to him that he was not in the upper fourth the doctor would tell him so before us all twenty times a week old waterhouse i call him old waterhouse because mister waterhouse ma would convey no meaning to me and i should not know about whom i was speaking who cordially liked him was honestly grieved we his friends though it was pleasant to have him among us suffered in our pride of him the only person quite contented was dan himself it was his way in all things others had their opinion of what was good for him he had his own and his own was the only opinion that ever influenced him the lower third suited him for him personally the upper fourth had no attraction  and even in the lower third he was always at the bottom he preferred it he selected the seat and kept it in spite of all allurements in spite of all reproaches it was nearest to the door it enabled him to be first out and last in also it afforded a certain sense of retirement its occupant to an extent screened from observation became in the course of time almost forgotten to dans philosophical temperament its practical advantages outweighed all sentimental objection  only on one occasion do i remember his losing it as a rule tiresome questions concerning past participles square roots or meridians never reached him being snapped up in transit by armwaving lovers of such trifles the few that by chance trickled so far he took no notice of they possessed no interest for him and he never pretended that they did but one day taken off his guard he gave voice quite unconsciously to a correct reply with the immediate result of finding himself in an exposed position on the front bench i had never seen dan out of temper before but that moment had any of us ventured upon a whispered congratulation we would have had our head punched i feel confident  old waterhouse thought that here at last was reformation come brian he cried rubbing his long thin hands together with delight after all youre not such a fool as you pretend  never said i was muttered dan to himself with a backward glance of regret towards his lost seclusion and before the day was out he had worked his way back to it again  as we were going out together old waterhouse passed us on the stairs havent you any sense of shame my boy he asked sorrowfully laying his hand kindly on dans shoulder  yes sir answered dan with his frank smile plenty it isnt yours thats all  he was an excellent fighter in the whole school of over two hundred boys not half a dozen and those only upper sixth boysfellows who came in top hats with umbrellas and who wouldnt out of regard to their own dignitycould have challenged him with any chance of success yet he fought very seldom and then always in a bored lazy fashion as though he were doing it purely to oblige the other fellow  one afternoon just as we were about to enter regents park by the wicket opposite hanover gate a biggish boy an errand boy carrying an empty basket and supported by two smaller boys barred our way  cant come in here said the boy with the basket  why not inquired dan  cos if you do i shall kick you was the simple explanation  without a word dan turned away prepared to walk on to the next opening the boy with the basket evidently encouraged followed us now im going to give you your cowards blow he said stepping in front of us will you take it quietly it is a lonely way the outer circle on a winters afternoon  ill tell you afterwards said dan stopping short  the boy gave him a slight slap on the cheek it could not have hurt but the indignity of course was great no boy of honour according to our code could have accepted it without retaliating  is that all asked dan  thats allfor the present replied the boy with the basket  goodbye said dan and walked on  glad he didnt insist on fighting remarked dan cheerfully as we proceeded im going to a party tonight  yet on another occasion in a street off lisson grove he insisted on fighting a young rough half again his own weight who brushing up against him had knocked his hat off into the mud  i wouldnt have said anything about his knocking it off explained dan afterwards tenderly brushing the poor bruised thing with his coat sleeve if he hadnt kicked it  on another occasion i remember three or four of us dan among the number were on our way one broiling summers afternoon to hadley woods as we turned off from the highroad just beyond barnet and struck into the fields dan drew from his pocket an enormous juicylooking pear  where did you get that from inquired one dudley  from that big greengrocers opposite barnet church answered dan have a bit  you told me you hadnt any more money retorted dudley in reproachful tones  no more i had replied dan holding out a tempting slice at the end of his pocketknife  you must have had some or you couldnt have bought that pear argued dudley accepting  didnt buy it  do you mean to say you stole it  yes  youre a thief denounced dudley wiping his mouth and throwing away a pip  i know it so are you  no im not  whats the good of talking nonsense you robbed an orchard only last wednesday at mill hill and gave yourself the stomachache  that isnt stealing  what is it  it isnt the same thing  whats the difference  and nothing could make dan comprehend the difference stealing is stealing he would have it whether you take it off a tree or out of a basket youre a thief dudley so am i anybody else say a piece  the thermometer was at that point where morals become slack we all had a piece but we were all of us shocked at dan and told him so it did not agitate him in the least  to dan i could speak my inmost thoughts knowing he would understand me and sometimes from him i received assistance and sometimes confusion the yearly examination was approaching my father and mother said nothing but i knew how anxiously each of them awaited the result my father to see how much i had accomplished my mother how much i had endeavoured i had worked hard but was doubtful knowing that prizes depend less upon what you know than upon what you can make others believe you know which applies to prizes beyond those of school  are you going in for anything dan i asked him we were discussing the subject crossing primrose hill one bright june morning  i knew the question absurd i asked it of him because i wanted him to ask it of me  theyre not giving away anything i particularly want murmured dan in his lazy drawl looked at from that point of view school prizes are it must be confessed not worth their cost  youre sweating yourself young un of course he asked next as i expected  i mean to have a shot at the history i admitted wish i was better at dates  its always twothirds dates dan assured me to my discouragement old florret thinks you cant eat a potato until you know the date that chap raleigh was born  ive prayed so hard that i may win the history prize i explained to him i never felt shy with dan he never laughed at me  you oughtnt to have done that he said i stared it isnt fair to the other fellows that wont be your winning the prize that will be your getting it through favouritism  but they can pray too i reminded him  if you all pray for it answered dan then it will go not to the fellow that knows most history but to the fellow thats prayed the hardest that isnt old florrets idea im sure  but we are told to pray for things we want i insisted  beastly mean way of getting em retorted dan and no argument that came to me neither then nor at any future time brought him to right thinking on this point  he would judge all matters for himself in his opinion achilles was a coward not a hero  he ought to have told the trojans that they couldnt hurt any part of him except his heel and let them have a shot at that he argued king arthur and all the rest of them with their magic swords it wasnt playing the game theres no pluck in fighting if you know youre bound to win beastly cads i call them all  i won no prize that year oddly enough dan did for arithmetic the only subject studied in the lower fourth that interested him he liked to see things coming right he explained  my father shut himself up with me for half an hour and examined me himself  its very curious paul he said you seem to know a good deal  they asked me all the things i didnt know they seemed to do it on purpose i blurted out and laid my head upon my arm my father crossed the room and sat down beside me  spud he saidit was a long time since he had called me by that childish nicknameperhaps you are going to be with me one of the unlucky ones  are you unlucky i asked  invariably answered my father rumpling his hair i dont know why i try hardi do the right thing but it turns out wrong it always does  but i thought mr hasluck was bringing us such good fortune i said looking up in surprise were getting on arent we  i have thought so before so often said my father and it has always ended in ain a collapse  i put my arms round his neck for i always felt to my father as to another boy bigger than myself and older but not so very much  you see when i married your mother he went on i was a rich man she had everything she wanted  but you will get it all back i cried  i try to think so he answered i do think sogenerally speaking but there are timesyou would not understandthey come to you  but she is happy i persisted we are all happy  he shook his head  i watch her he said women suffer more than we do they live more in the present i see my hopes but sheshe sees only me and i have always been a failure she has lost faith in me  i could say nothing i understood but dimly  that is why i want you to be an educated man paul he continued after a silence you cant think what a help education is to a man i dont mean it helps you to get on in the world i think for that it rather hampers you but it helps you to bear adversity to a man with a wellstored mind life is interesting on a piece of bread and a cup of tea i know if it were not for you and your mother i should not trouble  and yet at that time our fortunes were at their brightest so far as i remember them and when they were dark again he was full of fresh hope planning scheming dreaming again it was never acting a worse actor never trod this stage on which we fret his occasional attempts at a cheerfulness he did not feel inevitably resulted in our all three crying in one anothers arms no it was only when things were going well that experience came to his injury child of misfortune he ever rose antaeuslike renewed in strength from contact with his mother  nor must it be understood that his despondent moods even in time of prosperity were oft recurring generally speaking as he himself said he was full of confidence already had he fixed upon our new house in guilford street then still a good residential quarter while at the same time as he would explain to my mother sufficiently central for office purposes close as it was to lincoln and greys inn and bedford row pavements long worn with the weary footsteps of the laws sad courtiers  poplar said my father has disappointed me it seemed a good ideaa rapidly rising district singularly destitute of solicitors it ought to have turned out well and yet somehow it hasnt  there have been a few come my mother reminded him  of a sort admitted my father a criminal lawyer might gather something of a practice here i have no doubt but for general work of course you must be in a central position now in guilford street people will come to me  it should certainly be a pleasanter neighbourhood to live in agreed my mother  later on said my father in case i want the whole house for offices we could live ourselves in regents park it is quite near to the park  of course you have consulted mr hasluck asked my mother who of the two was by far the more practical  for hasluck replied my father it will be much more convenient he grumbles every time at the distance  i have never been quite able to understand said my mother why mr hasluck should have come so far out of his way there must surely be plenty of solicitors in the city  he had heard of me explained my father a curious old fellowlikes his own way of doing things its not everyone who would care for him as a client but i seem able to manage him  often we would go together my father and i to guilford street it was a large corner house that had taken his fancy half creeper covered with a balcony and pleasantly situated overlooking the gardens of the foundling hospital the wizened old caretaker knew us well and having opened the door would leave us to wander through the empty echoing rooms at our own will we furnished them handsomely in later queen anne style of which my father was a connoisseur sparing no necessary expense for as my father observed good furniture is always worth its price while to buy cheap is pure waste of money  this said my father on the second floor stepping from the bedroom into the smaller room adjoining i shall make your mothers boudoir we will have the walls in lavender and maple greenshe is fond of soft tonesand the window looks out upon the gardens there we will put her writingtable  my own bedroom was on the third floor a sunny little room  you will be quiet here said my father and we can shut out the bed and the washstand with a screen  later i came to occupy it though its renteight and sixpence a week including attendancewas somewhat more than at the time i ought to have afforded nevertheless i adventured it taking the opportunity of being an inmate of the house to refurnish it unknown to my stout landlady in later queen anne style putting a neat brass plate with my fathers name upon the door luke kelver solicitor office hours 10 till 4 a medical student thought he occupied my mothers boudoir he was a dull dog full of tiresome talk but i made acquaintanceship with him and often of an evening would smoke my pipe there in silence while pretending to be listening to his monotonous brag  the poor thing he had no idea that he was only a foolish ghost that his walls seemingly covered with coarsecoloured prints of woodenlooking horses simpering ballet girls and petrified prizefighters were in reality a delicate tone of lavender and maple green that at her writingtable in the sunlit window sat my mother her soft curls curtaining her quiet face    chapter vi  of the shadow that came between the man in grey and the lady of the lovelit eyes  theres nothing missing said my mother so far as i can find out depend upon it thats the explanation she has got frightened and has run away  but what was there to frighten her said my father pausing with a decanter in one hand and the bottle in the other  it was the idea of the thing replied my mother she has never been used to waiting at table she was actually crying about it only last night  but whats to be done said my father they will be here in less than an hour  there will be no dinner for them said my mother unless i put on an apron and bring it up myself  where does she live asked my father  at ilford answered my mother  we must make a joke of it said my father  my mother sitting down began to cry it had been a trying week for my mother a party to dinnerto a real dinner beginning with anchovies and ending with ices from the confectioners if only they would remain ices and not giving way to unaccustomed influences present themselves as cold custardwas an extraordinary departure from the even tenor of our narrow domestic way indeed i recollect none previous first there had been the house to clean and rearrange almost from top to bottom endless small purchases to be made of articles that need never misses but which ostentation if ever you let her sneering nose inside the door at once demands then the kitchen rangeit goes without saying one might imagine them all members of a stove union controlled by some agitating old boiler out of workhad taken the opportunity to strike refusing to bake another dish except under permanently improved conditions necessitating weary days with plumbers fat cookery books long neglected on their shelf had been consulted argued with and abused experiments made failures sighed over successes noted cost calculated anxiously means and ways adjusted hope finally achieved shadowed by fear  and now with victory practically won to have the reward thus dashed from her hand at the last moment downstairs in the kitchen would be the dinner waiting for the guests upstairs round the glittering table would be the assembled guests waiting for their dinner but between the two yawned an impassable gulf the bridge without a word of warning had boltedwas probably by this time well on its way to ilford there was excuse for my mothers tears  isnt it possible to get somebody else asked my father  impossible in the time said my mother i had been training her for the whole week we had rehearsed it perfectly  have it in the kitchen suggested my aunt who was folding napkins to look like ships which they didnt in the least and call it a picnic really it seemed the only practical solution  there came a light knock at the front door  it cant be anybody yet surely exclaimed my father in alarm making for his coat  its barbara i expect explained my mother she promised to come round and help me dress but now of course i shant want her my mothers nature was pessimistic  but with the words barbara ran into the room for i had taken it upon myself to admit her knowing that shadows slipped out through the window when barbara came in at the doorin those days i mean  she kissed them all three though it seemed but one movement she was so quick and at once they saw the humour of the thing  theres going to be no dinner laughed my father we are going to look surprised and pretend that it was yesterday it will be fun to see their faces  there will be a very nice dinner smiled my mother but it will be in the kitchen and theres no way of getting it upstairs and they explained to her the situation  she stood for an instant her sweet face the gravest in the group then a light broke upon it  ill get you someone she said  my dear you dont even know the neighbourhood began my mother but barbara had snatched the latchkey from its nail and was gone  with her disappearance shadow fell again upon us if there were only an hotel in this beastly neighbourhood said my father  you must entertain them by yourself luke said my mother and i must waitthats all  dont be absurd maggie cried my father getting angry cant cook bring it in  no one can cook a dinner and serve it too answered my mother impatiently besides shes not presentable  what about fan whispered my father  my mother merely looked it was sufficient  paul suggested my father  thank you retorted my mother i dont choose to have my son turned into a footman if you do  well hadnt you better go and dress was my fathers next remark  it wont take me long to put on an apron was my mothers reply  i was looking forward to seeing you in that new frock said my father in the case of another one might have attributed such a speech to tact in the case of my father one felt it was a happy accident  my mother confessedspeaking with a certain indulgence as one does of ones own follies when pastthat she herself also had looked forward to seeing herself therein threatening discord melted into mutual sympathy  i so wanted everything to be all right for your sake luke said my mother i know you were hoping it would help on the business  i was only thinking of you maggie dear answered my father you are my business  i know dear said my mother it is hard  the key turned in the lock and we all stood quiet to listen  shes come back alone said my mother i knew it was hopeless  the door opened  please maam said the new parlourmaid will i do  she stood there framed by the lintel in the daintiest of aprons the daintiest of caps upon her golden hair and every objection she swept aside with the wind of her merry wilfulness no one ever had their way with her nor wanted it  you shall be footman she ordered turning to mebut this time my mother only laughed wait here till i come down again then to my mother now maam are you ready  it was the first time i had seen my mother or indeed any other flesh and blood woman in evening dress and to tell the truth i was a little shocked nay more than a little and showed it i suppose for my mother flushed and drew her shawl over the gleaming whiteness of her shoulders pleading coldness but barbara cried out against this saying it was a sin such beauty should be hid and my father filching a shawl with a quick hand so dextrously indeed as to suggest some previous practice in the feat dropped on one kneeas though the world were some sweet picture bookand raised my mothers hand with grave reverence to his lips and barbara standing behind my mothers chair insisted on my following suit saying the queen was receiving so i knelt also glancing up shyly as towards the gracious face of some fair lady hitherto unknown thus catching my first glimpse of the philosophy of clothes  my memory lingers upon this scene by contrast with the sad changed days that swiftly followed when my mothers eyes would flash towards my father angry gleams and her voice ring cruel and hard though the moment he was gone her lips would tremble and her eyes grow soft again and fill with tears when my father would sit with averted face and sullen lips tight pressed or worse would open them only to pour forth a rapid flood of savage speech and fling out of the room slamming the door behind him and i would find him hours afterwards sitting alone in the dark with bowed head between his hands  wretched i would lie awake hearing through the flimsy walls their passionate tones now rising high now fiercely forced into cold whispers and then their words to each other sounded even crueller  in their estrangement from each other so new to them both clung closer to me though they would tell me nothing nor should i have understood if they had when my mother was sobbing softly her arms clasping me tighter and tighter with each quivering throb then i hated my father who i felt had inflicted this sorrow upon her yet when my father drew me down upon his knee and i looked into his kind eyes so full of pain then i felt angry with my mother remembering her bitter tongue  it seemed to me as though some cruel unseen thing had crept into the house to stand ever between them so that they might never look into each others loving eyes but only into the eyes of this evil shadow the idea grew upon me until at times i could almost detect its outline in the air feel a chillness as it passed me it trod silently through the pokey rooms always alert to thrust its grinning face before them now beside my mother it would whisper in her ear and the next moment stealing across to my father answer for him with his voice but strangely different i used to think i could hear it laughing to itself as it stepped back into enfolding space  to this day i seem to see it ever following with noiseless footsteps man and woman waiting patiently its opportunity to thrust its face between them so that i can read no love tale but glancing round i see its mocking eyes behind my shoulder reading also with a silent laugh so that never can i meet with boy and girl whispering in the twilight but i see it lurking amid the half lights just behind them creeping after them with stealthy tread as hand in hand they pass me in quiet ways  shall any of us escape or lies the road of all through this dark valley of the shadow of dead love is it loves ordeal testing the feeblehearted from the strong in faith who shall find each other yet again the darkness passed  of the dinner itself until time of dessert i can give no consecutive account for as footman under the orders of this enthusiastic parlourmaid my place was no sinecure and but few opportunities of observation through the crack of the door were afforded me all that was clear to me was that the chief guest was a mr teidelmannor tiedelmann i cannot now remember whicha snuffy mumbling old frump with whose name then however i was familiar by reason of seeing it so often in huge letters though with a co added on dreary long blank walls bordering the limehouse reach he sat at my mothers right hand and i wondered noticing him so ugly and so foolish seeming how she could be so interested in him shouting much and often to him for added to his other disattractions he was very deaf which necessitated his putting his hand up to his ear at every other observation made to him crying querulously eh what what are you talking about say it againsmiling upon him and paying close attention to his every want even old hasluck opposite to him and who though pleasant enough in his careless way was far from being a slave to politeness roared himself purple praising some new disinfectant of which this same teidelmann appeared to be the proprietor  my wife swears by it bellowed hasluck leaning across the table  our drains chimed in mrs hasluck who was a homely soul well youd hardly know there was any in the house since ive took to using it  what are they talking about asked teidelmann appealing to my mother whats he say his wife does  your disinfectant explained my mother mrs hasluck swears by it  who  mrs hasluck  does she delighted to hear it grunted the old gentleman evidently bored  nothing like it for a sickroom persisted hasluck might almost call it a scent  makes one quite anxious to be ill remarked my aunt addressing no one in particular  reminds me of cocoanuts continued hasluck  its proprietor appeared not to hear but hasluck was determined his flattery should not be lost  i say it reminds me of cocoanuts he screamed it this time  oh does it was the reply  doesnt it you  cant say it does answered teidelmann as a matter of fact dont know much about it myself never use it  old teidelmann went on with his dinner but hasluck was still full of the subject  take my advice he shouted and buy a bottle  buy a what  a bottle roared the other with an effort palpably beyond his strength  whats he say whats he talking about now asked teidelmann again appealing to my mother  he says you ought to buy a bottle again explained my mother  what of  of your own disinfectant  silly fool  whether he intended the remark to be heard and thus to close the topic which it did or whether as deaf people are apt to merely misjudged the audibility of an intended sotto vocalism i cannot say i only know that outside in the passage i heard the words distinctly and therefore assume they reached round the table also  a lull in the conversation followed but hasluck was not thinskinned and the next thing i distinguished was his cheery laugh  hes quite right was haslucks comment thats what i am undoubtedly because i cant talk about anything but shop myself i think everybody else is the same sort of fool  but he was doing himself an injustice for on my next arrival in the passage he was again shouting across the table and this time teidelmann was evidently interested  well if you could spare the time id be more obliged than i can tell you hasluck was saying i know absolutely nothing about pictures myself and pearsall says you are one of the best judges in europe  he ought to know chuckled old teidelmann hes tried often enough to palm off rubbish onto me  that last purchase of yours must have been a good thing for young hasluck mentioned the name of a painter since world famous been the making of him i should say  i gave him two thousand for the six replied teidelmann and theyll sell for twenty thousand  but youll never sell them exclaimed my father  no grunted old teidelmann but my widow will there came a soft low laugh from a corner of the table i could not see  its andersons great disappointment followed a languid caressing voice the musical laugh translated into prose it seemed that he has never been able to educate me to a proper appreciation of art hell pay thousands of pounds for a child in rags or a badly dressed madonna such a waste of money it appears to me  but you would pay thousands for a diamond to hang upon your neck argued my fathers voice  it would enhance the beauty of my neck replied the musical voice  an even more absolute waste of money was my fathers answer spoken low and i heard again the musical soft laugh  who is she i asked barbara  the second mrs teidelmann whispered barbara she is quite a swell married him for his moneyi dont like her myself but shes very beautiful  as beautiful as you i asked incredulously we were sitting on the stairs sharing a jelly  oh me answered barbara im only a child nobody takes any notice of meexcept other kids like you for some reason she appeared out of conceit with herself which was not her usual state of mind  but everybody thinks you beautiful i maintained  who she asked quickly  dr hal i answered  we were with our backs to the light so that i could not see her face  what did he say she asked and her voice had more of contentment in it  i could not remember his exact words but about the sense of them i was positive  ask him what he thinks of me as if you wanted to know yourself barbara instructed me and dont forget what he says this time im curious and though it seemed to me a foolish commandfor what could he say of her more than i myself could tell heri never questioned barbaras wishes  yet if i am right in thinking that jealousy of mrs teidelmann may have clouded for a moment barbaras sunny nature surely there was no reason for this seeing that no one attracted greater attention throughout the dinner than the parlourmaid  where ever did you get her from asked mrs florret barbara having just descended the kitchen stairs  a neathanded phillis commented dr florret with approval  ill take good care she never waits at my table laughed the wife of our minister the rev cottle a broadbuilt breezyvoiced woman mother of eleven eight of them boys  to tell the truth said my mother shes only here temporarily  as a matter of fact said my father we have to thank mrs hasluck for her  dont leave me out of it laughed hasluck cant let the old girl take all the credit  later my father absentmindedly addressed her as my dear at which mrs cottle shot a swift glance towards my mother and before that incident could have been forgotten hasluck when no one was looking pinched her elbow which would not have mattered had not the unexpectedness of it drawn from her an involuntary augh upon which for the reputation of the house and the dinner being then towards its end my mother deemed it better to take the whole company into her confidence naturally the story gained for barbara still greater admiration so that when with the dessert discarding the apron but still wearing the dainty cap which showed wisdom she and the footman took their places among the guests she was even more than before the centre of attention and remark  it was very nice of you said mrs cottle thus completing the circle of compliments and as i always tell my girls that is better than being beautiful  kind hearts added dr florret summing up the case are more than coronets dr florret had ever ready for the occasion the correct quotation but from him somehow it never irritated rather it fell upon the ear as a necessary rounding and completing of the theme like the amen in church  only to my aunt would further observations have occurred  when i was a girl said my aunt breaking suddenly upon the passing silence i used to look into the glass and say to myself fanny youve got to be amiable and i was amiable added my aunt challenging contradiction with a look nobody can say that i wasnt for years  it didnt pay suggested hasluck  it attracted replied my aunt no attention whatever  hasluck had changed places with my mother and having after many experiments learned the correct pitch for conversation with old teidelmann talked with him as much aside as the circumstances of the case would permit hasluck never wasted time on anything else than business it was in his opera box on the first night of verdis aida i am speaking of course of days then to come that he arranged the details of his celebrated deal in guano and even his very religion so i have been told and can believe he varied to suit the enterprise of the moment once during the protracted preliminaries of a cocoa scheme becoming converted to quakerism  but for the most of us interest lay in a discussion between washburn and florret concerning the superior advantages attaching to residence in the east end  as a rule incorrect opinion found itself unable to exist in dr florrets presence as no bird it is said can continue its song once looked at by an owl so all originality grew silent under the cold stare of his disapproving eye but dr fighting hal was no gentle warbler of thought vehement direct indifferent he swept through all polite argument as a strong wind through a murmuring wood carrying his partisans with him further than they meant to go and quite unable to turn back leaving his opponents clinging desperatelyupside down anyhowto their perches angry their feathers much ruffled  life flung out washburndr florret had just laid down unimpeachable rules for the conduct of all mankind on all occasionswhat do you respectable folk know of life you are not men and women you are marionettes you dont move to your natural emotions implanted by god you dance according to the latest book of etiquette you live and love laugh and weep and sin by rule only one moment do you come face to face with life that is in the moment when you die leaving the other puppets to be dressed in black and make believe to cry  it was a favourite subject of denunciation with him the artificiality of us all  little doll he had once called me and i had resented the term  thats all you are little paul he had persisted a good little hardworking doll that does what its made to do and thinks what its made to think we are all dolls your father is a gallanthearted softheaded little doll your mother the sweetest and primmest of dolls and im a silly dissatisfied doll that longs to be a man but hasnt the pluck we are only dolls little paul  hes a triflea trifle whimsical on some subjects explained my father on my repeating this conversation  there are a certain class of men explained my motheryou will meet with them more as you grow upwho talk for talkings sake they dont know what they mean and nobody else does either  but what would you have argued dr florret that every man should do that which is right in his own eyes  far better than like the old man in the fable he should do what every other fool thinks right retorted washburn the other day i called to see whether a patient of mine was still alive or not his wife was washing clothes in the front room hows your husband i asked i think hes dead replied the woman then without leaving off her work jim she shouted are you there no answer came from the inner room hes a goner she said wringing out a stocking  but surely said dr florret you dont admire a woman for being indifferent to the death of her husband  i dont admire her for that replied washburn and i dont blame her i didnt make the world and im not responsible for it what i do admire her for is not pretending a grief she didnt feel in berkeley square shed have met me at the door with an agonised face and a handkerchief to her eyes  assume a virtue if you have it not murmured dr florret  go on said washburn how does it run that monster custom who all sense doth eat of devils habit is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he gives a frock that aptly is put on so was the lions skin by the ass but it showed him only the more an ass here asses go about as asses but there are lions also i had a woman under my hands only a little while ago i could have cured her easily why she got worse every day instead of better i could not understand then by accident learned the truth instead of helping me she was doing all she could to kill herself i must doctor she cried i must i have promised if i get well he will only leave me and if i die now he has sworn to be good to the children here i tell you they livethink their thoughts work their will kill those they hate die for those they love savages if you like but savage men and women not bloodless dolls  i prefer the dolls concluded dr florret  i admit they are pretty answered washburn  i remember said my father the first masked ball i ever went to when i was a student in paris it struck me just as you say hal everybody was so exactly alike i was glad to get out into the street and see faces  but i thought they always unmasked at midnight said the second mrs teidelmann in her soft languid tones  i did not wait explained my father  that was a pity she replied i should have been interested to see what they were like underneath  i might have been disappointed answered my father i agree with dr florret that sometimes the mask is an improvement  barbara was right she was a beautiful woman with a face that would have been singularly winning if one could have avoided the hard cold eyes ever restless behind the halfclosed lids  always she was very kind to me moreover since the disappearance of cissy she was the first to bestow again upon me a good opinion of my small self my mother praised me when i was good which to her was the one thing needful but few of us i fear child or grownup take much pride in our solid virtues finding them generally hindrances to our desires like the oysters pearl of more comfort to the world than to ourselves if others there were who admired me very guardedly must they have kept the secret i would so gladly have shared with them but this new friend of oursor had i not better at once say enemymade me feel when in her presence a person of importance how it was accomplished i cannot explain no word of flattery nor even of mere approval ever passed her lips her charm to me was not that she admired me but that she led me by some mysterious process to admire myself  and yet in spite of this and many lesser kindnesses she showed to me i never really liked her but rather feared her dreading always the sudden raising of those ever halfclosed eyelids  she sat next to my father at the corner of the table her chin resting on her long white hands her sweet lips parted and as often as his eyes were turned away from her her soft low voice would draw them back again once she laid her hand on his laughing the while at some light jest of his and i saw that he flushed and following his quick glance saw that my mothers eyes were watching also  i have spoken of my father only as he then appeared to me a childan older chum with many lines about his mobile mouth the tumbled hair edged round with grey but looking back with older eyes i see him a slightly stooping yet still tall and graceful man with the face of a poetthe face i mean a poet ought to possess but rarely does nature apparently abhorring the obviouswith the shy eyes of a boy and a voice tender as a womans never the dingiest little drab that entered the kitchen but adored him speaking always of the master in tones of fond proprietorship for to the most slatternly his orders had ever the air of requests for favours women i so often read can care for only masterful men but may there not be variety in women as in other species or perhapsif the suggestion be not overdaringthe many writers deeming themselves authorities upon this subject of woman may in this one particular have erred i only know my father spoke to few women whose eyes did not brighten yet hardly should i call him a masterful man  i think its all right whispered hasluck to my father in the passagethey were the last to go what does she think of it eh  i think shell be with us answered my father  nothing like food for bringing people together said hasluck goodnight  the door closed but something had crept into the house it stood between my father and mother it followed them silently up the narrow creaking stairs    chapter vii  of the passing of the shadow  better is little than treasure and trouble therewith better a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith none but a great man would have dared to utter such a glaring commonplace as that not only on sundays now but all the week came the hot joint to table and on every day there was pudding till a body grew indifferent to pudding thus a joygiving luxury of life being lost and but another item added to the long list of uninteresting needs now we could eat and drink without stint no need now to organise for the morrows hash no need now to cut ones bread instead of breaking it thinking of saturdays bread pudding but there the saying fails for never now were we merry a silent unseen guest sat with us at the board so that no longer we laughed and teased as over the half pound of sausages or the two sweetscented herrings but talked constrainedly of empty things that lay outside us  easy enough would it have been for us to move to guilford street occasionally in the spiritless tones in which they now spoke on all subjects save the one my mother and father would discuss the project but always into the conversation would fall sooner or later some loosened thought to stir it to anger and so the aching months went by and the cloud grew  then one day the news came that old teidelmann had died suddenly in his counting house  you are going to her said my mother  i have been sent for said my father i mustit may mean business  my mother laughed bitterly why at the time i could not understand and my father flung out of the house during the many hours that he was away my mother remained locked in her room and stealing sometimes to the door i was sure i heard her crying and that she should grieve so at old teidelmanns death puzzled me  she came oftener to our house after that her mourning added i think to her beauty softeningor seeming to softenthe hardness of her eyes always she was very sweet to my mother who by contrast beside her appeared witless and ungracious and to me whatever her motive she was kindness itself hardly ever arriving without some trifling gift or plan for affording me some childish treat by instinct she understood exactly what i desired and liked the books that would appeal to me as those my mother gave me never did the pleasures that did please me as opposed to the pleasures that should have pleased me often my mother talking to me would chill me with the vista of the life that lay before me a narrow viewless way between twin endless walls of must and must not this softvoiced lady set me dreaming of life as of sunny fields through which one wandered laughing along the winding path of will so that although as i have said there lurked at the bottom of my thoughts a fear of her yet something within me i seemed unable to control went out to her drawn by her subtle sympathy and understanding of it  has he ever seen a pantomime she asked of my father one morning looking at me the while with a whimsical screwing of her mouth  my heart leaped within me my father raised his eyebrows what would your mother say do you think he asked my heart sank  she thinks i replied that theatres are very wicked places it was the first time that any doubt as to the correctness of my mothers judgments had ever crossed my mind  mrs teidelmanns smile strengthened my doubt dear me she said i am afraid i must be very wicked i have always regarded a pantomime as quite a moral entertainment all the bad people go down so very straight towell to the fit and proper place for them and we could promise to leave before the clown stole the sausages couldnt we paul  my mother was called and came and i could not help thinking how insignificant she looked with her pale face and plain dark frock standing stiffly beside this shining lady in her rustling clothes  you will let him come mrs kelver she pleaded in her soft caressing tones its dick whittington you knowsuch an excellent moral  my mother had stood silent clasping and unclasping her hands a childish trick she had when troubled and her lips were trembling important as the matter loomed before my own eyes i wondered at her agitation  i am very sorry said my mother it is very kind of you but i would rather he did not go  just this once persisted mrs teidelmann it is holiday time  a ray of sunlight fell into the room lighting upon her coaxing face making where my mother stood seem shadow  i would rather he did not go repeated my mother and her voice sounded harsh and grating when he is older others must judge for him but for the present he must be guided by mealone  i really dont think there could be any harm maggie urged my father things have changed since we were young  that may be answered my mother still in the same harsh voice it is long ago since then  i didnt intend it that way said my father with a short laugh  i merely meant that i may be wrong answered my mother i seem so old among you allso out of place i have tried to change but i cannot  we will say no more about it said mrs teidelmann sweetly i merely thought it would give him pleasure and he has worked so hard this last term his father tells me  she laid her hand caressingly on my shoulder drawing me a little closer to her and it remained there  it was very kind of you said my mother i would do anything to give him pleasure anythingi could he knows that he understands  my mothers hand i knew was seeking mine but i was angry and would not see and without another word she left the room  my mother did not allude again to the subject but the very next afternoon she took me herself to a hall in the neighbourhood where we saw a magiclantern followed by a conjurer she had dressed herself in a prettier frock than she had worn for many a long day and was brighter and gayer in herself than had lately been her wont laughing and talking merrily but i nursing my wrongs remained moody and sulky at any other time such rare amusement would have overjoyed me but the wonders of the great theatre that from other boys i had heard so much of that from gaudycoloured posters i had built up for myself were floating vague and undefined before me in the air and neither the openmouthed sleeper swallowing his endless chain of rats nor even the live rabbit found in the stout old gentlemans hatthe last sort of person in whose hat one would have expected to find such a thingcould draw away my mind from the joy i had caught a glimpse of only to lose  so we walked home through the muddy darkening streets speaking but little and that night wakingor rather half waking as children doi thought i saw a figure in white crouching at the foot of my bed i must have gone to sleep again and later though i cannot say whether the intervening time was short or long i opened my eyes to see it still there and frightened i cried out and my mother rose from her knees  she laughed a curious broken laugh in answer to my questions it was a silly dream i had she explained i must have been thinking of the conjurer we saw i dreamt that a wicked magician had spirited you away from me i could not find you and was all alone in the world  she put her arms around me so tight as almost to hurt me and thus we remained until again i must have fallen asleep  it was towards the close of these same holidays that my mother and i called upon mrs teidelmann in her great stonebuilt house at clapton she had sent a note round that morning saying she was suffering from terrible headaches that quite took her senses away so that she was unable to come out she would be leaving england in a few days to travel would my mother come and see her she would like to say goodbye to her before she went my mother handed the letter across the table to my father  of course you will go said my father poor girl i wonder what the cause can be she used to be so free from everything of the kind  do you think it well for me to go said my mother what can she have to say to me  oh just to say goodbye answered my father it would look so pointed not to go  it was a dull sombre house without but one entered through its commonplace door as through the weedgrown rock into aladdins cave old teidelmann had been a great collector all his life and his treasures now scattered through a dozen galleries were then heaped there in curious confusion pictures filled every inch of wall stood propped against the wonderful old furniture were even stretched unframed across the ceilings statues gleamed from every corner a few of the statues were i remember the only things out of the entire collection that mrs teidelmann kept for herself carvings embroideries priceless china miniatures framed in gems illuminated missals and gorgeously bound books crowded the room the ugly little thicklipped man had surrounded himself with the beauty of every age brought from every land he himself must have been the only thing cheap and uninteresting to be found within his own walls and now he lay shrivelled up in his coffin under a monument by means of which an unknown cemetery became quite famous  instructions had been given that my mother was to be shown up into mrs teidelmanns boudoir she was lying on a sofa near the fire when we entered asleep dressed in a loose lace robe that fell away showing her thin but snowwhite arms her rich dark hair falling loose about her in sleep she looked less beautiful harder and with a suggestion of coarseness about the face of which at other times it showed no trace my mother said she would wait perhaps mrs teidelmann would awake and the servant closing the door softly left us alone with her  an old french clock standing on the mantelpiece a heart supported by cupids ticked with a muffled soothing sound my mother choosing a chair by the window sat with her eyes fixed on the sleeping womans face and it seemed to methough this may have been but my fancy born of afterthoughtthat a faint smile relaxed for a moment the sleeping womans pained pressed lips neither i nor my mother spoke the only sound in the room being the hushed ticking of the great gilt clock until the other woman after a few slight movements of unrest began to talk in her sleep  only confused murmurs escaped her at first and then i heard her whisper my fathers name very lowhardly more than breathedwere the words but upon the silence each syllable struck clear and distinct ah no we must not luke my darling  my mother rose swiftly from her chair but she spoke in quite matteroffact tones  go paul she said wait for me downstairs and noiselessly opening the door she pushed me gently out and closed it again behind me  it was half an hour or more before she came down and at once we left the house letting ourselves out all the way home my mother never once spoke but walked as one in a dream with eyes that saw not with her hand upon the lock of our gate she came back to life  you must say nothing paul do you understand she said when people are delirious they use strange words that have no meaning do you understand paul you must never breathe a wordnever  i promised and we entered the house and from that day my mothers whole manner changed not another angry word ever again escaped her lips never an angry flash lighted up again her eyes mrs teidelmann remained away three months my father of course wrote to her often for he was managing all her affairs but my mother wrote to her alsothough this my father i do not think knewlong letters that she would go away by herself to pen writing them always in the twilight close to the window  why do you choose this time just when its getting dark to write your letters my father would expostulate when by chance he happened to look into the room let me ring for the lamp you will strain your eyes but my mother would always excuse herself saying she had only a few lines to finish  i can think better in this light she would explain  and when mrs teidelmann returned it was my mother who was the first to call upon her before even my father knew that she was back and from thence onward one might have thought them the closest of friends my mother visiting her often speaking of her to all in terms of praise and liking  in this way peace returned unto the house and my father was tender again in all his words and actions towards my mother and my mother thoughtful as before of all his wants and whims her voice soft and low the sweet smile ever lurking around her lips as in the old days before this evil thing had come to dwell among us and i might have forgotten it had ever cast its blight upon our life but that every day my mother grew feebler the little ways that had seemed a part of her gone from her  the summer came and wentthat time in towns of panting days and stifling nights when through the open window crawls to ones face the hot foul air heavy with reeking odours drawn from a thousand streets when lying awake one seems to hear the fitful breathing of the myriad mass around as of some overlaboured beast too tired to even rest and my mother moved about the house ever more listlessly  theres nothing really the matter with her said dr hal only weakness it is the place cannot you get her away from it  i cannot leave myself said my father just yet but there is no reason why you and the boy should not take a holiday this year i can afford it and later i might possibly join you  my mother consented as she did to all things now and so it came about that again of afternoons we climbedthough more slowly and with many pausesthe steep path to the ruined tower old jacob in his happy foolishness had built upon the headland rested once again upon its topmost platform sheltered from the wind that ever blew about its crumbling walls saw once more the distant mountains faint like spectres and the silent ships that came and vanished and about our feet the pleasant farm lands and the grave sweet river  we had taken lodgings in the village smaller now it seemed than previously but wonderful its sunny calm after the turmoil of the fierce dark streets mrs fursey was there still but quite another than the mrs fursey of my remembrance a still angular but cheery dame bent no longer on suppressing me but rather on drawing me out before admiring neighbours as one saying the material was unpromising as you know there were times when i almost despaired but with patience andmay i say a natural gift that wayyou see what can be accomplished and anna now a buxom wife and mother with an uncontrollable desire to fall upon and kiss me at most unexpected moments necessitating a never sleeping watchfulness on my part and a choosing of positions affording means of ready retreat and old chumbley still cobbling shoes in his tiny cave on the bench before him in a row they sat and watched him while he tapped and tapped and hammered pert little shoes piping be quick be quick we want to be toddling you seem to have no idea my good man how much toddling there is to be done dapper boots sighing oh please make haste we are waiting to dance and to strut jack walks in the lane jill waits by the gate oh deary how slowly he taps stout sober boots saying as soon as you can old friend remember weve work to do flatfooted old boots rusty and limp mumbling we havent much time mr chumbley just a patch that is all we havent much further to go and old joe still peddling his pack with the help of the same old jokes and tom pinfold still puzzled and scratching his head the rejected fish still hanging by its tail from his expostulating hand one might almost have imagined it the same fish grownup folks had changed but little only the foolish children had been playing tricks parties i had left mere sucking babes now swaggering in pinafore or knickerbocker children i had known now mincing it as men and women such affectation annoyed me  one afternoonit was towards the close of the last week of our staymy mother and i had climbed as was so often our wont to the upper platform of old jacobs tower my mother leant upon the parapet her eyes fixed dreamingly upon the distant mountains and a smile crept to her lips  what are you thinking of i asked  oh only of things that happened over thereshe nodded her head towards the distant hills as to some old crony with whom she shares secretswhen i was a girl  you lived there long ago didnt you when you were young i asked boys do not always stop to consider whether their questions might or might not be better expressed  youre very rude said my motherit was long since a tone of her old self had rung from her in answer to any touch it was a very little while ago  suddenly she raised her head and listened perhaps some twenty seconds she remained so with her lips parted and then from the woods came a faint longdrawn cooee we ran to the side of the tower commanding the pathway from the village and waited until from among the dark pines my father emerged into the sunlight  seeing us he shouted again and waved his stick and from the light of his eyes and his gallant bearing and the spring of his step across the heathery turf we knew instinctively that trouble had come upon him he always rose to meet it with that look and air it was the old norse blood in his veins i suppose so one imagines must those godless old pirates have sprung to their feet when the north wind loosed as a hawk from the leash struck at the beaked prow  we heard his quick step on the rickety stair and the next moment he was between us breathing a little hard but laughing  he stood for awhile beside my mother without speaking both of them gazing at the distant hills among which as my mother had explained things had happened long ago and maybe over there their memories met and looked upon each other with kind eyes  do you remember said my father we climbed up hereit was the first walk we took together after coming here we discussed our plans for the future how we would retrieve our fortunes  and the future answered my mother has a way of making plans for us instead  it would seem so replied my father with a laugh i am an unlucky beggar maggie i dropped all your money as well as my own down that wretched mine  it was the willit was fate or whatever you call it said my mother you could not help that luke  if only that damned pump hadnt jambed said my father  do you remember that mrs tharand asked my mother  yes what of her  a worldly woman i always thought her she called on me the morning we were leaving i dont think you saw her ive been through more worries than you would think to look at me she said to me laughing ive always remembered her words and of all the troubles that come to us in this world believe me mrs kelver money troubles are the easiest to bear  i wish i could think so said my father  she rather irritated me at the time continued my mother i thought it one of those commonplaces with which we console ourselves for other peoples misfortunes but now i know she spoke the truth  there was silence between them for awhile then said my father in a cheery tone  ive broken with old hasluck  i thought you would be compelled to sooner or later answered my mother  hasluck exclaimed my father with sudden vehemence is little better than a thief i told him so  what did he say asked my mother  laughed and said that was better than some people  my father laughed himself  i wish to do the memory of noel hasluck no injustice ever was he a kind friend to me not only then but in later years when having come to learn that kindness is rarer in the world than i had dreamt i was glad of it added to which if only for barbaras sake i would prefer to write of him throughout in terms of praise yet even were his goodtempered thickskinned ghost and unless it were goodtempered and thickskinned it would be no true ghost of old noel hasluck to be reading over my shoulder the words as i write them down i think it would agree with mei do not think it would be offended with me for ever in his life he was an admirer and a lover of the truth being one of those good fighters capable of respecting even his foe his enemy against whom from ten to four occasionally a little later he fought right valiantly for saying that of all the men who go down into the city each day in a cab or bus or train he was perhaps one of the most unprincipled and whether that be saying much or little i leave to those with more knowledge to decide  to do others as it was his conviction right or wrong that they would do him if ever he gave them half a chance was his notion of business and in most of his transactions he was successful i play a game he would argue where cheating is the rule nine out of every ten men round the table are sharpers like myself and the tenth man is a fool who has no business to be there we prey upon each other and the cutest of us is the winner  but the innocent people lured by your fine promises i ventured once to suggest to him the widows and the orphans  my dear lad he said with a laugh laying his fat hand upon my shoulder i remember one of your widows writing me a pathetic letter about some shares she had taken in a silver company of mine lord knows where the mine is nowsomewhere in spain i think it looked as though all her savings were gone she had an only son and it was nearly all they possessed in the world etc etcyou know the sort of thing well i did what ive often been numskull enough to do in similar cases wrote and offered to buy her out at par a week later she answered thanking me but saying it did not matter there had occurred a momentary rise and she had sold out at a profitto her own brotherinlaw as i discovered happening to come across the transfers you can find widows and orphans round the monte carlo card tables if you like to look for them they are no more deserving of consideration than the rest of the crowd besides if it comes to that im an orphan myself and he laughed again one of his deep hearty honest laughs no one ever possessed a laugh more suggestive in its every cadence of simple transparent honesty he used to say himself it was worth thousands to him  better from the moralists point of view had such a man been an outandout rogue then might one have pointed crying behold dishonesty as you will observe in the person of our awful example to be hated needs but to be seen but the duty of the chronicler is to bear witness to what he knows leaving truth with the whole case before her to sum up and direct the verdict in the city old hasluck had a bad reputation and deserved it in stokenewingtonthen a green suburb containing many fine old houses standing in great wooded gardenshe was loved and respected in his business he was a man void of all moral sense without bowels of compassion for any living thing in retirement a man with a strong sense of duty and a fine regard for the rights and feelings of others never happier than when planning to help or give pleasure in his office he would have robbed his own mother at home he would have spent his last penny to add to her happiness or comfort i make no attempt to explain i only know that such men do exist and that hasluck was one of them one avoids difficulties by dismissing them as a product of our curiously complex civilisationa convenient phrase let us hope the recording angel may be equally impressed by it  casting about for some reason of excuse to myself for my liking of him i hit upon the expedient of regarding him as a modern robin hood whom we are taught to admire without shame a robin hood up to date adapted to the changed conditions of modern environment making his living relieving the rich taking pleasure relieving the poor  what will you do asked my mother  i shall have to give up the office answered my father without him theres not enough to keep it going he was quite goodtempered about the matteroffered to divide the work letting me retain the straightforward portion for whatever that might be worth but i declined now i know i feel i would rather have nothing more to do with him  i think you were quite right agreed my mother  what i blame myself for said my father is that i didnt see through him before of course he has been making a mere tool of me from the beginning i ought to have seen through him why didnt i  they discussed the future or rather my father discussed my mother listening in silence stealing a puzzled look at him from time to time as though there were something she could not understand  he would take a situation in the city one had been offered him it might sound poor but it would be a steady income on which we must contrive to live the little money he had saved must be kept for investmentsnothing speculativejudicious dealings by means of which a cool clearheaded man could soon accumulate capital here the training acquired by working for old hasluck would serve him well one man my father knewquite a dull commonplace manstarting a few years ago with only a few hundreds was now worth tens of thousands foresight was the necessary qualification you watched the tendency of things so often had my father said to himself this is going to be a big thing that other it is no good and in every instance his prognostications had been verified he had felt it some men had that gift now was the time to use it for practical purposes  here said my father breaking off and casting an approving eye upon the surrounding scenery would be a pleasant place to end ones days the house you had was very pretty and you liked it we might enlarge it the drawingroom might be thrown outperhaps another wing i felt that our good fortune as from this day was at last established  but my mother had been listening with growing impatience her puzzled glances giving place gradually to flashes of anger and now she turned her face full upon him her question written plainly thereon demanding answer  some idea of it i had even then watching her and since i have come to read it word for word but that womanthat woman that loves you that you love ah i knowwhy do you play with me she is rich with her your life will be smooth and the boyit will be better far for him cannot you three wait a little longer what more can i do cannot you see that i am surely dyingdying as quickly as i candying as that poor creature your friend once told us of knowing it was the only thing she could do for those she loved be honest with me i am no longer jealous all that is past a man is ever younger than a woman and a man changes i do not blame you it is for the best she and i have talked it is far better so only be honest with me or at least silent will you not honour me enough for even that  my father did not answer having that to speak of that put my mothers question out of her mind for all time so that until the end no word concerning that other woman passed again between them twenty years later nearly i myself happened to meet her and then long physical suffering had chased the wantonness away for ever from the painworn mouth but in that hour of waning voices as some trouble of the fretful day when evening falls so she faded from their life and if even the remembrance of her returned at times to either of them i think it must have been in those moments when for no seeming reason shyly their hands sought one another  so the truth of the sad adohow far my mothers suspicions wronged my father for the eye of jealousy and what loving woman ever lived that was not jealous has its optic nerve terminating not in the brain but in the heart which was not constructed for the reception of true visioni never knew later long after the curtain of green earth had been rolled down upon the players i spoke once on the matter with doctor hal who must have seen something of the play and with more understanding eyes than mine and who thereupon delivered to me a short lecture on life in general a performance at which he excelled  flee from temptation and pray that you may be delivered from evil shouted the doctorhis was not the socratic methodbut remember this that as sure as the sparks fly upward there will come a time when however fast you run you will be overtakencorneredno one to deliver you but yourselfthe gods sitting round interested it is a grim fight for the thing you may be sure has chosen its right moment and every woman in the world will sympathise with you and be just to you not even despising you should you be overcome for however they may talk every woman in the world knows that male and female cannot be judged by the same standard to woman nature and the law speak with one voice sin not lest you be cursed of your sex it is no law of man it is the law of creation when the woman sins she sins not only against her conscience but against her every instinct but to the man nature whispers yield it is the law alone that holds him back therefore every woman in the world knowing this will be just to youevery woman in the world but onethe woman that loves you from her hope for no sympathy hope for no justice  then you think i began  i think said the doctor that your father loved your mother devotedly but he was one of those fighters that for the first halfdozen rounds or so cause their backers much anxiety it is a dangerous method  then you think my mother  i think your mother was a good woman paul and the good woman will never be satisfied with man till the lord lets her take him to pieces and put him together herself  my father had been pacing to and fro the tiny platform now he came to a halt opposite my mother placing his hands upon her shoulders  i want you to help me maggiehelp me to be brave i have only a year or two longer to live and theres a lot to be done in that time  slowly the anger died out of my mothers face  you remember that fall i had when the cage broke my father went on andrews as you know feared from the first it might lead to that but i always laughed at him  how long have you known my mother asked  oh about six months i felt it at the beginning of the year but i didnt say anything to washburn till a month later i thought it might be only fancy  and he is sure  my father nodded  but why have you never told me  because replied my father with a laugh i didnt want you to know if i could have done without you i should not have told you now  and at this there came a light into my mothers face that never altogether left it until the end  she drew him down beside her on the seat i had come nearer and my father stretching out his hand would have had me with them but my mother putting her arms about him held him close to her as though in that moment she would have had him to herself alone    chapter viii  how the man in grey made ready for his going  the eighteen months that followedfor the end came sooner than we had expectedwere i think the happiest days my father and mother had ever known or if happy be not altogether the right word let me say the most beautiful and most nearly perfect to them it was as though god in his sweet thoughtfulness had sent death to knock lightly at the door saying not yet you have still a little longer to be together in a little while in those last days all things false and meaningless they laid aside nothing was of real importance to them but that they should love each other comforting each other learning to understand each other again we lived poorly but there was now no pitiful straining to keep up appearances no haunting terror of what the neighbours might think the petty cares and worries concerning matters not worth a moments thought the mean desires and fears with which we disfigure ourselves fell from them there came to them broader thought a wider charity a deeper pity their love grew greater even than their needs overflowing towards at things sometimes recalling these months it has seemed to me that we make a mistake seeking to keep death gods gobetween ever from our thoughts is it not closing the door to a friend who would help us would we let him for who knows life so well whispering to us in a little while only a little longer that you have to be together is it worth taking so much thought for self is it worth while being unkind  from them a graciousness emanated pervading all around even my aunt fan decided for the second time in her career to give amiability a trial this intention she announced publicly to my mother and myself one afternoon soon after our return from devonshire  im a beast of an old woman said my aunt suddenly  dont say that fan urged my mother  whats the good of saying dont say it when ive just said it snapped back my aunt  its your manner explained my mother people sometimes think you disagreeable  theyd be daft if they didnt interrupted my aunt of course you dont really mean it continued my mother  stuff and nonsense snorted my aunt does she think im a fool i like being disagreeable i like to see em squirming  my mother laughed  i can be agreeable continued my aunt if i choose nobody more so  then why not choose suggested my mother i tried it once said my aunt and it fell flat nothing could have fallen flatter  it may not have attracted much attention replied my mother with a smile but one should not be agreeable merely to attract attention  it wasnt only that returned my aunt it was that it gave no satisfaction to anybody it didnt suit me a disagreeable person is at their best when they are disagreeable  i can hardly agree with you there answered my mother  i could do it again communed my aunt to herself there was a suggestion of vindictiveness in her tones its easy enough look at the sort of fools that are agreeable  im sure you could be if you tried urged my mother  let em have it continued my aunt still to herself thats the way to teach em sense let em have it  and strange though it may seem my aunt was right and my mother altogether wrong my father was the first to notice the change  nothing the matter with poor old fan is there he asked it was one evening a day or two after my aunt had carried her threat into effect nothing happened has there  no answered my mother nothing that i know of  her manner is so strange explained my father soso weird  my mother smiled dont say anything to her shes trying to be agreeable  my father laughed and then looked wistful i almost wish she wouldnt he remarked we were used to it and she was rather amusing  but my aunt being a woman of will kept her way and about the same time that occurred tending to confirm her in her new departure this was the introduction into our small circle of james wellington gadley properly speaking it should have been wellington james that being the order in which he had been christened in the year 1815 but in course of time and particularly during his school career it had been borne in upon him that wellington is a burdensome name for a commonplace mortal to bear and very wisely he had reversed the arrangement he was a slightly pompous but simpleminded little old gentleman very proud of his position as head clerk to mr stillwood the solicitor to whom my father was now assistant stillwood waterhead and royal dated back to the georges and was a firm bound up with the historyoccasionally shadyof aristocratic england true in these later years its glory was dwindling old mr stillwood its sole surviving representative declined to be troubled with new partners explaining frankly in answer to all applications that the business was a dying one and that attempting to work it up again would be but putting new wine into wornout skins but though its clientele was a yearly diminishing quantity much business yet remained to it and that of a good class its name being still a synonym for solid respectability and my father had deemed himself fortunate indeed in securing such an appointment james gadley had entered the firm as office boy in the days of its pride and had never awakened to the fact that it was not still the most important legal firm within the half mile radius from lombard street nothing delighted him more than to discuss over and over again the many strange affairs in which stillwood waterhead and royal had been concerned all of which he had at his tongues tip could he find a hearer these he would reargue interminably but with professional reticence personages becoming mr y and lady x and places the capital of let us say a foreign country or a certain town not a thousand miles from where we are now sitting the majority of his friends his methods being somewhat forensic would seek to discourage him but my aunt was a never wearied listener especially if the case were one involving suspicion of mystery and crime when during their very first conversation he exclaimed now whywhy after keeping away from his wife for nearly eighteen years never even letting her know whether he was alive or dead why this sudden resolve to return to her that is what i want explained to me he paused as was his wont for sympathetic comment my aunt instead of answering as others with a yawn oh im sure i dont know felt he wanted to see her i suppose replied with prompt intelligence  to murder herby slow poison  to murder her but why  in order to marry the other woman  what other woman  the woman he had just met and fallen in love with before that it was immaterial to him what had become of his wife this woman had said to him come back to me a free man or never see my face again  dear me now thats very curious  nothing of the sort plain common sense  i mean its curious because as a matter of fact his wife did die a little later and he did marry again  told you so remarked my aunt  in this way every case in the stillwood annals was reviewed and light thrown upon it by my aunts insight into the hidden springs of human action fortunate that the actors remained mere mr x and lady y for into the most innocent seeming behaviour my aunt read ever dark criminal intent  i think you are a little too severe mr gadley would now and then plead  were all of us miserable sinners my aunt would cheerfully affirm only we dont all get the same chances  an elderly maiden lady a miss z residing in a western town once famous as the resort of fashion but which we will not name my aunt was convinced had burnt down a house containing a will and forged another under which her childrenshould she ever marry and be blessed with suchwould inherit among them on coming of age a fortune of seven hundred pounds  the freshness of her views on this his favourite topic always fascinated mr gadley  i have to thank you maam he would remark on rising for a most delightful conversation i may not be able to agree with your conclusions but they afford food for reflection  to which my aunt would reply i hate talking to any one who agrees with me its like taking a walk to see ones own lookingglass id rather talk to somebody who didnt even if he were a fool which for her was gracious  he was a stout little gentleman with a stomach that protruded about a foot in front of him and of this he appeared to be quite unaware nor would it have mattered had it not been for his desire when talking to approach as close to his listener as possible gradually in the course of conversation his stomach acting as a gentle battering ram he would in this way drive you backwards round the room sometimes unless you were artful pinning you hopelessly into a corner when it would surprise him that in spite of all his efforts he never succeeded in getting any nearer to you his first evening at our house he was talking to my aunt from the corner of his chair as he grew more interested so he drew his chair nearer and nearer till at length having withdrawn inch by inch to avoid his encroachments my aunt was sitting on the extreme edge of her own his next move sent her on to the floor she said nothing which surprised me but on the occasion of his next visit she was busy darning stockings an unusual occupation for her he approached nearer and nearer as before but this time she sat her ground and it was he who in course of time sprang back with an exclamation foreign to the subject under discussion  ever afterwards my aunt met him with stockings in her hand and they talked with a space between their chairs  nothing further came of it though his being a widower added to their intercourse that spice of possibility no woman is ever too old to relish but that he admired her intellectually was evident once he even went so far as to exclaim miss davies you should have been a solicitors wife to his thinking the crown of feminine ambition to which my aunt had replied chances are i should have been if one had ever asked me and warmed by appreciation my aunts amiability took root and flourished though assuming as all growth developed late is apt to fantastic shape  there came to her the idea by no means illfounded that by flattery one can most readily render oneself agreeable so conscientiously she set to work to flatter in season and out i am sure she meant to give pleasure but the effect produced was that of thinly veiled sarcasm  my father would relate to us some trifling story some incident noticed during the day that had seemed to him amusing at once she would break out into enthusiasm holding up her hands in astonishment  what a funny man he is and to think that it comes to him naturally without an effort what a gift it is  on my mother appearing in a new bonnet or an old one retrimmed an event not unfrequent for in these days my mother took more thought than ever formerly for her appearance you will understand you women who have loved she would step back in simulated amazement  dont tell me its a married woman with a boy getting on for fourteen its a girl a saucy tripping girl thats what it is  persons have been known i believe whose vanity not checked in time has grown into a hopeless disease but i am inclined to think that a dose of my aunt about this period would have cured the most obstinate case  so also and solely for our benefit she assumed a vivacity and spriteliness that ill suited her that having regard to her age and tendency towards rheumatism must have cost her no small effort from these experiences there remains to me the perhaps immoral opinion that virtue in common with all other things is at her best when unassuming  occasionally the old adamor should one say evewould assert itself in my aunt and then still thoughtful for others she would descend into the kitchen and be disagreeable to amy our new servitor who never minded it amy was a philosopher who reconciled herself to all things by the reflection that there were only twentyfour hours in a day it sounds a dismal theory but from it amy succeeded in extracting perpetual cheerfulness my mother would apologise to her for my aunts interference  lord bless you mum it dont matter if i wasnt listening to her something else worse might be happening everythings all the same when its over  amy had come to us merely as a stop gap explaining to my mother that she was about to be married and desired only a temporary engagement to bridge over the few weeks between then and the ceremony  its rather unsatisfactory had said my mother i dislike changes  i can quite understand it mum had replied amy i dislike em myself only i heard you were in a hurry and i thought maybe that while you were on the lookout for somebody permanent  so on that understanding she came a month later my mother asked her when she thought the marriage would actually take place  dont think im wishing you to go explained my mother indeed id like you to stop i only want to know in time to make my arrangements  oh some time in the spring i expect was amys answer  oh said my mother i understood it was coming off almost immediately  amy appeared shocked  i must know a little bit more about him before i go as far as that she said  but i dont understand said my mother you told me when you came to me that you were going to be married in a few weeks  oh that one her tone suggested that an unfair strain was being put upon her memory i didnt feel i wanted him as much as i thought i did when it came to the point  you had meantime met the other one suggested my mother with a smile  well we cant help our feelings can we mum admitted amy frankly and what i always say isshe spoke as one with experience even thenbetter change your mind before its too late afterwards  amiable sweetfaced broadhearted amy most faithful of friends but oh most faithless of lovers age has not withered nor custom staled her liking for infinite variety butchers bakers soldiers sailors jacks of all trades does the sighing procession never pass before you amy pointing ghostly fingers of reproach still amy is engaged to whom at the particular moment i cannot say but i fancy to an early one who has lately become a widower after more exact knowledge i do not care to enquire for to confess ignorance on the subject implying that one has treated as a triviality and has forgotten the most important detail of a matter that to her is of vital importance is to hurt her feelings while to angle for information is but to entangle oneself to speak of him as tom when tom has belonged for weeks to the dead and buried past to hastily correct oneself to dick when there hasnt been a dick for years clearly not to know that he is now harry annoys her even more in my mothers time we always referred to him as dearest it was the title with which she herself distinguished them all and it avoided confusion  well and hows dearest my mother would enquire opening the door to amy on the sunday evening  oh very well indeed mum thank you and he sends you his respects or well not so nicely as i could wish im a little anxious about him poor dear  when you are married you will be able to take good care of him  thats really what he wantssome one to take care of him its what they all want the poor dears  and when is it coming off  in the spring mum she always chose the spring when possible  amy was nice to all men and to amy all men were nice could she have married a dozen she might have settled down with only occasional regrets concerning those left without in the cold but to ask her to select only one out of so many poor dears was to suggest shameful waste of affection  we had meant to keep our grim secret to ourselves but to hide ones troubles long from amy was like keeping cold hands from the fire very soon she knew everything that was to be known drawing it all from my mother as from some overburdened child then she put my mother down into a chair and stood over her  now you leave the house and everything connected with it to me mum commanded amy youve got something else to do  and from that day we were in the hands of amy and had nothing else to do but praise the lord for his goodness  barbara also found out from washburn i expect though she said nothing but came often old hasluck would have come himself i am sure had he thought he would be welcome as it was he always sent kind messages and presents of fruit and flowers by barbara and always welcomed me most heartily whenever she allowed me to see her home  she brought as ever sunshine with her making all trouble seem far off and shadowy my mother tended to the fire of love but barbara lit the cheerful lamp of laughter  and with the lessening days my father seemed to grow younger life lying lighter on him  one summers night he and i were walking with barbara to poplar station for sometimes when he was not looking tired she would order him to fetch his hat and stick explaining to him with a caress i like them tall and slight and full grown the young ones they dont know how to flirt we will take the boy with us as gooseberry and he pretending to be anxious that my mother did not see would kiss her hand and slip out quietly with her arm linked under his it was admirable the way he would enter into the spirit of the thing  the last cloud faded from before the moon as we turned the corner and even the east india dock road lay restful in front of us  i have always regarded myself said my father as a failure in life and it has troubled me i felt him pulled the slightest little bit away from me as though barbara who held his other arm had drawn him towards her with a swift pressure but do you know the idea that has come to me within the last few months that on the whole i have been successful i am like a man continued my father who in some deep wood has been frightened thinking he has lost his way and suddenly coming to the end of it finds that by some lucky chance he has been guided to the right point after all i cannot tell you what a comfort it is to me  what is the right point asked barbara  ah that i cannot tell you answered my father with a laugh i only know that for me it is here where i am all the time i thought i was wandering away from it i was drawing nearer to it it is very wonderful i am just where i ought to be if i had only known i never need have worried  whether it would have troubled either him or my mother very much even had it been otherwise i cannot say for life so small a thing when looked at beside death seemed to have lost all terror for them but be that as it may i like to remember that fortune at the last was kind to my father prospering his adventures not to the extent his sanguine nature had dreamt but sufficiently so that no fear for our future marred the peaceful passing of his tender spirit  or should i award thanks not to fate but rather to sweet barbara and behind her do i not detect shameless old hasluck grinning goodnaturedly in the background  now uncle luke i want your advice dads given me this cheque as a birthday present i dont want to spend it how shall i invest it  my dear why not consult your father  now uncle luke dads a dear especially after dinner but you and i know him giving me a present is one thing doing business for me is another hed unload on me hed never be able to resist the temptation  my father would suggest and barbara would thank him but a minute later would murmur you dont know anything about argentinos  my father did not but barbara did to quite a remarkable extent for a young girl  that child has insisted on leaving this cheque with me and i have advised her to buy argentinos my father would observe after she was gone i am going to put a few hundreds into them myself i hope they will turn out all right if only for her sake i have a presentiment somehow that they will  a month later barbara would greet him with isnt it lucky we bought argentinos  yes they havent turned out badly have they i had a feeling you know for argentinos  youre a genius uncle luke and now we will sell out and buy calcuttas wont we  sell out but why  you said so you said we will sell out in about a month and be quite safe  my dear ive no recollection of it  but barbara had and before she had done with him so had he and the next day argentinos would be soldnot any too soonand calcuttas bought  could money so gained bring a blessing with it the question would plague my father  its very much like gambling he would mutter uneasily to himself at each success uncommonly like gambling  it is for your mother he would impress upon me when she is gone paul put it aside keep it for doing good that may make it clean start your own life without any help from it  he need not have troubled it went the road that all luck derived however indirectly from old hasluck ever went yet it served good purpose on its way  but the most marvellous feat to my thinking ever accomplished by barbara was the bearing off of my father and mother to witness a voice from the grave or the power of love new and original drama in five acts and thirteen tableaux  they had been bred in a narrow creed both my father and my mother that puritan blood flowed in their veins that throughout our land has drowned much harmless joyousness yet those who know of it only from hearsay do foolishly to speak but ill of it if ever earnest times should come again not how to enjoy but how to live being the question fate demanding of us to show not what we have but what we are we may regret that they are fewer among us than formerly those who trained themselves to despise all pleasure because in pleasure they saw the subtlest foe to principle and duty no graceful growth this puritanism for its roots are in the hard stern facts of life but it is strong and from it has sprung all that is worth preserving in the anglosaxon character its men feared and its women loved god and if their words were harsh their hearts were tender if they shut out the sunshine from their lives it was that their eyes might see better the glory lying beyond and if their view be correct that earths threescore years and ten are but as preparation for eternity then who shall call them even foolish for turning away their thoughts from its allurements  still i think i should like to have a look at one just to see what it is like argued my father one cannot judge of a thing that one knows nothing about  i imagine it was his first argument rather than his second that convinced my mother  that is true she answered i remember how shocked my poor father was when he found me one night at the bedroom window reading sir walter scott by the light of the moon  what about the boy said my father for i had been included in the invitation  we will all be wicked together said my mother  so an evening or two later the four of us stood at the corner of pigott street waiting for the bus  it is a close evening said my father lets go the whole hog and ride outside  in those days for a lady to ride outside a bus was as in these days for a lady to smoke in public surely my mothers guardian angel must have betaken himself off in a huff  will you keep close behind and see to my skirt answered my mother commencing preparations if you will remember that these were the days of crinolines that the knifeboards of omnibuses were then approached by a perpendicular ladder the rungs two feet apart you will understand the necessity for such precaution  which of us was the most excited throughout that long ride it would be difficult to say barbara feeling keenly her responsibility as prompter and leader of the dread enterprise sat anxious as she explained to us afterwards hoping there would be nothing shocking in the play nothing to belie its innocent title pleased with her success so far yet still fearful of failure doubtful till the last moment lest we should suddenly repent and stopping the bus flee from the wrath to come my father was the youngest of us all compared with him i was sober and contained he fidgeted people remarked upon it he hummed but for the stern eye of a thin young man sitting next to him trying to read a paper i believe he would have broken out into song every minute he would lean across to enquire of my mother how are you feelingall right to which my mother would reply with a nod and a smile she sat very silent herself clasping and unclasping her hands as for myself i remember feeling so sorry for the crowds that passed us on their way home it was sad to think of the long dull evening that lay before them i wondered how they could face it  our seats were in the front row of the upper circle the lights were low and the house only half full when we reached them  it seems very orderly andand respectable whispered my mother there seemed a touch of disappointment in her tone  we are rather early replied barbara it will be livelier when the band comes in and they turn up the gas  but even when this happened my mother was not content there is so little room for the actors she complained  it was explained to her that the green curtain would go up that the stage lay behind  so we waited my mother sitting stiffly on the extreme edge of her seat holding me tightly by the hand i believe with some vague idea of flight should out of that vaultscented gloom the devil suddenly appear to claim us for his own but before the curtain was quite up she had forgotten him  you poor folk that go to the theatre a dozen times a year perhaps oftener what do you know of plays you see no drama you see but middleaged mr brown churchwarden payer of taxes foolishly pretending to be a brigand miss jones daughter of old jones the chemist making believe to be a haughty princess how can you a grown man waste money on a seat to witness such tomfoolery what we saw was something very different a young and beautiful girltrue not a lady by birth being merely the daughter of an honest yeoman but one equal in all the essentials of womanhood to the noblest in the landsuffered before our very eyes an amount of misfortune that had one not seen it for oneself one would never have believed fate could have accumulated upon the head of any single individual beside her woes our own poor troubles sank into insignificance we had used to grieve as my mother in a whisper reminded my father if now and again we had not been able to afford meat for dinner this poor creature driven even from her wretched attic compelled to wander through the snow without so much as an umbrella to protect her had not even a crust to eat and yet never lost her faith in providence it was a lesson as my mother remarked afterwards that she should never forget and virtue had been triumphant let shallow cynics say what they will had we not proved it with our own senses the villaini think his christian name if one can apply the word christian in connection with such a fiend was jasperhad never really loved the heroine he was incapable of love my mother had felt this before he had been on the stage five minutes and my fatherin spite of protests from callous people behind who appeared to be utterly indifferent to what was going on under their very noseshad agreed with her what he was in love with was her fortunethe fortune that had been left to her by her uncle in australia but about which nobody but the villain knew anything had she swerved a hairs breadth from the course of almost supernatural rectitude had her love for the hero ever weakened her belief in himin spite of damning evidence to the contraryfor a moment wavered then wickedness might have triumphed how at times knowing all the facts but helpless to interfere we trembled lest deceived by the cruel lies the villain told her she should yield to importunity how we thrilled when in language eloquent though rude she flung his false love back into his teeth yet still we feared we knew well that it was not the hero who had done the murder poor dear as amy would have called him he was quite incapable of doing anything requiring onehalf as much smartness we knew that it was not he poor innocent lamb who had betrayed the lady with the french accent we had heard her on the subject and had formed a very shrewd conjecture but appearances we could not help admitting were terribly to his disfavour the circumstantial evidence against him would have hanged an archbishop could she in face of it still retain her faith there were moments when my mother restrained with difficulty her desire to rise and explain  between the acts barbara would whisper to her that she was not to mind because it was only a play and that everything would be sure to come right in the end  i know my dear my mother would answer laughing it is very foolish of me i forget paul when you see me getting excited you must remind me  but of what use was i in such case i who only by holding on to the arms of my seat could keep myself from swarming down on to the stage to fling myself between this noble damsel and her persecutorthis fairhaired creamy angel in whose presence for the time being i had forgotten even barbara  the end came at last the uncle from australia was not dead the villainbungler as well as knavehad killed the wrong man somebody of no importance whatever as a matter of fact the comic man himself was the uncle from australiahad been so all along my mother had had a suspicion of this from the very first she told us so three times to make up i suppose for not having mentioned it before how we cheered and laughed in spite of the tears in our eyes  by pure accident it happened to be the first night of the piece and the author in response to much shouting and whistling came before the curtain he was fat and looked commonplace but i deemed him a genius and my mother said he had a good face and waved her handkerchief wildly while my father shouted bravo long after everybody else had finished and people round about muttered packed house which i didnt understand at the time but came to later  and stranger still it happened to be before that very same curtain that many years later i myself stepped forth to make my first bow as a playwright i saw the house but dimly for on such occasion ones vision is apt to be clouded all that i saw clearly was in the front row of the second circlea sweet face laughing though the tears were in her eyes and she waved to me a handkerchief and on one side of her stood a gallant gentleman with merry eyes who shouted bravo and on the other a dreamylooking lad but he appeared disappointed having expected better work from me and the fourth face i could not see for it was turned away from me  barbara determined on completeness insisted upon supper in those days respectability fed at home but one resort possible there was an eatinghouse with some pretence to gaiety behind st clement danes and to that she led us it was a long narrow room divided into wooden compartments after the old coffeehouse plan a gangway down the centre now we should call it a dismal hole and closing the door hasten away but to adam eve in her sunday figleaves was a stylishly dressed woman and to my eyes with its gilded mirrors and its flaring gas the place seemed a palace  barbara ordered oysters a fish that familiarity with its empty shell had made me curious concerning truly no spot on the globe is so rich in oyster shells as the east end of london a stranger might be led to the impression erroneous that the customary lunch of the east end labourer consists of oysters how they collect there in such quantities is a mystery though washburn to whom i once presented the problem found no difficulty in solving it to his own satisfaction to the rich man the oyster to the poor man the shell thus are the creators gifts divided among all his creatures none being sent empty away for drink the others had stout and i had ginger beer the waiter who called me sir advised against this mixture but among us all the dominating sentiment by this time was that nothing really mattered very much afterwards my father called for a cigar and boldly lighted it though my mother looked anxious and fortunately perhaps it would not draw and then it came out that he himself had once written a play  you never told me of that complained my mother  it was a long while ago replied my father nothing came of it  it might have been a success said my mother you always had a gift for writing  i must look it over again said my father i had quite forgotten it i have an impression it wasnt at all bad  it can be of much help said my mother a good play it makes one think  we put barbara into a cab and rode home ourselves inside a bus my mother was tired so my father slipped his arm round her telling her to lean against him and soon she fell asleep with her head upon his shoulder a coarselooking wench sat opposite her mans arm round her likewise and she also fell asleep her powdered face against his coat  they can do with a bit of nursing cant they said the man with a grin to the conductor  ah theyre just kids agreed the conductor sympathetically thats what they are all of em just kids  so the day ended but oh the emptiness of the morrow life without a crime without a single noble sentiment to brighten itno comic uncles no creamy angels oh the barrenness and dreariness of life even my mother at moments was quite irritable  we were much together again my father and i about this time often making my way from school into the city i would walk home with him he leaning on each occasion a little heavier upon my arm to this day i can always meet and walk with him down the commercial road and on saturday afternoons crossing the river to greenwich we would climb the hill and sit there talking or sometimes merely thinking together watching the dim vast city so strangely still and silent at our feet  at first i did not grasp the fact that he was dying the year to two of life that washburn had allowed to him had somehow become converted in my mind to vague years a fate with no immediate meaning the meanwhile he himself appeared to grow from day to day in buoyancy how could i know it was his great heart rising to his need  the comprehension came to me suddenly it was one afternoon in early spring i was on my way to the city to meet him the holborn viaduct was then in building and the traffic round about was in consequence always much disorganised the bus on which i was riding became entangled in a block at the corner of snow hill and for ten minutes we had been merely crawling one joint of a long sinuous serpent moving by short painful jerks it came to me while i was sitting there with a sharp spasm of physical pain i jumped from the bus and began to run and the terror and the hurt of it grew with every step i ran as if i feared he might be dead before i could reach the office he was waiting for me with a smile as usual and i flung myself sobbing into his arms  i think he understood though i could explain nothing but that i had had a fear something had happened to him for from that time forward he dropped all reserve with me and talked openly of our approaching parting  it might have come to us earlier my dear boy he would say with his arm round me or it might have been a little later a year or so one way or the other what does it matter and it is only for a little while paul we shall meet again  but i could not answer him for clutch them to me as i would all my beliefsthe beliefs in which i had been bred the beliefs that until then i had never doubted in that hour of their first trial were falling from me i could not even pray if i could have prayed for anything it would have been for my fathers life but if prayer were all powerful as they said would our loved ones ever die man has not faith enough they would explain if he had there would be no parting so the lord jests with his creatures offering with the one hand to snatch back with the other i flung the mockery from me there was no firm foothold anywhere what were all the religions of the word but narcotics with which humanity seeks to dull its pain drugs in which it drowns its terrors faith but a bubble that death pricks  i do not mean my thoughts took this form i was little more than a lad and to the young all thought is dumb speaking only with a cry but they were there vague inarticulate thoughts do not come to us as we grow older they are with us all our lives we learn their language that is all  one fair still evening it burst from me we had lingered in the park longer than usual slowly pacing the broad avenue leading from the observatory to the heath i poured forth all my doubts and fearsthat he was leaving me for ever that i should never see him again i could not believe what could i do to believe  i am glad you have spoken paul he said it would have been sad had we parted not understanding each other it has been my fault i did not know you had these doubts they come to all of us sooner or later but we hide them from one another it is foolish  but tell me i cried what can i do how can i make myself believe  my dear lad answered my father how can it matter what we believe or disbelieve it will not alter gods facts would you liken him to some irritable schoolmaster angry because you cannot understand him  what do you believe i asked father really i mean  the night had fallen my father put his arm round me and drew me to him  that we are gods children little brother he answered that what he wills for us is best it may be life it may be sleep it will be best i cannot think that he will let us die that were to think of him as without purpose but his uses may not be our desires we must trust him though he slay me yet will i trust in him  we walked awhile in silence before my father spoke again  now abideth these three faith hope and charityyou remember the versefaith in gods goodness to us hope that our dreams may be fulfiled but these concern but ourselvesthe greatest of all is charity  out of the nightshrouded human hive beneath our feet shone here and there a point of light  be kind that is all it means continued my father often we do what we think right and evil comes of it and out of evil comes good we cannot understandmaybe the old laws we have misread but the new law that we love one anotherall creatures he has made that is so clear and if it be that we are here together only for a little while paul the future dark how much the greater need have we of one another  i looked up into my fathers face and the peace that shone from it slid into my soul and gave me strength    chapter ix  of the fashioning of paul  loves of my youth whither are ye vanished tubby of the golden locks langley of the dented nose shamus stout of heart but faint of limb easy enough to down but utterly impossible to make to cry i give you best neal the thin and dicky dicky dick the fat ballett of the weeping eye beau bunnie lord of many ties who always fought in black kid gloves all ye others ye whose names i cannot recollect though i well remember ye were very dear to me whither are ye vanished where haunt your creeping ghosts had one told me then there would come a day i should never see again your merry faces never hear your wild shrill whoop of greeting never feel again the warm clasp of your inky fingers never fight again nor quarrel with you never hate you never love you could i then have borne the thought i wonder  once methinks not long ago i saw you tubby you with whom so often i discovered the north pole probed the problem of the sources of the nile have you forgotten tubby our secret camping ground beside the lonely waters of the regents park canal where discussing our frugal meal of toasted elephants tongueby the uninitiated mistakable for jumblesthere would break upon our trained hunters ear the hungry lion or tigers distant roar mingled with the melancholy longdrawn growling of the polar bear growing ever in volume and impatience until halfpast four precisely and we would snatch our rifles and with stealthy tread and every sense alert make our way through the jungleuntil stopped by the spiked fencing round the zoological gardens i feel sure it was you in spite of your side whiskers and the greyness and the thinness of your once clustering golden locks you were hurrying down throgmorton street chained to a small black bag i should have stopped you but that i had no time to spare having to catch a train at liverpool street and to get shaved on the way i wonder if you recognised me you looked at me a little hard i thought gallant kindly hearted shamus you who fought once for half an hour to save a frog from being skinned they tell me you are now an income tax assessor a man it is reported with power of disbelief unusual among even inland revenue circles of little faith lacking in the charity that thinketh no evil may providence direct you to other districts than to mine  so time natures handyman bustles to and fro about the many rooms making all things tidy covers with sweet earth the burnt volcanoes turns to use the debris of the ages smoothes again the ground above the dead heals again the beech bark marred by lovers  in the beginning i was far from being a favourite with my schoolmates and this was the first time trouble came to dwell with me later we men and women generally succeed in convincing ourselves that whatever else we may have missed in life popularity in a greater or less degree we have at all events secured for without it altogether few of us i think would care to face existence but where the child suffers keener than the man is in finding himself exposed to the cold truth without the protecting clothes of selfdeception my ostracism was painfully plain to me and as was my nature i brooded upon it in silence  can you run asked of me one day a most important personage whose name i have forgotten he was head of the lower fourth a tall youth with a nose like a beak and the manner of one born to authority he was the son of a draper in the edgware road and his father failing he had to be content for a niche in life with a lower clerkship in the civil service but to us youngsters he always appeared a duke of wellington in embryo and under other circumstances might perhaps have become one  yes i answered as a matter of fact it was my one accomplishment and rumour of it maybe had reached him  run round the playground twice at your fastest he commanded let me see you  i clinched my fists and charged off how grateful i was to him for having spoken to me the outcast of the class thus publicly i could only show by my exertions to please him when i drew up before him i was panting hard but i could see that he was satisfied  why dont the fellows like you he asked bluntly  if only i could have stepped out of my shyness spoken my real thoughts o lord of the lower fourth you upon whom successthe only success in life worth havinghas fallen as from the laps of the gods you to whom all lower fourth hearts turn tell me the secret of this popularity how may i acquire it no price can be too great for me to pay for it vain little egoist that i am it is the sum of my desires and will be till the long years have taught me wisdom the want of it embitters all my days why does silence fall upon their chattering groups when i draw near why do they drive me from their games what is it shuts me out from them repels them from me i creep into the corners and shed scalding tears of shame i watch with envious eyes and ears all you to whom the wondrous gift is given what is your secret is it tommys swagger then i will swagger too with anxious heart with mingled fear and hope but whywhy seeing that in tommy they admire it do they wait for me with imitations of cockadoodledo strut beside me mimicking a pouter pigeon is it dickys playfulnessdicky who runs away with their balls snatches their caps from off their heads springs upon their backs when they are least expecting it  why should dickys reward be laughter and mine a bloody nose and a widened deepened circle of dislike i am no heavier than dicky if anything a pound or two lighter is it billys friendliness i too would fling my arms about their necks but from me they angrily wrench themselves free is indifference the best plan i walk apart with step i try so hard to render careless but none follows no little friendly arm is slipped through mine should one seek to win ones way by kind offices ah if one could how i would fag for them i could do their sums for themi am good at sumswrite their impositions for them gladly take upon myself their punishments would they but return my service with a little love andmore important stilla little admiration  but all i could find to say was sulkily they do like me some of them i dared not aloud acknowledge the truth  dont tell lies he answered you know they dontnone of them and i hung my head  ill tell you what ill do he continued in his lordly way ill give you a chance were starting hare and hounds next saturday you can be a hare you neednt tell anybody just turn up on saturday and ill see to it mind youll have to run like the devil  he walked away without waiting for my answer leaving me to meet joy running towards me with outstretched hands the great moment comes to all of us to the politician when the party whip slips from confabulation with the front bench to congratulate him smiling on his really admirable little speech to the youthful dramatist reading in his bedsittingroom the managerial note asking him to call that morning at eleven to the subaltern beckoned to the stirrup of his chiefthe moment when the sun breaks through the morning mists and the world lies stretched before us our way clear  obeying orders i gave no hint in school of the great fortune that had come to me but hurrying home i exploded in the passage before the front door could be closed behind me  i am to be a hare because i run so fast anybody can be a hound but theres only two hares and they all want me and can i have a jersey we begin next saturday he saw me run i ran twice round the playground he said i was splendid of course its a great honour to be a hare we start from hampstead heath and may i have a pair of shoes  the jersey and the shoes my mother and i purchased that very day for the fear was upon me that unless we hastened the last blue and white striped jersey in london might be sold and the market be empty of running shoes that evening before getting into bed i dressed myself in full costume to admire myself before the glass and from then till the end of the week to the terror of my mother i practised leaping over chairs and my method of descending stairs was perilous and roundabout but as i explained to them the credit of the lower fourth was at stake and banisters and legs equally of small account as compared with fame and honour and my father nodding his head supported me with manly argument but my mother added to her prayers another line  saturday came the members of the hunt were mostly boys who lived in the neighbourhood so the arrangement was that at halfpast two we should meet at the turnpike gate outside the spaniards i brought my lunch with me and ate it in regents park and then took the bus to the heath one by one the others came up beyond mere glances none of them took any notice of me i was wearing my ordinary clothes over my jersey i knew they thought i had come merely to see them start and i hugged to myself the dream of the surprise that was in store for them and of which i should be the hero he came one of the last our leader and chief and i sidled up behind him and waited while he busied himself organising and constructing  but weve only got one hare cried one of them we ought to have two you know in case one gets blown  weve got two answered the duke think i dont know what im about young kelvers going to be the other one  silence fell upon the meet  oh i say we dont want him at last broke in a voice hes a muff  he can run explained the duke  let him run home came another voice which was greeted with laughter  youll run home in a minute yourself threatened the duke if i have any of your cheek whos captain hereyou or me now young un are you ready  i had commenced unbuttoning my jacket but my hands fell to my side i dont want to come i answered if they dont want me  hell get his feet wet suggested the boy who had spoken first dont spoil him hes his mothers pet  are you coming or are you not shouted the duke seeing me still motionless but the tears were coming into my eyes and would not go back i turned my face away without speaking  all right stop then cried the duke who like all authoritative people was impatient above all things of hesitation here keefe you take the bag and be off itll be dark before we start  my substitute snatched eagerly at the chance and away went the hares while i still keeping my face hid moved slowly off  crybaby shouted a sharpeyed youngster  let him alone growled the duke and i went on to where the cedars grew  i heard them start off a few minutes later with a whoop how could i go home confess my disappointment my shame my father would be expecting me with many questions my mother waiting for me with hot water and blankets what explanation could i give that would not betray my miserable secret  it was a chill dismal afternoon the heath deserted a thin rain commencing i slipped off my shirt and jacket and rolling them under my arm trotted off alone hare and hounds combined in one small carcass to chase myself sadly by myself  i see it still that pathetically ridiculous little figure jogging doggedly over the dank fields mile after mile it runs the little idiot jumpingsometimes falling into the muddy ditches it seems anxious rather than otherwise to get itself into a mess scrambling through the dripping hedges swarming over tarry fence and slimy paling on on it pantsthrough bishops wood by tangled churchyard bottom where now the railway shrieks down sloppy lanes bordering muswell hill where now stand rows of jerrybuilt prim villas at intervals it stops an instant to dab its eyes with its dingy little rag of a handkerchief to rearrange the bundle under its arm its chief anxiety to keep well out of sight of chance wanderers to dodge farmhouses to dart across highroads when nobody is looking and so tearsmeared and mudbespattered up the long rise of darkening crouch end lane where tonight the electric light blazes from a hundred shops and dead beat into the seven sisters road station there to tear off its soaked jersey and then home to poplar with shameless account of the jolly afternoon that it has spent of the admiration and the praise that it has won  you poor pitiful little brat popularity it is a shadow turn your eyes towards it and it shall ever run before you escaping you turn your back upon it walk joyously towards the living sun and it shall follow you am i not right why then do you look at me your little face twisted into that quizzical grin  when one takes service with deceit one signs a contract that one may not break but under penalty maybe it was good for my health those lonely runs but oh they were dreary by a process of argument not uncommon i persuaded myself that truth was a matter of mere words that so long as i had actually gone over the ground i described i was not lying to further satisfy my conscience i bought a big satchel and scattered from it tornup paper as i ran  and they never catch you asked my mother  oh no never they never even get within sight of me  be careful dear would advise my mother dont overstrain yourself but i could see that she was proud of me  and after awhile imagination came to my help so that often i could hear behind me the sound of pursuing feet catch through gaps in the trees a sight of a merry host upon my trail and would redouble my speed  thus but for dan my loneliness would have been unbearable his friendship was always there for me to creep to the shadow of a great rock in a weary land to this day one may always know dans politics they are those of the party out of power always without question one may know the cause that he will champion the unpopular cause the man he will defend the man who is down  you are such an ununderstandable chap complained a fellow clubman to him once in my hearing i sometimes ask myself if you have any opinions at all  i hate a crowd was dans only confession of faith  he never claimed anything from me in return for his affection he was there for me to hold to when i wanted him when baffled in all my attempts to win the affections of others i returned to him for comfort he gave it me without even relieving himself of friendly advice when at length childish success came to me and i needed him less he was neither hurt nor surprised other peopletheir thoughts their actions even when these concerned himselfnever troubled him he loved to bestow but as to response was strangely indifferent indeed if anything it bored him his nature appeared to be that of the fountain which fulfils itself by giving but is unable to receive  my popularity came to me unexpectedly after i had given up hoping for it surprising me annoying me gradually it dawned upon me that my company was being sought  come along kelver would say the spokesman of one group were going part of your way home you can walk with us  maybe i would go with them but more often before we reached the gate the delight of my society would be claimed by a rival troop  hes coming with us this afternoon he promised  no he didnt  yes he did  well he aint anyhow see  oh isnt he who says he isnt  i do  punch his head dick  yes you do jimmy blake and ill punch yours come kelver  i might have been some queen of beauty offered as prize for knightly contest indeed more than once the argument concluded thus primitively i being carried off in triumph by the victorious party  for a period it remained a mystery to me until i asked explanation of norvalwe called him norval he being one george grampian it was our wit from taking joy in teasing me norval had suddenly become one of my greatest admirers this by itself was difficult enough to understand he was in the second eleven and after dan the best fighter in the lower school if i could understand norvals change of attitude all would be plain to me so when next time bounding upon me in the cloakroom and slipping his arm into mine he clamoured for my company to camden town i put the question to him bluntly  why should i walk home with you why do you want me  because we like you  but why do you like me  why why because youre such a funny chap you say such funny things  it struck me like a slap in the face i had thought to reach popularity upon the ladder of heroic qualities in all the school books i had read leonard or marmaduke we had a marmaduke in the lower fifththey called him marmalade in the school books these disasters are not contemplated won love and admiration by reason of integrity of character nobility of sentiment goodness of heart brilliance of intellect combined maybe with a certain amount of agility instinct in the direction of bowling or aptitude for jumping but such only by the way not one of them had ever said a funny thing either consciously or unconsciously  dont be disagreeable kelver come with us and we will let you into the team as an extra ill teach you batting  so i was to be their fooli dreamer of knightly dreams aspirant to heros fame i craved their wonder i had won their laughter i had prayed for popularity it had been granted to mein this guise were the gods still the heartless practical jokers poor midas had found them  had my vanity been less i should have flung their gift back in their faces but my thirst for approbation was too intense i had to choose cut capers and be followed or walk in dignity ignored i chose to cut the capers as time wore on i found myself striving to cut them quicker quainter thinking out funny stories preparing ingenuous impromptus twisting all ideas into odd expression  i had my reward before long my company was desired by all the school but i was never content i would rather have been the captain of their football club even his deputy vice would have given all my meed of laughter for stuttering jerrys one round of applause when in our match against highbury he knocked up his century and so won the victory for us by just three  till the end i never quite abandoned hope of exchanging my vine leaves for the laurels i would rise an hour earlier in the morning to practise throwing at broomsticks set up in waste places at another time the sport coming into temporary fashion i wearied body and mind for weeks in vain attempts to acquire skill on stilts that even fat tubby could outdistance me upon them saddened my life for months  a lad there was a sixth form boy one wakeham by name if i remember rightly who greatly envied me my gift of being able to amuse he was of the age when the other sex begins to be of importance to a fellow and the desire had come to him to be regarded as a star of wit among the social circles of gospel oak need i say that by nature he was a ponderously dull boy  one afternoon i happened to be the centre of a small group in the playground i had been holding forth and they had been laughing whether i had delivered myself of anything really entertaining or not i cannot say it made no difference they had got into the habit of laughing when i talked sometimes i would say quite serious things on purpose they would laugh just the same wakeham was among them his eyes fixed on me watching me as boys watch a conjurer in the hope of finding out how he does it later in the afternoon he slipped his arm through mine and drew me away into an empty corner of the ground  i say kelver he broke out the moment we were beyond hearing you really are funny  it gave me no pleasure if he had told me that he admired my bowling i might not have believed him but should have loved him for it  so are you i answered savagely only you dont know it  no im not he replied wish i was i say kelverhe glanced round to see that no one was within earshotdo you think you could teach me to be funny  i was about to reply with conviction in the negative when an idea occurred to me wakeham was famous among us for one thing he could inserting two fingers in his mouth produce a whistle capable of confusing dogs a quarter of a mile off and of causing people near at hand to jump from six to eighteen inches into the air  this accomplishment of his i envied him as keenly as he envied me mine i did not admire it i could not see the use of it generally speaking it called forth irritation rather than affection a purplefaced old gentleman close to whose ear he once performed promptly cuffed his head for it and for so doing was commended by the whole street as a public benefactor drivers of vehicles would respond by flicking at him occasionally with success even youth from whom sympathy might have been expected appeared impelled if anything happened to be at all handy to take it up and throw it at him my own social circle would i knew regard it as a vulgar accomplishment and even wakeham himself dared not perform it in the hearing of his own classmates that any human being should have desired to acquire it seems incomprehensible yet for weeks in secret i had wrestled to produce the hideous sound why for three reasons so far as i can analyse this youngster of whom i am writing  firstly here was a means of attracting attention secondly it was something that somebody else could do and that he couldnt thirdly it was a thing for which he evidently had no natural aptitude whatever and therefore a thing to acquire which his soul yearned the more had a boy come across his path clever at walking on his hands with his heels in the air master paul kelver would in all probability have broken his neck in attempts to copy and excel i make no apologies for the brat i merely present him as a study for the amusement of a world of wiser boysand men  i struck a bargain with young wakeham i undertook to teach him to be funny in return for his teaching me this costermongers whistle  each of us strove conscientiously to impart knowledge neither of us succeeded wakeham tried hard to be funny i tried hard to whistle he did all i told him i followed his instructions implicitly the result was the feeblest of wit and the feeblest of whistles  do you think anybody would laugh at that wakeham would pathetically enquire at the termination of his supremest effort and honestly i would have to confess i did not think any living being would  how far off do you think any one could hear that i would demand anxiously on recovering sufficient breath to speak at all  well it would depend upon whether you knew it was coming wakeham would reply kindly not wishing to discourage me  we abandoned the scheme by mutual consent at about the end of a fortnight  i suppose its something that youve got to have inside you i suggested to wakeham in consolation  i dont think the roof of your mouth can be quite the right shape for it concluded wakeham  my success as storyteller commentator critic jester revived my childish ambition towards authorship my first stirrings in this direction i cannot rightly place i remember when very small falling into a sunk dustbina deep hole rather into which the gardener shot his rubbish the fall twisted my ankle so that i could not move and the time being evening and my prison some distance from the house my predicament loomed large before me yet one consolation remained with me the incident would be of value to me in the autobiography upon which i was then engaged i can distinctly recollect lying on my back among decaying leaves and broken glass framing my account on this day a strange adventure befell me walking in the garden all unheeding i suddenlyi did not want to add the truthtumbled into a dusthole six feet square that any one but a moon calf might have seen i puzzled to evolve a more dignified situation the dustbin became a cavern the entrance to which had been artfully concealed the six or seven feet i had really fallen an endless descent terminating in a vast and gloomy chamber i was divided between opposing desires one for rescue followed by sympathy and supper the other for the alarming experience of a night of terror where i lay nature conquering art i yelled and the episode terminated prosaically with a warm bath and arnica but from it i judge that desire for the woes and perils of authorship was with me somewhat early  of my many other dreams i would speak freely discussing them at length with sympathetic souls but concerning this one ambition i was curiously reticent only to twomy mother and a greybearded strangerdid i ever breathe a word of it even from my father i kept it a secret close comrades in all else though we were he would have talked of it much and freely dragged it into the light of day and from this i shrank  my talk with the stranger came about in this wise one evening i had taken a walk to victoria parka favourite haunt of mine at summer time it was a fair and peaceful evening and i fell awandering there in pleasant reverie until the waning light hinted to me the question of time i looked about me only one human being was in sight a man with his back towards me seated upon a bench overlooking the ornamental water  i drew nearer he took no notice of me and interestedthough why i could not sayi seated myself beside him at the other end of the bench he was a handsome distinguishedlooking man with wonderfully bright clear eyes and irongrey hair and beard i might have thought him a sea captain of whom many were always to be met with in that neighbourhood but for his hands which were crossed upon his stick and which were white and delicate as a womans he turned his face and glanced at me i fancied that his lips beneath the grey moustache smiled and instinctively i edged a little nearer to him  please sir i said after awhile could you tell me the right time  twenty minutes to eight he answered looking at his watch and his voice drew me towards him even more than had his beautiful strong face i thanked him and we fell back into silence  where do you live he turned and suddenly asked me  oh only over there i answered with a wave of my arm towards the chimneyfringed horizon behind us i neednt be in till halfpast eight i like this park so much i added i often come and sit here of an evening  why do you like to come and sit here he asked tell me  oh i dont know i answered i think  i marvelled at myself with strangers generally i was shy and silent but the magic of his bright eyes seemed to have loosened my tongue  i told him my name that we lived in a street always full of ugly sounds so that a gentleman could not think not even in the evening time when thought goes avisiting  mamma does not like the twilight time i confided to him it always makes her cry but then mamma isnot very young you know and has had a deal of trouble and that makes a difference i suppose  he laid his hand upon mine we were sitting nearer to each other now god made women weak to teach us men to be tender he said but you paul like this twilight time  yes i answered very much dont you  and why do you like it he asked  oh i answered things come to you  what things  oh fancies i explained to him i am going to be an author when i grow up and write books  he took my hand in his and shook it gravely and then returned it to me i too am a writer of books he said  and then i knew what had drawn me to him  so for the first time i understood the joy of talking shop with a fellow craftsman i told him my favourite authorsscott and dumas and victor hugo and to my delight found they were his also he agreeing with me that real stories were the best stories in which people did things  i used to read silly stuff once i confessed indian tales and that sort of thing you know but mamma said id never be able to write if i read that rubbish  you will find it so all through life paul he replied the things that are nice are rarely good for us and what do you read now  i am reading marlowes plays and de quinceys confessions just now i confided to him  and do you understand them  fairly well i answered mamma says ill like them better as i go on i want to learn to write very very well indeed i admitted to him then ill be able to earn heaps of money  he smiled so you dont believe in art for arts sake paul  i was puzzled what does that mean i asked  it means in our case paul he answered writing books for the pleasure of writing books without thinking of any reward without desiring either money or fame  it was a new idea to me do many authors do that i asked  he laughed outright this time it was a delightful laugh it rang through the quiet park awaking echoes and caught by it i laughed with him  hush he said and he glanced round with a whimsical expression of fear lest we might have been overheard between ourselves paul he continued drawing me more closely towards him and whispering i dont think any of us do we talk about it but ill tell you this paul it is a trade secret and you must remember it no man ever made money or fame but by writing his very best it may not be as good as somebody elses best but it is his best remember that paul  i promised i would  and you must not think merely of the money and the fame paul he added the next moment speaking more seriously money and fame are very good things and only hypocrites pretend to despise them but if you write books thinking only of money you will be disappointed it is earned easier in other ways tell me that is not your only idea  i pondered mamma says it is a very noble calling authorship i remembered and that any one ought to be very proud and glad to be able to write books because they give people happiness and make them forget things and that one ought to be very good if one is going to be an author so as to be worthy to help and teach others  and do you try to be good paul he enquired  yes i answered but its very hard to be quite gooduntil of course youre grown up  he smiled but more to himself than to me yes he said i suppose it is difficult to be good until you are grown up perhaps we shall all of us be good when were quite grown up which from a gentleman with a grey beard appeared to me a puzzling observation  and what else does mamma say about literature he asked can you remember  again i pondered and her words came back to me that he who can write a great book is greater than a king that the gift of being able to write is given to anybody in trust that an author should never forget he is gods servant  he sat for awhile without speaking his chin resting on his folded hands supported by his goldtopped cane then he turned and laid a hand upon my shoulder and his clear bright eyes were close to mine  your mother is a wise lady paul he said remember her words always in later life let them come back to you they will guide you better than the chatter of the clubs  and what modern authors do you read he asked after a silence any of themthackeray bulwer lytton dickens  i have read the last of the barons i told him i like that and ive been to barnet and seen the church and some of mr dickens  and what do you think of mr dickens he asked but he did not seem very interested in the subject he had picked up a few small stones and was throwing them carefully into the water  i like him very much i answered he makes you laugh  not always he asked he stopped his stonethrowing and turned sharply towards me  oh no not always i admitted but i like the funny bits best i like so much where mr pickwick  oh damn mr pickwick he said  dont you like him i asked  oh yes i like him well enough or used to he replied im a bit tired of him thats all does your mamma like mrmr dickens  not the funny parts i explained to him she thinks he is occasionally  i know he interrupted rather irritably i thought a trifle vulgar  it surprised me that he should have guessed her exact words i dont think mamma has much sense of humour i explained to him sometimes she doesnt even see papas jokes  at that he laughed again but she likes the other parts he enquired the parts where mr dickens isntvulgar  oh yes i answered she says he can be so beautiful and tender when he likes  twilight was deepening it occurred to me to enquire of him again the time  just over the quarter he answered looking at his watch  im so sorry i said i must go now  so am i sorry paul he answered perhaps we shall meet again goodbye then as our hands touched you have never asked me my name paul he reminded me  oh havent i i answered  no paul he replied and that makes me think of your future with hope you are an egotist paul and that is the beginning of all art  and after that he would not tell me his name perhaps next time we meet he said goodbye paul good luck to you  so i went my way where the path winds out of sight i turned he was still seated upon the bench but his face was towards me and he waved his hand to me i answered with a wave of mine and then the intervening boughs and bushes gradually closed in around me and across the rising mist there rose the hoarse harsh cry  all out all out    chapter x  in which paul is shipwrecked and cast into deep waters  my father died curiously enough on the morning of his birthday we had not expected the end to arrive for some time and at first did not know that it had come  i have left him sleeping said my mother who had slipped out very quietly in her dressinggown washburn gave him a draught last night we wont disturb him  so we sat round the breakfast table speaking in low tones for the house was small and flimsy all sound easily heard through its thin partitions afterwards my mother crept upstairs i following and cautiously opened the door a little way  the blinds were still down and the room dark it seemed a long time that my mother stood there listening her ear against the jar the first costermongera girls voice it soundedpassed crying shrilly watercreases fine fresh watercreases with your breakfastapenny a bundle watercreases and further off a hoarse youth was wailing meeilkmeeilkoi  inch by inch my mother opened the door wider and we stole in he was lying with his eyes still closed the lips just slightly parted i had never seen death before and could not realise it all that i could see was that he looked even younger than i had ever seen him look before by slow degrees only it came home to me the knowledge that he was gone away from us for daysfor weeks i would hear his step behind me in the street his voice calling to me see his face among the crowds and hastening to meet him stand bewildered because it had mysteriously disappeared but at first i felt no pain whatever  to my mother it was but a short parting into her placid faith had never fallen fear nor doubt he was waiting for her in gods good time they would meet again what need of sorrow without him the days passed slowly the house must ever be a little dull when the good mans away but that was all so my mother would speak of him alwaysof his dear kind ways of his oddities and follies we loved so to recall not through tears but smiles thinking of him not as of one belonging to the past but as of one beckoning to her from the future  we lived on still in the old house though ever planning to move for the great brick monster had crept closer round about us year by year devouring in his progress all things fair field and garden tree and cottage timemellowed house suggesting story kind hedgerow hiding hideousness beyondthe few spots yet in that doomed land lingering to remind one of the sunshine one by one had he scrunched them between his ugly teeth a world apart this east end of london this ghetto of the poor for ever growing dreariness added year by year to dreariness hopelessness stretching ever farther its long shrivelled arms these endless rows of reeking cells where london herds her slaves often of a misty afternoon when we knew that without this city of the dead life was stirring in the sunshine we would fare forth to househunt in pleasant suburbs now themselves added to the weary catacomb of narrow streetsto highgate then a tiny town connected by a coach with leafy holloway to hampstead with its rows of ancient redbrick houses from whose windblown heath one saw beyond the woods and farms far londons domes and spires to wood green among the pastures where smockcoated labourers discussed their politics and ale beneath widespreading elms to hornsey then a village consisting of an ivycovered church and one grassbordered way but though we often saw the very thing for us and would discuss its possibilities from every point of view and find them good we yet delayed  we must think it over would say my mother there is no hurry for some reasons i shall be sorry to leave poplar  for what reasons mother  oh well no particular reason paul only we have lived there so long you know it will be a wrench leaving the old house  to the making of man go all things even to the instincts of the clinging vine we fling our tendrils round what is the nearest castlekeep or pigstye wall rain and sunshine fastening them but firmer dying sir walter scottdo you rememberhastening home from italy fearful lest he might not be in time to breathe again the damp mists of the barren hills an ancient dame i knew they had carried her from her attic in slumland that she might be fanned by the sea breezes and the poor old soul lay pining for what she called her home wife mother widow she had lived there till the alleys reek smelt good to her nostrils till its riot was the voices of her people who shall understand us save he who fashioned us  so the old house held us to its dismal bosom and not until within its homely but unlovely arms first my aunt and later on my mother had died and i had said goodbye to amy crying in the midst of littered emptiness did i leave it  my aunt died as she had lived grumbling  you will be glad to get rid of me all of you she said dropping for the first and last time i can recollect into the retort direct and i cant say i shall be very sorry to go myself it hasnt been my idea of life  poor old lady that was only a couple of weeks before the end i do not suppose she guessed it was so certain or perhaps she might have been more sentimental  dont be foolish said my mother youre not going to die  whats the use of talking like an idiot retorted my aunt ive got to do it some time why not now when everythings all ready for it it isnt as if i was enjoying myself  i am sure we do all we can for you said my mother i know you do replied my aunt im a burden to you i always have been  not a burden corrected my mother  what does the woman call it then snapped back my aunt does she reckon ive been a sunbeam in the house ive been a trial to everybody thats what i was born for its my metier  my mother put her arms about the poor old soul and kissed her we should miss you very much she said  im sure i hope they all will answered my aunt its the only thing ive got to leave em worth having  my mother laughed  maybe its been a good thing for you maggie grumbled my aunt if it wasnt for cantankerous disagreeable people like me gentle patient people like you wouldnt get any practice perhaps after all ive been a blessing to you in disguise  i cannot honestly say we ever wished her back though we certainly did miss hermissed many a joke at her oddities many a laugh at her cornery ways it takes all sorts as the saying goes to make a world possibly enough if only we perfect folk were left in it we would find it uncomfortably monotonous  as for amy i believe she really regretted her  one never knows whats good for one till ones lost it sighed amy  im glad to think you liked her said my mother  you see mum explained amy i was one of a large family and a bit of a row now and again cheers one up i always think ill be losing the power of my tongue if something doesnt come along soon  well you are going to be married in a few weeks now my mother reminded her  but amy remained despondent theyre poor things the men at a few words the best of them she replied as likely as not just when youre getting interested you turn round to find that theyve put on their hat and gone out  my mother and i were very much alone after my aunts death barbara had gone abroad to put the finishing touches to her educationto learn the tricks of the nobs trade as old hasluck phrased it and i had left school and taken employment with mr stillwood without salary the idea being that i should study for the law  you are in lucks way my boy in lucks way old mr gadley had assured me to have commenced your career in the office of stillwood waterhead and royal will be a passport for you anywhere it will stamp you my boy  mr stillwood himself was an extremely old and feeble gentlemanso old and feeble it seemed strange that he a wealthy man had not long ago retired  i am always meaning to he explained to me one day soon after my advent in his office when your poor father came to me he told me very frankly the sad factthat he had only a few more years to live mr kelver i answered him do not let that trouble you so far as i am concerned there are one or two matters in the office i should like to see cleared up and in these you can help me when they are completed i shall retire yet you see i linger on i am like the old hackney coach horse mr welleror is it mr jingletells us of if the shafts were drawn away i should probably collapse so i jog on i jog on  he had married late in life a common woman much younger than himself who had brought to him a horde of needy and greedy relatives and no doubt as a refuge from her noisy neighbourhood the daily peace of lombard street was welcome to him we saw her occasionally she was one of those blustering managing women who go through life under the impression that making a disturbance is somehow putting things to rights ridiculously ashamed of her origin she sought to hide it under what her friends assured her was the air of a duchess but which as a matter of fact resembled rather the sunday manners of an elderly barmaid mr gadley alone was not afraid of her but on the contrary kept her always very much in fear of him often speaking to her with refreshing candour he had known her in the days it was her desire should be buried in oblivion and had always resented as a personal insult her entry into the old established aristocratic firm of stillwood  co  her history was peculiar mr stillwood when a blase man about town verging on forty had first seen her then a fairhaired ethereallooking child in spite of her dirt playing in the gutter to his lasting selfreproach it was young gadley himself accompanying his employer home from westminster who had drawn mr stillwoods attention to the girl by boxing her ears for having as he passed slapped his face with a convenient sprat stillwood acting on the impulse of the moment had taken the child by the hand and dragged her unwilling to her fathers place of businessa small coal shed in the horseferry road the arrangement he there made amounted practically to the purchase of the child she was sent abroad to school and the coal shed closed on her return ten years later a big handsome young woman he married her and learned at leisure the truth of the old saying whats bred in the bone will come out in the flesh scrub it and paint it and hide it away under fine clothes as you will  her constant complaint against her husband was that he was only a solicitor a profession she considered vulgar and nothing riled old gadley more than hearing her views upon this point  its not fair to the gals i once heard her say to him i was working in the next room with the door not quite closed added to which she talked at the top of her voice on all subjects what real gentleman i should like to know is going to marry the daughter of a city attorney as i told him years ago he ought to have retired and gone into the house  the very thing your poor father used to talk of doing whenever things were going a bit queer in the retail coal and potato business grunted old gadley  mrs stillwood called him a low beast in her most aristocratic tones and swept out of the room  not that old stillwood himself ever expressed fondness for the law  i am not at all sure kelver i remember his saying to me on one occasion that you have done wisely in choosing the law it makes one regard humanity morally as the medical profession regards it physicallyas universally unsound you suspect everybody of being a rogue when people are behaving themselves we lawyers hear nothing of them all we hear of is roguery trickery and hypocrisy it deteriorates the character kelver we live in a perpetual atmosphere of transgression i sometimes fancy it may be infectious  it does not seem to have infected you sir i replied for as i think i have already mentioned the firm of stillwood waterhead and royal was held in legal circles as the synonym for rectitude of dealing quite oldfashioned  i hope not kelver i hope not the old gentleman replied and yet do you know i sometimes suspect myselfwonder if i may not perhaps be a scamp without realising it a rogue you know kelver can always explain himself into an honest man to his own satisfaction a scamp is never a scamp to himself  his words for the moment alarmed me for acting on old gadleys advice i had persuaded my mother to put all her small capital into mr stillwoods hands for reinvestment a transaction that had resulted in substantial increase of our small income but looking into his smiling eyes my momentary fear vanished  laughing he laid his hand upon my shoulder one person always be suspicious of kelveryourself nobody can do you so much harm as yourself  of washburn we saw more and more hal we both called him now for removing with his gentle masterful hands my mothers shyness from about her he had established himself almost as one of the family my mother regarding him as she might some absurdly bearded boy entrusted to her care without his knowing it i looking up to him as to some wonderful elder brother  you rest me mrs kelver he would say lighting his pipe and sinking down into the deep leathern chair that always waited for him in our parlour your even voice your soft eyes your quiet hands they soothe me  it is good for a man he would say looking from one to the other of us through the hanging smoke to test his wisdom by two things the face of a good woman and the ear of a childi beg your pardon paulof a young man a good womans face is the white sunlight under the gaslamps who shall tell diamond from paste bring it into the sunlight does it stand that test then it is good and the children they are the waiting earth on which we fling our store is it chaff and dust or living seed wait and watch i shower my thoughts over our paul mrs kelver they seem to me brilliant deep original the young beggar swallows them forgets them they were rubbish then i say something that dwells with him that grows ah that was alive that was a seed the waiting earth it can make use only of what is true  you should marry hal my mother would say it was her panacea for all mankind  i would mrs kelver he answered her on one occasion i would tomorrow if i could marry half a dozen women i should make an ideal husband for half a dozen wives one i should neglect for five days and be a burden to upon the sixth  from any other than hal my mother would have taken such a remark made even in jest as an insult to her sex but hals smile was a coating that could sugar any pill  i am not one man mrs kelver i am half a dozen if i were to marry one wife she would be married to six husbands it is too many for any woman to manage  have you never fallen in love asked my mother  three of me have but on each occasion the other five of me outvoted him  youre sure six would be sufficient queried my mother smiling  just the right number mrs kelver there is one of me must worship adore a woman madly abjectly grovel before her like the troubadour before his queen of song eat her slipper drink the water she has washed in scourge himself before her window die for a kiss of her glove flung down with a laugh she must be scornful contemptuous cruel there is another i would cherish a tender yielding creature one whose face would light at my coming cloud at my going one to whom i should be a god there is a third i a child of panan ugly little beast mrs kelver horns on head and hoofs on feet leering through the wood seeking its fit mate and a fourth would wed a wholesome homely wench deep of bosom broad of hip fit mother of a sturdy brood a fifth could only be content with a true friend a comrade wise and witty a sharer and understander of all joys and thoughts and feelings and a last mrs kelver yearns for a woman pure and sweet clothed in love and crowned with holiness shouldnt we be a handful mrs kelver for any one woman in an eightroomed house  but my mother was not to be discouraged you will find the woman one day hal who will be all of them to youall of them that are worth having that is and your eightroomed house will be a kingdom  a man is many and a woman but one answered hal  that is what men say who are too blind to see more than one side of a woman retorted my mother a little sharply for the honour and credit of her own sex in all things was very dear to my mother and indeed this i have learned that the flag of womanhood you shall ever find upheld by all true women flouted only by the false for a judge in petticoats is ever but a witness in a wig  hal laid aside his pipe and leant forward in his chair now tell us mrs kelver for our guidance we two young bachelors what must the lover of a young girl be  always very serious on this subject of love my mother answered gravely she asks for the whole of a man hal not merely for a sixth nor any other part of him she is a child asking for a lover to whom she can look up who will teach her guide her protect her she is a queen demanding homage and yet he is her king whom it is her joy to serve she asks to be his partner his fellowworker his playmate and at the same time she loves to think of him as her child her big baby she must take care of whatever he has to give she has also to respond with you need not marry six wives hal you will find your six in one  as the water to the vessel woman shapes herself to man an old heathen said that three thousand years ago and others have repeated him that is what you mean  i dont like that way of putting it answered my mother i mean that as you say of man so in every true woman is contained all women but to know her completely you must love her with all love  sometimes the talk would be of religion for my mothers faith was no dead thing that must be kept ever sheltered from the air lest it crumble  one evening who are we that we should live cried hal the spider is less cruel the very pig less greedy gluttonous and foul the tiger less tigerish our cousin ape less monkeyish what are we but savages clothed and ashamed ninetenths of us  but sodom and gomorrah reminded him my mother would have been spared for the sake of ten just men  much more sensible to have hurried the ten men out leaving the remainder to be buried with all their abominations under their own ashes growled hal  and we shall be purified continued my mother the evil in us washed away  why have made us ill merely to mend us if the almighty were so anxious for our company why not have made us decent in the beginning he had just come away from a meeting of poor law guardians and was in a state of dissatisfaction with human nature generally  it is his way answered my mother the precious stone lies hid in clay he has his purpose  is the stone so very precious  would he have taken so much pains to fashion it if it were not you see it all around you hal in your daily practiceheroism selfsacrifice love stronger than death can you think he will waste it he who uses again even the dead leaf  shall the new leaf remember the new flower  yes if it ever knew it shall memory be the only thing to die  often of an evening i would accompany hal upon his rounds by the savage tribe he both served and ruled he had come to be regarded as medicine man and priest combined he was both their tyrant and their slave working for them early and late yet bullying them unmercifully enforcing his commands sometimes with vehement tongue and where that would not suffice with quick fists the counsellor helper ruler literally of thousands of income he could have made barely enough to live upon but few men could have enjoyed more sense of power and that i think it was that held him to the neighbourhood  nature laid me by and forgot me for a couple of thousand years was his own explanation of himself born in my proper period i should have climbed to chieftainship upon uplifted shields i might have been an attila an alaric among the civilised one can only climb by crawling and i am too impatient to crawl here i am king at once by force of brain and muscle so in poplar he remained poor in fees but rich in honour  the love of justice was a passion with him the oppressors of the poor knew and feared him well injustice once proved before him vengeance followed sure if the law would not help he never hesitated to employ lawlessness of which he could always command a satisfactory supply bumble might have the board of guardians at his back shylock legal support for his pound of flesh but sooner or later the dark night brought punishment a ducking in dock basin or canal brutal assault upon a respected resident according to the local papers the miscreants always making and keeping good their escape for he was an admirable organiser  one night it seemed to him necessary that a child should go at once into the infirmary  it aint no use my taking her now explained the mother ill only get bullyragged for disturbing em my old man was carried there three months ago when he broke his leg but they wouldnt take him in till the morning  oho oho oho sang hal taking the child up in his arms and putting on his hat you follow me well have some sport tally ho tally ho and away we went hal heading our procession through the streets shouting a rollicking song the baby staring at him openmouthed  now ring cried hal to the mother on our reaching the workhouse gate ring modestly as becomes the poor ringing at the gate of charity and the bell tinkled faintly  ring again cried hal drawing back into the shadow and at last the wicket opened  oh if you please sir my baby  blast your baby answered a husky voice what dye mean by coming here this time of night  please sir im afraid its dying and the doctor  the man was no sentimentalist and to do him justice made no hypocritical pretence of being one he consigned the baby and its mother and the doctor to hell and the wicket would have closed but for the point of hals stick  open the gate roared hal it was idle pretending not to hear hal anywhere within half a mile of him when he filled his lungs for a cry open it quick you blackguard you gross vatload of potato spirit you  that the governor should speak a language familiar to the governed was held by the romans born rulers of men essential to authority this theory hal also maintained his command of idiom understanded by his people was one of his rods of power in less time than it took the trembling porter to loosen the bolts hal had presented him with a word picture of himself as seen by others that must have lessened his selfesteem  i didnt know as it was you doctor explained the man  no you thought you had only to deal with some helpless creature you could bully stir your fat carcass you ugly cur im in a hurry  the house surgeon was away but an attendant or two were lounging about unfortunately for themselves for hal being there took it upon himself to go round the ward setting crooked things straight and a busy and alarming time they had of it not till a couple of hours later did he fling himself forth again having enjoyed himself greatly  a gentleman came to reside in the district a firm believer in the wisdom of the couplet a woman a spaniel and a walnut tree the more you beat them the better they be the spaniel and the walnut tree he did not possess so his wife had the benefit of his undivided energies whether his treatment had improved her morally one cannot say her evident desire to do her best may have been natural or may have been assisted but physically it was injuring her he used to beat her about the head with his strap his argument being that she always seemed half asleep and that this for the time being woke her up sympathisers brought complaint to hal for the police in that neighbourhood are to keep the streets respectable with the life in the little cells that line them they are no more concerned than are the scavengers of the sewers with the domestic arrangements of the rats  whats he like asked hal  hes a big un answered the woman who had come with the tale and hes good with his fistsive seen him but theres no getting at him hes the sort to have the law on you if you interfere with him and shes the sort to help him  any likely time to catch him at it asked hal  saturdays its as regular as early closing answered the woman but you might have to wait a bit  ill wait in your room granny next saturday suggested hal  all right agreed the woman ill risk it even if i do get a bloody head for it  so that week end we sat very still on two rickety chairs listening to a long succession of sharp cracking sounds that had one not known one might have imagined produced by some child monotonously exploding percussion caps each one followed by an answering groan hal never moved but sat smoking his pipe an ugly smile about his mouth only once he opened his lips and then it was to murmur to himself and god blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply  the horror ceased at last and later we heard the door unlock and a mans foot upon the landing above hal beckoned to me and swiftly we slipped out and down the creaking stairs he opened the front door and we waited in the evilsmelling little passage the man came towards us whistling he was a powerfully built fellow rather goodlooking i remember he stopped abruptly upon catching sight of hal who stood crouching in the shadow of the door  what are you doing here he demanded  waiting to pull your nose answered hal suiting the action to the word and then laughing he ran down the street i following  the man gave chase calling to us with a string of imprecations to stop but hal only ran the faster though after a street or two he slackened and the man gained on us a little  so we continued the distance between us and our pursuer now a little more now a little less people turned and stared at us a few boys scenting grim fun followed shouting for awhile but these we soon outpaced till at last in deserted streets winding among warehouses bordering the river we three ran alone between long lifeless walls i looked into hals face from time to time and he was laughing but every now and then he would look over his shoulder at the man behind him still following doggedly and then his face would be twisted into a comically terrified grimace turning into a narrow culdesac hal suddenly ducked behind a wide brick buttress and the man still running passed us and then hal stood up and called to him and the man turned looked into hals eyes and understood  he was not a coward besides even a rat when cornered will fight for its life he made a rush at hal and hal made no attempt to defend himself he stood there laughing and the man struck him full in the face and the blood spurted out and flowed down into his mouth the man came on again though terror was in every line of his face all his desire being to escape but this time hal drove him back again they fought for awhile if one can call it fighting till the man mad for air reeled against the wall stood there quivering convulsively his mouth wide open resembling more than anything else some huge dying fish and hal drew away and waited  i have no desire to see again the sight i saw that quiet still evening framed by those high windowless walls from behind which sounded with ceaseless regularity the gentle swish of the incoming tide all sense of retribution was drowned in the sight of hals evident enjoyment of his sport the judge had disappeared leaving the work to be accomplished by a savage animal loosened for the purpose  the wretched creature flung itself again towards its only door of escape fought with the vehemence of despair to be flung back again a hideous bleeding mass of broken flesh i tried to cling to hals arm but one jerk of his steel muscles flung me ten feet away  keep off you fool he cried i wont kill him im keeping my head i shall know when to stop and i crept away and waited  hal joined me a little later wiping the blood from his face we made our way to a small publichouse near the river and from there hal sent a couple of men on whom he could rely with instructions how to act i never heard any more of the matter it was a subject on which i did not care to speak to hal i can only hope that good came of it  there was a spotit has been cleared away since to make room for the approach to greenwich tunnelit was then the entrance to a grain depot in connection with the milwall docks a curious brick well it resembled in the centre of which a roadway wound downward corkscrew fashion disappearing at the bottom into darkness under a yawning arch the place possessed the curious property of being ever filled with a ceaseless murmur as though it were some aerial maelstrom drawing into its silent vacuum all wandering waves of sound from the restless human ocean flowing round it no single tone could one ever distinguish it was a mingling of all voices heard there like the murmur of a seasoaked shell  we passed through it on our return its work for the day was finished its strange weary song uninterrupted by the mighty waggons thundering up and down its spiral way hal paused leaning against the railings that encircled its centre and listened  hark do you not hear it paul he asked it is the music of humanity all human notes are needful to its making the faint wail of the newborn the cry of the dying thief the beating of the hammers the merry trip of dancers the clatter of the teacups the roaring of the streets the crooning of the mother to her babe the scream of the tortured child the meeting kiss of lovers the sob of those that part listen prayers and curses sighs and laughter the soft breathing of the sleeping the fretful feet of pain voices of pity voices of hate the glad song of the strong the foolish complaining of the weak listen to it paul right and wrong good and evil hope and despair it is but one voicea single note drawn by the sweep of the players hand across the quivering strings of man what is the meaning of it paul can you read it sometimes it seems to me a note of joy so full so endless so complete that i cry blessed be the lord whose hammers have beaten upon us whose fires have shaped us to his ends and sometimes it sounds to me a dying note so that i could curse him who in wantonness has wrung it from the anguish of his creaturestill i would that i could fling myself prometheus like between him and his victims calling my darkness but their light my agony o god their hope  the faint light from a neighbouring gaslamp fell upon his face that an hour before i had seen the face of a wild beast the ugly mouth was quivering tears stood in his great tender eyes could his prayer in that moment have been granted could he have pressed against his bosom all the pain of the world he would have rejoiced  he shook himself together with a laugh come paul we have had a busy afternoon and im thirsty let us drink some beer my boy good sound beer and plenty of it  my mother fell ill that winter mountain born and mountain bred the close streets had never agreed with her and scolded by all of us she promised come the fine weather to put sentiment behind her and go away from them  im thinking she will said hal gripping my shoulder with his strong hand but itll be by herself that shell go lad my wonder is he continued that she has held out so long if anything it is you that have kept her alive now that you are off her mind to a certain extent she is worrying about your father i expect these women they never will believe a man can take care of himself even in heaven shes never quite trusted the lord with him and never will till shes there to give an eye to things herself  hals prophecy fell true she left come the fine weather as she had promised i remember it was the first day primroses were hawked in the street but another death had occurred just before which concerning me closely as it does i had better here dispose of and that was the death of old mr stillwood who passed away rich in honour and regret and was buried with much ostentation and much sincere sorrow for he had been to many of his clients mostly old folk rather a friend than a mere man of business and had gained from all with whom he had come in contact respect and from many real affection  in conformity with the old legal fashions that in his life he had so fondly clung to his will was read aloud by mr gadley after the return from the funeral and many were the tears its recital called forth written years ago by himself and never altered its quaint phraseology was full of kindly thought and expression no one had been forgotten clerks servants poor relations all had been treated with evenhanded justice while for those with claim upon him ample provision had been made few wills i think could ever have been read less open to criticism  old gadley slipped his arm into mine as we left the house if youve nothing to do young un he said ill get you to come with me to the office i have got all the keys in my pocket and we shall be quiet it will be sad work for me and i had rather we were alone a couple of hours will show us everything  we lighted the wax candlesold stillwood could never tolerate gas in his own roomand opening the safe took out the heavy ledgers one by one and from them gadley dictated figures which i wrote down and added up  thirty years i have kept these books for him said old gadley as we laid by the last of them thirty years come christmas next he and i together no other hands but ours have ever touched them and now people to whom they mean nothing but so much business will fling them about drop greasy crumbs upon themi know their ways the brutesscribble all over them and he who always would have everything so neat and orderly  we came to the end of them in less than the time old gadley had thought needful in such perfect order had everything been maintained i was preparing to go but old gadley had drawn a couple of small keys from his pocket and was shuffling again towards the safe  only one more he explained in answer to my look his own private ledger it will merely be in the nature of a summary but well just glance through it  he opened an inner drawer and took from it a small thick volume bound in green leather and closed with two brass locks an ancient volume it appeared its strong binding faded and stained old gadley sat down with it at the dead mans own desk and snuffing the two shaded candles unlocked and opened it i was standing opposite so that the book to me was upside down but the date on the first page 1841 caught my eye as also the small neat writing now brown with age  so neat so orderly he always was murmured old gadley again smoothing the page affectionately with his hand and i waited for his dictation  but no glib flow of figures fell from him his eyebrows suddenly contracted his body stiffened itself then for the next quarter of an hour nothing sounded in the quiet room but his turning of the creakling pages once or twice he glanced round swiftly over his shoulder as though haunted by the idea of some one behind him then back to the neat closely written folios his little eyes now exhibiting a comical look of horror starting out of his round red face first slowly then quickly with trembling hands he turned the pages till the continual ratling of the leaves sounded like strange mocking laughter through the silent empty room almost one could imagine it coming from some watching creature hidden in the shadows  the end reached he sat staring before him his whole body quivering great beads of sweat upon his shiny bald head  am i mad was all he could find to say kelver am i mad  he handed me the book it was a cynically truthful record of fraud extending over thirty years every client every friend every relative that had fallen into his net he had robbed the fortunate ones of a part the majority of their all its very first entry debited him with the proceeds of his own partners estate its last ranre kelvervarious sales of stock to his credit were his payments year after year of imaginary interests on imaginary securities the surplus accounted for with simple brevity transferred to own account no record could have been more clear more frank beneath each transaction was written its true history the actual investments sometimes necessary carefully distinguished from the false in neat red ink would occur here and there a note for his own guidance eldest child comes of age august 73 be prepared for trustees desiring production turning to august 73 one found that genuine investment had been made to be sold again a few months later on from beginning to end not a single false step had he committed suspicious clients had been earmarked the trusting discriminated with gratitude and milked again and again to meet emergency  as a piece of organisation it was magnificent no one but a financial genius could have picked a dozen steps through such a network of chicanery for half a lifetime he had moved among it dignified respected and secure  whether even he could have maintained his position for another month was doubtful suicide though hinted at was proved to have been impossible it seemed as though with his amazing audacity he had tricked even death into becoming his accomplice  but it is impossible kelver cried gadley this must be some dream stillwood waterhead and royal what is the meaning of it  he took the book into his hands again then burst into tears you never knew him wailed the poor little man stillwood waterhead and royal i came here as office boy fifty years ago he was more like a friend to me than and again the sobs shook his little fat body  i locked the books away and put him into his hat and coat but i had much difficulty in getting him out of the office  i darent young un he cried drawing back fifty years i have walked out of this office proud of it proud of being connected with it i darent face the street  all the way home his only idea was could it not be hidden honest kindly little man that he was he seemed to have no thought for the unfortunate victims the good name of his master of his friend gone stillwood waterhead and royal a byword to have avoided that i believe he would have been willing for yet another hundred clients to be ruined  i saw him to his door then turned homeward and to my surprise in a dark bystreet heard myself laughing heartily i checked myself instantly feeling ashamed of my callousness of my seeming indifference to the trouble even of myself and my mother yet as there passed before me the remembrance of that imposing and expensive funeral with its mournful following of tearful faces the hushed reading of the will with its accompaniment of rustling approval the picture of the admirably sympathetic clergyman consoling with white hands mrs stillwood inclined to hysteria but anxious concerning her two hundred pounds worth of crape which by no possibility of means could now be paid forrecurred to me the obituary notice in the chelsea weekly chronicle the humour of the thing swept all else before it and i laughed againi could not help itloud and long it was my first introduction to the comedy of life which is apt to be more brutal than the comedy of fiction  but nearing home the serious side of the matter forced itself uppermost fortunately our supposed dividends had been paid to us by mr stillwood only the month before could i keep the thing from troubling my mothers last days it would be hard work i should have to do it alone for a perhaps foolish pride prevented my taking hal into my confidence even made his friendship a dread to me lest he should come to learn and offer help there is a higher generosity it is said that can receive with pleasure as well as bestow favour but i have never felt it could i be sure of acting my part of not betraying myself to her sharp eyes of keeping newspapers and chance gossip away from her good shrewd amy i cautioned but i shrank from even speaking on the subject to hal and my fear was lest he should blunder into the subject which for the usual nine days occupied much public attention but fortunately he appeared not even to have heard of the scandal  possibly had the need lasted longer i might have failed but as it was a few weeks saw the end  dont leave me today paul whispered my mother to me one morning so i stayed and in the evening my mother put her arms around my neck and i lay beside her my head upon her breast as i used to when a little boy and when the morning came i was alone    book ii  chapter i  describes the desert island to which paul was drifted  room to let for a single gentleman sometimes in an idle hour impelled by foolishness i will knock at the door it is opened after a longer or shorter interval by the slaveyin the morning slatternly her arms concealed beneath her apron in the afternoon smart in dirty cap and apron how well i know her unchanged not grown an inchher round bewildered eyes her open mouth her touzled hair her scored red hands with an effort i refrain from muttering so sorry forgot my key from pushing past her and mounting two at a time the narrow stairs carpeted to the first floor but bare beyond instead i say oh what rooms have you to let when scuttling to the top of the kitchen stairs she will call over the banisters a gentleman to see the rooms there comes up panting a harassedlooking elderly female but genteel in black she crushes past the little slavey and approaching eyes me critically  i have a very nice room on the first floor she informs me and one behind on the third  i agree to see them explaining that i am seeking them for a young friend of mine we squeeze past the hat and umbrella stand there is just room but one must keep close to the wall the first floor is rather an imposing apartment with a marbletopped sideboard measuring quite three feet by two the doors of which will remain closed if you introduce a wad of paper between them a green tablecloth matching the curtains covers the lootable the lamp is perfectly safe so long as it stands in the exact centre of the table but should not be shifted a paper firestove ornament in some mysterious way bestows upon the room an air of chastity above the mantelpiece is a flyblown mirror between the once gilt frame and glass of which can be inserted invitation cards indeed one or two so remain proving that the tenants even of bedsittingrooms are not excluded from social delights the wall opposite is adorned by an oleograph of the kind cheap jacks sell by auction on saturday nights in the pimlico road and warrant as handmade generally speaking it is a swiss landscape there appears to be more body in a swiss landscape than in scenes from less favoured localities a dilapidated mill a foaming torrent a mountain a maiden and a cow can at the least be relied upon an easy chair i disclaim all responsibility for the adjective stuffed with many coils of steel wire each possessing a business end in admirable working order and covered with horsehair highly glazed awaits the uninitiated there is one way of sitting upon it and only one by using the extreme edge and planting your feet firmly on the floor if you attempt to lean back in it you inevitably slide out of it when so treated it seems to say to you excuse me you are very heavy and you would really be much more comfortable upon the floor thank you so much the bed is behind the door and the washstand behind the bed if you sit facing the window you can forget the bed on the other hand if more than one friend come to call on you you are glad of it as a matter of fact experienced visitors prefer itmake straight for it refusing with firmness to exchange it for the easy chair  and this room is  eight shillings a week sirwith attendance of course  any extras  the lamp sir is eighteenpence a week and the kitchen fire if the gentleman wishes to dine at home two shillings  and fire  sixpence a scuttle sir i charge for coals  its rather a small scuttle  the landlady bridles a little the usual size i think sir one presumes there is a special size in coalscuttles made exclusively for lodginghouse keepers  i agree that while i am about it i may as well see the other room the third floor back the landlady opens the door for me but remains herself on the landing she is a stout lady and does not wish to dwarf the apartment by comparison the arrangement here does not allow of your ignoring the bed it is the life and soul of the room and it declines to efface itself its only possible rival is the washstand strawcoloured with staring white basin and jug together with other appurtenances it glares defiantly from its corner i know im small it seems to say but im very useful and i wont be ignored the remaining furniture consists of a couple of chairsthere is no hypocrisy about them they are not easy and they do not pretend to be easy a small chest of lightpainted drawers before the window with white china handles upon which is a tiny lookingglass and occupying the entire remaining space after allowing three square feet for the tenant when he arrives an attenuated fourlegged table apparently homemade the only ornament in the room is suspended above the fireplace a funeral card framed in beer corks as the corpse introduced by the ancient egyptians into their banquets it is hung there perhaps to remind the occupant of the apartment that the luxuries and allurements of life have their end or maybe it consoles him in despondent moments with the reflection that after all he might be worse off  the rent of this room is threeandsixpence a week also including attendance lamp as for the first floor eighteenpence but kitchen fire a shilling  but why should kitchen fire for the first floor be two shillings and for this only one  well as a rule sir the first floor wants more cooking done  you are quite right my dear lady i was forgetting the gentleman in the third floor back cooking for him is not a great tax upon the kitchen fire his breakfast it is what madam we call plain i think his lunch he takes out you may see him walking round the quiet square up and down the narrow street that leading to nowhere in particular is between twelve and two somewhat deserted he carries a paper bag into which at intervals when he is sure nobody is looking his mouth disappears from studying the neighbourhood one can guess what it contains saveloys hereabouts are plentiful and only twopence each there are pie shops where meat pies are twopence and fruit pies a penny the lady behind the counter using deftly a broad flat knife lifts the little dainty with one twist clean from its tiny dish it is marvellous having regard to the thinness of the pastry that she never breaks one roleypoley pudding sweet and wonderfully satisfying more especially when cold is but a penny a slice peas pudding though this is an awkward thing to eat out of a bag is comforting upon cold days then with his tea he takes two eggs or a haddock the fourpenny size maybe on rare occasions a chop or steak and you fry it for him madam though every time he urges on you how much he would prefer it grilled for fried in your one fryingpan its flavour becomes somewhat confused but maybe this is the better for him for shutting his eyes and trusting only to smell and flavour he can imagine himself enjoying variety he can begin with herrings pass on to liver and bacon opening his eyes again for a moment perceive that he has now arrived at the joint and closing them again wind up with distinct suggestion of toasted cheese thus avoiding monotony for dinner he goes out again maybe he is not hungry late meals are a mistake or maybe putting his hand into his pocket and making calculations beneath a lamppost appetite may come to him then there are places cheerful with the sound of frizzling fat where fried plaice brown and odorous may be had for three halfpence and a handful of sliced potatoes for a penny where for fourpence succulent stewed eels may be discussed vinegar ad lib or for sevenpencebut these are redletter eveningshalf a sheeps head may be indulged in which is a supper fit for any king who happened to be hungry  i explain that i will discuss the matter with my young friend when he arrives the landlady says certainly sir she is used to what she calls the wandering christian and easing my conscience by slipping a shilling into the slaveys astonished lukewarm hand i pass out again into the long dreary street now echoing maybe to the sad cry of muffins  or sometimes of an evening the lamp lighted the remnants of the meat tea cleared away the flickering firelight cosifying the dingy rooms i go avisiting there is no need for me to ring the bell to mount the stairs through the thin transparent walls i can see you plainly old friends of mine fashions a little changed that is all we wore bellshaped trousers eightandsix to measure sevenandsix if from stock fastened our neckties in dashing style with a horseshoe pin i think in the matter of waistcoats we had the advantage of you ours were gayer braver our cuffs and collars were of paper sixpencehalfpenny the dozen threehalfpence the pair on sunday they were white and glistening on monday less aggressively obvious on tuesday morning decidedly dappled but on tuesday evening when with natty cane or umbrella neatly rolled in patent leather case we took our promenade down oxford streetfashionable hour nine to ten pmwe could shoot our arms and cock our chins with the best your indiarubber linen has its advantages storm does not wither it it braves better the heat and turmoil of the day the passing of a sponge and your dicky is itself again we had to use breadcrumbs and so sacrifice the glaze yet i cannot help thinking that for the first few hours at all events our paper was more dazzling  for the rest i see no change in you old friends i wave you greeting from the misty street god rest you gallant gentlemen lonely and friendless and despised making the best of joyless lives keeping yourselves genteel on twelve fifteen or eighteen ah but you are plutocrats shillings a week saving something even of that maybe to help the old mother in the country so proud of her gentleman son who has book learning and who is something in the city may nothing you dismay bullied and badgered and baited from nine to six though you may be from then till bedtime you are rorty young dogs the halfguinea topper as worn by the prince of wales ah how many a meal has it not

will pass for new a pleasant evening to you may your cheap necktie make all the impression your soul can desire may your penny cigar be mistaken for havana may the barmaid charm your simple heart by addressing you as baby may some sweet shopgirl throw a kindly glance at you inviting you to walk with her may she snigger at your humour may other dogs cast envious looks at you and may no harm come of it  you dreamers of dreams you who while your companions play and sleep will toil upward in the night you have read mr smiles selfhelp longfellows psalm of life and so strengthened attack with confidence french without a master bookkeeping in six lessons with a sigh to yourselves you turn aside from the alluring streets from the bright bewitching eyes into the stuffy air of birkbeck institutions polytechnic schools may success compensate you for your youth devoid of pleasure may the partners chair you seen in visions be yours before the end may you live one day in clapham in a twelveroomed house  and after all we have our moments have we not the saturday night at the play the hours of waiting they are short we converse with kindred souls of the british drama its past and future we have our views we dream of florence this kate that in a little while we shall see her ah could she but know how we loved her her photo is on our mantelpiece transforming the dismal little room into a shrine the poem we have so often commenced when it is finished we will post it to her at least she will acknowledge its receipt we can kiss the paper her hand has rested on the great doors groan then quiver ah the wild thrill of that moment now push for all you are worth charge wriggle squirm it is an epitome of life we are throughcollarless panting pummelled from top to toe but what of that upward still upward then downward with leaps at risk of our neck from bench to bench through the gloom we have gained the front row would we exchange sensations with the stallite strolling languidly to his seat the extravagant dinner once a week we banquet a la francais in soho for oneandsix including wine does tortoni ever give his customers a repast they enjoy more i trow not  my first lodging was an attic in a square the other side of blackfriars bridge the rent of the room if i remember rightly was three shillings a week with cooking halfacrown without i purchased a methylated spirit stove with kettle and fryingpan and took it without  old hasluck would have helped me willingly and there were others to whom i might have appealed but a boys pride held me back i would make my way alone win my place in the world by myself to hal knowing he would sympathise with me i confided the truth  had your mother lived he told me i should have had something to say on the subject of course i knew what had happened but as it iswell you need not be afraid i shall not offer you help indeed i should refuse it were you to ask put your carlyle in your pocket he is not all voices but he is the best maker of men i know the great thing to learn of life is not to be afraid of it  look me up now and then he added and well talk about the stars the future of socialism and the woman questionanything you like except about yourself and your twopennyhalfpenny affairs  from another it would have sounded brutal but i understood him and so we shook hands and parted for longer than either of us at the time expected the francogerman war broke out a few weeks later on and hal the love of adventure always strong within him volunteered his services which were accepted it was some years before we met again  on the doorpost of a house in farringdon street not far from the circus stood in those days a small brass plate announcing that the ludgate news rooms occupied the third and fourth floors and that the admission to the same was one penny we were a seedy company that every morning crowded into these rooms clerks shopmen superior artisans travellers warehousemenall of us out of work most of us were young but with us was mingled a sprinkling of elder men and these latter were always the saddest and most silent of this little whispering army of the downatheel roughly speaking we were divided into two groups the newcomers cheery confident these would flit from newspaper to newspaper with buzz of pleasant anticipation select their advertisement as one choosing some dainty out of a rich and varied menu card and replying to it as one conferring favour  dear sirin reply to your advertisement in todays standard i shall be pleased to accept the post vacant in your office i am of good appearance and address i am an excellent it was really marvellous the quality and number of our attainments french we wrote and spoke it fluently a la ahn german of this we possessed a slighter knowledge it was true but sufficient for mere purposes of commerce bookkeeping arithmetic geometry we played with them the love of work it was a passion with us our moral character it would have adorned a free kirk elder i could call on you tomorrow or friday between eleven and one or on saturday any time up till two salary required two guineas a week an early answer will oblige yours truly  the old stagers did not buzz hour after hour they sat writing steadily methodically with day by day less hope and heavier fears  siryour advt in todays d t i am of such and such an age list of qualifications less lengthy set forth with more modesty object desired being air of verisimilitudeif you decide to engage me i will endeavour to give you every satisfaction any time you like to appoint i will call on you i should not ask a high salary to start with yours obediently  dozens of the first letter hundreds of the second i wrote with painful care pen carefully chosen the oneinch margin down the left hand side of the paper first portioned off with dots to three or four i received a curt reply instructing me to call but the shyness that had stood so in my way during the earlier half of my school days had now i know not why returned upon me hampering me at every turn a shy child grownup folks at all events can understand and forgive but a shy young man is not unnaturally regarded as a fool i gave the impression of being awkward stupid sulky the more i strove against my temperament the worse i became my attempts to be at my ease to assert myself resultedi could see it myselfonly in rudeness  well i have got to see one or two others we will write and let you know was the conclusion of each interview and the end as far as i was concerned of the enterprise  my few pounds guard them how i would were dwindling rapidly looking back it is easy enough to regard ones early struggles from a humorous point of view one knows the story it all ended happily but at the time there is no means of telling whether ones biography is going to be comedy or tragedy there were moments when i felt confident it was going to be the latter occasionally when one is feeling well it is not unpleasant to contemplate with pathetic sympathy ones own deathbed one thinks of the friends and relations who at last will understand and regret one be sorry they had not behaved themselves better but myself there was no one to regret i felt very small very helpless the world was big i feared it might walk over me trample me down never seeing me i seemed unable to attract its attention  one morning i found waiting for me at the reading room another of the usual missives it ran will mr p kelver call at the above address tomorrow morning between tenthirty and eleven the paper was headed lott and co indian commission agents aldersgate street without much hope i returned to my lodgings changed my clothes donned my silk hat took my one pair of gloves drew its silk case over my holey umbrella and so equipped for fight with fate made my way to aldersgate street for a quarter of an hour or so being too soon i walked up and down the pavement outside the house gazing at the secondfloor windows behind which so the doorplate had informed me were the offices of lott  co i could not recall their advertisement nor my reply to it the firm was evidently not in a very flourishing condition i wondered idly what salary they would offer for a moment i dreamt of a cheeryble brother asking me kindly if i thought i could do with thirty shillings a week as a beginning but the next i recalled my usual fate and considered whether it was even worth while to climb the stairs go through what to me was a painful ordeal merely to be impressed again with the sense of my own worthlessness  a fine rain began to fall i did not wish to unroll my umbrella yet felt nervous for my hat it was five minutes to the half hour listlessly i crossed the road and mounted the bare stairs to the second floor two doors faced me one marked private i tapped lightly at the second not hearing any response after a second or two i tapped again a sound reached me but it was unintelligible i knocked yet again still louder this time i heard a reply in a shrill plaintive tone  oh do come in  the tone was one of pathetic entreaty i turned the handle and entered it was a small room dimly lighted by a dirty window the bottom half of which was rendered opaque by tissue paper pasted to its panes the place suggested a village shop rather than an office pots of jam jars of pickles bottles of wine biscuit tins parcels of drapery boxes of candles bars of soap boots packets of stationery boxes of cigars tinned provisions guns cartridgesthings sufficient to furnish a desert island littered every available corner at a small desk under the window sat a youth with a remarkably small body and a remarkably large head so disproportionate were the two i should hardly have been surprised had he put up his hands and taken it off half in the room and half out i paused  is this lott  co i enquired  no he answered its a room one eye was fixed upon me dull and glassy it never blinked it never wavered with the help of the other he continued his writing  i mean i explained coming entirely into the room are these the offices of lott  co  its one of them he replied the back one if youre really anxious for a job you can shut the door  i complied with his suggestion and then announced that i was mr kelvermr paul kelver  minikins my name he returned sylvanus minikin you dont happen by any chance to know what youve come for i suppose  looking at his body my inclination was to pick my way among the goods that covered the floor and pull his ears for him from his grave and massive face he might for all i knew be the head clerk  i have called to see mr lott i replied with dignity i have an appointment i produced the letter from my pocket and leaning across a sewingmachine i handed it to him for his inspection having read it he suddenly took from its socket the eye with which he had been hitherto regarding me and proceeding to polish it upon his pocket handkerchief turned upon me his other having satisfied himself he handed me back my letter  want my advice he asked  i thought it might be useful to me so replied in the affirmative  hook it was his curt counsel  why i asked isnt he a good employer  replacing his glass eye he turned again to his work if employment is what you want answered mr minikin youll get it best employer in london hell keep you going for twentyfour hours a day and then offer you overtime at half salary  i must get something to do i confessed  sit down then suggested mr minikin rest while you can  i took the chair it was the only chair in the room with the exception of the one minikin was sitting on  apart from his being a bit of a driver i asked what sort of a man is he is he pleasant  never saw him put out but once answered minikin  it sounded well when was that i asked  all the time ive known him  my spirits continued to sink had i been left alone with minikin much longer i might have ended by following his advice hooking it before mr lott arrived but the next moment i heard the other door open and some one entered the private office then the bell rang and minikin disappeared leaving the communicating door ajar behind him the conversation that i overheard was as follows  why isnt mr skeat here  because he hasnt come  where are the letters  under your nose  how dare you answer me like that  well its the truth they are under your nose  did you give thorneycrofts man my message  yes  what did he answer  said you were a liar  oh he did did he what did you reply  asked him to tell me something i didnt know  thought that clever didnt you  not bad  whatever faults might be laid to mr lotts door he at least i concluded possesssed the virtue of selfcontrol  anybody been here  yes  who  mr

you have finished them  half an hour after i have begun them  get out get out has that door been open all the time  well i dont suppose its opened itself  minikin reentered with papers in his hand in you go he said heaven help you and i passed in and closed the door behind me  the room was a replica of the one i had just left if possible it was more crowded more packed with miscellaneous articles i picked my way through these and approached the desk mr lott was a small dingylooking man with very dirty hands and small restless eyes i was glad that he was not imposing or my shyness might have descended upon me as it was i felt better able to do myself justice at once he plunged into the business by seizing and waving in front of my eyes a bulky bundle of letters tied together with red tape  one hundred and seventeen answers to an advertisement he cried with evident satisfaction in one day that shows you the state of the labour market  i agreed it was appalling  poor devils poor devils murmured mr lott what will become of them some of them will starve terrible death starvation kelver takes such a long timeespecially when youre young  here also i found myself in accord with him  living with your parents  i explained to him my situation  any friends  i informed him i was entirely dependent upon my own efforts  any money anything coming in  i told him i had a few pounds still remaining to me but that after that was gone i should be penniless  and to think kelver that there are hundreds thousands of young fellows precisely in your position how sad how very sad how long have you been looking for a berth  a month i answered him  i thought as much do you know why i selected your letter out of the whole batch  i replied i hoped it was because he judged from it i should prove satisfactory  because its the worst written of them all he pushed it across to me look at it awful isnt it  i admitted that handwriting was not my strong point  nor spelling either he added and with truth who do you think will engage you if i dont  nobody he continued without waiting for me to reply a month hence you will still be looking for a berth and a month after that now im going to do you a good turn save you from destitution give you a start in life  i expressed my gratitude  he waived it aside that is my notion of philanthropy help those that nobody else will help that young fellow in the other roomhe isnt a bad worker hes smart but hes impertinent  i murmured that i had gathered so much  doesnt mean to be cant help it noticed his trick of looking at you with his glass eye keeping the other turned away from you  i replied that i had  always does it used to irritate his last employer to madness said to him one day do turn that signal lamp of yours off minikin and look at me with your real eye what do you think he answered that it was the only one hed got and that he didnt want to expose it to shocks wouldnt have mattered so much if it hadnt been one of the ugliest men in london  i murmured my indignation  i put up with him nobody else would the poor fellow must live  i expressed admiration at mr lotts humanity  you dont mind work youre not one of those goodfornothings who sleep all day and wake up when its time to go home  i assured him that in whatever else i might fail i could promise him industry  with some of them complained mr lott in a tone of bitterness its nothing but play girls gadding about the streets work businessoh no i may go bankrupt my wife and children may go into the workhouse no thought for me the man that keeps them feeds them clothes them how much salary do you want  i hesitated i gathered this was not a cheeryble brother it would be necessary to be moderate in ones demands fiveandtwenty shillings a week i suggested  he repeated the figure in a scream fiveandtwenty shillings for writing like that and cant spell commission dont know anything about the business fiveandtwentytell you what ill do ill give you twelve  but i cant live on twelve i explained  cant live on twelve do you know why because you dont know how to live i know you all one veal and ham pie one roleypoley one dutch cheese and a pint of bitter  his recital made my mouth water  you overload your stomachs then you cant work half the diseases you young fellows suffer from are brought about by overeating  now you take my advice continued mr lott try vegetarianism in the morning a little oatmeal wonderfully strengthening stuff oatmeal look at the scotch for dinner beans why do you know theres more nourishment in half a pint of lentil beans than in a pound of beefsteakmore gluten thats what you want more gluten no corpses no dead bodies why ive known young fellows vegetarians who have lived like fighting cocks on sevenpence a day seven times seven are fortynine how much do you pay for your room  i told him  fourandapenny and twoandsix makes sixandseven that leaves you five and fivepence for mere foolery good god what more do you want  ill take eighteen sir i answered i cant really manage on less  very well i wont beat you down he answered fifteen shillings a week  i said eighteen i persisted  well and i said fifteen he retorted somewhat indignant at the quibbling thats splitting the difference isnt it i cant be fairer than that  i dared not throw away the one opportunity that had occurred anything was better than return to the reading rooms and the empty days full of despair i accepted and it was agreed that i should come the following monday morning  nabbed was minikins enquiry on my return to the back office for my hat  i nodded  whats he wasting on you  fifteen shillings a week i whispered  felt sure somehow that hed take a liking to you answered minikin dont be ungrateful and look thin on it  outside the door i heard mr lotts shrill voice demanding to know where postage stamps were to be found  at the postoffice was minikins reply  the hours were longin fact we had no office hours we got away when we could which was rarely before seven or eightbut my work was interesting it consisted of buying for unfortunate clients in india or the colonies anything they might happen to want from a stage coach to a pot of marmalade packing it and shipping it across to them our commission was anything they could be persuaded to pay over and above the value of the article i was not much interfered with there was that to be said for lott  co so long as the work was done he was quite content to leave one to ones own way of doing it and hastening through the busy streets bargaining in shop or warehouse bustling important in and out the swarming docks i often thanked my stars that i was not as some poor twopoundaweek clerk chained to a dreary desk  the fifteen shillings a week was a tight fit but that was not my trouble reduce your denominatoryou know the quotation i found it no philosophical cant but a practical solution of life my food cost me on the average a shilling a day if more of us limited our commissariat bill to the same figure there would be less dyspepsia abroad generally i cooked my own meals in my own fryingpan but occasionally i would indulge myself with a more orthodox dinner at a cook shop or tea with hot buttered toast at a coffeeshop and but for the greasy tablecloth and the dirtyhanded waiter such would have been even greater delights the shilling a week for amusements afforded me at least one occasionally two visits to the theatre for in those days there were paradises where for sixpence one could be a god fourpence a week on tobacco gave me halfadozen cigarettes a day i have spent more on smoke and derived less satisfaction dress was my greatest difficulty one anxiety in life the poor man is saved he knows not the haunting sense of debt my tailor never dunned me his principle was halfacrown down on receipt of order the balance on the handing over of the goods no system is perfect the method avoided friction it is true yet on the other hand it was annoying to be compelled to promenade come sundays in shiny elbows and frayed trousers knowing all the while that finished waiting was a suit in which one might have made ones markhad only one shut ones eyes passing that pastrycooks window on payday surely there should be a sumptuary law compelling pastrycooks to deal in cellars or behind drawn blinds  were it because of its mere material hardships that to this day i think of that period of my life with a shudder i should not here confess to it i was alone i knew not a living soul to whom i dared to speak who cared to speak to me for those first twelve months after my mothers death i lived alone thought alone felt alone in the morning during the busy day it was possible to bear but in the evenings the sense of desolation gripped me like a physical pain the summer evenings came again bringing with them the long lingering light so laden with melancholy i would walk into the parks and sitting there watch with hungry eyes the men and women boys and girls moving all around me talking laughing interested in one another feeling myself some speechless ghost seeing but not seen crying to the living with a voice they heard not sometimes a solitary figure would pass by and glance back at me some lonely creature like myself longing for human sympathy in the teeming city must have been thousands suchyoung men and women to whom a friendly ear a kindly voice would have been as the water of life each imprisoned in his solitary cell of shyness we looked at one another through the grating with condoling eyes further than that was forbidden to us once in kensington gardens a woman turned then slowly retracing her steps sat down beside me on the bench neither of us spoke had i done so she would have risen and moved away yet there was understanding between us to each of us it was some comfort to sit thus for a little while beside the other had she poured out her heart to me she could have told me nothing more than i knew i too am lonely friendless i too long for the sound of a voice the touch of a hand it is hard for you it is harder still for me a girl shut out from the bright world that laughs around me denied the right of youth to joy and pleasure denied the right of womanhood to love and tenderness  the footsteps to and fro grew fewer she moved to rise stirred by an impulse i stretched out my hand then seeing the flush upon her face drew it back hastily but the next moment changing her mind she held hers out to me and i took it it was the first clasp of a hand i had felt since six months before i had said goodbye to hal she turned and walked quickly away i stood watching her she never looked round and i never saw her again  i take no credit to myself for keeping straight as it is termed during these days for good or evil my shyness prevented my taking part in the flirtations of the streets whether inviting eyes were ever thrown to me as to others i cannot say sometimes fancying sohoping so i would follow yet never could i summon up sufficient resolution to face the possible rebuff before some less timid swain would swoop down upon the quarry then i would hurry on cursing myself for the poorness of my spirit fancying mocking contempt in the laughter that followed me  on a sunday i would rise early and take long solitary walks into the country one winters dayi remember it was on the road between edgware and stanmorethere issued from a byroad a little ahead of me a party of boys and girls young people about my own age bound evidently on a skating expedition i could hear the musical ring of their blades clattering as they walked and the sound of their merry laughter so clear and belllike through the frosty air and an aching anguish fell upon me i felt a mad desire to run after them to plead with them to let me walk with them a little way to let me laugh and talk with them every now and then they would pirouette to cry some jest to one another i could see their faces the girls so sweetly alluring framed by their dainty hats and furs the bright colour in their cheeks the light in their teasing eyes a little further on they turned aside into a bylane and i stood at the corner listening till the last echo of their joyous voices died away and on a stone that still remains standing there i sat down and sobbed  i would walk about the streets always till very late i dreaded the echoing clang of the little front door when i closed it behind me the climbing of the silent stairs the solitude that waited for me in my empty room it would rise and come towards me like some living thing kissing me with cold lips often unable to bear the closeness of its presence i would creep out into the streets there even though it followed me i was not alone with it sometimes i would pace them the whole night sharing them with the other outcasts while the city slept  occasionally during these nightly wanderings would come to me moments of exaltation when fear fell from me and my blood would leap with joy at prospect of the fierce struggle opening out before me then it was the ghostly city sighing round me that seemed dead i the only living thing real among a world of shadows in long echoing streets i would laugh and shout misunderstanding policemen would turn their bullseyes on me gruffly give me practical advice they knew not who i was i stood the centre of a vast galantyshow the phantom houses came and went from some there shone bright lights the doors were open and little figures flitted in and out the tiny coaches glided to and fro manikins grotesque but pitiful crept across the starlit curtain  then the mood would change the city grim and vast stretched round me endless i crawled a mere atom within its folds helpless insignificant absurd the houseless forms that shared my vigil were my fellows what were we animalcule upon its bosom that it saw not heeded not for company i would mingle with them ragged men frowsy women ageless youths gathered round the red glow of some coffee stall  rarely would we speak to one another more like animals we browsed there sipping the halfpenny cup of hot water coloured with coffee grounds at least it was warm munching the moist slab of coarse cake looking with dull indifferent eyes each upon the wretchedness of the others perhaps some two would whisper to each other in listless monotonous tone broken here and there by a short mirthless laugh some shivering creature not yet casehardened to despair seek perhaps the relief of curses that none heeded later a faint chill breeze would shake the shadows loose a thin wan light streak the dark air with shade and silently stealthily we would fade away and disappear    chapter ii  paul escaping from his solitude falls into strange company and becomes captive to one of haughty mien  all things pass even the selfinflicted sufferings of shy young men condemned by temperament to solitude came the winter evenings i took to work in it one may drown much sorrow for oneself with its handful of fire its two candles lighted my apartment was more inviting i bought myself paper pens and ink great or small what more can a writer do he is but the wouldbe medium will the spirit voices employ him or reject him  london with its million characters grave and gay its ten thousand romances its mysteries its pathos and its humour lay to my hand it stretched before me asking only intelligent observation more or less truthful report but that i could make a story out of the things i really knew never occurred to me my tales were of cottage maidens of bucolic yeomen my scenes were laid in windmills among mountains or in moated granges i fancy this phase of folly is common to most youthful fictionists  a trail of gentle melancholy lay over them sentiment was more popular then than it is now and as do all beginners i scrupulously followed fashion generally speaking to be a heroine of mine was fatal however naturally her hair might curland curly hair i believe is the hallmark of vitality whatever other indications of vigorous health she might exhibit in the first chapter such as dancing eyes colour that came and went ringing laughter fawnlike agility she was tolerably certain poor girl to end in an untimely grave snowdrops and early primroses my botany i worked up from a useful little volume our garden favourites illustrated grew there as in a forcing house and if in the neighbourhood of the coast the seabreezes would choose that particular churchyard somewhat irreverently for their favourite playground years later a whitehaired man would come there leading little children by the hand and to them he would tell the tale anew which must have been a dismal entertainment for them  now and then by way of change it would be the gentleman who would fall a victim of the deadly atmosphere of my literature it was of no particular consequence so he himself would conclude in his last soliloquy it was better so snowdrops and primroses for whatever consolation they might have been to him it was hopeless for him to expect his grave marked by a rude cross being as a rule situate in an exceptionally unfrequented portion of the african veldt or amid burning sands for description of final scenery on these occasions a visit to the british museum readingroom would be necessary  dismal little fledgelings and again and again would i drive them from the nest again and again they fluttered back to me soiled crumpled physically damaged yet one person had admired them cried over themmyself  all methods i tried sometimes i would send them forth accompanied by a curt business note of the takeitorleaveit order at other times i would attach to it pathetic appeals for its consideration sometimes i would give value to it stating that the price was five guineas and requesting that the cheque should be crossed at other times seek to tickle editorial cupidity by offering this my first contribution to their pages for nothingmy sample packet so to speak sent gratis one trial surely sufficient now i would write sarcastically enclosing together with the stamped envelope for return a brutally penned note of rejection or i would write frankly explaining elaborately that i was a beginner and asking to be told my faultsif any  not one found a resting place for its feet a month a week a couple of days they would remain away from me then return i never lost a single one i wished i had it would have varied the monotony  i hated the poor little slavey who bursting joyously into the room would hold them out to me from between her apronhidden thumb and finger her chronic sniff i translated into contempt if flying down the stairs at the sound of the postmans knock i secured it from his hands it seemed to me he smiled tearing them from their envelopes i would curse them abuse them fling them into the fire sometimes but before they were more than scorched i would snatch them out smooth them reread them the editor himself could never have seen them it was impossible some jealous underling had done this thing i had sent them to the wrong paper they had arrived at the inopportune moment their triumph would come rewriting the first and last sheets i would send them forth again with fresh hope  meanwhile understanding that the wouldbe happy warrior must shine in camp as well as field i sought to fit myself also for the social side of life smoking and drinking were the twin sins i found most difficulty in acquiring i am not claiming a mental excellence so much as confessing a bodily infirmity the spirit had always been willing but my flesh was weak fired by emulation i had at school occasionally essayed a cigarette the result had been distinctly unsatisfactory and after some two or three attempts i had abandoned for the time being all further endeavour excusing my faintheartedness by telling myself with sanctimonious air that smoking was bad for growing boys attempting to delude myself by assuming in presence of contemporaries of stronger stomach fine pose of disapproval yet in my heart knowing myself a young hypocrite disguising physical cowardice in the robes of moral courage a selfdeception to which human nature is prone  so likewise now and again i had tasted the wine that was red and that stood year in year out decanted on our sideboard the true inwardness of st pauls prescription had been revealed to me the attitudesometimes sneered atof those who drink it under doctors orders regarding it purely as a medicine appeared to me reasonable i had noticed also that others some of them grown men even making wry faces when drinking my mothers claret and had concluded therefrom that taste for strong liquor was an accomplishment less easily acquired than is generally supposed the lack of it in a young man could be no disgrace and accordingly effort in that direction also had i weakly postponed  but now a gentleman at large my education could no longer be delayed to the artist in particular was trainingand severe trainingan absolute necessity recently fashion has changed somewhat but a quarter of a century ago a genius who did not smoke and drinkand that more than was good for himwould have been dismissed without further evidence as an impostor about the genius i was hopeful but at no time positively certain as regarded the smoking and drinking so much at least i could make sure of i set to work methodically conscientiously smoking experience taught me was better practised on saturday nights sunday affording me the opportunity of walking off the effects patience and determination were eventually crowned with success i learned to smoke a cigarette to all appearance as though i were enjoying it young men of less character might here have rested content but attainment of the highest has always been with me a motive force the cigarette conquered i next proceeded to attack the cigar my first one i remember well most men do it was at a smoking concert held in the islington drill hall to which minikin had invited me not feeling sure whether my growing dizziness were due solely to the cigar or in part to the hot overcrowded room i made my excuses and slipped out i found myself in a small courtyard divided from a neighbouring garden by a low wall the cause of my trouble was clearly the cigar my inclination was to take it from my mouth and see how far i could throw it conscience on the other hand urged me to persevere it occurred to me that if climbing on to the wall i could walk along it from end to end there would be no excuse for my not heeding the counsels of perfection if on the contrary try as i might the wall proved not wide enough for my footsteps then i should be entitled to lose the beastly thing and as best i could make my way home to bed i attained the wall with some difficulty and commenced my selfinflicted ordeal two yards further i found myself lying across the wall my legs hanging down one side my head overhanging the other the position proving suitable to my requirements i maintained it inclination again seizing its opportunity urged me then and there to take a solemn vow never to smoke again i am proud to write that through that hour of temptation i remained firm strengthening myself by whispering to myself never despair what others can do so can you is not all victory won through suffering  a liking for drink i had found if possible even yet more difficult of achievement spirits i almost despaired of once confusing bottles i drank some hair oil in mistake for whiskey and found it decidedly less nauseous but twice a week i would force myself to swallow a glass of beer standing over myself insisting on my draining it to the bitter dregs as reward afterwards to take the taste out of my mouth i would treat myself to chocolates at the same time comforting myself by assuring myself that it was for my good that there would come a day when i should really like it and be grateful to myself for having been severe with myself  in other and more sensible directions i sought also to progress gradually i was overcoming my shyness it was a slow process i found the best plan was not to mind being shy to accept it as part of my temperament and with others laugh at it the coldness of an indifferent world is of service in hardening a too sensitive skin the gradual rubbings of existence were rounding off my many corners i became possible to my fellow creatures and they to me i began to take pleasure in their company  by directing me to this particular house in nelson square fate had done to me a kindness i flatter myself we were an interesting menagerie gathered together under its leaky roof mrs peedles our landlady who slept in the basement with the slavey had been an actress in charles keanes company at the old princesss there it is true she had played only insignificant parts london as she would explain to us was even then but a poor judge of art with

and there say lady macbeths sleepwalking scene or from ophelias entrance in the fourth act it would be no trouble her memory was excellent we would hasten to assure her of our perfect faith  listening to her it was difficult as she herself would frankly admit to imagine her the once arch miss lucretia barry looking at her to remember there had been an evening when she had been the cynosure of every eye one found it necessary to fortify oneself with perusal of underlined extracts from ancient journals much thumbed and creased thoughtfully lent to one for the purpose since those days fate had woven round her a mantle of depression she was now a faded wateryeyed little woman prone on the slightest provocation to sit down suddenly on the nearest chair and at once commence a history of her troubles quite unconscious of this failing it was an idea of hers that she was an exceptionally cheerful person  but there frettings no good we must grin and bear things in this world she would conclude wiping her eyes upon her apron its better to laugh than to cry i always say and to prove that this was no mere idle sentiment she would laugh then and there upon the spot  much stairclimbing had bestowed upon her a shortness of breath which no amount of panting in her resting moments was able to make good  you dont know ow to breathe explained our second floor front to her on one occasion a kindly young man you dont swallow it you only gargle with it take a good draught and shut your mouth dont be frightened of it dont let it out again till its done something thats what its ere for  he stood over her with his handkerchief pressed against her mouth to assist her but it was of no use  there dont seem any room for it inside me she explained  bells had become to her the business of life she lived listening for them converse to her was a filling in of time while waiting for interruptions  a bottle of whiskey fell into my hands that christmas time a present from a commercial traveller in the way of business not liking whiskey myself it was no sacrifice for me to reserve it for the occasional comfort of mrs peedles when breathless with her hands to her side she would sink upon the chair nearest to my door her poor washedout face would lighten at the suggestion  ah well she would reply i dont mind if i do its a poor heart that never rejoices  and then her tongue unloosened she would sit there and tell me stories of my predecessors young men lodgers who like myself had taken her bedsittingrooms and of the woes and misfortunes that had overtaken them i gathered that a more unlucky house i could not have selected a former tenant of my own room of whom i strangely reminded her had written poetry on my very table he was now in portland doing five years for forgery mrs peedles appeared to regard the two accomplishments as merely different expressions of the same art another of her young men as she affectionately called us had been of studious ambition his career up to a point appeared to have been brilliant what he mightnt have been according to mrs peedles there was practically no saying what he happened to be at the moment of conversation was an unpromising inmate of the hanwell lunatic asylum  ive always noticed it mrs peedles would explain its always the most deserving those that try hardest to whom trouble comes im sure i dont know why  i was glad on the whole when that bottle of whiskey was finished a second might have driven me to suicide  there was no mr peedlesat least not for mrs peedles though as an individual he continued to exist he had been general utility at the princesssthe old terms were still in vogue at that timea fine figure of a man in his day so i was given to understand but one easily led away especially by minxes mrs peedles spoke bitterly of general utilities as people of not much use  for working days mrs peedles had one dress and one cap both black and void of ostentation but on sundays and holidays she would appear metamorphosed she had carefully preserved the bulk of her stage wardrobe even to the pastedecked shoes and tinsel jewelry shapeless in classic garb as hermia or bulgy in brocade and velvet as lady teazle she would receive her few visitors on sunday evenings discarded puppets like herself with whom the conversation was of gayer nights before their wires had been cut or her glory hid from the ribald street beneath a mackintosh pay her few calls maybe it was the unusual excitement that then brought colour into her furrowed cheeks that straightened and darkened her eyebrows at other times so singularly unobtrusive be this how it may the change was remarkable only the thin grey hair and the workworn hands remaining for purposes of identification nor was the transformation merely one of surface mrs peedles hung on her hook behind the kitchen door dingy limp discarded out of the wardrobe with the silks and satins was lifted down to be put on as an undergarment miss lucretia barry like her costumes somewhat aged somewhat withered but still distinctly arch  in the room next to me lived a lawwriter and his wife they were very old and miserably poor the fault was none of theirs despite copybooks maxims there is in this world such a thing as illluckpersistent monotonous that gradually wears away all power of resistance i learned from them their history it was hopelessly simple hopelessly uninstructive he had been a schoolmaster she a pupil teacher they had married young and for a while the world had smiled upon them then came illness attacking them both nothing out of which any moral could be deduced a mere case of bad drains resulting in typhoid fever they had started again saddled by debt and after years of effort had succeeded in clearing themselves only to fall again this time in helping a friend nor was it even a case of folly a poor man who had helped them in their trouble hardly could they have done otherwise without proving themselves ungrateful and so on a tedious tale commonplace trivial now listless patient hard working they had arrived at an animallike indifference to their fate content so long as they could obtain the bare necessities of existence passive when these were not forthcoming their interest in life limited to the one luxury of the pooran occasional glass of beer or spirits often days would go by without his obtaining any work and then they would more or less starve law documents are generally given out to such men in the evening to be returned finished the next morning waking in the night i would hear through the thin wooden partition that divided our rooms the even scratching of his pen  thus cheek by jowl we worked i my side of the screen he his youth and age hope and realisation  out of him my fears fashioned a vision of the future past his door i would slink on tiptoe dread meeting him upon the stairs once had not he said to himself the worlds mine oyster may not the voices of the night have proclaimed him also king might i not be but an idle dreamer mistaking desire for power would not the world prove stronger than i at such times i would see my life before me the clerkship at thirty shillings a week rising by slow instalments it may be to one hundred and fifty a year the fourroomed house at brixton the girl wife pretty perhaps but sinking so soon into the slatternly woman the squalling children how could i unaided expect to raise myself from the ruck was not this the more likely picture  our second floor front was a young fellow in the commercial line jarman was young london personifiedblatant yet kindhearted aggressively selfassertive generous to a fault cunning yet at the same time frank shrewd cheery and full of pluck never say die was his motto and anything less dead it would be difficult to imagine all day long he was noisy and all night long he snored he woke with a start bathed like a porpoise sang while dressing roared for his boots and whistled during his breakfast his entrance and exit were always to an orchestration of banging doors directions concerning his meals shouted at the top of his voice as he plunged up or down the stairs the clattering and rattling of brooms and pails flying before his feet his departure always left behind it the suggestion that the house was now to let it came almost as a shock to meet a human being on the landing he would have conveyed an atmosphere of bustle to the egyptian pyramids  sometimes carrying his own suppertray arranged for two he would march into my room at first resenting his familiarity i would hint at my desire to be alone would explain that i was busy  you fire away shakespeare redivivus he would reply dont delay the tragedy why should london wait ill keep quiet  but his notion of keeping quiet was to retire into a corner and there amuse himself by enacting a tragedy of his own in a hoarse whisper accompanied by appropriate gesture  ah ah i would hear him muttering to himself i ave killed er good old father i ave falsely accused er young man of all the crimes that i ave myself committed i ave robbed er of er ancestral estates yet she loves me not it is

surprise impossible to renew the thread of my work i would abandon my attempts at literature and instead listen to his talk which was always interesting his conversation was it is true generally about himself but it was none the less attractive on that account his love affairs which appeared to be numerous formed his chief topic there was no reserve about jarman his life contained no secret chambers what he told her straight what she up and said to him in reply was for all the world that cared to hear so far his search after the ideal had met with but ill success  girls he would say

would cheerfully affirm but youve got to look for em theyre not the sort that advertises  behind jarman in the second floor back resided one whom jarman had nicknamed the lady ortensia i believe before my arrival there had been love passages between the two but neither of them so i gathered had upon closer inspection satisfied the others standard their present attitude towards each other was that of insult thinly veiled under exaggerated politeness miss rosina sellars was in her own language a lady assistant in common parlance a barmaid at the ludgate hill station refreshment room she was a large flabby young woman with less powder her complexion might by admirers have been termed creamy as it was it presented the appearance rather of underdone pastry to be on all occasions quite the lady was her pride there were those who held the angle of her dignity to be exaggerated jarman would beg her for her own sake to be more careful lest one day she should fall down backwards and hurt herself on the other hand her bearing was certainly calculated to check familiarity even stockbrokers clerksyoung men as a class with the bump of reverence but poorly developedwould in her presence falter and grow hesitating she had cultivated the art of not noticing to something approaching perfection she could draw the noisiest customer a glass of beer which he had never ordered exchange it for three of whiskey which he had take his money and return him his change without ever seeing him hearing him or knowing he was there it shattered the selfassertion of the youngest of commercial travellers her tone and manner outside rare moments of excitement were suggestive of an offended but forgiving iceberg jarman invariably passed her with his coat collar turned up to his ears and even thus protected might have been observed to shiver her stare in conjunction with her i beg your pardon was a moral douche that would have rendered apologetic and explanatory don juan himself  to me she was always gracious which by contrast to her general attitude towards my sex of studied disdain i confess flattered me she was good enough to observe to mrs peedles who repeated it to me that i was the only gentleman in the house who knew how to behave himself  the entire first floor was occupied by an irishman andthey never minced the matter themselves so hardly is there need for me to do so she was a charming little darkeyed woman an extightrope dancer and always greatly offended mrs peedles by claiming miss lucretia barry as a sister artiste  of course i dont know how it may be now would reply mrs peedles with some slight asperity but in my time we ladies of the legitimate stage used to look down upon dancers and such sort of course no offence to you mrs okelly  neither of them was in the least offended  sure mrs peedles ye could never have looked down upon the signora the okelly would answer laughing ye had to lie back and look up to her why ive got the crick in me neck to this day  ah my dear and you dont know how nervous i was when glancing down id see his handsome face just underneath me thinking that with one false step i might spoil it for ever would reply the signora  me darling id have died happy just smothered in loveliness would return the okelly and he and the signora would rush into each others arms and the sound of their kisses would quite excite the little slavey sweeping down the stairs outside  he was a barrister attached in theory to the western circuit in practice somewhat indifferent to it much more attached to the lower strata of bohemia and the signora at the present he was earning all sufficient for the simple needs of himself and the signora as a teacher of music and singing his method was simple and suited admirably the locality unless specially requested he never troubled his pupils with such tiresome things as scales and exercises his plan was to discover the song the young man fancied himself singing the particular jingle the young lady yearned to knock out of the piano and to teach it to them was it tom bowling well and good come on follow your leader the okelly would sing the first line  now then try that dont be afraid just open yer mouth and gave it tongue thats all right everything has a beginning sure later on well get the time and tune maybe a little expression  whether the system had any merit in it i cannot answer certain it was that as often as not it achieved success graduallysay by the end of twelve eighteenpenny lessonsout of storm and chaos tom bowling would emerge recognisable for all men to hear had the pupil any voice to start with the okelly improved it had he none the okelly would help him to disguise the fact  take it easy now take it easy the okelly would counsel sure its a delicate organ yer voice dont ye strain it now yere at yer best when yere just low and sweet  so also with the blushing pianiste at the end of a month a tune was distinctly discernible she could hear it herself and was happy his repute spread  twice already had he eloped with the signora and twice again was he to repeat the operation before i finally lost sight of him to break oneself of habit is always difficult and once by wellmeaning friends had he been induced to return to home if not to beauty his wife who was considerably older than himself possessed so he would inform me with tears in his eyes every moral excellence that should attract mankind upon her goodness and virtue her piety and conscientiousness he would descant to me by the half hour his sincerity it was impossible to question it was beyond doubt that he respected her admired her honoured her she was a saint an angela wretch a villain such as he was not fit to breathe the same pure air to do him justice it must be admitted he showed no particular desire to do so as an aunt or grandmother i believe he would have suffered her gladly he had nothing to say against her except that he found himself unable to live with her  that she must have been a lady of exceptional merit one felt convinced the signora who had met her only once and then under somewhat trying conditions spoke her praises with equal enthusiasm had she the signora enjoyed the advantage of meeting such a model earlier she the signora might have been a better woman it seemed a pity the introduction could not have taken place sooner and under different circumstances could they both have adopted her as a sort of mutual motherinlaw it would have given them i am positive the greatest satisfaction on her occasional visits they would have vied with each other in showing her affectionate attention for the deserted lady i tried to feel sorry but could not avoid the reflection that it would have been better for all parties had she been less patient and forgiving her husband was evidently much more suited to the signora  indeed the relationship between these two was more a true marriage than one generally meets with no pair of lovebirds could have been more snug together in their virtues and failings alike they fitted each other when sober the immorality of their behaviour never troubled them in fact when sober nothing ever troubled them they laughed joked played through life two happy children to be shocked at them was impossible i tried it and failed  but now and again there came an evening when they were not sober it happened when funds were high on such occasion the okelly would return laden with bottles of a certain sweet champagne of which they were both extremely fond and a friend or two would be invited to share in the festivity whether any exceptional quality resided in this particular brand of champagne i am not prepared to argue my own personal experience of it has prompted me to avoid it for the rest of my life its effect upon them was certainly unique instead of intoxicating them it sobered them there is no other way of explaining it with the third or fourth glass they began to take serious views of life before the end of the second bottle they would be staring at each other appalled at contemplation of their own transgression the signora the tears streaming down her pretty face would declare herself a wicked wicked woman she had dragged down into shame the most blameless the most virtuous of men emptying her glass she would bury her face in her hands and with her elbows on her knees in an agony of remorse sit rocking to and fro the okelly throwing himself at her feet would passionately abjure her to look up she had it appeared got hold of the thing at the wrong end it was he who had dragged her down  at this point metaphor would become confused each had been dragged down by the other one and ruined also each one was the other ones good angel all that was commendable in the signora she owed to the okelly whatever was not discreditable about the okelly was in the nature of a loan from the signora with the help of more champagne the right course would grow plain to them she would go back brokenhearted but repentant to the tightrope he would return a better but a blighted man to mrs okelly and the western circuit this would be their last evening together on earth a fresh bottle would be broached and the guest or guests called upon to assist in the ceremony of renunciation glasses full to the brim this time  so much tragedy did they continue to instil into the scene that on the first occasion of my witnessing it i was unable to refrain from mingling my tears with theirs as however the next morning they had forgotten all about it and as nothing came of it nor of several subsequent repetitions i should have believed a separation between them impossible but that even while i was an inmate of the house the thing actually happened  it came about in this wise his friends having discovered him had pointed out to him again his duty the signoraa really excellent little woman so far as intention was concernedhad seconded their endeavours with the result that on a certain evening in autumn we of the house assembled all of us on the first floor to support them on the occasion of their finalso we all deemed it thenleavetaking for eleven oclock two fourwheeled cabs had been ordered one to transport the okelly with his belongings to hampstead and respectability in the other the signora would journey sorrowfully to the tower basin there to join a circus company sailing for the continent  i knocked at the door some quarter of an hour before the appointed hour of the party i fancy the idea had originated with the signora  dear willie has something to say to you she had informed me that morning on the stairs he has taken a sincere liking to you and it is something very important  they were sitting one each side the fireplace looking very serious a bottle of the sobering champagne stood upon the table the signora rose and kissed me gravely on the brow the okelly laid both hands upon my shoulders and sat me down on a chair between them  mr kelver said the signora you are very young  i hintedit was one of those rare occasions upon which gallantry can be combined with truththat i found myself in company  the signora smiled sadly and shook her head  age said the okelly is a matter of feeling kelver may ye never be as old as i am feeling now  as we are feeling corrected the signora kelver said the okelly pouring out a third glass of champagne we want ye to promise us something  it will make us both happier added the signora  that ye will take warning continued the okelly by our wretched example paul in this world there is only one path to possible happiness the path of strict he paused  propriety suggested the signora  of strict propriety agreed the okelly deviate from it continued the okelly impressively and what is the result  unutterable misery supplied the signora  ye think we two have been happy here together said the okelly  i replied that such was the conclusion to which observation had directed me  we tried to appear so explained the signora it was merely on the outside in reality all the time we hated each other tell him willie dear how we have hated each other  it is impossible said the okelly finishing and putting down his glass to give ye any idea kelver how we have hated each other  how we have quarrelled said the signora tell him dear how we have quarrelled  all day long and half the night concluded the okelly  fought added the signora you see mr kelver people inin our position always do if it had been otherwise ifif everything had been proper then of course we should have loved each other as it is it has been a cat and dog existence hasnt it been a cat and dog existence willie  its been just hell upon earth murmured the okelly with his eyes fixed gloomily upon the firestove ornament deadly in earnest though they both were i could not repress a laugh their excellent intention was so obvious the signora burst into tears  he doesnt believe us she wailed  me dear replied the okelly throwing up his part with promptness and satisfaction how could ye expect it how could he believe that any man could look at ye and hate ye  its all my fault cried the little woman i am such a wicked creature i cannot even be miserable when i am doing wrong a decent woman in my place would have been wretched and unhappy and made everybody about her wretched and unhappy and so have set a good example and have been a warning i dont seem to have any conscience and i do try the poor little lady was sobbing her heart out  when not shy i could be sensible and of the okelly and the signora one could be no more shy than of a pair of robin redbreasts besides i was really fond of them they had been very good to me  dear miss beltoni i answered i am going to take warning by you both  she pressed my hand oh do please do she murmured we really have been miserablenow and then  i am never going to be content i assured her until i find a lady as charming and as amiable as you and if ever i get her ill take good care never to run any risk of losing her  it sounded well and pleased us all the okelly shook me warmly by the hand and this time spoke his real feelings  me boy he said all women are goodfor somebody but the woman that is good for yerself is better for ye than a better woman whos the best for somebody else ye understand  i said i did  at eight oclock precisely mrs peedles arrivedas flora macdonald in green velvet jacket and twelve to fifteen inches of plaid stocking as a topic fitting the occasion we discussed the absent mr peedles and the subject of deserted wives in general  a finelooking man allowed mrs peedles but weakweak as water  the signora agreed that unfortunately there did exist such men twas pitiful but true  my dear continued mrs peedles she wasnt even a lady  the signora expressed astonishment at the deterioration in mr peedles taste thus implied  i wont go so far as to say we never had a difference continued mrs peedles whose object appeared to be an impartial statement of the whole case there may have been incompatability of temperament as they say myself i have always been of a playful dispositionfrivolous some might call me  the signora protested the okelly declined to listen to such aspersion on her character even from mrs peedles herself  mrs peedles thus corrected allowed that maybe frivolous was too sweeping an accusation say sportive  but a good wife to him i always was asserted mrs peedles with a fine sense of justice never flighty like some of them i challenge any one to accuse me of having been flighty  we felt we should not believe any one who did and told her so  mrs peedles drawing her chair closer to the signora assumed a confidential attitude if they want to go let em go i always say she whispered loudly into the signoras ear ten to one theyll find theyve only jumped out of the fryingpan into the fire one can always comfort oneself with that  there seemed to be confusion in the mind of mrs peedles her virtuous sympathies i gathered were with the signora mr okellys return to mrs okelly evidently manifested itself in the light of a shameful desertion having regard to the fact patent to all who knew him that the poor fellow was sacrificing every inclination to stern sense of duty such view of the matter was rough on him but philosophers from all ages have agreed that our good deeds are the whips with which fate punishes us for our bad  my dear continued mrs peedles when mr peedles left me i thought that i should never smile again yet here you see me laughing away through life just as ever youll get over it all right and mrs peedles wiped away her tears and smiled upon the signora upon which the signora commenced to cry again  happily timely diversion was made at this point by the bursting into the room of jarman who upon perceiving mrs peedles at once gave vent to a hoot supposed to be expressive of scottish joy and without a moments hesitation commenced to dance a reel  my neighbours of the first floor knocked at the door a little while afterwards and genteelly late arrived miss rosina sellars coldly gleaming in a decollete but aweinspiring costume of mingled black and scarlet out of which her fair if fleshy neck and arms shone luxuriant  we did not go into supper instead supper came into us from the restaurant at the corner of the blackfriars road i cannot say that at first it was a festive meal the okelly and the signora made effort as in duty bound to be cheerful but for awhile were somewhat unsuccessful the third floor front wasted no time in speech but ate and drank copiously miss sellars retaining her gloveswhich was perhaps wise her hands being her weak pointsignalled me out much to my embarrassment as the recipient of her most polite conversation mrs peedles became reminiscent of parties generally seeing that most of mrs peedles former friends and acquaintances were either dead or in more or less trouble her efforts did not tend to enliven the table one gathering of which the present strangely reminded her was a funeral chiefly remarkable from discovery of the romantic fact late in the proceedings that the gentleman in whose honour the whole affair had been organised was not dead at all but instead having taken advantage of an error arising out of a railway accident was at the moment eloping with the wife of his own chief mourner as mrs peedles explained and as one could well credit it had been an awkward position for all present nobody had quite known whether to feel glad or sorrywith the exception of the chief mourner upon whose personal undertaking that the company might regard the ceremony as merely postponed festivities came to an end  our prop and stay from a convivial point of view was jarman as a delicate attention to mrs peedles and her costume he sunk his nationality and became for the evening according to his own declaration a braw laddie with herhis sonsie lassie so he termed herhe flirted in the broadest if not purest scotch the okelly for him became the laird the third floor jamie o the ilk miss sellars the bonnie wee rose myself the chiel periods of silence were dispersed by suggestions that we should hoot awa jarman himself setting us the example  with the clearance away of the eatables making room for the production of a more varied supply of bottles matters began to mend mrs peedles became more arch jarmans scotch more striking and extensive the lady ortensias remarks less depressingly genteel her aitches less accentuated  jarman rose to propose the health of the okelly coupled with that of the signora to the okelly in a burst of generosity jarman promised our united patronage to jarman it appeared that by employing the okelly to defend us whenever we got into trouble with the police and by recommending him to our friends a steady income should be assured to him  the okelly replied feelingly to the effect that nelson square blackfriars would ever remain engraved upon his memory as the fairest and brightest spot on earth personally nothing would have given him greater pleasure than to die among the dear friends who now surrounded him but there was such a thing as duty and he and the signora had come to the conclusion that true happiness could only be obtained by acting according to ones conscience even if it made one miserable  jarman warming to his work then proposed the health of mrs peedles as truehearted and hardbreathing a lady as ever it had been his privilege to know her talent for cheery conversation was familiar to us all upon it he need not enlarge all he would say was that personally never did she go out of his room without leaving him more cheerful than when she entered it  after thati forget in whatwe drank the health of the lady ortensia persons there werejarman would not attempt to disguise the factwho complained that the lady ortensia was too distant too standoffish with such complaint he himself had no sympathy but tastes differed if the lady ortensia were inclined to be exclusive who should blame her everybody knew their own business best for use in a second floor front he could not honestly recommend the lady ortensia it would not be giving her a fair chance and it would not be giving the second floor a fair chance but for any gentleman fitting up marble halls for any one on the lookout for a really toney article jarman would say inquire for miss rosina sellars and see that you get her  there followed my turn there had been literary chaps in the past jarman admitted so much against them he had nothing to say they had no doubt done their best but the gentleman whose health jarman wished the company now to drink had this advantage over them that they were dead and he wasnt some of this gentlemans work jarman had readin manuscript but that was a distinction purely temporary he jarman claimed to be no judge of literature but this he could and would say it took a good deal to make him miserable yet this the literary efforts of mr kelver invariably accomplished  mrs peedles speaking without rising from personal observation in the daytimewhich she hoped would not be deemed a liberty literature even in manuscript being so to speak public propertyfound herself in a position to confirm all that mr jarman had remarked speaking as one not entirely without authority on the subject of literature and the drama mrs peedles could say that passages she had read had struck her as distinctly not half bad some of the lovescenes in particular had made her to feel quite a girl again how he had acquired such knowledge was not for her to say cries of naughty from jarman and oh mr kelver i shall be quite afraid of you roguishly from miss sellars  the okelly who having abandoned his favourite champagne for less sobering liquor had since suppertime become rapidly more cheerful felt sure there was a future before me that he had not seen any of my work so he assured me in no way lessened his opinion of it one thing only would he impress upon me that the best work was the result of strict attention to virtue his advice to me was to marry young and be happy  my persevering efforts of the last few months towards the acquisition of convivial habits appeared this evening to be receiving their reward the okellys sweet champagne i had drunk with less dislike than hitherto a white syrupy sort of stuff out of a fat and artisticlooking bottle i had found distinctly grateful to the palate dimly the quotation about taking things at the flood and so getting on quickly floated through my brain coupled with another one about fortune favouring the bold it had seemed to me a good occasion to try for the second time in my life a full flavoured cigar i had selected with the caution of a connoisseur one of mottled green complexion from the okellys largest box and so far all had gone well an easy selfconfidence delightful by reason of its novelty had replaced my customary shyness a sense of lightnessof positive airiness emanating from myself pervaded all things tossing off another glass of the champagne i rose to reply  modesty in my present mood would have been affectation to such dear and wellbeloved friends i had no hesitation in admitting the truth that i was a clever fellowa damned clever fellow i knew it they knew it in a short time everybody would know it but they need not fear that in the hour of my pride when it arrived i should prove ungrateful never should i forget their kindness to me a lonely young man alone in a lonelyhere the pathos of my own situation overcame me words seemed weak jarman i meant putting my hand upon his head to have blessed him for his goodness to me but he being not exactly where he looked to be i just missed him and sat down on the edge of my chair which was a hard one i had not intended this to be the end of my speech by a long one but jarman whispering to me ended at exactly the right moment shows the born orator strong inclination to remain seated now that i was down seconding his counsel and the company being clearly satisfied i decided to leave things where they were  a delightful dreaminess was stealing over me everything and everybody appeared to be a long way off but whether because of this or in spite of it exceedingly attractive never had i noticed the signora so bewitching in a motherly sort of way even the third floor front was good to look upon mrs peedles i could almost have believed to be the real flora macdonald sitting in front of me but the vision of miss rosina sellars made literally my head to swim never before had i dared to cast upon female loveliness the satisfying gaze with which i now boldly regarded her every movement evidently she noticed it for she turned away her eyes i had heard that exceptionally strongminded people merely by concentrating their will could make other ordinary people do just whatever they the exceptionally strongminded people wished i willed that miss rosina sellars should turn her eyes again towards me victory crowned my efforts evidently i was one of these exceptionally strongminded persons slowly her eyes came round and met mine with a smilea helpless pathetic smile that said so i read it you know no woman can resist you be merciful  inflamed by the brutal lust of conquest i suppose i must have willed still further for the next thing i remember is sitting with miss sellars on the sofa holding her hand the while the okelly sang a sentimental ballad only one line of which comes back to me for the angels must have told him and he knows i love him now much stress upon the now the others had their backs towards us miss sellars with a look that pierced my heart dropped her somewhat large head upon my shoulder leaving as i observed the next day a patch of powder on my coat  miss sellars observed that one of the saddest things in the world was unrequited love  i replied gallantly whateryou know about it  ah you men you men murmured miss sellars youre all alike  this suggested a personal aspersion on my character not allus i murmured  you dont know what love is said miss sellars youre not old enough  the okelly had passed on to sullivans sweethearts then in its first popularity       oh love for a yeara weeka day      but oh for the love that loves alwaays  miss sellars languishing eyes were fixed upon me miss sellars red lips pouted and twitched miss sellars white bosom rose and fell never so it seemed to me had so large an amount of beauty been concentrated in one being  yeserdo i said i love you  i stooped to kiss the red lips but something was in my way it turned out to be a cold cigar miss sellars thoughtfully removed it and threw it away our lips met her large arms closed about my neck and held me tight  well im sure came the voice of mrs peedles as from afar nice goings on  i have vague remembrance of a somewhat heated discussion in which everybody but myself appeared to be taking extreme interestof miss sellars in her most ladylike and chilling tones defending me against the charge of being no gentleman which mrs peedles was explaining nobody had said i wasnt the argument seemed to be of the circular order no gentleman had ever kissed miss sellars who had not every right to do so nor ever would to kiss miss sellars without such right was to declare oneself no gentleman miss sellars appealed to me to clear my character from the aspersion of being no gentleman i was trying to understand the situation when jarman seizing me somewhat roughly by the arm suggested my going to bed miss sellars seizing my other arm suggested my refusing to go to bed so far i was with miss sellars i didnt want to go to bed and said so my desire to sit up longer was proof positive to miss sellars that i was a gentleman but to no one else the argument shifted the question being now as to whether miss sellars were a lady to prove the point it was according to miss sellars necessary that i should repeat i loved her i did repeat it adding with faint remembrance of my own fiction that if a lifes devotion was likely to be of the slightest further proof my hearts blood was at her service this cleared the air mrs peedles observing that under such circumstances it only remained for her to withdraw everything she had said to which miss sellars replied graciously that she had always known mrs peedles to be a good sort at the bottom  nevertheless gaiety was gone from among us and for this in some way i could not understand i appeared to be responsible jarman was distinctly sulky the okelly suddenly thinking of the time went to the door and discovered that the two cabs were waiting the third floor recollected that work had to be finished i myself felt sleepy  our host and hostess departed jarman again suggested bed and this time i agreed with him after a slight misunderstanding with the door i found myself upon the stairs i had never noticed before that they were quite perpendicular adapting myself to the changed conditions i climbed them with the help of my hands i accomplished the last flight somewhat quickly and feeling tired sat down the moment i was within my own room jarman knocked at the door i told him to come in but he didnt it occurred to me that the reason was i was sitting on the floor with my back against the door the discovery amused me exceedingly and i laughed and jarman baffled descended to his own floor i found getting into bed a difficulty owing to the strange behaviour of the room it spun round and round now the bed was just in front of me now it was behind me i managed at last to catch it before it could get past me and holding on by the ironwork frustrated its efforts to throw me out again on to the floor  but it was some time before i went to sleep and over my intervening experiences i draw a veil    chapter iii  good friends show paul the road to freedom but before setting out he will go avisiting  the sun was streaming into my window when i woke in the morning i sat up and listened the roar of the streets told me plainly that the day had begun without me i reached out my hand for my watch it was not in its usual place upon the rickety dressingtable i raised myself still higher and looked about me my clothes lay scattered on the floor one boot in solitary state occupied the chair by the fireplace the other i could not see anywhere  during the night my head appeared to have grown considerably i wondered idly for the moment whether i had not made a mistake and put on minikins if so i should be glad to exchange back for my own this thing i had got was a topheavy affair and was aching most confoundedly  suddenly the recollection of the previous night rushed at me and shook me awake from a neighbouring steeple rang chimes i counted with care eleven oclock i sprang out of bed and at once sat down upon the floor  i remembered how holding on to the bed i had felt the room waltzing wildly round and round it had not quite steadied itself even yet it was still rotating not whirling now but staggering feebly as though worn out by its allnight orgie creeping to the washstand i succeeded after one or two false plunges in getting my head inside the basin then drawing on my trousers with difficulty and reaching the easychair i sat down and reviewed matters so far as i was able commencing from the present and working back towards the past  i was feeling very ill that was quite clear something had disagreed with me  that strong cigar i whispered feebly to myself i ought never to have ventured upon it and then the little room with all those people in it besides i have been working very hard i must really take more exercise  it gave me some satisfaction to observe that shuffling and cowardly though i might be i was not a person easily bamboozled  nonsense i told myself brutally dont try to deceive me you were drunk  not drunk i pleaded dont say drunk it is such a coarse expression some people cannot stand sweet champagne so i have heard it affected my liver do please make it a question of liver  drunk i persisted unrelentingly hopelessly vulgarly drunkdrunk as any arry after a bank holiday  it is the first time i murmured  it was your first opportunity i replied  never again i promised  the stock phrase i returned  how old are you  nineteen  so you have not even the excuse of youth how do you know that it will not grow upon you that having thus commenced a downward career you will not sink lower and lower and so end by becoming a confirmed sot  my heavy head dropped into my hands and i groaned many a temperance tale perused on sunday afternoons came back to me imaginative in all directions i watched myself hastening toward a drunkards grave now heroically struggling against temptation now weakly yielding the craving growing upon me in the misty air about me i saw my fathers white face my mothers sad eyes i thought of barbara of the scorn that could quiver round that bewitching mouth of hal with his tremendous contempt for all forms of weakness shame of the present and terror of the future between them racked my mind  it shall be never again i cried aloud by god it shall at nineteen one is apt to be vehement i will leave this house at once i continued to myself aloud i will get away from its unwholesome atmosphere i will wipe it out of my mind and all connected with it i will make a fresh start i will  something i had been dimly conscious of at the back of my brain came forward and stood before me the flabby figure of miss rosina sellars what was she doing here what right had she to step between me and my regeneration  the right of your affianced bride my other half explained with a grim smile to myself  did i really go so far as that  we will not go into details i replied i do not wish to dwell upon them that was the result  i wasi was not quite myself at the time i did not know what i was doing  as a rule we dont when we do foolish things but we have to abide by the consequences all the same unfortunately it happened to be in the presence of witnesses and she is not the sort of lady to be easily got rid of you will marry her and settle down with her in two small rooms her people will be your people you will come to know them better before many days are passed among them she is regarded as the lady from which you can judge of them a nice commencement of your career is it not my ambitious young friend a nice mess you have made of it  what am i to do i asked  upon my word i dont know i answered  i passed a wretched day ashamed to face mrs peedles or even the slavey i kept to my room with the door locked at dusk feeling a little betteror rather less bad i stole out and indulged in a simple meal consisting of tea without sugar and a kippered herring at a neighbouring coffeehouse another gentleman taking his seat opposite to me and ordering hot buttered toast i left hastily  at eight oclock in the evening minikin called round from the office to know what had happened seeking help from shame i confessed to him the truth  thought as much he answered seems to have been an a1 from the look of you  i am glad it has happened now it is over i said to him it will be a lesson i shall never forget  i know said minikin nothing like a fair and square drunk for making you feel real good better than a sermon  in my trouble i felt the need of advice and minikin though my junior was i knew far more experienced in worldly affairs than i was  thats not the worst i confided to him what do you think ive done  killed a policeman suggested minikin  got myself engaged  no one like you quiet fellows for going it when you do begin commented minikin nice girl  i dont know i answered i only know i dont want her how can i get out of it  minikin removed his left eye and commenced to polish it upon his handkerchief a habit he had when in doubt from looking into it he appeared to derive inspiration  takeherownpart sort of a girl  i intimated that he had diagnosed miss rosina sellars correctly  know how much youre earning  she knows i live up here in this attic and do my own cooking i answered  minikin glanced round the room must be fond of you  she thinks im clever i explained and that i shall make my way  and shes willing to wait  i nodded  well i should let her wait replied minikin replacing his eye theres plenty of time before you  but shes a barmaid and shell expect me to walk with her to take her out on sundays to go and see her friends i cant do it besides shes right i mean to get on then shell stick to me its awful  how did it happen asked minikin  i dont know i replied i didnt know i had done it till it was over  anybody present  halfadozen of them i groaned  the door opened and jarman entered he never troubled to knock anywhere in place of his usual noisy greeting he crossed in silence and shook me gravely by the hand  friend of yours he asked indicating minikin  i introduced them to each other  proud to meet you said jarman  glad to hear it said minikin dont look as if youd got much else to be stuck up about  dont mind him i explained to jarman he was born like it  wonderful gift replied jarman dye know what i should do if i ad it he did not wait for minikins reply ire myself out to break up evening parties ever thought of it seriously  minikin replied that he would give the idea consideration  make your fortune going round the suburbs assured him jarman pity you werent ere last night he continued might ave saved our young friend ere a deal of trouble has e told you the news  i explained that i had already put minikin in possession of all the facts  now youve got a good steady eye said jarman upon whom minikin according to his manner had fixed his glass orb ow dye think e is looking  as well as can be expected under the circumstances dont you think answered minikin  does e know the circumstances has e seen the girl asked jarman  i replied he had not as yet enjoyed that privilege then e dont know the worst said jarman a hundred and sixty pounds of er and still growing bit of a load for im aint it  some of em do have luck was minikins rejoinder jarman leant forward and took further stock for a few seconds of his new acquaintance  thats a fine ead of yours he remarked all your own no offence continued jarman without giving minikin time for repartee i was merely thinking there must be room for a lot of sense in it now what do you as a practical man advise im dose of poison or waterloo bridge and a brick  i suppose theres no doubt i interjected that we are actually engaged  not a blooming shadow assured me jarman cheerfully so far as shes concerned  i shall tell her plainly i explained that i was drunk at the time  and ow are you going to convince er of it asked jarman you think your telling er you loved er proves it so it would to anybody else but not to er you cant expect it besides if every girl is going to give up er catch just because the fellow adnt all is wits about im at the timewell what do you think he appealed to minikin  to minikin it appeared that if such contention were allowed girls might as well shut up shop  jarman who now that he had got even with minikin was more friendly disposed towards that young man drew his chair closer to him and entered upon a private and confidential argument from which i appeared to be entirely excluded  you see explained jarman this aint an ordinary case this chaps going to be the future poet laureate now when the prince of wales invites him to dine at marlborough ouse e dont want to go there tacked on to a girl that carries aitches with her in a bag and dont know which end of the spoon out of which to drink er soup  it makes a difference of course agreed minikin  what weve got to do said jarman is to get im out of it and upon my sivvy blessed if i see ow to do it  she fancies him asked minikin  what she fancies explained jarman is that nature intended er to be a lady and its no good pointing out to er the mistake shes making because she aint got sense enough to see it  no good talking straight to her suggested minikin telling her that it can never be  thats our difficulty replied jarman it can be this chapi listened as might a prisoner in the dock to the argument of counsel interested but impotentdont know enough to come in out of the rain as the saying is es just the sort of chap this sort of thing does appen to  but he dont want her urged minikin he says he dont want her  yes to you and me answered jarman and of course e dont im not saying es a natural born idiot but let er come along and do a sniveltell im that es breaking er eart and appeal to im to beave as a gentleman and all that sort of thing and what do you think will be the result  minikin agreed that the problem presented difficulties  of course if twas you or me we should just tell er to put erself away somewhere where the moth couldnt get at er and wait till we sent round for er and thered be an end of the matter but with im its different  he is a bit of a soft agreed minikin  taint is fault explained jarman twas the way e was brought up e fancies girls are the sort of things one sees in plays going about saying unand me let me pass maybe some of em are but this aint one of em  how did it happen asked minikin  ow does it appen nine times out of ten returned jarman e was a bit misty and she was wide awake e gets a bit spoony andwell you know  artful things girls commented minikin  cant blame em returned jarman with generosity its their business got to dispose of themselves somehow oughtnt to be binding without a written order dated the next morning thatd make it all right  couldnt prove a prior engagement suggested minikin  shed want to see the girl first before shed believe itonly natural returned jarman  couldnt get a girl urged minikin  who could you trust asked the cautious jarman besides there aint time shes letting im rest today tomorrow evening shell be down on im  dont see anything for it said minikin but for him to do a bunk  not a bad idea that mused jarman only wheres e to bunk to  neednt go far said minikin  shed find im out and follow im said jarman she can look after herself mind you dont you go doing er any injustice  he could change his name suggested minikin  ow could e get a crib asked jarman no character no references  ive got it cried jarman starting up the stage  can he act asked minikin  can do anything retorted my supporter that dont want too much sense thats is sanctuary the stage no questions asked no character wanted lord why didnt i think of it before  wants a bit of getting on to doesnt it suggested minikin  depends upon where you want to get replied jarman for the first time since the commencement of the discussion he turned to me can you sing he asked me  i replied that i could a little though i had never done so in public  sing something now demanded jarman lets ear you wait a minute he cried  he slipped out of the room i heard him pause upon the landing below and knock at the door of the fair rosinas room the next minute he returned  its all right he explained shes not in yet now sing for all youre worth remember its for life and freedom  i sang sally in our alley not with much spirit i am inclined to think with every mention of the ladys name there rose before me the abundant form and features of my fiancee which checked the feeling that should have trembled through my voice but jarman though not enthusiastic was content  it isnt what i call a grand opera voice he commented but it ought to do all right for a chorus where economy is the chief point to be considered now ill tell you what to do you go tomorrow straight to the okelly and put the whole thing before im es a good sort ell touch you up a bit and maybe give you a few introductions lucky for you this is just the right time theres one or two things comin on and if fate aint dead against you youll lose your amorita or whatever its called and not find er again till its too late  i was not in the mood that evening to feel hopeful about anything but i thanked both of them for their kind intentions and promised to think the suggestion over on the morrow when as it was generally agreed i should be in a more fitting state to bring cool judgment to bear upon the subject and they rose to take their departure  leaving minikin to descend alone jarman returned the next minute consols are down a bit this week he whispered with the door in his hand if you want a little of the ready to carry you through dont go sellin out i can manage a few pounds suck a couple of lemons and youll be all right in the morning so long  i followed his advice regarding the lemons and finding it correct went to the office next morning as usual lott  co in consideration of my agreeing to a deduction of two shillings on the weeks salary allowed himself to overlook the matter i had intended acting on jarman s advice to call upon the okelly at his address of respectability in hampstead that evening and had posted him a note saying i was coming before leaving the office however i received a reply to the effect that he would be out that evening and asking me to make it the following friday instead disappointed i returned to my lodgings in a depressed state of mind jarman s scheme which had appeared hopeful and even attractive during the daytime now loomed shadowy and impossible before me the emptiness of the first floor parlour as i passed its open door struck a chill upon me reminding me of the disappearance of a friend to whom in spite of moral disapproval i had during these last few months become attached unable to work the old pain of loneliness returned upon me i sat for awhile in the darkness listening to the scratching of the pen of my neighbour the old lawwriter and the sense of despair that its sound always communicated to me encompassed me about this evening with heavier weight than usual  after all was not the sympathy of the lady ortensia stimulated for personal purposes though it might be better than nothing at least here was some living creature to whom i belonged to whom my existence or nonexistence was of interest who if only for her own sake was bound to share my hopes my fears  it was in this mood that i heard a slight tap at the door in the dim passage stood the small slavey holding out a note i took it and returning lighted my candle the envelope was pink and scented it was addressed in handwriting not so bad as i had expected to paul kelver esquire i opened it and read  dr mr pauli herd as how you was took hill hafter the party i feer you are not strong you must not work so hard or you will be hill and then i shall be very cros with you i hop you are well now if so i am going for a wark and you may come with me if you are good with much love from your affechonat rosie  in spite of the spelling a curious tingling sensation stole over me as i read this my first loveletter a faint mist swam before my eyes through it glorified and softened i saw the face of my betrothed pasty yet alluring her large white fleshy arms stretched out invitingly toward me moved by a sudden hot haste that seized me i dressed myself with trembling hands i appeared to be anxious to act without giving myself time for thought complete with a colour in my cheeks unusual to them and a burning in my eyes i descended and knocked with a nervous hand at the door of the second floor back  whos that came in answer miss sellars sharp tones  it is ipaul  oh wait a minute dear the tone was sweeter there followed the sound of scurried footsteps a rustling of clothes a banging of drawers a few moments dead silence and then  you can come in now dear  i entered it was a small untidy room smelling of smoky lamp but all i saw distinctly at the moment was miss sellars with her arms above her head pinning her hat upon her strawcoloured hair  with the sight of her before me in the flesh my feelings underwent a sudden revulsion during the few minutes she had kept me waiting outside the door i had suffered from an almost uncontrollable desire to turn the handle and rush in now had i acted on impulse i should have run out not that she was an unpleasantlooking girl by any means it was the atmosphere of coarseness of commonness around her that repelled me the fastidiousnessfinikinness if you willthat would so often spoil my rare chop put before me by a waitress with dirty fingernails forced me to disregard the ample charms she no doubt did possess to fasten my eyes exclusively upon her red rough hands and the one or two warts that grew thereon  youre a very naughty boy told me miss sellars finishing the fastening of her hat why didnt you come in and see me in the dinnerhour ive a great mind not to kiss you  the powder she had evidently dabbed on hastily was plainly visible upon her face the round soft arms were hidden beneath illfitting sleeves of some crapey material the thought of which put my teeth on edge i wished her intention had been stronger instead relenting she offered me her flowery cheek which i saluted gingerly the taste of it reminding me of certain pale thin doughcakes manufactured by the wife of our school porter and sold to us in playtime at four a penny and which having regard to their satisfying quality had been popular with me in those days  at the top of the kitchen stairs miss sellars paused and called down shrilly to mrs peedles who in course of time appeared panting  oh me and mr kelver are going out for a short walk mrs peedles i shant want any supper good night  oh good night my dear replied mrs peedles hope youll enjoy yourselves is mr kelver there  hes round the corner i heard miss sellars explain in a lower voice and there followed a snigger  hes a bit shy aint he suggested mrs peedles in a whisper  ive had enough of the other sort was miss sellars answer in low tones  ah well its the shy ones that come out the strongest after a bitleastways thats been my experience  hell do all right so long  miss sellars buttoning a burst glove rejoined me  i suppose youve never had a sweetheart before asked miss sellars as we turned into the blackfriars road  i admitted that this was my first experience  i cant abear a flirty man explained miss sellars thats why i took to you from the beginning you was so quiet  i began to wish that nature had bestowed upon me a noisier temperament  anybody could see you was a gentleman continued miss sellars heaps and heaps of hoffers ive hadhundreds you might almost say but what ive always told em is i like you very much indeed as a friend but im not going to marry any one but a gentleman dont you think i was right  i murmured it was only what i should have expected of her  you may take my harm if you like suggested miss sellars as we crossed st georges circus and linked we pursued our way along the kennington park road  fortunately there was not much need for me to talk miss sellars was content to supply most of the conversation herself and all of it was about herself  i learned that her instincts since childhood had been toward gentility nor was this to be wondered at seeing that her familyon her mothers side at all eventswere connected distinctly with the highest in the land mesalliances however are common in all communities and one of them a particularly flagrant specimenher mar had alas contracted having marriedwhat did i think i should never guessa waiter miss sellars stopping in the act of crossing newington butts to shudder at the recollection of her female parents shame was nearly run down by a tramcar  mr and mrs sellars did not appear to have hit it off together could one wonder mrs sellars with an uncle on the stock exchange and mr sellars with one on peckham rye i gathered his calling to have been chiefly three shies a penny mrs sellars was now however happily dead and if no other good thing had come out of the catastrophe it had determined miss sellars to take warning by her mothers error and avoid connection with the lowly born she it was who with my help would lift the family back again to its proper position in society  it used to be a joke against me explained miss sellars heven when i was quite a child i never could tolerate anything low why one day when i was only seven years old what do you think happened  i confessed my inability to guess  well ill tell you said miss sellars itll just show you uncle josephthat was fathers uncle you understand  i assured miss sellars that the point was fixed in my mind  well one day when he came to see us he takes a cocoanut out of his pocket and offers it to me thank you i says i dont heat cocoanuts that have been shied at by just anybody and missed it made him so wild after that explained miss sellars they used to call me at home the princess of wales  i murmured it was a pretty fancy  some people replied miss sellars with a giggle says it fits me but of course thats only their nonsense  not knowing what to reply i remained silent which appeared to somewhat disappoint miss sellars  out of the clapham road we turned into a bystreet of twostoreyed houses  youll come in and have a bit of supper suggested miss sellars mars quite hanxious to see you  i found sufficient courage to say i was not feeling well and would much rather return home  oh but you must just come in for five minutes dear itll look so funny if you dont i told em we was coming  i would really rather not i urged some other evening i felt a presentiment i confided to her that on this particular evening i should not shine to advantage  oh you mustnt be so shy said miss sellars i dont like shy fellowsnot too shy thats silly and miss sellars took my arm with a decided grip making it clear to me that escape could be obtained only by an unseemly struggle in the street not being prepared for which i meekly yielded  we knocked at the door of one of the small houses miss sellars retaining her hold upon me until it had been opened to us by a lank young man in his shirtsleeves and closed behind us  dont gentlemen wear coats of a hevening nowadays asked miss sellars tartly of the lank young man new fashion just come in  i dont know what gentlemen wear in the evening or what they dont retorted the lank young man who appeared to be in an aggressive mood if i can find one in this street ill ast him and let you know  mother in the droaringroom enquired miss sellars ignoring the retort  theyre all of em in the parlour if thats what you mean returned the lank young man the whole blooming shoot if you stand up against the wall and dont breathe therell just be room for you  sweeping by the lank young man miss sellars opened the parlour door and towing me in behind her shut it  well mar here we are announced miss sellars an enormously stout lady ornamented with a cap that appeared to have been made out of a bandanna handkerchief rose to greet us thus revealing the fact that she had been sitting upon an extremely small horsehaircovered easychair the disproportion between the lady and her support being quite pathetic  i am charmed mr  kelver supplied miss sellars  kelver to make your acquaintance recited mrs sellars in the tone of one repeating a lesson  i bowed and murmured that the honour was entirely mine  dont mention it replied mrs sellars pray be seated  mrs sellars herself set the example by suddenly giving way and dropping down into her chair which thus again became invisible it received her with an agonised groan  indeed the insistence with which this article of furniture throughout the evening called attention to its sufferings was really quite distracting with every breath that mrs sellars took it moaned wearily there were moments when it literally shrieked i could not have accepted mrs sellars offer had i wished there being no chair vacant and no room for another a young man with watery eyes sitting just behind me between a fat young lady and a lean one rose and suggested my taking his place miss sellars introduced me to him as her cousin joseph something or other and we shook hands  the wateryeyed joseph remarked that it had been a fine day between the showers and hoped that the morrow would be either wet or dry upon which the lean young lady having slapped him asked admiringly of the fat young lady if he wasnt a silly fool to which the fat young lady replied with somewhat unnecessary severity i thought that no one could help being what they were born to this the lean young lady retorted that it was with precisely similar reflection that she herself controlled her own feelings when tempted to resent the fat young ladys nasty jealous temper  the threatened quarrel was nipped in the bud by the discretion of miss sellars who took the opportunity of the fat young ladys momentary speechlessness to introduce me promptly to both of them they also i learned were cousins the lean girl said she had erd on me and immediately fell into an uncontrollable fit of giggles of which the wateryeyed joseph requested me to take no notice explaining that she always went off like that at exactly threequarters to the halfhour every evening sundays and holidays excepted that she had taken everything possible for it without effect and that what he himself advised was that she should have it off  the fat girl seizing the chance afforded her remarked genteelly that she too had heard hof me with emphasis upon the hof she also remarked it was a long walk from blackfriars bridge  all depends upon the company eh bet they didnt find it too long  this came from a loudvoiced redfaced man sitting on the sofa beside a somewhat melancholylooking female dressed in bright green these twain i discovered to be uncle and aunt gutton from an observation dropped later in the evening concerning government restrictions on the sale of methylated spirit and hastily smothered i gathered that their line was oil and colour  mr guttons forte appeared to be badinage he it was who on my explaining my heightened colour as due to the closeness of the evening congratulated his niece on having secured so warm a partner  will be jolly handy shouted uncle gutton for rosina seeing shes always complaining of her cold feet  here the lank young man attempted to squeeze himself into the room but found his entrance barred by the square squat figure of the wateryeyed young man  dont push advised the wateryeyed young man walk over me quietly  well why dont yer get out of the way growled the lank young man now coated but still aggressive  where am i to get to asked the wateryeyed young man with some reason say the word and ill ang myself up to the gas bracket  in my courting days roared uncle gutton the girls used to be able to find seats even if there wasnt enough chairs to go all round  the sentiment was received with varying degrees of approbation the wateryeyed young man sitting down put the lean young lady on his knee and in spite of her struggles and sounding slaps heroically retained her there  now then rosie shouted uncle gutton who appeared to have constituted himself master of the ceremonies dont stand about my girl youll get tired  left to herself i am inclined to think my fiancee would have spared me but uncle gutton having been invited to a love comedy was not to be cheated of any part of the performance and the audience clearly being with him there was nothing for it but compliance i seated myself and amid plaudits accommodated the ample and heavy rosina upon my knee  goodbye called out to me the wateryeyed young man as behind the fair rosina i disappeared from his view see you again later on  i used to be a plump girl myself before i married observed aunt gutton plump as butter i was at one time  it isnt what one eats said the maternal sellars i myself dont eat enough to keep a fly and my legs  thatll do mar interrupted the filial sellars tartly  i was only going to say my dear  we all know what you was going to say mar retorted miss sellars weve heard it before and it isnt interesting  mrs sellars relapsed into silence  ard work and plenty of it keeps you thin enough i notice remarked the lank young man with bitterness to him i was now introduced he being mr george sellars seen im before was his curt greeting  at supperreferred to by mrs sellars again in the tone of one remembering a lesson as a cold collation with the accent on the tioni sat between miss sellars and the lean young lady with aunt and uncle gutton opposite to us it was remarked with approval that i did not appear to be hungry  had too many kisses afore he started suggested uncle gutton with his mouth full of cold roast pork and pickles wonderfully nourishing thing kisses eh look at mother and me thats all we live on  aunt gutton sighed and observed that she had always been a poor feeder  the wateryeyed young man observing he had never tasted them himselfat which sally there was much laughtersaid he would not mind trying a sample if the lean young lady would kindly pass him one  the lean young lady opined that not being used to high living it might disagree with him  just one pleaded the wateryeyed young man to go with this bit of cracklin  the lean young lady amid renewed applause first thoughtfully wiping her mouth acceded to his request  the wateryeyed young man turned it over with the air of a gourmet  not bad was his verdict reminds me of onions at this there was another burst of laughter  now then aint paul goin to have one shouted uncle gutton when the laughter had subsided  amid silence feeling as wretched as perhaps i have ever felt in my life before or since i received one from the gracious miss sellars wet and sounding  looks better for it already commented the delighted uncle gutton hell soon get fat on em  not too many at first advised the wateryeyed young man looks to me as if hes got a weak stomach  i think had the meal lasted much longer i should have made a dash for the street the contemplation of such step was forming in my mind but miss sellars looking at her watch declared we must be getting home at once for the which i could have kissed her voluntarily and being a young lady of decision at once rose and commenced leavetaking polite protests were attempted but these with enthusiastic assistance from myself she swept aside  dont want any one to walk home with you suggested uncle gutton sure you wont feel lonely by yourselves eh  we shant come to no harm assured him miss sellars  praps youre right agreed uncle gutton there dont seem to be much of the fiery and untamed about him so far as i can see  slow waters run deep reminded us aunt gutton with a waggish shake of her head  no question about the slow assented uncle gutton if you dont like him observed miss sellars speaking with dignity  to be quite candid with you my girl i dont answered uncle gutton whose temper maybe as the result of too much cold pork and whiskey seemed to have suddenly changed  well he happens to be good enough for me recommenced miss sellars  im sorry to hear a niece of mine say so interrupted uncle gutton if you want my opinion of him  if ever i do ill call round some time when youre sober and ast you for it returned miss sellars and as for being your niece you was here when i came and i dont see very well as how i could have got out of it you neednt throw that in my teeth  the gust was dispersed by the practical remark of brother george to the effect that the last tram for walworth left the oval at eleventhirty to which he further added the suggestion that the clapham road was wide and well adapted to a row  there aint going to be no rows replied uncle gutton returning to amiability as suddenly as he had departed from it we understand each other dont we my girl  thats all right uncle i know what you mean returned miss sellars with equal handsomeness  bring him round again when hes feeling better added uncle gutton and well have another look at him  what you want advised the wateryeyed young man on shaking hands with me is complete rest and a tombstone  i wished at the time i could have followed his prescription  the maternal sellars waddled after us into the passage which she completely blocked she told me she was delightted to have met me and that she was always at home on sundays  i said i would remember it and thanked her warmly for a pleasant evening at miss sellars request calling her ma  outside miss sellars agreed that my presentiment had proved correctthat i had not shone to advantage our journey home on a tramcar was a somewhat silent proceeding at the door of her room she forgave me and kissed me good night had i been frank with her i should have thanked her for that evenings experience it had made my course plain to me  the next day which was thursday i wandered about the streets till two oclock in the morning when i slipped in quietly passing miss sellars door with my boots in my hand  after mr lotts departure on friday which fortunately was payday i set my desk in order and confided to minikin written instructions concerning all matters unfinished  i shall not be here tomorrow i told him going to follow your advice  found anything to do he asked  not yet i answered  suppose you cant get anything  if the worst comes to the worst i replied i can hang myself  well you know the girl maybe you are right he agreed  hope it wont throw much extra work on you i said  well i shant be catching it if it does was his answer thats all right  he walked with me to the angel and there we parted  if you do get on to the stage he said and its anything worth seeing and you send me an order and i can find the time maybe ill come and see you  i thanked him for his promised support and jumped upon the tram  the okellys address was in belsize square i was about to ring and knock as requested by a highlypolished brass plate when i became aware of pieces of small coal falling about me on the doorstep looking up i perceived the okelly leaning out of an attic window from signs i gathered i was to retire from the doorstep and wait in a few minutes the door opened and his hand beckoned me to enter  walk quietly he whispered and on tiptoe we climbed up to the attic from where had fallen the coal ive been waiting for ye explained the okelly speaking low me wifea good woman paul sure a better woman never lived yell like her when ye know her later onshe might not care about yere calling shed want to know where i met ye andye understand besides added the okelly we can smoke up here and seating himself where he could keep an eye upon the door near to a small cupboard out of which he produced a pipe still alight the okelly prepared himself to listen  i told him briefly the reason of my visit  it was my fault paul he was good enough to say my fault entirely between ourselves it was a damned silly idea that party the whole thing altogether dont ye think so  i replied that i was naturally prejudiced against it myself  most unfortunate for me continued the okelly i know that me cabman took me to hammersmith instead of hampstead said i told him hammersmith didnt get home here till three oclock in the morning most unfortunateunder the circumstances  i could quite imagine it  but im glad yeve come said the okelly i had a notion ye did something foolish that evening but i couldnt remember precisely what its been worrying me  its been worrying me also i can assure you i told him and i gave him an account of my wednesday evenings experience  ill go round tomorrow morning he said and see one or two people its not a bad idea that of jarmans i think i may be able to arrange something for ye  he fixed a time for me to call again upon him the next day when mrs okelly would be away from home he instructed me to walk quietly up and down on the opposite side of the road with my eye on the attic window and not to come across unless he waved a handkerchief  rising to go i thanked him for his kindness dont put it that way me dear paul he answered if i dont get ye out of this scrape i shall never forgive meself if we damned silly fools dont help one another he added with his pleasant laugh who is to help us  we crept downstairs as we had crept up as we reached the first floor the drawingroom door suddenly opened  william cried a sharp voice  me dear answered the okelly snatching his pipe from his mouth and thrusting it still alight into his trousers pocket i made the rest of the descent by myself and slipping out closed the door behind me as noiselessly as possible  again i did not return to nelson square until the early hours and the next morning did not venture out until i had heard miss sellars who appeared to be in a bad temper leave the house then running to the top of the kitchen stairs i called for mrs peedles i told her i was going to leave her and judging the truth to be the simplest explanation i told her the reason why  my dear said mrs peedles i am only too glad to hear it it wasnt for me to interfere but i couldnt help seeing you were making a fool of yourself i only hope youll get clear off and you may depend upon me to do all i can to help you  you dont think im acting dishonourably do you mrs peedles i asked  my dear replied mrs peedles its a difficult world to live inleastways thats been my experience of it  i had just completed my packingit had not taken me longwhen i heard upon the stairs the heavy panting that always announced to me the upcoming of mrs peedles she entered with a bundle of old manuscripts under her arm torn and tumbled booklets of various shapes and sizes these she plumped down upon the rickety table and herself upon the nearest chair  put them in your box my dear said mrs peedles theyll come in useful to you later on  i glanced at the bundle i saw it was a collection of old plays in manuscriptprompt copies scored cut and interlined the top one i noticed was the bloodspot or the maiden the miser and the murderer the second the female highwayman  everybodys forgotten em explained mrs peedles but theres some good stuff in all of them  but what am i to do with them i enquired  just whatever you like my dear explained mrs peedles its quite safe theyre all of em dead the authors of em ive picked em out most carefully you just take a scene from one and a scene from the other with judgment and your talent youll make a dozen good plays out of that little lot when your time comes  but they wouldnt be my plays mrs peedles i suggested  they will if i give them to you answered mrs peedles you put em in your box and never mind the bit of rent added mrs peedles you can pay me that later on  i kissed the kind old soul goodbye and took her gift with me to my new lodgings in camden town many a time have i been hard put to it for plot or scene and more than once in weak mood have i turned with guilty intent the torn and crumpled pages of mrs peedless donation to my literary equipment it is pleasant to be able to put my hand upon my heart and reflect that never yet have i yielded to the temptation always have i laid them back within their drawer saying to myself with stern reproof  no no paul stand or fall by your own merits never plagiarisein any case not from this little lot    chapter iv  leads to a meeting  dont be nervous said the okelly and dont try to do too much you have a very fair voice but its not powerful keep cool and open your mouth  it was eleven oclock in the morning we were standing at the entrance of the narrow court leading to the stage door for a fortnight past the okelly had been coaching me it had been nervous work for both of us but especially for the okelly mrs okelly a thin acidlooking lady of whom i once or twice had caught a glimpse while promenading belsize square awaiting the okellys signal was a seriousminded lady with a conscientious objection to all music not of a sacred character with the hope of winning the okelly from one at least of his sinful tendencies the piano had been got rid of and its place in the drawingroom filled by an american organ of exceptionally lugubrious tone with this we had had to make shift and though the okellya veritable musical geniushad succeeded in evolving from it an accompaniment to sally in our alley less misleading and confusing than might otherwise have been the case the result had not been to lighten our labours my rendering of the famous ballad had in consequence acquired a dolefulness not intended by the composer sung as i sang it the theme became to employ a definition since grown hackneyed as applied to art a problem ballad involuntarily one wondered whether the marriage would turn out as satisfactorily as the young man appeared to anticipate was there not when one came to think of it a melancholy a pessimism ingrained within the temperament of the complainful hero that would ill assort with those instincts toward frivolity the careful observer could not avoid discerning in the charming yet nevertheless somewhat shallow character of sally  lighter lighter not so soulful would demand the okelly as the solemn notes rolled jerkily from the groaning instrument beneath his hands  once we were nearly caught mrs okelly returning from a district visitors committee meeting earlier than was expected hastily i was hidden in a small conservatory adjutting from the first floor landing where crouching behind flowerpots i listened in fear and trembling to the severe crossexamination of the okelly  william do not prevaricate it was not a hymn  me dear so much depends upon the time let me give ye an example of what i mean  william pray in my presence not to play tricks with sacred melodies if you have no respect for religion please remember that i have besides why should you be playing hymns in any time at ten oclock in the morning it is not like you william and i do not credit your explanation and you were singing i distinctly heard the word sally as i opened the door  salvation me dear corrected the okelly  your enunciation william is not usually so much at fault  a little hoarseness me dear explained the okelly  your voice did not sound hoarse perhaps it will be better if we do not pursue the subject further  with this the okelly appeared to agree  a lady a little difficult to get on with when yere feeling well and strong so the okelly would explain her but if ye happen to be ill one of the kindest most devoted of women when i was down with typhoid three years ago a tenderer nurse no man could have had i shall never forget it and so she would be again tomorrow if there was anything serious the matter with me  i murmured the wellknown quotation  mrs okelly to a t concurred the okelly i sometimes wonder if lady scott may not have been the same sort of woman  the unfortunate part of it is continued the okelly that im such a healthy beggar it dont give her a chance if i were only a chronic invalid now theres nothing that woman would not do to make me happy as it is the okelly struck a chord we resumed our studies  but to return to our conversation at the stage door  meet me at the cheshire cheese at one oclock said the okelly shaking hands if ye dont get on here well try something else but ive spoken to hodgson and i think ye will good luck to ye  he went his way and i mine in a glass box just behind the door a curvednose roundeyed little man looking like an angry bird in a cage demanded of me my business i showed him my letter of appointment  up the passage across the stage along the corridor first floor second door on the right he instructed me in one breath and shut the window with a snap  i proceeded up the passage it somewhat surprised me to discover that i was not in the least excited at the thought of this my first introduction to behind the scenes  i recall my fathers asking a young soldier on his return from the crimea what had been his sensations at the commencement of his first charge  well replied the young fellow i was worrying all the time remembering i had rushed out leaving the beer tap running in the canteen and i could not forget it  so far as the stage i found my way in safety pausing for a moment and glancing round my impression was not so much disillusionment concerning all things theatrical as realisation of my worst forebodings in that one moment all glamour connected with the stage fell from me nor has it since ever returned to me from the tawdry decorations of the auditorium to the childish makebelief littered around on the stage i saw the theatre a painted thing of shreds and patchesthe grown childs dollshouse the drama may improve us elevate us interest and teach us i am sure it does long may it flourish but so likewise does the dressing and undressing of dolls the opening of the front of the house and the tenderly putting of them away to bed in rooms they completely fill train our little dears to the duties and the joys of motherhood toys what wise child despises them art fiction the musical glasses are they not preparing us for the time however distant when we shall at last be grown up  in a maze of ways beyond the stage i lost myself but eventually guided by voices came to a large room furnished barely with many chairs and worn settees and here i found some twenty to thirty ladies and gentlemen already seated they were of varying ages sizes and appearance but all of them alike in having about them that impossibletodefine but impossibletomistake suggestion of theatricality the men were chiefly remarkable for having no hair on their faces but a good deal upon their heads the ladies one and all were blessed with remarkably pink and white complexions and exceptionally bright eyes the conversation carried on in subdued but penetrating voices was chiefly of him and her everybody appeared to be on an affectionate footing with everybody else the terms of address being my dear my love old girl old chappie christian nameswhen name of any sort was needfulalone being employed i hesitated for a minute with the door in my hand fearing i had stumbled upon a family gathering as however nobody seemed disconcerted at my entry i ventured to take a vacant seat next to an extremely small and boyishlooking gentleman and to ask him if this was the room in which i an applicant for a place in the chorus of the forthcoming comic opera ought to be waiting  he had large fishy eyes with which he looked me up and down for such a length of time he remained thus regarding me in silence that a massive gentleman sitting near who had overheard took it upon himself to reply in the affirmative adding that from what he knew of butterworth we would all of us be waiting here a damned sight longer than any gentleman should keep other ladies and gentlemen waiting for no reason at all  i think it exceedingly bad form observed the fishyeyed gentleman in deep contralto tones for any gentleman to take it upon himself to reply to a remark addressed to quite another gentleman  i beg your pardon retorted the large gentleman i thought you were asleep  i think it very ill manners remarked the small gentlemen in the same slow and impressive tones for any gentleman to tell another gentleman who happens to be wide awake that he thought he was asleep  sir returned the massive gentleman assuming with the help of a large umbrella a quite johnsonian attitude i decline to alter my manners to suit your taste  if you are satisfied with them replied the small gentleman i cannot help it but i think you are making a mistake  does anybody know what the opera is about asked a bright little woman at the other end of the room  does anybody ever know what a comic opera is about asked another lady whose appearance suggested experience  i once asked the author observed a wearylooking gentleman speaking from a corner his reply was well if you had asked me at the beginning of the rehearsals i might have been able to tell you but damned if i could now  it wouldnt surprise me observed a goodlooking gentleman in a velvet coat if there occurred somewhere in the proceedings a drinking chorus for male voices  possibly if we are good added a thin lady with golden hair the heroine will confide to us her love troubles which will interest us and excite us  the door at the further end of the room opened and a name was called an elderly lady rose and went out  poor old gertie remarked sympathetically the thin lady with the golden hair im told that she really had a voice once  when poor young bond first came to london said the massive gentleman who was sitting on my left i remember his telling me he applied to lord barrymores tiger alexander lee i mean of course who was then running the strand theatre for a place in the chorus lee heard him sing two lines and then jumped up thanks thatll do good morning says lee bond knew he had got a good voice so he asked lee what was wrong whats wrong shouts lee do you think i hire a chorus to show up my principals  having regard to the company present commented the fishyeyed gentleman i consider that anecdote as distinctly lacking in tact  the feeling of the company appeared to be with the fisheyed young man  for the next half hour the door at the further end of the room continued to open and close devouring ogrefashion each time some dainty human morsel now chorus gentleman now chorus lady conversation among our thinning ranks became more fitful a growing anxiety making for silence  at length mr horace moncrieff called the voice of the unseen charon in common with the rest i glanced round languidly to see what sort of man mr horace moncrieff might be the door was pushed open further charon now revealed as a palefaced young man with a drooping moustache put his head into the room and repeated impatiently his invitation to the apparently coy moncrieff it suddenly occurred to me that i was mr horace moncrieff  so glad youve found yourself said the palefaced young man as i joined him at the door please dont lose yourself again were rather pressed for time  i crossed with him through a deserted refreshment barone of the saddest of sightsinto a room beyond a melancholylooking gentleman was seated at the piano beside him stood a tall handsome man who was opening and reading rapidly from a bundle of letters he held in his hand a big burly boredlooking gentleman was making desperate efforts to be amused at the staccato conversation of a sharpfaced restlesseyed gentleman whose peculiarity was that he never by any chance looked at the person to whom he was talking but always at something or somebody else  moncrieff enquired the tall handsome manwhom i later discovered to be mr hodgson the managerwithout raising his eyes from his letters  the palefaced gentleman responded for me  fire away said mr hodgson  what is it asked of me wearily the melancholy gentleman at the piano  sally in our alley i replied  what are you interrupted mr hodgson he had never once looked at me and did not now  a tenor i replied not a full tenor i added remembering the okellys instructions  utterly impossible to fill a tenor remarked the restlesseyed gentleman looking at me and speaking to the worriedlooking gentleman ever tried  everybody laughed with the exception of the melancholy gentleman at the piano mr hodgson throwing in his contribution without raising his eyes from his letters throughout the proceedings the restlesseyed gentleman continued to make humorous observations of this nature at which everybody laughed excepting always the melancholy pianista short sharp mechanical laugh devoid of the least suggestion of amusement the restlesseyed gentleman it appeared was the leading low comedian of the theatre  go on said the melancholy gentleman and commenced the accompaniment  tell me when hes going to begin remarked mr hodgson at the conclusion of the first verse  he has a fair voice said my accompanist hes evidently nervous  there is a prejudice throughout theatrical audiences observed mr hodgson in favour of a voice they can hear that is all i am trying to impress upon him  the second verse so i imagined i sang in the voice of a trumpet the burly gentlemanthe translator of the french libretto as he turned out to be the author of the english version as he preferred to be calledacknowledged to having distinctly detected a sound the restlesseyed comedian suggested an announcement from the stage requesting strict silence during my part of the performance  the sickness of fear was stealing over me my voice so it seemed to me disappointed at the effect it had produced had retired sulky into my boots whence it refused to emerge  your voice is all rightvery good whispered the musical conductor they want to hear the best you can do thats all  at this my voice ran up my legs and out of my mouth thirty shillings a week half salary for rehearsals if thats all right mr catchpole will give you your agreement if not very much obliged good morning said mr hodgson still absorbed in his correspondence  with the palefaced young man i retired to a desk in the corner where a few seconds sufficed for the completion of the business leaving i sought to catch the eye of my melancholy friend but he appeared too sunk in dejection to notice anything the restlesseyed comedian looking at the author of the english version and addressing me as boanerges wished me good morning at which the everybody laughed and informed as to the way out by the palefaced mr catchpole i left  the first call was for the following monday at two oclock i found the theatre full of life and bustle the principals who had just finished their own rehearsal were talking together in a group we ladies and gentlemen of the chorus filled the centre of the stage i noticed the lady i had heard referred to as gertie as also the thin lady with the golden hair the massive gentleman and the fishyeyed young man were again in close proximity so long as i knew them they always were together possessed apparently of a sympathetic antipathy for each other the fishyeyed young gentleman was explaining the age at which he thought decayed chorus singers ought in justice to themselves and the public to retire from the profession the massive gentleman the age and size at which he thought parcels of boys ought to be learning manners across their mothers knee  mr hodgson still reading letters exactly as i had left him four days ago stood close to the footlights my friend the musical director armed with a violin and supported by about a dozen other musicians occupied the orchestra the adapter and the stage managera frenchman whom i found it good policy to mistake for a born englishmansat deep in confabulation at a small table underneath a temporary gas jet quarter of an hour or so passed by and then the stage manager becoming suddenly in a hurry rang a small bell furiously  clear please all clear shouted a small boy with important air suggestive of a fox terrier and following the others i retreated to the wings  the comedian and the leading ladywhom i knew well from the front but whom i should never have recognisedsevered themselves from their companions and joined mr hodgson by the footlights as a preliminary we were sorted out according to our sizes into loving couples  ah said the stage manager casting an admiring gaze upon the fishyeyed young man whose height might have been a little over five feet two i have the very girl for youa beauty darting into the group of ladies he returned with quite the biggest specimen a lady of magnificent proportions whom with the air of the virtuous uncle of melodrama he bestowed upon the fishyeyed young man to the massive gentleman was given a sharpfaced little lady who at a distance appeared quite girlish myself i found mated to the thin lady with the golden hair  at last complete we took our places in the then approved semicircle and the attenuated orchestra struck up the opening chorus my music which had been sent me by post i had gone over with the okelly and about that i felt confident but for the rest ill at ease  i am afraid said the thin lady i must ask you to put your arm round my waist its very shocking i know but you see our salary depends upon it do you think you could manage it  i glanced into her face a whimsical expression of fun replied to me and drove away my shyness i carried out her instructions to the best of my ability  the indefatigable stage manager ran in and out among us while we sang driving this couple back a foot or so this other forward herding this group closer together throughout another making space suggesting the idea of a sheepdog at work  very good very good indeed commented mr hodgson at the conclusion we will go over it once more and this time in tune  and we will make love added the stage manager not like marionettes but like ladies and gentlemen all alive seizing the lady nearest to him he explained to us by object lesson how the real peasant invariably behaves when under influence of the grand passion standing gracefully with hands clasped upon heart head inclined at an angle of fortyfive his whole countenance eloquent with tender adoration  if he expects remarked the massive gentleman sotto voce to an experiencedlooking young lady a performance of romeo thrown in i for one shall want an extra ten shillings a week  casting the lady aside and seizing upon a gentleman our stage manager then proceeded to show the ladies how a village maiden should receive affectionate advances one shoulder a trifle higher than the other body from the waist upward gently waggling roguish expression in left eye  ah hes a bit new to it replied the experienced young lady hell get over all that  again we started whether others attempted to follow the stage managers directions i cannot say my whole attention being centred upon the fishyeyed young man who did implicitly soon it became apparent that the whole of us were watching the fishyeyed young man to the utter neglect of our own business mr hodgson even looked up from his letters the orchestra was playing out of time the author of the english version and the leading lady exchanged glances three people only appeared not to be enjoying themselves the chief comedian the stage manager and the fishyeyed young gentleman himself who pursued his labours methodically and conscientiously there was a whispered confabulation between the leading low comedian mr hodgson and the stage manager as a result the music ceased and the fishyeyed young gentleman was requested to explain what he was doing  only making love replied the fishyeyed young gentleman  you were playing the fool sir retorted the leading low comedian severely  that is a very unkind remark replied the fishyeyed young gentleman evidently hurt to make to a gentleman who is doing his best  mr hodgson behind his letters was laughing poor fellow he murmured i suppose he cant help it go on  we are not producing a pantomime you know urged our comedian  i want to give him a chance poor devil explained mr hodgson in a lower voice only support of a widowed mother  our comedian appeared inclined to argue but at this point mr hodgsons correspondence became absorbing  for the chorus the second act was a busy one we opened as soldiers and vivandieres every warrior in this way possessing his own private travelling bar our stage manager again explained to us by example how a soldier behaves first under stress of patriotic emotion and secondly under stress of cheap cognac the difference being somewhat subtle patriotism displaying itself by slaps upon the chest and cheap cognac by slaps upon the forehead a little later we were conspirators our stage manager with the help of a tablecloth showed us how to conspire next we were a mob led by the sentimental baritone our stage manager ruffling his hair expounded to us how a mob led by a sentimental baritone would naturally behave itself the act wound up with a fight our stage manager minus his coat demonstrated to us how to fight and die the dying being a painful and dusty performance necessitating as it did much rolling about on the stage the fishyeyed young gentleman throughout the whole of it was again the centre of attraction whether he were solemnly slapping his chest and singing about glory or solemnly patting his head and singing about grapes was immaterial he was the soldier for us what the plot was about did not matter so long as he was in it who led the mob one did not care ones desire was to see him lead how others fought and died was matter of no moment to see him slaughtered was sufficient whether his unconsciousness was assumed or natural i cannot say in either case it was admirable an earnest young man overanxious if anything to do his duty by his employers was the extent of the charge that could be brought against him our chief comedian frowned and fumed our stage manager was in despair mr hodgson and the author of the english version on the contrary appeared kindly disposed towards the gentleman in addition to the widowed mother mr hodgson had invented for him five younger brothers and sisters utterly destitute but for his earnings to deprive so exemplary a son and brother of the means of earning a livelihood for dear ones dependent upon him was not in mr hodgsons heart our chief comedian dissociated himself from all uncharitable feelingswould subscribe towards the subsistence of the young man out of his own pocket his only concern being the success of the opera the author of the english version was convinced the young man would not accept a charity had known him for yearswas a most sensitive creature  the rehearsal proceeded in the last act it became necessary for me to kiss the thin lady  i am very sorry said the thin lady but duty is duty it has to be done  again i followed directions the thin lady was good enough to congratulate me on my performance  the last three or four rehearsals we performed in company with the principals divided counsels rendered them decidedly harassing our chief comedian had his views and they were decided the leading lady had hers and was generous with them the author of the english version possessed his also but of these nobody took much notice once every twenty minutes the stage manager washed his hands of the whole affair and left the theatre in despair and anybodys hat that happened to be handy to return a few minutes later full of renewed hope the sentimental baritone was sarcastic the tenor distinctly rude to everybody mr hodgsons method was to agree with all and listen to none the smaller fry of the company together with the more pushing of the chorus supported each in turn when the others were not looking up to the dress rehearsal it was anybodys opera  about one thing and about one thing only had the principals fallen into perfect agreement and that was that the fishyeyed young gentleman was out of place in a romantic opera the tenor would be making impassioned love to the leading lady perception would come to both of them that though they might be occupying geographically the centre of the stage dramatically they were not without a shred of evidence yet with perfect justice they would unhesitatingly blame for this the fishyeyed young man  i wasnt doing anything he would explain meekly i was only looking it was perfectly true that was all he was doing  then dont look would comment the tenor  the fishyeyed young gentleman obediently would turn his face away from them and in some mysterious manner the situation would thereupon become even yet more hopelessly ridiculous  my scene i think sir would thunder our chief comedian a little later on  i am only doing what i was told to do answered the fishyeyed young gentleman and nobody could say that he was not  take a circus and run him as a sideshow counselled our comedian  i am afraid he would never be any good as a sideshow replied mr hodgson who was reading letters  on the first night passing the gallery entrance on my way to the stage door the sight of the huge crowd assembled there waiting gave me my first taste of artistic joy i was a part of what they had come to see to praise or to condemn to listen to to watch within the theatre there was an atmosphere of suppressed excitement amounting almost to hysteria the birdlike gentleman in his glass cage was fluttering agitated the hands of the stage carpenters putting the finishing touches to the scenery were trembling their voices passionate with anxiety the foxterrierlike callboy was pale with sense of responsibility  i made my way to the dressingrooma long low wooden corridor furnished from end to end with a wide shelf that served as common dressingtable lighted by a dozen flaring gasjets wireshielded here awaited us gentlemen of the chorus the wigmakers assistant whose duty it was to make us up from one to another he ran armed with his hares foot his box of paints and his bundle of crepe hair my turn arriving he seized me by the head jabbed a wig upon me and in less than a couple of minutes i left his hands the orthodox peasant of the stage white of forehead and pink of cheek with curly moustache and lips of coral glancing into the glass i could not help feeling pleased with myself a moustache without doubt suited me  the chorus ladies when i met them on the stage were a revelation to me paint and powder though i knew their appearance to consist of chiefly yet in that hot atmosphere of the theatre under that artificial glare it seemed fit and fascinating the close approximation to so much bare flesh its curious subtle odour was almost intoxicating dr johnsons excuse to garrick for the rarity of his visits to the theatre recurred to me with understanding  how do you like my costume asked the thin lady with the golden hair  i think you we were standing apart behind a piece of projecting scenery she laid her hand upon my mouth laughing  how old are you she asked me  isnt that a rude question i answered i dont ask your age  mine she replied entitles me to talk to you as i should to a boy of my owni had one once get out of this life if you can its bad for a woman its worse still for a man to you especially it will be harmful  why to me in particular  because you are an exceedingly foolish little boy she answered with another laugh and are rather nice  she slipped away and joined the others the chorus was now entirely assembled on the stage the sound of the rapidlyfilling house reached us softened through the thick baize curtain a dull continuous droning as of water pouring into some huge cistern suddenly there fell upon our ears a startling crash the overture had commenced the stage managermore suggestive of a sheepdog than ever but lacking the calm dignity the selfpossession born of conscious capability distinctive of his prototype a fussy argumentative sheepdogrushed into the midst of us and worried us into our positions where the more experienced continued to converse in whispers the rest of us waiting nervously trying to remember our words the chorus master taking his stand with his back to the proscenium held his whitegloved hand in readiness the curtain rushed up the house a nightmare of white faces appearing to run towards us the chorusmasters whitegloved hand flung upward a roar of voices struck upon my ear but whether my own were of them i could not say if i were singing at all it was unconsciously mechanically later i found myself standing in the wings beside the thin lady the stage was in the occupation of the principals on my next entrance my senses were more with me i was able to look about me here and there a stronglymarked face among the audience stood out but the majority were as indistinguishable as so many blades of grass looked at from the stage the house seemed no more real than from the front do the painted faces upon a black cloth  the curtain fell amid the usual applause sounding to us behind it like the rattle of tiny stones against a windowpane three times it rose and fell like the opening and shutting of a door and then followed a scamper for the dressingrooms the long corridors being filled with the rustling of skirts and the scurrying of feet  it was in the second act that the fishyeyed young gentleman came into his own the chorus had lingered till it was quite apparent that the tenor and the leading lady were in love with each other then with the exquisite delicacy so characteristic of a chorus foreseeing that its further presence might be embarrassing it turned to go half to the east the other half to the west the fishyeyed young man starting from the centre was the last to leave the stage in another moment he would have disappeared from view there came a voice from the gallery clear distinct pathetic with entreaty  dont go get behind a tree  the request was instantly seconded by a roar of applause from every part of the house followed by laughter from that point onward the house was chiefly concerned with the fortunes of the fishyeyed young gentleman at his next entrance disguised as a conspirator he was welcomed with enthusiasm his passing away regretted loudly at the fall of the curtain the tenor furious rushed up to him and shaking a fist in his face demanded what he meant by it  i wasnt doing anything explained the fishyeyed young man  you went off sideways roared the tenor  well you told me not to look at you explained meekly the fishyeyed young gentleman i must go off somehow i regard you as a very difficult man to please  at the final fall of the curtain the house appeared divided as regarded the merits of the opera but for goggles there was a unanimous and enthusiastic call and the while we were dressing a message came for goggles that mr hodgson wished to see him in his private room  he can make a funny face no doubt about it commented one gentleman as goggles left the room  i defy him to make a funnier one than god almightys made for him responded the massive gentleman  theres a deal in luck observed with a sigh another a tall handsome young gentleman possessed of a rich bass voice  leaving the stage door i encountered a group of gentlemen waiting upon the pavement outside not interested in them myself i was hurrying past when one laid a hand upon my shoulder i turned he was a big broadshouldered fellow with a dark vandyke beard and soft dreamy eyes  dan i cried  i thought it was you young un in the first act he answered in the second when you came on without a moustache i knew it are you in a hurry  not at all i answered are you  no he replied we dont go to press till thursday so i can write my notice tomorrow come and have supper with me at the albion and we will talk you look tired young un  no i assured him only excitedpartly at meeting you  he laughed and drew my arm through his    chapter v  how on a sweet grey morning the future came to paul  over our supper dan and i exchanged histories they revealed points of similarity leaving school some considerable time earlier than myself dan had gone to cambridge but two years later in consequence of the death of his father of a wound contracted in the indian mutiny and never cured had been compelled to bring his college career to an untimely termination  you might not have expected that to grieve me said dan with a smile but as a matter of fact it was a severe blow to me at cambridge i discovered that i was by temperament a scholar the reason why at school i took no interest in learning was because learning was of set purpose made as uninteresting as possible like a cooks tourist party through a picture gallery we were rushed through education the object being not that we should see and understand but that we should be able to say that we had done it at college i chose my own subjects studied them in my own way i fed on knowledge was not stuffed with it like a strassburg goose  returning to london he had taken a situation in a bank the chairman of which had been an old friend of his father the advantage was that while earning a small income he had time to continue his studies but the deadly monotony of the work had appalled him and upon the death of his mother he had shaken the cloying dust of the city from his brain and joined a small fitup theatrical company on the stage he had remained for another eighteen months had played all roles from romeo to paul pry had helped to paint the scenery had assisted in the billposting the latter so he told me he had found one of the most difficult of accomplishments the pasteladen poster having an innate tendency to recoil upon the amateurs own head and to stick there wearying of the stage proper he had joined a circus company had been signor ricardo the daring bareback rider also one of the brothers roscius in their marvellous trapeze act inclining again towards respectability had been a waiter for three months at ostend from that a footman  one never knows remarked dan i may come to be a society novelist if so inside knowledge of the aristocracy will give me decided advantage over the majority of my competitors  other callings he had sampled had tramped through ireland with a fiddle through scotland with a lecture on palestine assisted by dissolving views had been a billiardmarker next a schoolmaster for the last three months he had been a journalist dramatic and musical critic to a sunday newspaper often had i dreamt of such a position for myself  how did you obtain it i asked  the idea occurred to me replied dan late one afternoon sauntering down the strand wondering what i should do next i was on my beam ends with only a few shillings in my pocket but luck has always been with me i entered the first newspaper office i came to walked upstairs to the first floor and opening the first door without knocking passed through a small empty room into a larger one littered with books and papers it was growing dark a gentleman of extremely youthful figure was running round and round cursing to himself because of three things he had upset the ink could not find the matches and had broken the bellpull in the gloom assuming him to be the office boy i thought it would be fun to mistake him for the editor as a matter of fact he turned out to be the editor i lit the gas for him and found him another inkpot he was a slim young man with the voice and manner of a schoolboy i dont suppose he is any more than five or sixandtwenty he owes his position to the fact of his aunts being the proprietress he asked me if he knew me before i could tell him that he didnt he went on talking he appeared to be labouring under a general sense of injury  people come into this office he said they seem to look upon it as a shelter from the rainpeople i dont know from adam and that damned fool downstairs lets them march straight upanybody men with articles on safety valves people who have merely come to kick up a row about something or another half my work i have to do on the stairs  i recommended to him that he should insist upon strangers writing their business upon a slip of paper he thought it a good idea  for the last threequarters of an hour he said have i been trying to finish this one column and four times have i been interrupted  at that precise moment there came another knock at the door  i wont see him he cried i dont care who he is i wont see him send him away send everybody away  i went to the door he was an elderly gentleman he made to sweep by me but i barred his way and closed the editorial door behind me he seemed surprised but i told him it was impossible for him to see the editor that afternoon and suggested his writing his business on a sheet of paper which i handed to him for the purpose i remained in that anteroom for half an hour and during that time i suppose i must have sent away about ten or a dozen people i dont think their business could have been important or i should have heard about it afterwards the last to come was a tiredlooking gentleman smoking a cigarette i asked him his name  he looked at me in surprise and then answered idiot  i remained firm however and refused to let him pass  its a bit awkward he retorted dont you think you could make an exception in favour of the subeditor on press night  i replied that such would be contrary to my instructions  oh all right he answered id like to know whos going to the royalty tonight thats all its seven oclock already  an idea occurred to me if the subeditor of a paper doesnt know whom to send to a theatre it must mean that the post of dramatic critic on that paper is for some reason or another vacant  oh thats all right i told him i shall be in time enough  he appeared neither pleased nor displeased have you arranged with the guvnor he asked me  im just waiting to see him again for a few minutes i returned itll be all right have you got the ticket  havent seen it he replied  about a column i suggested  threequarters he preferred and went  the moment he was gone i slipped downstairs and met a printers boy coming up  whats the name of your sub i asked him tall man with a black moustache looks tired  oh you mean penton explained the boy  thats the name i answered couldnt think of it  i walked straight into the editor he was still irritable what is it what is it now he snapped out  i only want the ticket for the royalty theatre i answered penton says youve got it  i dont know where it is he growled  i found it after some little search upon his desk  whos going he asked  i am i said and i went  they have never discovered to this day that i appointed myself penton thinks i am some relation of the proprietress and in consequence everybody treats me with marked respect mrs wallace herself the proprietress thinks i am the discovery of penton in whose judgment she has great faith and with her i get on admirably the paper i dont think is doing too well and the salary is small but sufficient journalism suits my temperament and i dare say i shall keep to it  youve been somewhat of a rolling stone hitherto i commented  he laughed from the stones point of view he answered i never could see the advantage of being smothered in moss i should always prefer remaining the stone unhidden able to move and see about me but now to speak of other matters what are your plans for the immediate future your opera thanks to the gentlemen the gods have dubbed goggles will i fancy run through the winter are you getting any salary  thirty shillings a week i explained to him with full salary for matinees  say two pounds he replied with my three we could set up an establishment of our own i have an idea that is original shall we work it out together  i assured him with fervour that nothing would please me better  there are four delightful rooms in queens square he continued they are charmingly furnished a fine sittingroom in the front with two bedrooms and a kitchen behind their last tenant was a polish revolutionary who three months ago poor fellow was foolish enough to venture back to russia and who is now living rent free the landlord of the house is an original old fellow deleglise the engraver he occupies the rest of the house himself he has told me i can have the rooms for anything i like to offer and i should suggest thirty shillings a week though under ordinary circumstances they would be worth three or four pounds but he will only let us have them on the understanding that we do for ourselves he is quite an oddity he hates petticoats especially elderly petticoats he has one servant an old frenchwoman who i believe was housekeeper to his mother and he and she do the housework together most of their time quarrelling over it nothing else of the genus domestic female will he allow inside the door not even an occasional charwoman would be permitted to us on the other hand it is a beautiful old georgian house with adams mantelpieces a stone staircase and oakpanelled rooms and our portion would be the entire second floor no pianos and no landlady he is a widower with one child a girl of about fourteen or maybe a little older now what do you say i am a very fair cook will you be houseandparlourmaid  i needed no pressing a week later we were installed there and for nearly two years we lived there at the risk of offending an adorable but somewhat touchy sex convinced that man left to himself is capable of little more than putting himself to bed and that only in a roughandready fashion truth compels me to record the fact that without female assistance or supervision of any kind we passed through those two years and yet exist to tell the tale dan had not idly boasted better plain cooking i never want to taste so good a cup of coffee omelette or devilled kidney i rarely have tasted had he always confined his efforts within the boundaries of his abilities there would be little to record beyond continuous and monotonous success but stirred into dangerous ambition at the call of an occasional tea or supper party lured out of his depths by the example of old deleglise our landlorda man who for twenty years had made cooking his hobbydan would at intervals venture upon experiment pastry it became evident was a thing he should never have touched his hand was heavy and his temperament too serious there was a thing called lemon sponge necessitating much beating of eggs in the cookerybooka remarkably fat volume luscious with illustrations of highlycoloured foodit appeared an airy and graceful structure of dazzling whiteness served as dan sent it to table it suggested rather in form and colour a miniature earthquake spongy it undoubtedly was one forced it apart with the assistance of ones spoon and fork it yielded with a gentle tearing sound another favourite dainty of his was mannacake concerning it i would merely remark that if it in any way resembled anything the children of israel were compelled to eat then there is explanation for that fretfulness and discontent for which they have been perhaps unjustly blamedsome excuse even for their backwardflung desires in the direction of the egyptian fleshpots moses himself may have been blessed with exceptional digestion it was substantial one must say that for it one slice of itsolid firm crusty on the outside towards the centre marshysatisfied most people to a sense of repletion for supper parties dan would essay triflesby no means open to the criticism of being light as airsouffles that guests in spite of my admonishing kicks would persist in alluding to as pudding and in wintertime pancakes later as regards these latter he acquired some skill but at first the difficulty was the tossing i think myself a safer plan would have been to turn them by the aid of a knife and fork it is less showy but more sure at least you avoid all danger of catching the halfbaked thing upon your head instead of in the pan of dropping it into the fire or among the cinders but thorough was always dans motto and after all small particles of coal or a few hairs can always be detected by the careful feeder and removed  a more eventempered man than dan for twentythree hours out of every twentyfour surely never breathed it was a revelation to me to discover that for the other he could be uncertain irritable even ungrateful at first in a spirit of pure good nature i would offer him counsel and advice explain to him why as it seemed to me the custard was pimply the mayonnaise sauce suggestive of hair oil what was my return sneers insult and abuse followed if i did not clear out quickly by spoilt tomatoes cold coffee groundsanything that happened to be handy pained saddened i would withdraw he would kick the door to after me his greatest enemy appeared to be the oven the oven it was that set itself to thwart his best wrought schemes always it was the ovens fault that the snowy bun appeared to have been made of red sandstone the macaroni cheese of cambrian clay one might have sympathised with him more had his language been more restrained as it was the virulence of his reproaches almost inclined one to take the part of the oven  concerning our housemaid i can speak in terms of unqualified praise there are alas fussy housemaidswho has not known and suffered themwho overdo the thing have no repose no instinct telling them when to ease up and let the place alone i have always held the perpetual stirring up of dust a scientific error left to itself it is harmless may even be regarded as a delicate domestic bloom bestowing a touch of homeliness upon objects that without it gleam cold and unsympathetic let sleeping dogs lie why be continually waking up the stuff filling the air with all manner of unhealthy germs nature in her infinite wisdom has ordained that upon table floor or picture frame it shall sink and settle there it remains quiet and inoffensive there it will continue to remain so long as nobody interferes with it why worry it so also with crumbs odd bits of string particles of eggshell stumps of matches ends of cigarettes what fitter place for such than under the nearest mat to sweep them up is tiresome work they cling to the carpet you get cross with them curse them for their obstinacy and feel ashamed of yourself for your childishness for every one you do persuade into the dustpan two jump out again you lose your temper feel bitter towards the man that dropped them your whole character becomes deteriorated under the mat they are always willing to go compromise is true statesmanship there will come a day when you will be glad of an excuse for not doing something else that you ought to be doing then you can take up the mats and feel quite industrious contemplating the amount of work that really must be donesome time or another  to differentiate between the essential and the nonessential that is where woman fails in the name of common sense what is the use of washing a cup that half an hour later is going to be made dirty again if the cat be willing and able to so clean a plate that not one speck of grease remain upon it why deprive her of pleasure to inflict toil upon yourself if a bed looks made and feels made then for all practical purposes it is made why upset it merely to put it straight again it would surprise most women the amount of labour that can be avoided in a house  for needlework i confess i never acquired skill dan had learnt to handle a thimble but my own second finger was ever reluctant to come forward when wanted it had to be found all other fingers removed out of its way then feebly nervously it would push slip get itself pricked badly with the head of the needle and thoroughly frightened remain incapable of further action more practical i found it to push the needle through by help of the door or table  the opera as dan had predicted ran far into the following year when it was done with anotherin which goggles appeared as one of the principalstook its place and was even more successful after the experience of nelson square my present salary of thirtyfive shillings occasionally forty shillings a week seemed to me princely there floated before my eyes the possibility of my becoming a great opera singer on six hundred pounds a week i felt i could be content but the okelly set himself to dispel this dream  yed be making a mistake me boy explained the okelly yed be just wasting yere time i wouldnt tell ye so if i werent convinced of it  i know it is not powerful i admitted  ye might almost call it thin added the okelly  it might be good enough for comic opera i argued people appear to succeed in comic opera without much voice  sure there yere right agreed the okelly with a sigh an of course if ye had an exceptionally fine presence and were strikingly handsome  one can do a good deal with makeup i suggested  the okelly shook his head its never quite the same thing it would depend upon your acting  i dreamt of becoming a second kean of taking macreadys place it need not interfere with my literary ambition i could combine the two fill drury lane in the evening turn out epochmaking novels in the morning write my own plays  every day i studied in the readingroom of the british museum wearying of success in art i might eventually go into parliament a prime minister with a thorough knowledge of history why not with ollendorf for guide i continued french and german it might be the diplomatic service that would appeal to me in my old age an ambassadorship it would be a pleasant termination to a brilliant career  there was excuse for my optimistic mood about this period all things were going well with me a story of mine had been accepted i forget for the moment the name of the journal it is dead now most of the papers in which my early efforts appeared are dead my contributions might be likened to their swan songs proofs had been sent me which i had corrected and returned but proofs are not facts this had happened to me once before and i had been lifted to the skies only to fall the more heavily the paper had collapsed before my story had appeared ah why had they delayed it might have saved them this time i remembered the proverb and kept my own counsel slipping out early each morning on the day of publication to buy the paper to scan eagerly its columns for weeks i suffered hope deferred but at last one bright winters day in january walking down the harrow road i found myself standing still suddenly stunned before a bill outside a small newsvendors shop it was the first time i had seen my real name in print the witch of moel sarbod a legend of mona by paul kelver for this i had even risked discovery by the lady ortensia my legs trembling under me i entered the shop a ruffianlylooking man in dirty shirtsleeves who appeared astonished that any one should want a copy found one at length on the floor underneath the counter with it in my pocket i retraced my footsteps as in a dream on a seat in paddington green i sat down and read it the hundred best books i have waded through them all they have never charmed me as charmed me that one short story in that now forgotten journal need i add it was a sad and sentimental composition once upon a time there lived a mighty king onebut with the names i will not bore you they are somewhat unpronounceable their selection had cost me many hours of study in the british museum readingrooms surrounded by lexicons of the welsh language gazetteers translations from the early celtic poetswith footnotes he loved and was beloved by a beautiful princess whose name being translated was purity one day the king hunting lost his way and being weary lay down and fell asleep and by chance the spot whereon he lay was near to a place which by infinite pains with the aid of a magnifying glass i had discovered upon the map and which means in english the cave of the waters where dwelt a wicked sorceress who while he slept cast her spells upon him so that he awoke to forget his kingly honour and the good of all his people his only desire being towards the witch of moel sarbod  now there lived in this kingdom by the sea a great magician and purity who loved the king far better than herself bethought her of him and of all she had heard concerning his power and wisdom and went to him and besought his aid that she might save the king there was but one way to accomplish this with bare feet purity must climb the rocky path leading to the witchs dwelling go boldly up to her not fearing her sharp claws nor her strong teeth and kiss her upon the mouth in this way the spirit of purity would pass into the witchs soul and she would become a woman but the form and spirit of the witch would pass into purity transforming her and in the cave of the waters she must forever abide thus purity gave herself that the king might live with bleeding feet she climbed the rocky path clasped the witchs form within her arms kissed her on the mouth and the witch became a woman and reigned with the king over his people wisely and helpfully but purity became a hideous witch and to this day abides on moel sarbod where is the cave of the waters and they who climb the mountains side still hear above the roaring of the cataract the sobbing of purity the kings betrothed but many liken it rather to a joyous song of love triumphant  no writer worth his salt was ever satisfied with anything he ever wrote so i have been told and so i try to believe evidently i am not worth my salt candid friends and others to whom in my salad days i used to show my work asking for a frank opinion meaning of course though never would they understand me their unadulterated praise would assure me for my good that this my first to whom the gods gave life was but a feeble illshaped child its attempted early english a cross between the pilgrims progress and old moores almanac its scenerywhich had cost me weeks of researchan apparent attempt to sum up in the language of a local guide book the leading characteristics of the garden of eden combined with dantes inferno its pathos of the pennyplain and twopennycoloured order maybe they were right much have i written since that at the time appeared to me good that i have read later with regret with burning cheek with frowning brow but of this my firstborn the harbinger of all my hopes i am no judge touching the yellowing badlyprinted pages i feel again the deep thrill of joy with which i first unfolded them and read again i am a youngster and life opens out before meinmeasurable no goal too high this child of my brain my work it shall spread my name throughout the world it shall be a household world in lands that i shall never see friends whose voices i shall never hear will speak of me i shall die but it shall live yield fresh seed bear fruit i know not of generations yet unborn shall read it and remember me my thoughts my words my spirit in it i shall live again it shall keep my memory green  the long long thoughts of boyhood we elders smile at them the little world spins round the little voices of an hour sink hushed the crawling generations come and go the solar system drops from space the eternal mechanism reforms and shapes itself anew time turning ploughs another furrow so growing sleepy we murmur with a yawn is it that we see clearer or that our eyes are growing dim let the young men see their visions dream their dreams hug to themselves their hopes of enduring fame so shall they serve the world better  i brushed the tears from my eyes and looked up halfadozen urchins male and female were gaping at me openmouthed they scattered shouting whether compliment or insult i know not probably the latter i flung them a handful of coppers which for the moment silenced them and went upon my way how bright how fair the bustling streets golden in the winter sunshine thronged with life with effort laughter rang around me sweet music rolled from barrelorgans the strenuous voices of the costermongers called invitation to the fruitful earth errand boys passed me whistling shrilly joyous melodies perspiring tradesmen shouted generous offers to the needy men and women hurried by with smiling faces sleek cats purred in sheltered nooks till merry dogs invited them to sport the sparrows feasting in the roadway chirped their hymn of praise  at the marble arch i jumped upon a bus i mentioned to the conductor in mounting that it was a fine day he replied that he had noticed it himself the retort struck me as a brilliant repartee our coachman all but run into by a hansom cab driven by a surly old fellow of patriarchal appearance remarked upon the danger of allowing horses out in charge of bits of boys how full the world of wit and humour  almost without knowing it i found myself in earnest conversation with a young man sitting next to me we conversed of life of love not until afterwards reflecting upon the matter did it surprise me that to a mere chance acquaintance of the moment he had spoken of the one thing dearest to his heart a sweet but clearly wayward maiden the hebe of a small oldfashioned coffeeshop the bus was at that moment passing hitherto i had not been the recipient of confidences it occurred to me that as a rule not even my friends spoke much to me concerning their own affairs generally it was i who spoke to them of mine i sympathised with him advised himhow i do not recollect he said however he thought that i was right and at regent street he left me expressing his determination to follow my counsel whatever it may have been  between berners street and the circus i lent a shilling to a couple of young ladies who had just discovered with amusement quickly swallowed by despair that they neither of them had any money with them they returned it next day in postage stamps with a charming note the assurance with which i tendered the slight service astonished me myself at any other time i should have hesitated argued with my fears offered it with an appearance of sulky constraint and been declined for a moment they were doubtful then looking at me accepted with a delightful smile they consulted me as to the way to paternoster row i instructed them adding a literary anecdote which seemed to interest them i even ventured on a compliment neatly phrased i am inclined to think evidently it pleaseda result hitherto unusual in the case of my compliments at the corner of southampton row i parted from them with regret why had i never noticed before how full of pleasant people this sweet and smiling london  at the corner of queens square a decentlooking woman stopped me to ask the way to the childrens hospital at chelsea explaining she had made a mistake thinking it was the one in great ormond street where her child lay i directed her then glancing into her face noticed how tired she looked and a vista of the weary pavements she would have to tramp flashed before me i slipped some money into her hand and told her to take a bus she flushed then thanked me i turned a few yards further on she was starting after me amazement on her face i laughed and waved my hand to her she smiled back in return and went her way  a rain began to fall i paused upon the doorstep for a minute enjoying the cool drops upon by upturned face the tonic sharpness of the keen east wind then slipped my key into the lock and entered  the door of old deleglises studio on the first floor happened to be open hitherto beyond the usual formal salutations when by chance we met upon the stairs i had exchanged but few words with my eccentric landlord but remembering his kindly face the desire came upon me to tell him my good fortune i felt sure his eyes would lighten with delight by instinct i knew him for a young mans man  i tapped lightly no answer came someone was talking it sounded like a girls voice i pushed the door further open and walked in such was the custom of the house it was a large room built over the yard lighted by one high window before which was the engraving desk shaded under a screen of tissue paper at the further end of the room stood a large chevalglass and in front of this its back towards me was a figure that excited my curiosity so that remaining where i was partly hidden behind a large easel i watched it for awhile in silence above a heavily flounced blue skirt which fell in creases on the floor and trailed a couple of yards or so behind it wore a black lowcut sleeveless bodicemuch too big for itof the fashion early victorian a good deal of darkbrown hair fastened up by hairpins that stuck out in all directions like quills upon a porcupine suggesting collapse with every movement was ornamented by three enormous green feathers one of which hung limply over the ladys left ear three times while i watched unnoticed the lady propped it into a more befitting attitude and three times limp and intoxicatedlooking it fell back into its former foolish position her long thin arms displaying a pair of brilliantly red elbows pointed to quite a dangerous degree terminated in hands so very sunburnt as to convey the impression of a pair of remarkably wellfitting gloves her right hand grasped and waved with determination a large lace fan her left clutched fiercely the front of her skirt with a sweeping curtsey to herself in the glass which would have been more effective could she have avoided tying her legs together with her skirta contretemps necessitating the use of both hands and a succession of jumps before she could disentangle herselfshe remarked so soon as she had recovered her balance  so sorry i am late my carriage was unfortunately delayed  the excuse i gathered was accepted for with a gracious smile and a vigorous bow by help of which every hairpin made distinct further advance towards freedom she turned and with much dignity and head over the right shoulder took a short walk to the left at the end of six short steps she stopped and began kicking for what reason i at first could not comprehend it dawned upon me after awhile that her object was the adjustment of her train finding the manoeuvre too difficult of accomplishment by feet alone she stooped and taking the stuff up in her hands threw it behind her then facing north she retraced her steps to the glass talking to herself as she walked in the highpitched drawl distinctive as my stage knowledge told me of aristocratic society  oh do you think soreally ah yes you say that certainly not i shouldnt think of it there followed what i am inclined to believe was intended for a laugh musical but tantalising if so want of practice marred the effort the performance failed to satisfy even herself she tried again it was still only a giggle  before the glass she paused and with a haughty inclination of her head succeeded for the third time in displacing the intoxicated feather  oh bother the silly thing she said in a voice so natural as to be by contrast with her previous tone quite startling  she fixed it again with difficulty muttering something inarticulate then her left hand resting on an imaginary coatsleeve her right holding her skirt sufficiently high to enable her to move she commenced to majestically gyrate  whether hampered as she was by excess of skirt handicapped by the natural clumsiness of her age catastrophe in any case would not sooner or later have overtaken her i have my doubts i have since learnt her own view to be that but for catching sight in turning of my face staring at her through the bars of the easel all would have gone well and gracefully avoiding controversy on this point the facts to be recorded are that seeing me she uttered a sudden exclamation of surprise dropped her skirt trod on her train felt her hair coming down tried to do two things at once and sat upon the floor i ran to her assistance with flaming face and flashing eyes she sprang to her feet there was a sound as of the rushing down of avalanches the blue flounced skirt lay round her on the floor she stood above its billowy folds reminiscent of venus rising from the wavesa gawky angular venus in a short serge frock reaching a little below her knees black stockings and a pair of prunella boots of a size suggesting she had yet some inches to grow before reaching her full height  i hope you havent hurt yourself i said  the next moment i didnt care whether she had or whether she hadnt she did not reply to my kindly meant enquiry instead her hand swept through the air in the form of an ample semicircle it terminated on my ear it was not a small hand it was not a soft hand it was not that sort of hand the sound of the contact rang through the room like a pistol shot i beard it with my other ear i sprang at her and catching her before she had recovered her equilibrium kissed her i did not kiss her because i wanted to i kissed her because i could not box her ears back in return which i should have preferred doing i kissed her hoping it would make her mad it did if a look could have killed me such would have been the tragic ending of this story it did not kill me it did me good  you horrid boy she cried you horrid horrid boy  there i admit she scored i did not in the least object to her thinking me horrid but at nineteen one does object to being mistaken for a boy  i am not a boy i explained  yes you are she retorted a beast of a boy  if you do it again i warned hera sudden movement on her part hinting to me the possibilityill kiss you again i mean it  leave the room she commanded pointing with her angular arm towards the door  i did not wish to remain i was about to retire with as much dignity as circumstances permitted  boy she added  at that i turned now i wont go i replied see if i do  we stood glaring at each other  what right have you in here she demanded  i came to see mr deleglise i answered i suppose you are miss deleglise it doesnt seem to me that you know how to treat a visitor  who are you she asked  mr horace moncrieff i replied i was using at the period both my names indiscriminately but for this occasion horace moncrieff i judged the more aweinspiring  she snorted i know youre the housemaid you sweep all the crumbs under the mats  now this was a subject about which at the time i was feeling somewhat sore needs must when the devil drives but as matters were dan and i could well have afforded domestic assistance it rankled in my mind that to fit in with the foolish fad of old deleglise i the future dickens thackeray and george eliot kean macready and phelps rolled into one should be compelled to the performance of menial duties on this morning of all others my brilliant literary career just commenced the anomaly of the thing appeared naturally more glaring  besides how came she to know i swept the crumbs under the matthat it was my method had she and dan been discussing me ridiculing me behind my back what right had dan to reveal the secrets of our menage to this chit of a schoolgirl had he done so or had she been prying poking her tilted nose into matters that did not concern her pity it was she had no mother to occasionally spank her teach her proper behaviour  where i sweep our crumbs is nothing to do with you i replied with some spirit that i have to sweep them at all is the fault of your father a sensible girl  how dare you speak against my father she interrupted me with blazing eyes  we will not discuss the question further i answered with sense and dignity  i think you had better not she retorted  turning her back on me she commenced to gather up her hairpinsthere must have been about a hundred of them i assisted her to the extent of picking up about twenty which i handed to her with a bow it may have been a little stiff but that was only to be expected i wished to show her that her bad example had not affected my own manners  i am sorry my presence should have annoyed you i said it was quite an accident i entered the room thinking your father was here  when you saw he wasnt you might have gone out again she replied instead of hiding yourself behind a picture  i didnt hide myself i explained the easel happened to be in the way  and you stopped there and watched me  i couldnt help it  she looked round and our eyes met they were frank grey eyes an expression of merriment shot into them i laughed  then she laughed it was a delightful laugh the laugh one would have expected from her  you might at least have coughed she suggested  it was so amusing i pleaded  i suppose it was she agreed and held out her hand did i hurt you she asked  yes you did i answered taking it  well it was enough to annoy me wasnt it she suggested  evidently i agreed  i am going to a ball next week she explained a grownup ball and ive got to wear a skirt i wanted to see if i could manage a train  well to be candid you cant i assured her  it does seem difficult  shall i show you i asked  what do you know about it  well i see it done every night  oh yes of course youre on the stage yes do  we readjusted the torn skirt accommodating it better to her figure by the help of hairpins i showed her how to hold the train and i humming a tune we commenced to waltz  i shouldnt count my steps i suggested to her it takes your mind away from the music  i dont waltz well she admitted meekly i know i dont do anything wellexcept play hockey  and try not to tread on your partners feet thats a very bad fault  i do try not to she explained  it comes with practice i assured her  ill get tom to give me half an hour every evening she said he dances beautifully  whos tom  oh father  why do you call your father tom it doesnt sound respectful  oh he likes it and it suits him so much better than father besides he isnt like a real father he does everything i want him to  is that good for you  no its very bad for meeverybody says so when you come to think of it of course it isnt the way to bring up a girl i tell him but he merely laughssays its the only way he knows i do hope i turn out all right am i doing it better now  a little dont be too anxious about it dont look at your feet  but if i dont they go all wrong it was you who trod on mine that time  i know im sorry its a little difficult not to  am i holding my train all right  well theres no need to grip it as if you were afraid it would run away it will follow all right hold it gracefully  i wish i wasnt a girl  oh youll get used to it we concluded our dance  what do i dosay thank you  yes prettily  what does he do  oh he takes you back to your chaperon or suggests refreshment or you sit and talk  i hate talking i never know what to say  oh thats his duty hell try and amuse you then you must laugh you have a nice laugh  but i never know when to laugh if i laugh when i want to it always offends people what do you do if somebody asks you to dance and you dont want to dance with them  oh you say your programme is full  but if it isnt  well you tell a lie  couldnt i say i dont dance well and that im sure theyd get on better with somebody else  it would be the truth but they might not believe it  i hope nobody asks me that i dont want  well he wont a second time anyhow  you are rude  you are only a schoolgirl  i look a woman in my new frock i really do  i should doubt it  you shall see me then youll be polite it is because you are a boy you are rude men are much nicer  oh are they  yes you will be when you are a man  the sound of voices rose suddenly in the hall  tom cried miss deleglise and collecting her skirt in both hands bolted down the corkscrew staircase leading to the kitchen leaving me standing in the centre of the studio  the door opened and old deleglise entered accompanied by a small slight man with red hair and beard and somewhat watery eyes  deleglise himself was a handsome old fellow then a man of about fiftyfive his massive mobile face illuminated by bright restless eyes was crowned with a lionlike mane of irongrey hair till a few years ago he had been a painter of considerable note but in questions of art his temper was short preraphaelism had gone out of fashion for the time being the tendency of the new age was towards impressionism and in disgust old deleglise had broken his palette across his knee and swore never to paint again artistic work of some sort being necessary to his temperament he contented himself now with engraving at the moment he was engaged upon the reproduction of memlincs shrine of st ursula with photographs of which he had just returned from bruges  at sight of me his face lighted with a smile and he advanced with outstretched hand  ah my lad so you have got over your shyness and come to visit the old bear in his den good boy i like young faces  he had a clear musical voice ever with the suggestion of a laugh behind it he laid his hand upon my shoulder  why you are looking as if you had come into a fortune he added and didnt know what a piece of bad luck that can be to a young fellow like yourself  how could it be bad luck i asked laughing  takes all the sauce out of life young man answered deleglise what interest is there in running a race with the prize already in your possession tell me that  it is not that kind of fortune i answered it is another i have had my first story accepted it is in print look  i handed him the paper he spread it out upon the engraving board before him  ah thats better he said thats better charlie he turned to the redheaded man who had seated himself listlessly in the one easychair the room contained come here  the redheaded man rose and wandered towards us let me introduce you to mr paul kelver our new fellow servant our lady has accepted him he has just been elected his first story is in print  the redhaired man stretched out his long thin hand i have thirty years of fame said the redhaired mancould i say worldwide  he turned for confirmation to old deleglise who laughed i think you can  if i could give it you would you exchange with meat this moment  you would be a fool if you did he went on ones first success ones first victory it is the lovers first kiss fortune grows old and wrinkled frowns more often than she smiles we become indifferent to her quarrel with her make it up again but the joy of her first kiss after the long wooing burn it into your memory my young friend that it may live with you always  he strolled away old deleglise took up the parable  ah yes ones first success paul laugh my boy cry shut yourself up in your room shout dance throw your hat into the air and cry hurrah make the most of it paul hug it to your heart think of it dream of it this is the finest hour of your life my boy there will never come another like itnever  he crossed the studio and taking from its nail a small oil painting brought it over and laid it on the board beside my paper it was a fascinating little picture painted with that exquisite minutiae and development of detail that a newer school was then ridiculing as though art had but one note to her voice the dead figure of an old man lay upon a bed a child had crept into the darkened room and supporting itself by clutching tightly at the sheet was gazing with solemn curiosity upon the white still face  that was mine said old deleglise it was hung in the academy thirtysix years ago and bought for ten guineas by a dentist at bury st edmunds he went mad a few years later and died in a lunatic asylum i had never lost sight of it and the executors were quite agreeable to my having it back again for the same ten guineas i used to go every morning to the academy to look at it i thought it the cleverest bit of work in the whole gallery and im not at all sure that it wasnt i saw myself a second teniers another millet look how that light coming through the open door is treated isnt it good somebody will pay a thousand guineas for it before i have been dead a dozen years and it is worth it but i wouldnt sell it myself now for five thousand ones first success it is worth all the rest of life  all queried the redhaired man from his easychair we looked round the lady of the skirt had entered now her own proper self a young girl of about fifteen angular awkwardlooking but bringing into the room with her that atmosphere of life of hope that is the eternal message of youth she was not beautiful not thenplain one might almost have called her but for her frank grey eyes her mass of darkbrown hair now gathered into a long thick plait a light came into old deleglises eyes  you are right not all he murmured to the redhaired man  she came forward shyly i found it difficult to recognise in her the flaming fury that a few minutes before had sprung at me from the billows of her torn blue skirt she shook hands with the redhaired man and kissed her father  my daughter said old deleglise introducing me to her mr paul kelver a literary gent  mr kelver and i have met already she explained he has been waiting for you here in the studio  and have you been entertaining him asked deleglise oh yes i entertained him she replied her voice was singularly like her fathers with just the same suggestion of ever a laugh behind it  we entertained each other i said  thats all right said old deleglise stop and lunch with us we will make ourselves a curry    chapter vi  of the glory and goodness and the evil that go to the making of love  during my time of struggle i had avoided all communication with old hasluck he was not a man to sympathise with feelings he did not understand with boisterous good humour he would have insisted upon helping me why i preferred half starving with lott and co to selling my labour for a fair wage to goodnatured old hasluck merely because i knew him i cannot explain though the profits may not have been so large lott and cos dealings were not one whit more honest i do not believe it was that which decided me nor do i think it was because he was barbaras father i never connected him nor that good old soul his vulgar homely wife in any way with barbara to me she was a being apart from all the world her true parents i should have sought them rather amid the sacred groves of vanished lands within the skydomed shrines of banished gods there are instincts in us not easily analysed not to be explained by reason i have always preferred the findingsometimes the losingof my way according to the map to the surer and simpler method of vocal enquiry working out a complicated journey and running the risk of never arriving at my destination by aid of a continental bradshaw to putting myself into the hands of courteous officials maintained and paid to assist the perplexed traveller possibly a faroff progenitor of mine may have been some morose rogue savage with untribal inclinations living in his cave apart fashioning his own stone hammer shaping his own flint arrowheads shunning the merry wardance preferring to caper by himself  but now having gained my own foothold i could stretch out my hand without fear of the movement being mistaken for appeal i wrote to old hasluck and almost by the next post received from him the friendliest of notes he told me barbara had just returned from abroad took it upon himself to add that she also would be delighted to see me and as i knew he would threw his doors open to me  of my boyish passion for barbara never had i spoken to a living soul nor do i think excepting barbara herself had any ever guessed it to my mother though she was very fond of her barbara was only a girl with charms but also with faults concerning which my mother would speak freely hurting me as one unwittingly might hurt a neophyte by philosophical discussion of his newly embraced religion often choosing by preference late evening or the night i would wander round and round the huge redbrick house standing in its ancient garden on the top of stamford hill descending again into the noisome streets as one returning to the world from praying at a shrine purified filled with peace all noble endeavour all unselfish aims seeming within my grasp  during barbaras four years absence my adoration had grown and strengthened out of my memory of her my desire had evolved its ideal a being of my imagination but by reason of that to me the more real the more present i looked forward to seeing her again but with no impatience revelling rather in the anticipation than eager for the realisation as a creature of flesh and blood the child i had played with talked with touched she had faded further and further into the distance as the vision of my dreams she stood out clearer day by day i knew that when next i saw her there would be a gulf between us i had no wish to bridge to worship her from afar was a sweeter thought to me than would have been the hope of a passionate embrace to live with her sit opposite to her while she ate and drank see her perhaps with her hair in curlpapers know possibly that she had a corn upon her foot hear her speak maybe of a decayed tooth or of a chilblain would have been torture to me into such abyss of the commonplace there was no fear of my dragging her and for this i was glad in the future she would be yet more removed from me she was older than i was she must be now a woman instinctively i felt that in spite of years i was not yet a man she would marry the thought gave me no pain my feeling for her was utterly devoid of appetite no one but myself could close the temple i had built about her none deny to me the right of entry there no jealous priest could hide her from my eyes her altar i had reared too high since i have come to know myself better i perceive that she stood to me not as a living woman but as a symbol not a fellow human being to be walked with through life helping and to be helped but that impalpable religion of sex to which we raise up idols of poor human clay alas not always to our satisfaction so that foolishly we fall into anger against them forgetting they were but the work of our own hands not the body but the spirit of love  i allowed a week to elapse after receiving old haslucks letter before presenting myself at stamford hill it was late one afternoon in early summer hasluck had not returned from the city mrs hasluck was out visiting miss hasluck was in the garden i told the supercilious footman not to trouble i would seek her there myself i guessed where she would be her favourite spot had always been a sunny corner bright with flowers surrounded by a thick yew hedge cut after the dutch fashion into quaint shapes of animals and birds she was walking there as i had expected reading a book and again as i saw her came back to me the feeling that had swept across me as a boy when first outlined against the dusty books and papers of my fathers office she had flashed upon my eyes that all the fairy tales had suddenly come true only now instead of the princess she was the queen taller she was with a dignity that formerly had been the only charm she lacked she did not hear my coming my way being across the soft short grass and for a little while i stood there in the shadow of the yews drinking in the beauty of her clearcut profile bent down towards her book the curving lines of her long neck the wonder of the exquisite white hand against the lilac of her dress  i did not speak rather would i have remained so watching but turning at the end of the path she saw me and as she came towards me held out her hand i knelt upon the path and raised it to my lips the action was spontaneous till afterwards i was not aware of having done it her lips were smiling as i raised my eyes to them the faintest suggestion of contempt mingling with amusement yet she seemed pleased and her contempt even if i were not mistaken would not have wounded me  so you are still in love with me i wondered if you would be  did you know that i was in love with you  i should have been blind if i had not  but i was only a boy  you were not the usual type of boy you are not going to be the usual type of man  you do not mind my loving you  i cannot help it can i nor can you  she seated herself on a stone bench facing a sundial and leaning hack her hands clasped behind her head looked at me and laughed  i shall always love you i answered but it is with a curious sort of love i do not understand it myself  tell me she commanded still with a smile about her lips describe it to me  i was standing over against her my arm resting upon the dials stone column the sun was sinking casting long shadows on the velvety grass illuminating with a golden light her upturned face  i would you were some great queen of olden days and that i might be always near you serving you doing your bidding your love in return would spoil all i shall never ask it never desire it that i might look upon you touch now and then at rare intervals with my lips your hand kiss in secret the glove you had let fall the shoe you had flung off know that you knew of my love that i was yours to do with as you would to live or die according to your wish or that you were priestess in some temple of forgotten gods where i might steal at daybreak and at dusk to gaze upon your beauty kneel with clasped hands watching your sandalled feet coming and going about the altar steps lie with pressed lips upon the stones your trailing robes had touched  she laughed a light mocking laugh i should prefer to be the queen the role of priestess would not suit me temples are so cold a slight shiver passed through her she made a movement with her hand beckoning me to her feet that is how you shall love me paul she said adoring me worshipping meblindly i will be your queen and treat youas it chooses me all i think all i do i will tell you and you shall tell me it is right the queen can do no wrong  she took my face between her hands and bending over me looked long and steadfastly into my eyes you understand paul the queen can do no wrongnever never there had crept into her voice a note of vehemence in her face was a look almost of appeal  my queen can do no wrong i repeated and she laughed and let her hands fall back upon her lap  now you may sit beside me so much honour paul shall you have today but it will have to last you long and you may tell me all you have been doing maybe it will amuse me and afterwards you shall hear what i have done and shall say that it was right and good of me  i obeyed sketching my story briefly yet leaving nothing untold not even the transit of the lady ortensia ashamed of the episode though i was at that she looked a little grave  you must do nothing again paul she commanded to make me feel ashamed of you or i shall dismiss you from my presence for ever i must be proud of you or you shall not serve me in dishonouring yourself you are dishonouring me i am angry with you paul do not let me be angry with you again  and so that passed and although my love for heras i know well she wished and sought it shouldfailed to save me at all times from the apish voices whispering ever to the beast within us i know the desire to be worthy of her to honour her with all my being helped my life as only love can the glory of the morning fades the magic veil is rent we see all things with cold clear eyes my love was a woman she lies dead they have mocked her white sweet limbs with rags and tatters but they cannot cheat loves eyes god knows i loved her in all purity only with false love we love the false beneath the unclean clinging garments she sleeps fair  my tale finished now i will tell you mine she said i am going to be married soon i shall be a countess paul the countess huescari will teach you how to pronounce itand i shall have a real castle in spain you need not look so frightened paul we shall not live there it is a halfruined gloomy place among the mountains and he loves it even less than i do paris and london will be my courts so you will see me often you shall know the great world paul the world i mean to conquer where i mean to rule  is he very rich i asked  as poor she laughed as poor as a spanish nobleman the money i shall have to provide or rather poor dear dad will he gives me title position of course i do not love him handsome though he is dont look so solemn paul we shall get on together well enough queens paul do not make love matches they contract alliances i have done well paul congratulate me do you hear paul say that i have acted rightly  does he love you i asked  he tells me so she answered with a laugh how uncourtierlike you are paul do you suggest that any man could see me and not love me  she sprang to her feet i do not want his love she cried it would bore me women hate love they cannot return i dont mean love like yours devout little paul she added with a laugh that is sweet incense wafted round us that we like to scent with our noses in the air give me that paul i want it i ask for it but the love of a hand the love of a husband that one does not care forit would be horrible  i felt myself growing older for the moment my goddess became a child needing help  but have you thought i commenced  yes yes she interrupted me quickly i have thought and thought till i can think no more there must be some sacrifice it must be as little as need be that is all he does not love me he is marrying me for my moneyi know that and i am glad of it you do not know me paul i must have rank position what am i the daughter of rich old hasluck who began life as a butcher in the mile end road as the princess huescar society will forget as mrsit seemed to me she checked herself abruptlyjones or brown it would remember however rich i might be i am vain paul caring for powerambition i have my fathers blood in me all his nights and days he has spent in gaining wealth he can do no more we upstarts have our pride of race he has done his share i must do mine  but you need not be mere mrs anybody commonplace i argued why not wait you will meet someone who can give you position and whom at the same time you can love would that not be better  he will never come the man i could love she answered because my little paul he has come already hush paul the queen can do no wrong  who is he i asked may i not know  yes paul she answered you shall know i want you to know then you shall tell me that i have acted rightly do you hear me paulquite rightlythat you still respect me and honour me he could not help me as his wife i should be less even than i am a mere rich nobody giving long dinnerparties to other rich nobodies living amongst city men retired tradespeople envied only by their fat vulgarly dressed wives courted by seedy bohemians for the sake of my cook with perhaps an opera singer or an impecunious nobleman or two out of dads city list for my showguests is that the court paul where you would have your queen reign  is he so commonplace a man i answered the man you love i cannot believe it  he is not commonplace she answered it is i who am commonplace the things i desire they are beneath him he will never trouble himself to secure them  not even for love of you  i would not have him do so even were he willing he is great with a greatness i cannot even understand he is not the man for these times in old days i should have married him knowing he would climb to greatness by sheer strength of manhood but now men do not climb they crawl to greatness he could not do that i have done right paul  what does he say i asked  shall i tell you she laughed a little bitterly i can give you his exact words you are half a woman and half a fool so womanlike you will follow your folly but let your folly see to it that your woman makes no fool of herself  the words were what i could imagine his saying i heard the strong ring of his voice through her mocking mimicry  hal i cried it is he  so you never guessed even that paul i thought at times it would be sweet to cry it out aloud that it could have made no difference that everyone who knew me must have read it in my eyes  but he never seemed to take much notice of you i said  she laughed you neednt be so unkind paul what did i ever do for you much more than snub you we boys and girls there is not so much difference between us we love our masters yet you must not think so poorly of me i was only a child to him then but we were locked up in paris together during the entire siege have not you heard he did take a little notice of me there paul i assure you  would it have been better i wonder had she followed the woman and not the fool it sounds an easy question to answer but i am thinking of years later one winters night at tiefenkasten in the julier pass i was on my way from san moritz to chur the sole passenger i had just climbed half frozen from the sledge and was thawing myself before the stove in the common room of the hotel when the waiter put a pencilled note into my hand  come up and see me i am a prisoner in this damned hole till the weather breaks hal  i hardly recognised him at first only the poor ghost he seemed of the hal i had known as a boy his long privations endured during the paris siege added to the superhuman work he had there put upon himself had commenced the ruin of even his magnificent physiquea ruin the wild loose life he was now leading was soon to complete it was a gloomy vaulted room that once had been a chapel lighted dimly by a cheap evilsmelling lamp heated to suffocation by one of those great greentiled german ovens now only to be met with in rare outoftheway world corners he was sitting propped up by pillows on the bed placed close to one of the high windows his deep eyes flaring like two gleaming caverns out of his drawn haggard face  i saw you from the window he explained it is the only excitement i get twice a day when the sledges come in i broke down coming across the pass a fortnight ago on my way from davos we were stuck in a drift for eighteen hours it nearly finished my last lung and i havent even a book to read by god lad i was glad to see your frosted face ten minutes ago in the light of the lantern  he grasped me with his long bony hand sit down and let me hear my voice using again its mother tongueyou were always a good listenerfor the last eight years i have hardly spoken it can you stand the room the windows ought to be open but what does it matter i may as well get accustomed to the heat before i die  i drew my chair close to the bed and for awhile between his fits of coughing we talked of things that were outside our thoughts or rather hal talked continuously boisterously meeting my remonstrances with shouts of laughter ending in wild struggles for breath so that i deemed it better to let him work his mad mood out  then suddenly what is she doing he asked do you ever see her  she is playing in i mentioned the name of a comic opera then running in paris no i have not seen her for some time  he laid his white wasted hand on mine what a pity you and i could not have rolled ourselves into one paulyou the saint and i the satyr together we should have made her perfect lover  there came back to me the memory of those long nights when i had lain awake listening to the angry voices of my father and mother soaking through the flimsy wall it seemed my fate to stand thus helpless between those i loved watching them hurting one another against their will  tell me i askedi loved her knowing her i was not blind whose fault was it yours or hers  he laughed whose fault paul god made us  thinking of her fair sweet face i hated him for his mocking laugh but the next moment looking into his deep eyes seeing the pain that dwelt there my pity was for him a smile came to his ugly mouth  you have been on the stage paul you must have heard the saying often ah well the curtain must come down however badly things are going it is only a play paul we do not choose our parts i did not even know i was the villain till i heard the booing of the gallery i even thought i was the hero full of noble sentiment sacrificing myself for the happiness of the heroine she would have married me in the beginning had i plagued her sufficiently  i made to speak but he interrupted me continuing ah yes it might have been better that is easy to say not knowing so too it might have been worsein all probability much the same all roads lead to the end you know i was always a fatalist paul we tried both ways she loved me well enough but she loved the world also i thought she loved it better so i kissed her on her brow mumbled a prayer for her happiness and made my exit to a choking sob so ended the first act wasnt i the hero throughout that paul i thought so slapped myself upon the back told myself what a fine fellow i had been thenyou know what followed she was finer clay than she had fancied love is womans kingdom not the world even then i thought more of her than of myself i could have borne my share of the burden had i not seen her fainting under hers shamed degraded so we dared to think for ourselves injuring nobody but ourselves played the man and woman lost the world for love wasnt it brave paul were we not hero and heroine they had printed the playbill wrong paul that was all i was really the hero but the printing devil had made a slip so instead of applauding you booed how could you know any of you it was not your fault  but that was not the end i reminded him if the curtain had fallen then i could have forgiven you  he grinned that fatal last act even yours dont always come right so the critics tell me  the grin faded from his face we may never see each other again paul he went on dont think too badly of me i found i had made a second mistakeor thought i had she was no happier with me after a time than she had been with him if all our longings were one life would be easy but they are not what is to be done but toss for it and if it come down head we wish it had been tail and if tail we think of what we have lost through its not coming down head love is no more the whole of a womans life than it is of a mans he did not apply for a divorce that was smart of him we were shunned ignored to some women it might not have mattered but she had been used to being sought courted feted she made no complaintdid worse made desperate effort to appear cheerful to pretend that our humdrum life was not boring her to death i watched her growing more listless more depressed grew angry with her angrier with myself there was no bond between us except our passion that was real enoughgrand i believe is the approved literary adjective it is good enough for what nature intended it a summer season in a cave it makes but a poor marriage settlement in these more complicated days we fell to mutual recriminations vulgar scenes ah most of us look better at a little distance from one another the sordid contemptible side of life became important to us i was never rich by contrast with all that she had known miserably poor the mere sight of the food our twelvepoundayear cook put upon the table would take away her appetite love does not change the palate give you a taste for cheap claret when you have been accustomed to dry champagne we have bodies to think of as well as souls we are apt to forget that in moments of excitement  she fell ill and it seemed to me that i had dragged her from the soil where she had grown only to watch her die and then he came precisely at the right moment i cannot help admiring him most men take their revenge clumsily hurting themselves he was so neat had been so patient i am not even ashamed of having fallen into his trap it was admirably baited maybe i had despised him for having seemed to submit meekly to the blow what cared he for me and my opinion it was she was all he cared for he knew her better than i knew that sooner or later she would tire not of love but of the cottage look back with longing eyes towards all that she had lost fool cuckold what was it to him that the world would laugh at him despise him love such as his made fools of men would i not give her back to him  by god it was fine acting half into the night we talked i leaving him every now and again to creep to the top of the stairs and listen to her breathing he asked me my advice i being the hardheaded partner of cool judgment what would be the best way of approaching her after i was gone where should he take her how should they live till the nine days talk had died away and i sat opposite to himhow he must have longed to laugh in my silly faceadvising him we could not quite agree as to details of a possible yachting cruise and i remember hunting up an atlas and we pored over it our heads close together by god i envy him that night  he sank back on his pillows and laughed and coughed and laughed and coughed again till i feared that wild long broken laugh would be his last but it ceased at length and for awhile exhausted he lay silent before continuing  then came the question how was i to go she loved me still he was sure of it and for the matter of that so was i so long as she thought that i loved her she would never leave me only from her despair could fresh hope arise for her would i not make some sacrifice for her sake persuade her that i had tired of her only by one means could she be convinced my going off alone would not suffice my reason for that she might suspectshe might follow it would be for her sake again it was the hero that i played the dear old chuckleheaded hero paul that you ought to have cheered not hooted i loved her as much as i ever loved her in my life that night i left her i took my boots off in the passage and crept up in my stockinged feet i told him i was merely going to change my coat and put a few things into a bag he gripped my hand and tears were standing in his eyes it is odd that suppressed laughter and expressed grief should both display the same token is it not i stole into her room i dared not kiss her for fear of waking her but a stray lock of her hairyou remember how long it wasfell over the pillow nearly reaching to the floor i pressed my lips against it where it trailed over the bedstead till they bled i have it still upon my lips the mingling of the cold iron and the warm soft silken hair he told me when i came down again that i had been gone threequarters of an hour and we went out of the house together he and i that is the last time i ever saw her  i leant across and put my arms around him i suppose it was unenglish there are times when one forgets these points i did not know i did not know i cried  he pressed me to him with his feeble arms what a cad you must have thought me paul he said but you might have given me credit for better taste i was always rather a gourmet than a gourmand where women were concerned  you have never seen him either again i asked  no he answered i swore to kill him when i learnt the trick he had played me he commenced the divorce proceedings against her the very morning after i had left her possibly had i succeeded in finding him within the next six months i should have done so a few newspaper proprietors would have been the only people really benefited time is the cheapest bravo a little patience is all he charges all roads lead to the end paul  but i tell my tale badly marring effects of sunlight with the memory of shadows at the time all promised fair he was a handsome distinguishedlooking man not every aristocrat if without disrespect to ones betters a humble observer may say so suggests his title this man would have suggested his title had he not possessed it i suppose he must have been about fifty at the time but most men of thirty would have been glad to exchange with him both figure and complexion his behaviour to his fiancee was the essence of good taste affectionate devotion carried to the exact point beyond which having regard to the disparity of their years it would have appeared ridiculous that he sincerely admired her was fully content with her there could be no doubt i am even inclined to think he was fonder of her than divining her feelings towards himself he cared to show knowledge of the world must have told him that men of fifty find it easier to be the lovers of women young enough to be their daughters than girls find it to desire the affection of men old enough to be their fathers and he was not the man to allow impulse to lead him into absurdity  from my own peculiar point of view he appeared the ideal prince consort it was difficult for me to imagine my queen in love with any mere man this was one beside whom she could live losing in my eyes nothing of her dignity my feelings for her he guessed at our first interview most men in his position would have been amused and many would have shown it for what reason i cannot say but with a tact and courtesy that left me only complimented he drew from me before i had met him halfadozen times more frank confession than a month previously i should have dreamt of my yielding to anything than my own pillow he laid his hand upon my shoulder  i wonder if you know my friend how wise you are he said we all of us at your age love an image of our own carving ah if only we could be content to worship the white changeless statute but we are fools we pray the gods to give her life and under our hot kisses she becomes a woman i also loved when i was your age paul your countrymen they are so practical they know only one kind of love it is businesslike richhow puts it your poet rich in saving common sense but there are many kinds you understand that my friend you are wise do not confuse them she was a child of the mountains i used to walk three leagues to mass each day to worship her had i been wisehad i so left it the memory of her would have coloured all my life with glory but i was a fool my friend i turned her into a woman ahhe made a gesture of disgustsuch a fat ugly woman paul i turned her into i had much difficulty in getting rid of her we should never touch things in life that are beautiful we have such clumsy hands we spoil whatever we touch  hal did not return to england till the end of the year by which time the count and countess huescarthough i had her permission still to call her barbara i never availed myself of it the countess fitted my mood betterhad taken up residence in the grand paris house old hasluck had bought for them  it was the highwater mark of old haslucks career and if anything he was a little disappointed that with the dowry he had promised her barbara had not done even better for herself  foreign counts he grumbled to me laughingly one day well i hope theyre worth more in society than they are in the city a hundred guineas is their price there and theyre not worth that who was that american girl that married a russian prince only last week a million dollars was all she gave for him and she a wholesale bootmakers daughter into the bargain our girls are not half as smart  but that was before he had seen his future soninlaw after he was content enough and up to the day of the wedding childishly elated under the counts tuition he studied with reverential awe the huescar history princes statesmen warriors glittered golden apples from the spreading branches of its genealogical tree why not again its attenuated blue sap strengthened with the rich red blood brewed by toil and effort in the grim laboratories of the under world in imagination old hasluck saw himself the grandfather of chancellors the greatgrandfather of kings  i have laid the foundation you shall raise the edifice so he told her one evening i was spending with them caressing her golden hair with his blunt fat fingers i am glad you were not a boy a boy in all probability would have squandered the money let the name sink back again into the gutter and even had he been the other sort he could only have been another business man keeping where i had left him you will call your first boy hasluck wont you it must always be the firstborns name it shall be famous in the world yet and for something else than mere money  i began to understand the influences that had gone towards the makingor marringof barbaras character i had never guessed he had cared for anything beyond money and the making of money  it was of course a wedding as ostentatious as possible old hasluck knew how to advertise and spared neither expense nor labour with the result that it was the event of the season at least according to the society papers mrs hasluck was the type of woman to have escaped observation even had the wedding been her own that she was present at her daughters becomingly dressed in grey veiling spotted white with an encrustation of mousseline de soie i learnt the next day from the morning post old hasluck himself had to be fetched every time he was wanted at the conclusion of the ceremony seeking him i found him sitting on the stairs leading to the crypt  is it over he asked he was mopping his face on a huge handkerchief and had a small lookingglass in his hand  all over i answered they are waiting for you to start  i always perspire so when im excited he explained keep me out of it as much as possible  but the next time i saw him which was two or three days later the reaction had set in he was sitting in his great library surrounded by books he would no more have thought of disturbing than he would of strumming on the gorgeous grand piano inlaid with silver that ornamented his drawingroom a change had passed over him his swelling rotundity suggestive generally of a bladder inflated to its extremest limits by excess of selfimportance appeared to be shrinking i put the idea aside as mere fancy at the time but it was fact he became a mere bag of bones before he died he was wearing an old pair of carpet slippers and smoking a short clay pipe  well i said everything went off all right  everybodys gone off all right so far he grunted he was crouching over the fire though the weather was still warm one hand spread out towards the blaze now ive got to go off thats the only thing theyre waiting for then everything will be in order  i dont think they are wanting you to go off i answered with a laugh  you mean he answered im the goose that lays the golden eggs ah but you see so many of the eggs break and so many of them are bad  some of them hatch all right i replied the simile was becoming somewhat confused in conversation similes are apt to  if i were to die this week he saidhe paused completing mental calculations i should be worth roughly speaking a couple of million this time next year i may be owing a million  i sat down opposite to him why run risks i suggested surely you have enough why not give it upretire  he laughed do you think i havent said that to myself ladsworn i would a dozen times a year i cant do it im a gambler its the earliest thing i can recollect doing gambling with brace buttons there are men paul now dying in the workhousemen i once knew well i think of them sometimes and wish i didntwho any time during half their life might have retired on twenty thousand a year if i were to go to any one of them and settle an annuity of a hundred a year upon him the moment my back was turned hed sell it out and totter up to threadneedle street with the proceeds its in our blood i shall gamble on my deathbed die with the tape in my hand  he kicked the fire into a blaze a roaring flame made the room light again  but that wont be just yet awhile he laughed and before it does ill be the richest man in europe i keep my head coolthats the great secret leaning over towards me he sunk his voice to a whisper drink paulso many of them drink they get worried fifty things dancing round and round at the same time in their heads fifty questions to be answered in five minutes tick tick tick taps the little devil at their elbow this going down that going up rumor of this report of that a fortune to be lost here a fortune to be snatched there everything in a whirl tick tick tick like nails into a coffin god for five minutes peace to think shut the door turn the key out comes the bottle thats the end all right so long as you keep away from that cool quick brain clear judgmentthats the secret  but is it worth it all i suggested surely you have enough  it means power paul he slapped his trousers pocket making the handful of gold and silver he always carried there jingle musically it is this that rules the world my children shall be big pots hobnob with kings and princes slap them on the back and call them by their christian names be kings themselveswhy not its happened before my children the children of old noel hasluck son of a whitechapel butcher heres my pedigree again be slapped his tuneful pocket its an older one than theirs its coming into its own at last its moneywe men of moneythat are the true kings now its our family that rules the worldthe great money family i mean to be its head  the blaze died out leaving the room almost in darkness and for awhile we sat in silence  quiet isnt it said old hasluck raising his head  the settling of the falling embers was the only sound about us  guess well always be like this now continued old hasluck old woman goes to bed you see immediately after dinner it used to be different when she was about somehow the house and the lackeys and all the rest of it seemed to be a more natural sort of thing when she was the centre of it it frightens the old woman now shes gone she likes to get away from it poor old susan a little country inn with herself as landlady and me fussing about behind the bar that was always her ambition poor old girl  you will be visiting them i suggested and they will be coming to stop with you  he shook his head they wont want me and it isnt my game to hamper them i never mix out of my class ive always had sense enough for that  i laughed wishing to cheer him though i knew he was right surely your daughter belongs to your own class i replied  do you think so he asked with a grin thats not a pretty compliment to her she was my child when she used to cling round my neck while i made the sausages calling me her dear old pig it didnt trouble her then that i dropped my aitches and had a greasy skin i was a whitechapel butcher and she was a whitechapel brat i could have kept her if id liked but i was set upon making a lady of her and i did it but i lost my child every time she came back from school i could see she despised me a little more im not blaming her how could she help it i was making a lady of her teaching her to do it though there were moments when i almost hated her felt tempted to snatch her back to me drag her down again to my level make her my child again before it was too late oh it wasnt all unselfishness i could have done it she would have remained my class then would have married my class and her children would have been my class i didnt want that everythings got to be paid for i got what i asked for im not grumbling at the price but it aint cheap  he rose and knocked the ashes from his pipe ring the bell paul will you he said lets have some light and something to drink dont take any notice of me ive got the hump tonight  it was a minute or two before the lamp came he put his arm upon my shoulder leaning upon me somewhat heavily  i used to fancy sometimes paul he said that you and she might have made a match of it i should have been disappointed for some things but youd have been a bit nearer to me you two it never occurred to you that i suppose    chapter vii  how paul set forth upon a quest  of old deleglises sunday suppers which costumed from head to foot in spotless linen he cooked himself in his great kitchen moving with flushed earnest face about the gleaming stove while behind him his guests waited ranged round the massive oaken table glittering with cut glass and silver among which fluttered the deft hands of madeline his ancient whitecapped bonne much has been already recorded and by those possessed of greater knowledge they who sat there talking in whispers until such time as old deleglise turned towards them again radiant with consciousness of success the savoury triumph steaming between his hands when like the sudden swell of the moonlight sonata the talk would rush once more into a roar were men whose names were thenand some are stillmore or less household words throughout the englishspeaking world artists musicians actors writers scholars droles their wit and wisdom their sayings and their doings must be tolerably familiar to readers of memoir and biography and if to such their epigrams appear less brilliant their jests less laughable than to us who heard them spoken that is merely because fashion in humour and in understanding changes as in all else  you gentle reader of my book i shall not trouble with secondhand record of that which you can read elsewhere for me it will be but to write briefly of my own brief glimpse into that charmed circle concerning this story more are the afternoon at homes held by dan and myself upon the second floor of the old georgian house in pleasant quiet queen square for cook and housemaid on these days it would be a busy morning failing other supervision dan and i agreed that to secure success on these important occasions each of us should criticise the work of the other i passed judgment on dans cooking he upon my housework  too much soda i would declare sampling the cake  you silly juggins its meant to taste of sodaits a soda cake  i know that it isnt meant to taste of nothing but soda there wants to be some cake about it also this thing so far as flavour is concerned is nothing but a seidlitz powder you cant give people solidified seidlitz powders for tea  dan would fume but i would remain firm the soda cake would be laid aside and something else attempted his cookery was the one thing dan was obstinate about he would never admit that anything could possibly be wrong with it his most ghastly failures he would devour himself later on with pretended enjoyment i have known him finish a sponge cake the centre of which had to be eaten with a teaspoon declaring it was delicious that eating a dry sponge cake was like eating dust that a sponge cake ought to be a trifle syrupy towards the centre afterwards he would be strangely silent and drink brandy out of a wineglass  call these knives clean it would be dans turn  yes i do  dan would draw his finger across one producing chiarooscuro  not if you go fingering them why dont you leave them alone and go on with your own work  youve just wiped them thats all  well there isnt any knifepowder  yes there is  besides it ruins knives overcleaning themtakes all the edge off we shall want them pretty sharp to cut those lemon buns of yours  overcleaning them you dont take any pride in the place  good lord dont i work from morning to night  you lazy young devil  makes one lazy your cooking how can a man work when he is suffering all day long from indigestion  but dan would not be content until i had found the board and cleaned the knives to his complete satisfaction perhaps it was as well that in this way all things once a week were set in order after lunch housemaid and cook would vanish two carefully dressed gentlemen being left alone to receive their guests  these would be gathered generally from among dans journalistic acquaintances and my companions of the theatre occasionally minikin and jarman would be of the number mrs peedles even once or twice arriving breathless on our landing left to myself i perhaps should not have invited them deeming them hardly fitting company to mingle with our other visitors but dan having once been introduced to them overrode such objection  my dear lord chamberlain dan would reply an ounce of originality is worth a ton of convention little tin ladies and gentlemen all made to pattern one can find them everywhere your friends would be an acquisition to any society  but are they quite good form i hinted  ill tell you what we will do replied dan well forget that mrs peedles keeps a lodginghouse in blackfriars we will speak of her as our friend that dear quaint old creature lady p a title that is an oddity whose costume always suggests the wardrobe of a provincial actress my dear paul your society novelist would make a fortune out of such a character the personages of her amusing anecdotes instead of being thirdrate theatrical folk shall be earl blank and the baroness de dash the editors of society journals shall pay me a shilling a line for them jarmanyes jarman shall be the son of a south american millionaire vulgar nonsense you mean racy minikinhe looks much more like forty than twentyhe shall be an eminent scientist his head will then appear the natural size his glass eye the result of a chemical experiment a touch of distinction his uncompromising rudeness a lovable characteristic we will make him buy a yard of red ribbon and wear it across his shirtfront and address him as herr professor it will explain slight errors of english grammar and all peculiarities of accent they shall be our lions you leave it to me we will invite commonplace middleclass folk to meet them  and this to my terror and alarm dan persisted in doing jarman entered into the spirit of the joke with gusto so far as he was concerned our guests from the beginning to the end were one and all i am confident deceived the more he swaggered the more he boasted the more he talked about himselfand it was a failing he was prone tothe greater was his success at the persistent endeavours of dans journalistic acquaintances to excite his cupidity by visions of new journals to be started with a mere couple of thousand pounds and by the inherent merit of their ideas to command at once a circulation of hundreds of thousands i could afford to laugh but watching the tremendous efforts of my actress friends to fascinate himluring him into corners gazing at him with languishing eyes trotting out all their little tricks for his exclusive benefit quarrelling about him among themselvesmy conscience would prick me lest our jest should end in a contretemps fortunately jarman himself was a gentleman of uncommon sense or my fears might have been realised i should have been sorry myself to have been asked to remain stone under the blandishments of girls young and old of women handsome and once no doubt good looking showered upon him during that winter but jarman as i think i have explained was no slave to female charms he enjoyed his good time while it lasted and eventually married the eldest daughter of a small blacking factory she was a plain girl but pleasant and later brought to jarman possession of the factory when i meet himhe is now stout and rubicundhe gives me the idea of a man who has attained to his ideals  with minikin we had more trouble people turned up possessed of scientific smattering we had to explain that the professor never talked shop others were owners of unexpected knowledge of german which they insisted upon airing we had to explain that the herr professor was in london to learn english and had taken a vow during his residence neither to speak nor listen to his native tongue it was remarked that his acquaintance with colloquial english slang for a foreigner was quite unusual occasionally he was too rude even for a scientist informing ladies clamouring to know how he liked english women that he didnt like them silly telling one gentleman a friend of dan a rather important man who once asked him referring to his yard of ribbon what he got it for that he got it for fourpence we had to explain him as a gentleman who had been soured by a love disappointment the ladies forgave him the gentlemen said it was a damned lucky thing for the girl altogether minikin took a good deal of explaining  lady peedles our guests decided among themselves must be the widow of some one in the city who had been knighted in a crowd they made fun of her behind her back but to her face were most effusive my dear lady peedles was the phrase most often heard in our rooms whenever she was present at the theatre my friend lady peedles became a person much spoken ofgenerally in loud tones my own social position i found decidedly improved by reason of her ladyships evident liking for myself it went abroad that i was her presumptive heir i was courted as a gentleman of expectations  the fishyeyed young man became one of our regular guests dan won his heart by never laughing at him  i like talking to you said the fishyeyed young man one afternoon to dan you dont go into fits of laughter when i remark that it has been a fine day most people do of course on the stage i dont mind i know i am a funny little devil i get my living by being a funny little devil there is a photograph of me hanging in the theatre lobby i saw a workman stop and look at it the other day as he passed i was just behind him he burst into a roar of laughter little he makes me laugh to look at him he cluttered to himself well thats all right i want the man in the gallery to think me funny but it annoys me when people laugh at me off the stage if i am out to dinner anywhere and ask somebody to pass the mustard i never get it instead they burst out laughing i dont want people to laugh at me when i am having my dinner i want my dinner it makes me very angry sometimes  i know agreed dan sympathetically the world never grasps the fact that man is a collection not a single exhibit i remember being at a house once where the chief guest happened to be a great hebrew scholar one tea time a miss henman passing the butter to some one in a hurry let it slip out of her hand why is miss henman like a caterpillar asked our learned guest in a sepulchral voice nobody appeared to know because she makes the butter fly it never occurred to any one of us that the doctor could possibly joke there was dead silence for about a minute then our hostess looking grave remarked oh do you really think so  if i were to enter a room full of people said the fishyeyed young man and tell them that my mother had been run over by an omnibus they would think it the funniest story they had heard in years  he was playing a principal part now in the opera and it was he undoubtedly who was drawing the house but he was not happy  i am not a comic actor really he explained i could play romeo so far as feeling is concerned and play it damned well there is a fine vein of poetry in me but of course its no good to me with this face of mine  but are you not sinning your mercies you fellows dan replied there is young kelver here at school it was always his trouble that he could give us a good time and make us laugh which nobody else in the whole school could do his ambition was to kick a ball as well as a hundred other fellows could kick it he could tell us a good story now if he would only write what the almighty intended him to write instead of gloomy rigmaroles about suffering princesses in welsh caves i dont say its bad but a hundred others could write the same sort of thing better  cant you understand answered the little man the poorest tragedian that ever lived never wished himself the best of low comedians the court fool had an excellent salary no doubt and likely enough had got twothirds of all the brain there was in the palace but not a woodenheaded manatarms but looked down upon him every gallery boy who pays a shilling to laugh at me regards himself as my intellectual superior while to a fourthrate spouter of blank verse he looks up in admiration  does it so very much matter suggested dan how the woodenheaded manatarms or the shilling gallery boy happens to regard you  yes it does retorted goggles because we happen to agree with them if i could earn five pounds a week as juvenile lead i would never play a comic part again  there i cannot follow you returned dan i can understand the artist who would rather be the man of action the poet who would rather be the statesman or the warrior though personally my sympathies are precisely the other waywith wolfe who thought it a more glorious work the writing of a great poem than the burning of so many cities and the killing of so many men we all serve the community it is difficult looking at the matter from the inside to say who serves it best some feed it some clothe it the churchman and the policeman between them look after its morals keep it in order the doctor mends it when it injures itself the lawyer helps it to quarrel the soldier teaches it to fight we bohemians amuse it instruct it we can argue that we are the most important the others cater for its body we for its mind but their work is more showy than ours and attracts more attention and to attract attention is the aim and object of most of us but for bohemians to worry among themselves which is the greatest is utterly without reason the storyteller the musician the artist the clown we are members of a sharing troupe one with the ambition of the fat boy in pickwick makes the peoples flesh creep another makes them hold their sides with laughter the tragedian soliloquising on his crimes shows us how wicked we are you looking at a pair of lovers from under a scratch wig show us how ridiculous we are both lessons are necessary who shall say which is the superior teacher  ah i am not a philosopher replied the little man with a sigh  ah returned dan with another and i am not a comic actor on my way to a salary of a hundred a week we all of us want the other boys cake  the okelly was another frequent visitor of ours the attic in belsize square had been closed in vain had the okelly wafted incense burned pastilles and sprinkled eaudecologne in vain had he talked of rats hinted at drains  a wonderful woman groaned the okelly in tones of sorrowful admiration theres no deceiving her  but why submit was our natural argument why not say you are going to smoke and do it  its her theory me boy explained the okelly that the home should be kept purea sort of a temple ye know shes convinced that in time it is bound to exercise an influence upon me its a beautiful idea when ye come to think of it  meanwhile in the rooms of halfadozen sinful men the okelly kept his own particular pipe together with his own particular smoking mixture and one such pipe and one such tobacco jar stood always on our mantelpiece  in the spring the forces of temptation raged round that feeble but most excellently intentioned citadel the okellys conscience the signora had returned to england was performing then at ashleys theatre the okelly would remain under long spells of silence puffing vigorously at his pipe or would fortify himself with paeans in praise of mrs okelly  if anything could ever make a model man of mehe spoke in the tones of one whose doubts are stronger than his hopesit would be the example of that woman  it was one saturday afternoon i had just returned from the matinee  i dont believe continued the okelly i dont really believe she has ever done one single thing she oughtnt to or left undone one single thing she ought in the whole course of her life  maybe she has and you dont know of it i suggested perceiving the idea might comfort him  i wish i could think so returned the okelly i dont mean anything really wrong he corrected himself quickly but something just a little wrong i feeli really feel i should like her better if she had  not that i mean i dont like her as it is ye understand corrected himself the okelly a second time i respect that womani cannot tell ye me boy how much i respect her ye dont know her there was one morning about a month ago that womanshes down at six every morning summer and winter we have prayers at halfpast i was a trifle late meself it was never me strong point as ye know early rising seven oclock struck she didnt appear and i thought she had overslept herself i wont say i didnt feel pleased for the moment it was an unworthy sentiment but i almost wished she had i ran up to her room the door was open the bedclothes folded down as she always leaves them she came in five minutes later she had got up at four that morning to welcome a troupe of native missionaries from east africa on their arrival at waterloo station shes a saint that woman i am not worthy of her  i shouldnt dwell too much on that phase of the subject i suggested  i cant help it me boy replied the okelly i feel i am not  i dont for a moment say you are i returned but i shouldnt harp upon the idea i dont think it good for you  i never will be he persisted gloomily never  evidently he was started on a dangerous train of reflection with the idea of luring him away from it i led the conversation to the subject of champagne  most people like it dry admitted the okelly meself i have always preferred it with just a suggestion of fruitiness  there was a champagne i said you used to be rather fond of when weyears ago  i think i know the one ye mean said the okelly it wasnt at all bad considering the price  you dont happen to remember where you got it i asked  it was in bridge street remembered the okelly not so very far from the circus  it is a pleasant evening i remarked let us take a walk  we found the place half wineshop half office  just the same commented the okelly as we pushed open the door and entered not altered a bit  as in all probability barely twelve months had elapsed since his last visit the fact in itself was not surprising clearly the okelly had been calculating time rather by sensation i ordered a bottle and we sat down myself being prejudiced against the brand i called for a glass of claret the okelly finished the bottle i was glad to notice my ruse had been successful the virtue of that wine had not departed from it with every glass the okelly became morally more elevated he left the place determined that he would be worthy of mrs okelly walking down the embankment he asserted his determination of buying an alarmclock that very evening at the corner of westminster bridge he became suddenly absorbed in his own thoughts looking to discover the cause of his silence i saw that his eyes were resting on a poster representing a charming lady standing on one leg upon a wire below herat some distanceappeared the peaks of mountains the artist had even caught the likeness i cursed the luck that had directed our footsteps but the next moment lacking experience was inclined to be reassured  me dear paul said the okellyhe laid a fatherly hand upon my shoulderthere are fairfaced laughing womensweet creatures that ye want to put yer arm around and dance with he shook his head disapprovingly there are the sainted women who lead us up paulup always up  a look such as the young man with the banner might have borne with him to the fields of snow and ice suffused the okellys handsome face without another word he crossed the road and entered an american store where for sixandelevenpence he purchased an alarmclock the man assured us would awake an egyptian mummy with this in his hand he waved me a goodbye and jumped upon a hampstead bus and alone i strolled on to the theatre  hal returned a little after christmas and started himself in chambers in the city it was the nearest he dared venture so he said to civilisation  id be no good in the west end he explained for a season i might attract as an eccentricity but your swells would never stand me for longerno more would any respectable folk anywhere we dont get on together i commenced at richmond it was a fashionable suburb then and i thought i was going to do wonders i had everything in my favour except myself i do know my work nobody can deny that of me my father spent every penny he had poor gentleman in buying me an oldestablished practice fine house carriage and pair whitehaired butlereverything correct except myself it was of no use i can hold myself in for a month or two then i break out the old original savage that i am under my frock coat i feel i must run amuck stabbing hacking at the prim smiling lies mincing round about me i can fool a silly woman for halfadozen visits bow and rub my hands purr round her sympathetically all the while i am longing to tell her the truth  go home wash your face dont block up the pores of your skin with paint let out your corsets you are thirtythree round the abdomen if you are an inch how can you expect your digestion to do its work when youre squeezing it into twentyone give up gadding about half your day and most of your night you are old enough to have done with that sort of thing let the children come and suckle them yourself youll be all the better for them dont loll in bed all the morning get up like a decent animal and do something for your living use your brain what there is of it and your body at that price you can have health tomorrow and at no other i can do nothing for you  and sooner or later i blurt it out he laughed his great roar lord you should see the real face coming out of the simpering mask  pompous old fools strutting into me like turkeycocks by jove it was worth it they would dribble out looking half their proper size after i had done telling them what was the matter with them  do you want to know what you are really suffering from i would shout at them when i could contain myself no longer gluttony my dear sir gluttony and drunkenness and overindulgence in other vices that shall be nameless live like a man get a little selfrespect from somewhere give up being an ape treat your body properly and it will treat you properly thats the only prescription that will do you any good  he laughed again tell the truth you shame the devil but the devil replies by starving you its a fairly effective retort i am not the stuff successful family physicians are made of in the city i may manage to rub along one doesnt see so much of ones patients they come and go clerks and warehousemen my practice will be among chiefly the poor man does not so much mind being told the truth about himself it is a blessing to which he is accustomed  we spoke but once of barbara a photograph of her in her brides dress stood upon my desk occasionally first fitting the room for the ceremony sweeping away all impurity even from under the mats and dressing myself with care i would centre it amid flowers and kneeling kiss her hand where it rested on the back of the topheavy looking chair without which no photographic studio is complete  one day he took it up and looked at it long and hard  the forehead denotes intellectuality the eyes tenderness and courage the lower part of the face on the other hand suggests a good deal of animalism the finely cut nostrils show egotismanother word for selfishness the nose itself vanity the lips sensuousness and love of luxury i wonder what sort of woman she really is he laid the photograph back upon the desk  i did not know you were so firm a believer in lavater i said  only when he agrees with what i know he answered have i not described her rightly  i do not care to discuss her in that vein i replied feeling the blood mounting to my cheeks  too sacred a subject he laughed it is the one ingredient of manhood i lack idealityan unfortunate deficiency for me i must probe analyse dissect see the thing as it really is know it for what it is  well she is the countess huescar now i said for gods sake leave her alone  he turned to me with the snarl of a beast how do you know she is the countess huescar is it a special breed of woman made on purpose how do you know she isnt my wifebrain and heart flesh and blood mine if she was do you think i should give her up because some fool has stuck his label on her  i felt the anger burning in my eyes yours his she is no mans property she is herself i cried  the wrinkles round his nose and mouth smoothed themselves out you need not be afraid he sneered as you say she is the countess huescar can you imagine her as mrs doctor washburn i cant he took her photograph in his hand again the lower part of the face is the true index to the character it shows the animal and it is the animal that rules the soul the intellect it comes and goes the animal remains always sensuousness love of luxury vanity those are the strings to which she dances to be a countess is of more importance to her than to be a woman she is his not mine let him keep her  you do not know her i answered you never have you listen to what she says she does not know herself  he looked at me queerly what do you think her to be he asked me a true woman not the shallow thing she seems  a true woman i persisted stoutly that you have not eyes enough to see  you little fool he muttered with the same queer lookyou little fool but let us hope you are wrong paul let us hope for her sake you are wrong  it was at one of deleglises sunday suppers that i first met urban vane the position nor even the character i fear it must be confessed of his guests was never enquired into by old deleglise a simpleminded kindly old fellow himself it was his fate to be occasionally surprised and grieved at the discovery that even the most entertaining of supper companions could fall short of the highest standard of conventional morality  dear dear me he would complain pacing up and down his studio with puzzled visage the last man in the world of whom i should have expected to hear it so original in all his ideas are you quite sure  i am afraid there can be no doubt about it  i cant believe it i really cant believe it one of the most amusing men i ever met  i remember a wellknown artist one evening telling us with much sense of humour how he had just completed the sale of an old spanish cabinet to two distinct and separate purchasers  i sold it first recounted the little gentleman with glee to old jong the dealer he has been worrying me about it for the last three months and on saturday afternoon hearing that i was clearing out and going abroad he came round again well i am not sure i am in a position to sell it i told him wholl know he asked they are not in are they not yet i answered but i expect they will be some time on monday tell your man to open the door to me at eight oclock on monday morning he replied well have it away without any fuss there neednt be any receipt im lending you a hundred pounds in cash i worked him up to a hundred and twenty and he paid me upon my word i should never have thought of it if he hadnt put the idea into my head but turning round at the door you wont go and sell it to some one else he suggested between now and monday it serves him right for his damned impertinence send and take it away today if you are at all nervous i told him he looked at the thing it is about twelve feet high altogether i would if i could get a cart he muttered then an idea struck him does the top come off see for yourself i answered its your cabinet not mine i was feeling rather annoyed with him he examined it thats all right he said merely a couple of screws ill take the top with me now on my cab he got a man in and they took the upper cupboard away leaving me the bottom two hours later old sir george called to see me about his wifes portrait the first thing he set eyes on was the remains of the cabinet he had always admired it hallo he asked are you breaking up the studio literally what have you done with the other half ive sent it round to jongs he didnt give me time to finish save jongs commission and sell it to me direct he said we wont argue about the price and ill pay you in cash  well if providence comes forward and insists on taking charge of a man it is hardly good manners to flout her besides his wifes portrait is worth twice as much as he is paying for it he handed me over the money in notes things not going quite smoothly with you just at the moment he asked me oh about the same as usual i told him you wont be offended at my taking it away with me this evening he asked not in the least i answered youll get it on the top of a fourwheeled cab we called in a couple of men and i helped them down with it and confoundedly heavy it was i shall send round to jongs for the other half on monday morning he said speaking with his head through the cab window and explain it to him do i answered hell understand  im sorry im going away so early in the morning concluded the little gentleman id give back jong ten per cent of his money to see his face when he enters the studio  everybody laughed but after the little gentleman was gone the subject cropped up again  if i wake sufficiently early remarked one i shall find an excuse to look in myself at eight oclock jongs face will certainly be worth seeing  rather rough both on him and sir george observed another  oh he hasnt really done anything of the kind chimed in old deleglise in his rich sweet voice he made that all up its just his fun hes full of humour  i am inclined to think that would be his idea of a joke asserted the first speaker  old deleglise would not hear of it but a week or two later i noticed an addition to old deleglises studio furniture in the shape of a handsome old carved cabinet twelve feet high  he really had done it explained old deleglise speaking in a whisper though only he and i were present of course it was only his fun but it might have been misunderstood i thought it better to put the thing straight i shall get the money back from him when he returns a most amusing little man  old deleglise possessed a house in gower street which fell vacant one of his guests a writer of poetical drama was a man who three months after he had earned a thousand pounds never had a penny with which to bless himself they are dying out these careless goodnatured conscienceless bohemians but quarter of a century ago they still lingered in alsatian london turned out of his lodgings by a philistine landlord his sole possession in the wide world two acts of a drama for which he had already been paid the problem of his future though it troubled him but little became acute to his friends old deleglise treating the matter as a joke pretending not to know who was the landlord suggested he should apply to the agents for position as caretaker some furniture was found for him and the empty house in gower street became his shelter the immediate present thus provided for kindly old deleglise worried himself a good deal concerning what would become of his friend when the house was let there appeared to be no need for worry weeks months went by applications were received by the agents in fair number view cards signed by the dozen but prospective tenants were never seen again one sunday evening our poet warmed by old deleglises burgundy forgetful whose recommendation had secured him the lowly but timely appointment himself revealed the secret  most convenient place ive got so he told old deleglise whole house to myself i wander about it just suits me  im glad to hear that murmured old deleglise  come and see me and ill cook you a chop continued the other ive had the kitchen range brought up into the back drawingroom saves going up and down stairs  the devil you have growled old deleglise what do you think the owner of the house will say  havent the least idea who the poor old duffer is myself theyve put me in as caretakeran excellent arrangement avoids all argument about rent  afraid it will soon come to an end that excellent arrangement remarked old deleglise drily  why why should it  a house in gower street oughtnt to remain vacant long  this one will  you might tell me asked old deleglise with a grim smile how do you manage it what happens when people come to look over the housedont you let them in  i tried that at first explained the poet but they would go on knocking and boys and policemen passing would stop and help them it got to be a nuisance so now i have them in and get the thing over i show them the room where the murder was committed if its a nervouslooking party i let them off with a brief summary if that doesnt do i go into details and show them the bloodspots on the floor its an interesting story of the gruesome order come round one morning and ill tell it to you im rather proud of it with the blinds down and a clock in the next room that ticks loudly it goes well  yet this was a man who were the merest acquaintance to call upon him and ask for his assistance would at once take him by the arm and lead him upstairs all notes and cheques that came into his hands he changed at once into gold into some attic half filled with lumber he would fling it by the handful then locking the door leave it there on their hands and knees he and his friends when they wanted any would grovel for it poking into corners hunting under boxes groping among broken furniture feeling between cracks and crevices nothing gave him greater delight than an expedition of this nature to what he termed his goldfield it had for him as he would explain all the excitements of mining without the inconvenience and the distance he never knew how much was there for a certain period a pocketful could be picked up in five minutes then he would entertain a dozen men at one of the best restaurants in london tip cabmen and waiters with halfsovereigns shower halfcrowns as he walked through the streets lend or give to anybody for the asking later halfanhours dusty search would be rewarded with a single coin it made no difference to him he would dine in soho for eighteenpence smoke shag and run into debt  the redhaired man to whom deleglise had introduced me on the day of my first meeting with the lady of the train was another of his most constant visitors it flattered my vanity that the redhaired man whose name was famous throughout europe and america should condescend to confide to meas he did and at some lengththe deepest secrets of his bosom awedat all events at firsti would sit and listen while by the hour he would talk to me in corners telling me of the women he had loved they formed a somewhat large collection julias marias janets even janeshe had madly worshipped deliriously adored so many it grew bewildering with a faraway look in his eyes pain trembling through each note of his musical soft voice he would with bitter jest with passionate outburst recount how he had sobbed beneath the stars for love of isabel bitten his own flesh in frenzied yearning for lenore he appeared from his own accountif in connection with a theme so poetical i may be allowed a commonplace expressionto have had no luck with any of them of the remainder an appreciable percentage had been mere passing visions seen at a distance in the dawn at twilightgenerally speaking when the light must have been uncertain never again though he had wandered in the neighbourhood for months had he succeeded in meeting them it would occur to me that enquiries among the neighbours applications to the local police might possibly have been efficacious but to have broken in upon his exalted mood with such suggestions would have demanded more nerve than at the time i possessed in consequence my thoughts i kept to myself  my god boy he would conclude may you never love as i loved that woman miriamor henrietta or irene as the case might be  for my sympathetic attitude towards the redhaired man i received one evening commendation from old deleglise  good boy said old deleglise laying his hand on my shoulder we were standing in the passage we had just shaken hands with the redhaired man who as usual had been the last to leave none of the others will listen to him he used to stop and confide it all to me after everybody else had gone sometimes i have dropped asleep to wake an hour later and find him still talking he gets it over early now good boy  soon i learnt it was characteristic of the artist to be willingnay anxious to confide his private affairs to any one and every one who would only listen another characteristic appeared to be determination not to listen to anybody elses as attentive recipient of other peoples troubles and emotions i was subjected to practically no competition whatever one gentleman a leading actor of that day i remember immediately took me aside on my being introduced to him and consulted me as to his best course of procedure under the extremely painful conditions that had lately arisen between himself and his wife we discussed the unfortunate position at some length and i did my best to counsel fairly and impartially  i wish you would lunch with me at whites tomorrow he said we can talk it over quietly say halfpast one by the bye i didnt catch your name  i spelt it to him he wrote the appointment down on his shirtcuff i went to whites the next day and waited an hour but he did not turn up i met him three weeks later at a gardenparty with his wife but he appeared to have forgotten me  observing old deleglises guests comparing them with their names it surprised me the disconnection between the worker and the work writers of noble sentiment of elevated ideality i found contained in men of commonplace appearance of gross appetites of conventional ideas it seemed doubtful whether they fully comprehended their own work certainly it had no effect upon their own lives on the other hand an innocent boyish young man who lived the most correct of lives with a girlishlooking wife in an ivycovered cottage near barnes common i discovered to be the writer of decadent stories at which the empress theodora might have blushed the men whose names were widest known were not the men who shone the brightest in deleglises kitchen more often they appeared the dull dogs listening enviously or failing pathetically when they tried to compete with others who to the public were comparatively unknown after a time i ceased to confound the artist with the man thought no more of judging the one by the other than of evolving a tenant from the house to which circumstances or carelessness might have directed him clearly they were two creations originally independent of each other settling down into a working partnership for purposes merely of mutual accommodation the spirit evidently indifferent as to the particular body into which he crept anxious only for a place to work in easily contented  varied were these guests that gathered round old deleglises oak cabinet ministers reported to be in homburg russian nihilists escaped from siberia italian revolutionaries high church dignitaries disguised in grey suitings exerrand boys who had discovered that with six strokes of the pen they could set half london laughing at whom they would raw laddies with the burr yet clinging to their tongues but who we knew would one day have the people dancing to the music of their words neither wealth nor birth nor age nor position counted was a man interesting amusing had he ideas and thoughts of his own then he was welcome men who had come men who were coming met there on equal footing among them as years ago among my schoolmates i found my placesomewhat to my dissatisfaction i amused much rather would i have shocked them by the originality of my views impressed them with the depth of my judgments they declined to be startled refused to be impressed instead they laughed nor from these men could i obtain sympathy in my disappointment  what do you mean you villain roared deleglises caretaker at me one evening on entering the kitchen how dare you waste your time writing this sort of stuff  he had a copy of the paper containing my witch of moel sarbod in his handthen some months old he screwed it up into a ball and flung it in my face ive only just read it what did you get for it  nothing i answered  nothing he screamed you got off for nothing you ought to have been whipped at the carts tail  oh come its not as bad as that suggested old deleglise  not bad there isnt a laugh in it from beginning to end  there wasnt intended to be i interrupted  why not you swindler what were you sent into the world to do to make it laugh  i want to make it think i told him  make it think hasnt it got enough to think about arent there ten thousand pennyaliners poets tragedians tubthumpers longeared philosophers boring it to death who are you to turn up your nose at your work and tell the almighty his own business you are here to make us laugh get on with your work you confounded young idiot  urban vane was the only one among them who understood me who agreed with me that i was fitted for higher things than merely to minister to the worlds need of laughter he alone it was who would listen with approval to my dreams of becoming a famous tragedian a writer of soulsearching books of passionanalysing plays i never saw him laugh himself certainly not at anything funny humour he would explain in his languid drawl personally it doesnt amuse me one felt its introduction into the scheme of life had been an error he was a large fleshy man with a dreamy caressing voice and strangely impassive face where he came from who he was nobody knew without ever passing a remark himself that was worth listening to he nevertheless by some mysterious trick of manner i am unable to explain soon established himself even throughout that company where as a rule men found their proper level as a silent authority in all contests of wit or argument stories at which he listened bored fell flat the bon mot at which some faint suggestion of a smile quivered round his cleanshaven lips was felt to be the crown of the discussion i can only conclude his secret to have been his magnificent assumption of superiority added to a sphinxlike impenetrability behind which he could always retire from any danger of exposure subjects about which he knew nothingand i have come to the conclusion they were more numerous than was suspectedbecame in his presence topics outside the radius of cultivated consideration one felt ashamed of having introduced them his own subjectsthey were few but exclusivehe had the knack of elevating into intellectual tests one felt ashamed reflecting how little one knew about them whether he really did possess a charm of manner or whether the sense of his superiority with which he had imbued me it was that made any condescension he paid me a thing to grasp at i am unable to say certain it is that when he suggested i should throw up chorus singing and accompany him into the provinces as manager of a theatrical company he was then engaging to run a wonderful drama that was going to revolutionise the english stage and educate the english public i allowed myself not a moment for consideration but accepted his proposal with grateful delight  who is he asked dan somehow he had never impressed dan but then dan was a fellow to impress whom was slow work as he himself confessed he had no instinct for character i judge he would explain purely by observation  what does that matter was my reply  what does he know about the business  thats why he wants me  what do you know about it  theres not much to know i can find out  take care you dont find out that theres more to know than you think what is this wonderful play of his  i havent seen it yet i dont think its finished its something from the spanish or the russian im not sure im to put it into shape when hes done the translation he wants me to put my name to it as the adaptor  wonder he hasnt asked you to wear his clothes has he got any money  of course he has money how can you run a theatrical company without money  have you seen the money  he doesnt carry it about with him in a bag  i should have thought your ambition to be to act not to manage managers are to be had cheap enough why should he want some one who knows nothing about it  im going to act im going to play a leading part  great scott  hell do the management really himself i shall simply advise him but he doesnt want his own name to appear  why not  his people might object  who are his people  how do i know what a suspicious chap you are  dan shrugged his shoulders you are not an actor you never will be you are not a business man youve made a start at writing thats your proper work why not go on with it  i cant get on with it that one thing was accepted and never paid for everything else comes back regularly just as before besides i can go on writing wherever i am  youve got friends here to help you  they dont believe i can do anything but write nonsense  well clever nonsense is worth writing its better than stodgy sense literature is blocked up with that why not follow their advice  because i dont believe they are right im not a clown i dont mean to be because a man has a sense of humour it doesnt follow he has nothing else that is only one of my gifts and by no means the highest i have knowledge of human nature poetry dramatic instinct i mean to prove it to you all vanes the only man that understands me  dan lit his pipe have you made up your mind to go  of course i have its an opportunity that doesnt occur twice theres a tide in the affairs  thanks interrupted dan ive heard it before well if youve made up your mind theres an end of the matter good luck to you you are young and its easier to learn things then than later  you talk i answered as if you were old enough to be my grandfather  he smiled and laid both hands upon my shoulders so i am he said quite old enough little boy paul dont be angry youll always be little paul to me he put his hands in his pockets and strolled to the window  whatll you do i enquired will you keep on these rooms  no he replied i shall accept an offer that has been made to me to take the subeditorship of a big yorkshire paper it is an important position and will give me experience  youll never be happy mewed up in a provincial town i told him i shall want a london address and i can easily afford it lets keep them on together  he shook his head it wouldnt be the same thing he said  so there came a morning when we said goodbye before dan returned from the office i should be gone they had been pleasant months that we had spent together in these pretty rooms though my life was calling to me full of hope i felt the pain of leaving them two years is a long period in a young mans life when the sap is running swiftly my affections had already taken root there the green leaves in summer in winter the bare branches of the square the sparrows that chirped about the windowsills the quiet peace of the great house dan kindly old deleglise around them my fibres clung closer than i had known the lady of the train she managed it now less clumsily her hands and feet had grown smaller her elbows rounder i found myself smiling as i thought of herone always did smile when one thought of norah everybody didof her tomboy ways her ringing laughthere were those who termed it noisy her irrepressible franknessthere were times when it was inconvenient would she ever become ladylike sedate proper one doubted it i tried to picture her a wife the mistress of a house i found the smile deepening round my mouth what a jolly wife she would make i could see her bustling full of importance flying into tempers lasting possibly for thirty seconds then calling herself names saving all argument by undertaking her own scolding and doing it well i followed her to motherhood what a joke it would be what would she do with them she would just let them do what they liked with her she and they would be a parcel of children together she the most excited of them all no on second thoughts i could detect in her a strong vein of common sense they would have to mind their ps and qs i could see her romping with them helping them to tear their clothes but likewise i could see her flying after them bringing back an armful struggling bathing it physicking it perhaps she would grow stout grow grey but she would still laugh more often than sigh speak her mind be quick goodtempered norah to the end her character precluded all hope of surprise that as i told myself was its defect about her were none of those glorious possibilities that make of some girls charming mysteries a woman said i to myself should be a wondrous jewel hiding unknown lights and shadows you my dear norahi spoke my thoughts aloud as had become a habit with me those who live much alone fall into this wayyou are merely a crystal not shallowno i should not call you shallow by any mans but transparent  what would he be her lover some plain matteroffact businesslike young fellow a good player of cricket and football fond of his dinner what a very uninteresting affair the lovemaking would be if she liked himwell she would probably tell him so if she didnt he would know it in five minutes  as for inducing her to change her mind wooing her cajoling heri heard myself laughing at the idea  there came a quick rap at the door come in i cried and she entered  i came to say goodbye to you she explained im just going out what were you laughing at  oh at an idea that occurred to me  a funny one  yes  tell it me  well it was something in connection with yourself it might offend you  it wouldnt trouble you much if it did would it  no i dont suppose it would  then why not tell me  i was thinking of your lover  it did offend her i thought it would but she looked really interesting when she was cross her grey eyes would flash and her whole body quiver there was a charming spice of danger always about making her cross  i suppose you think i shall never have one  on the contrary i think you will have a good many i had not thought so before then i formed the idea for the first time in that moment while looking straight into her angry face it was still a childish face  the anger died out of it as it always did within the minute and she laughed it would be fun wouldnt it i wonder what i should do with him it makes you feel very serious being in love doesnt it  very  have you ever been in love  i hesitated for a moment then the delight of talking about it overcame my fear of being chaffed besides when she felt it nobody could be more delightfully sympathetic i determined to adventure it  yes i answered ever since i was a boy if you are going to be foolish i added for i saw the laugh before it came i shant talk to you about it  im noti wont really she pleaded making her face serious again what is she like  i took from my breast pocket barbaras photograph and handed it to her in silence  is she really as beautiful as that she asked gazing at it evidently fascinated  more so i assured her her expression is the most beautiful part of her those are only her features  she sighed i wish i was beautiful  you are at an awkward age i told her it is impossible to say what you are going to be like  mamma was a lovely woman everybody says so and tom i call awfully handsome perhaps ill be better when im filled out a bit more a small venetian mirror hung between the two windows she glanced up into it its my nose that irritates me she said she rubbed it viciously as if she would rub it out  some people admire snub noses i explained to her  no really  tennyson speaks of them as tiptilted like the petals of a rose  how nice of him do you think he meant my sort she rubbed it again but in a kinder fashion then looked again at barbaras photograph who is she  she was miss hasluck i answered she is the countess huescar now she was married last summer  oh yes i remember you told us about her you were children together but whats the good of your being in love with her if shes married  it makes my whole life beautiful  wanting somebody you cant have  i dont want her  you said you were in love with her  so i am  she handed me back the photograph and i replaced it in my pocket  i dont understand that sort of love she said if i loved anybody i should want to have them with me always  she is with me always i answered in my thoughts she looked at me with her clear grey eyes i found myself blinking something seemed to be slipping from me something i did not want to lose i remember a similar sensation once at the moment of waking from a strange delicious dream to find the sunlight pouring in upon me through an open window  that isnt being in love she said thats being in love with the idea of being in love thats the way i used to go to ballsshe laughedin front of the glass you caught me once do you remember  and was it not sweeter i argued the imagination you were the belle of the evening you danced divinely every dance were taken in to supper by the lion in reality you trod upon your partners toes bumped and were bumped were left a wallflower more than half the time had a headache the next day were not the dream balls the more delightful  no they werent she answered without the slightest hesitation one real dance when at last it came was worth the whole of them oh i know ive heard you talking all of youof the faces that you see in dreams and that are ever so much more beautiful than the faces that you see when youre awake of the wonderful songs that nobody ever sings the wonderful pictures that nobody ever paints and all the rest of it i dont believe a word of it its tommyrot  i wish you wouldnt use slang  well you know what i mean what is the proper word give it me  i suppose you mean cant i suggested  no i dont cant is something that you dont believe in yourself its tommyrot there isnt any other word when im in love it will be with something that is real  i was feeling angry with her i know just what he will be like he will be a goodnatured commonplace  whatever he is she interrupted hell be alive and hell want me and i shall want him dreams are silly i prefer being up she clapped her hands thats it then silent she looked at me with an expression of new interest ive been wondering and wondering what it was you are not really awake yet youve never got up  i laughed at her whimsical way of putting it but at the back of my brain was a troubled idea that perhaps she was revealing to me the truth and if so what would waking up as she termed it be like a flash of memory recalled to me that summer evening upon barking bridge when as it had seemed to me the little childish paul had slipped away from me leaving me lonely and bewildered to find another self was my boyhood in like manner now falling from me i found myself clinging to it with vague terror its thoughts its feelingsdreams they had grown sweet to me must i lose them this cold unknown new self waiting to receive me i shrank away from it with fear  do you know i think you will be rather nice when you wake up  her words recalled me to myself perhaps i never shall wake up i said i dont want to wake up  oh but one cant go on dreaming all ones life she laughed youll wake up and fall in love with somebody real she came across to me and taking the lapels of my coat in both her hands gave me a vigorous shake i hope shell be somebody nice i am rather afraid  you seem to think me a fool i was still angry with her without quite knowing why  she shook me again you know i dont but it isnt the nice people that take best care of themselves tom cant i have to take care of him  i laughed  i do really you should hear me scold him i like taking care of people goodbye  she held out her hand it was white now and shapely but one could not have called it small strong it felt and firm as it gripped mine    chapter viii  and how came back again  i left london the drums beating in my heart the flags waving in my brain somewhat more than a year later one foggy wet december evening i sneaked back to it defeatedah that is a small thing capable of redressdisgraced i returned to it as to a hidingplace where lost in the crowd i might waste my days unnoticed until such time as i could summon up sufficient resolution to put an end to my dead life i had been ambitiousdwelling again amid the bitterness of the months that followed my return i write in the past tense i had been eager to make a name a position for myself but were i to claim no higher aim i should be doing injustice to my bloodto the greatsouled gentleman whose whole life had been an ode to honour to her of simple faith who had known no other prayer to teach me than the childish cry god help me to be good i had wished to be a great man but it was to have been a great good man the world was to have admired me but to have respected me also i was to have been the knight without fear but rarer yet without reproachgalahad not launcelot i had learnt myself to be a feeble backboneless fighter conquered by the first serious assault of evil a creature of mean fears slave to every crack of the devils whip a feeder with swine  urban vane i had discovered to be a common swindler his play he had stolen from the desk of a wellknown dramatist whose acquaintance he had made in deleglises kitchen the man had fallen ill and vane had been constant in his visits partly recovering the man had gone abroad to italy had he died there as at the time was expected the robbery might never have come to light news reached us in a small northern town that he had taken a fresh lease of life and was on his way back to england then it was that vane with calm indifference smoking his cigar over a bottle of wine to which he had invited me told me the bald truth adorning it with some touches of wit had the recital come upon me sooner i might have acted differently but six months companionship with urban vane if it had not by grace of the lord destroyed the roots of whatever flower of manhood might have been implanted in me had most certainly withered its leaves  the man was clever that he was not clever enough to perceive from the beginning what he has learnt since that honesty is the best policyat least for men with brainsremains somewhat of a mystery to me where once he made his hundreds among shady ways he now i suppose makes his thousands in the broad daylight of legitimate enterprise chicanery in the blood one might imagine has to be worked out urban vanes are to be found in all callings they commence as scamps years later to ones astonishment one finds them ornaments to their profession wild oats are of various quality according to the soil from which they are preserved we sow them in our various ways  at first i stormed vane sat with an amused smile upon his lips and listened  your language my dear kelver he replied my vocabulary exhausted might wound me were i able to accept you as an authority upon this vexed question of morals with the rest of the world you preach one thing and practise another i have noticed it so often it is perhaps sad but the preaching has ceased to interest me you profess to be very indignant with me for making use of another mans ideas it is done every day you yourself were quite ready to take credit not due to you for months we have been travelling with this play drama in five acts by mr horace moncrieff not more than two hundred lines of it are your ownexcellent lines i admit but they do not constitute the play  this aspect of the affair had not occurred to me but you asked me to put my name to it i stammered you said you did not want your own to appearfor private reasons you made a point of it  he waved away the smoke from his cigar the man you are posing as would never have put his name to work not his own you never hesitated on the contrary you jumped at the chance of so easy an opening to your career as playwright my need as you imagined it was your opportunity  but you said it was from the french i argued you had merely translated it i adapted it i dont defend the custom but it is the custom the man who adapts a play calls himself the author they all do it  i know he answered it has always amused me our sick friend himself whom i am sure we are both delighted to welcome back to life has done it more than once and made a very fair profit on the transaction indeed from internal evidence i am strongly of opinion that this present play is a case in point well chickens come home to roost i adapt from him what is the difference  simply this he continued pouring himself out another glass of wine that whereas owing to the anomalous state of the copyright laws stealing from the foreign author is legal and commendable against stealing from the living english author there is a certain prejudice  and the consequences i am afraid you will find somewhat unpleasant i suggested  he laughed it was not a frivolity to which he was prone you mean my dear kelver that you will  dont look so dumbfounded he went on you cannot be so stupid as you are pretending to be the original manuscript at the lord chamberlains office is in your handwriting you knew our friend as well as i did and visited him why the whole tour has been under your management you have arranged everythingmost excellently i have been quite surprised  my anger came later for the moment the sudden light blinded me to everything but fear  but you told me i cried it was only a matter of form that you wanted to keep your name out of it because  he was looking at me with an expression of genuine astonishment my words began to appear humorous even to myself i found it difficult to believe i had been the fool i was now seeing myself to have been  i am sorry he said i am really sorry i took you for a man of the world i thought you merely did not wish to know anything  still to my shame fear was the thing uppermost in my heart you are not going to put it all on to me i pleaded  he had risen he laid his hand upon my shoulder instead of flinging it off i was glad of its kindly pressure he was the only man to whom i could look for help  dont take it so seriously he said he will merely think the manuscript has been lost as likely as not he will be unable to remember whether he wrote it or merely thought of writing it no one in the company will say anything it isnt their business we must set to work i had altered it a good deal before you saw it and changed all the names of the characters we will retain the third act it is the only thing of real value in the play the situation is not original you have as much right to dish it up as he had in a fortnight we will have the whole thing so different that if he saw it himself he would only imagine we had got hold of the idea and had forestalled him  there were moments during the next few weeks when i listened to the voice of my good angel when i saw clearly that even from the lowest point of view he was giving me sound advice i would go to the man tell him frankly the whole truth  but vane never left my elbow suspecting i suppose he gave me clearly to understand that if i did so i must expect no mercy from him my story denounced by him as an outrageous lie would be regarded as the funkinspired subterfuge of a young rogue at the best i should handicap myself with suspicion that would last me throughout my career on the other hand what harm had we done presented in some twenty or so small towns where it would soon be forgotten a play something like most plays were something like our friend would produce his version and reap a rich harvest ours would disappear if by any unlikely chance discussion should arise the advertisement would be to his advantage so soon as possible we would replace it by a new piece altogether a young man of my genius could surely write something better than hotchpotch such as this experience was all that i had lacked as regarded ones own conscience was not the worlds honesty a mere question of convention had he been a young man and had we diddled him out of his play for a tenpound note we should have been applauded as sharp men of business the one commandment of the world was dont get found out the whole trouble left alone would sink and fade later we should tell it as a good jokeand be laughed with  so i fell from mine own esteem vane helping meand he had brainsi set feverishly to work i am glad to remember that every line i wrote was born in misery i tried to persuade vane to let me make a new play altogether which i offered to give him for nothing he expressed himself as grateful but his frequently declared belief in my dramatic talent failed to induce his acceptance  later on my dear kelver was his reply for the present this is doing very well going on as we are we shall soon improve it out of all recognition while at the same time losing nothing that is essential all your ideas are excellent  by the end of about three weeks we had got together a concoction that so far as dialogue and characters were concerned might be said to be our own there was good work in it here and there under other conditions i might have been proud of much that i had written as it was i experienced only the terror of the thief dodging the constable my cleverness might save me it afforded me no further satisfaction my humour when i heard the people laughing at it i remembered i had forged listening in vague fear to every creak upon the stairs wondering in what form discovery might come upon me there was one speech addressed by the hero to the villain yes i admit it i do love her but there is that which i love bettermy selfrespect stepping down to the footlights and slapping his chest which according to stage convention would appear to be a sort of moral jewelbox bursting with assorted virtues our juvenile leada gentleman who led a somewhat rabbitlike existence perpetually diving down openings to avoid service of writs at the instance of his wife for alimonywould invariably bring down the house upon this sentiment every night listening to the applause i would shudder recalling how i had written it with burning cheeks  there was a character in the piece a vicious old man that from the beginning vane had wanted me to play i had disliked the part and had refused choosing instead to act a highsouled countryman in the portrayal of whose irreproachable emotions i had taken pleasure vane now renewed his arguments and my power of resistance seeming to have departed from me i accepted the exchange certainly the old gentlemans scenes went with more snap but at a cost of further degradation to myself upon an older actor the effect might have been harmless but the growing tree springs back less surely i found myself taking pleasure in the coarse laughter that rewarded my suggestive leers calling up all the evil in my nature to help me in the development of fresh business vane was enthusiastic in his praises generous with his assistance under his tuition i succeeded in making the part as unpleasant as we dared i had genius so vane told me i understood so much of human nature one proof of the moral deterioration creeping over me was that i was beginning to like vane  looking back at the man as i see him plainly now a very ordinary scamp his pretension not even amusing i find it difficult to present him as he appeared to my boyish eyes he was well educated and well read he gave himself the airs of a superior being by freak of fate compelled to abide in a world of inferior creatures to live among them in comfort it was necessary for him to outwardly conform to their conventions but to respect their reasoning would have been beneath him to accept their laws as binding on ones own conscience was using the common expression to give oneself away to confess oneself commonplace every decent instinct a man might own to was proof in vanes eyes of his being suburban bourgeoiseverything that was unintellectual it was the first time i had heard this sort of talk vane was one of the pioneers of the movement which has since become somewhat tiresome to laugh at it is easy to a man of the world boys are impressed by it from him i first heard the now familiar advocacy of pure hedonism pan enticed from his dark groves was to sit upon olympus  my lower nature rose within me to proclaim the foolish chatterer as a prophet so life was not as i had been taughta painful struggle between good and evil there was no such thing as evil the senseless epithet was a libel upon nature not through wearisome repression but rather through joyous expression of the animal lay advancement  villainsworkers in wrong for aesthetic pleasure of the artare useful characters in fiction in real life they do not exist i am convinced the man believed most of the rubbish he talked since the time of which i write he has done some service to the world i understand he is an excellent husband and father a considerate master a delightful host he intended i have no doubt to improve me to enlarge my understanding to free me from soulstifling bondage of convention not to credit him with this wellmeaning intention would be to assume him something quite inhuman to bestow upon him a dignity beyond his deserts i find it easier to regard him merely as a fool  our leading lady was a handsome but coarse woman somewhat overdeveloped starting life as a musichall singer she had married a small tradesman in the south of london some three or four years previous her junolike charms had turned the head of a youthful novelista refined sensitive man of whom great things in literature had been expected and judging from his earlier work not unreasonably he had run away with her and eventually married her the scandal was still fresh already she had repented of her bargain these women regard their infatuated lovers merely as steps in the social ladder and he had failed to appreciably advance her under her demoralising spell his ambition had died in him he no longer wrote no longer took interest in anything beyond his own debasement he was with us in the company playing small parts and playing them badly he would have remained with us as billposter rather than have been sent away  vane planned to bring this woman and myself together to her he pictured me a young gentleman of means a coming author who would soon be earning an income sufficient to keep her in every luxury to me he hinted that she had fallen in love with me i was never attracted to her by any feeling stronger than the admiration with which one views a handsome animal it was my vanity upon which he worked he envied me any man would envy me experience of life was what i needed to complete my genius the great intellects of this earth must learn all lessons even at the cost of suffering to themselves and others  as years before i had laboured to acquire a liking for cigars and whiskey deeming it an accomplishment necessary to a literary career so painstakingly i now applied myself to the cultivation of a pretty taste in passion according to the literature fictional and historical vane was kind enough to supply me with men of note were invariably sad dogs that my temperament was not that of the sad dog that i lacked instinct and inclination for the part appeared to this young idiot of whom i am writing in the light of a defect that her languishing glances irritated rather than maddened me that the occasional covert pressure of her hot thick hand left me cold i felt a reproach to my manhood i would fall in love with her surely my blood was red like other mens besides was i not an artist and was not profligacy the hallmark of the artist  but one grows tired of the confessional fate saved me from playing the part vane had assigned me in this vulgar comedy dragged me from my entanglement flung me on my feet again she was a little brusque in the process but i do not feel inclined to blame the kind lady for that the mud was creeping upward fast and a quick hand must needs be rough  our dramatic friend produced his play sooner than we had expected it crept out that something very like it had been seen in the provinces argument followed enquiries were set on foot it will blow over said vane but it seemed to be blowing our way  the salaries as a rule were paid by me on friday night vane in the course of the evening would bring me the money for me to distribute after the performance we were playing in the north of ireland i had not seen vane all that day so soon as i had changed my clothes i left my dressingroom to seek him the boxoffice keeper meeting me put a note into my hand it was short and to the point vane had pocketed the evenings takings and had left by the sevenfifty train he regretted causing inconvenience but life was replete with small comedies the wise man attached no seriousness to them we should probably meet again and enjoy a laugh over our experiences  some rumour had got about i looked up from the letter to find myself surrounded by suspicious faces with dry lips i told them the truth only they happened not to regard it as the truth vane throughout had contrived cleverly to them i was the manager the sole person responsible my wearily spoken explanations were to them incomprehensible lies the quarter of an hour might have been worse for me had i been sufficiently alive to understand or care what they were saying a dull listless apathy had come over me i felt the scene only stupid ridiculous tiresome there was some talk of giving me a damned good hiding i doubt whether i should have known till the next morning whether the suggestion had been carried out or not i gathered that the true history of the play the reason for the sudden alterations had been known to them all along they appeared to have reserved their virtuous indignation till this evening as explanation of my apparent sleepiness somebody whether in kindness to me or not i cannot say suggested i was drunk fortunately it carried conviction no further trains left the town that night i was allowed to depart a deputation promised to be round at my lodgings early in the morning  our leading lady had left the theatre immediately on the fall of the curtain it was not necessary for her to wait her husband acting as her business man on reaching my rooms i found her sitting by the fire it reminded me that our agent in advance having fallen ill her husband had at her suggestion been appointed in his place and had left us on the wednesday to make the necessary preparations in the next town on our list i thought that perhaps she had come round for her money and the idea amused me  well she said with her one smile i had been doing my best for some months to regard it as soulconsuming but without any real success  well i answered it bored me her being there i wanted to be alone  you dont seem overjoyed to see me whats the matter with you whats happened  i laughed vanes bolted and taken the weeks money with him  the beast she said i knew he was that sort what ever made you take up with him will it make much difference to you  it makes a difference all round i replied theres no money to pay any of you theres nothing to pay your fares back to london  she had risen here let me understand this she said are you the rich mug vanes been representing you to be or only his accomplice  the mug and the accomplice both i answered without the rich its his tour he put my name to it because he didnt want his own to appearfor family reasons its his play he stole it  she interrupted me with a whistle i thought it looked a bit fishy all those alterations but such funny things do happen in this profession stole it did he  the whole thing in manuscript i put my name to it for the same reasonhe didnt want his own to appear  she dropped into her chair and laugheda goodtempered laugh loud and long well im damned she said the first man who has ever taken me in i should never have signed if i had thought it was his show i could see the sort he was with half an eye she jumped up from the chair here let me get out of this she said i just looked in to know what time tomorrow id forgotten you neednt say i came  her hand upon the door laughter seized her again so that for support she had to lean against the wall  do you know why i really did come she said youll guess when you come to think it over so i may as well tell you its a bit of a joke i came to say yes to what you asked me last night have you forgotten  i stared at her last night it seemed a long while agoso very unimportant what i might have said  she laughed again so help me if you havent well you asked me to run away with youthats all to let our two souls unite damned lucky i took a day to think it over goodnight  goodnight i answered without moving i was gripping a chair to prevent myself from rushing at her pushing her out of the room and locking the door i wanted to be alone  i heard her turn the handle got a pound or two to carry you over it was a womans voice  i put my hand into my pocket one pound seventeen i answered counting it it will pay my fare to londonor buy me a dinner and a secondhand revolver i havent quite decided yet  oh you get back and pull yourself together she said youre only a kid goodnight  i put a few things into a small bag and walked thirty miles that night into belfast arrived in london i took a lodging in deptford where i was least likely to come in contact with any face i had ever seen before i maintained myself by giving singing lessons at sixpence the halfhour evening lessons in french and german the lord forgive me to ambitious shopboys at eighteen pence a week making up tradesmens books a few articles of jewellery i had retained enabled me to tide over bad periods for some four months i existed there never going outside the neighbourhood occasionally wandering listlessly about the streets some object some vista would strike me by reason of its familiarity then i would turn and hasten back into my grave of dim weltering streets  of thoughts emotions during these dead days i was unconscious somewhere in my brain they may have been stirring contending but myself i lived as in a long dull dream i ate and drank and woke and slept and walked and walked and lounged by corners staring by the hour together seeing nothing  it has surprised me since to find the scenes i must then have witnessed photographed so clearly on my mind tragedies dramas farces played before me in that teeming underworldthe scenes present themselves to me distinct complete yet i have no recollection of ever having seen them  i fell ill it must have been some time in april but i kept no count of days nobody came near me nobody knew of me i occupied a room at the top of a huge block of workmens dwellings a woman who kept a secondhand store had lent me for a shilling a week a few articles of furniture lying upon my chairbedstead i listened to the shrill sounds around me that through the light and darkness never ceased a pint of milk left each morning on the stone landing kept me alive i would wait for the mans descending footsteps then crawl to the door i hoped i was going to die regretting my returning strength the desire for food that drove me out into the streets again  one night a week or two after my partial recovery i had wandered on and on for hour after hour the breaking dawn recalled me to myself i was outside the palings of a park in the faint shadowy light it looked strange and unfamiliar i was too tired to walk further i scrambled over the low wooden fencing and reaching a seat dropped down and fell asleep  i was sitting in a sunny avenue birds were singing joyously bright flowers were all around me norah was beside me her frank sweet eyes were looking into mine they were full of tenderness mingled with wonder it was a delightful dream i felt myself smiling  suddenly i started to my feet norahs strong hand drew me down again  i was in the broad walk regents park where i remembered norah often walked before breakfast a parkkeeper the only other human creature within sight was eyeing me suspiciously i saw myselfwithout a lookingglassunkempt ragged my intention was to run but norah was holding me by the arm savagely i tried to shake her off i was weak from my recent illness and i suppose half starved it angered me to learn she was the stronger of the two in spite of my efforts she dragged me back  ashamed of my weakness ashamed of everything about me i burst into tears and that of course made me still more ashamed to add to my discomfort i had no handkerchief holding me with one handit was quite sufficientnorah produced her own and wiped my eyes the parkkeeper satisfied i suppose that at all events i was not dangerous with a grin passed on  where have you been and what have you been doing asked norah she still retained her grip upon me and in her grey eyes was quiet determination  so with my face turned away from her i told her the whole miserable story taking strange satisfaction in exaggerating if anything my own share of the disgrace my recital ended i sat staring down the long shadowfreckled way and for awhile there was no sound but the chirping of the sparrows  then behind me i beard a smothered laugh it was impossible to imagine it could come from norah i turned quickly to see who had stolen upon us it was norah who was laughing though to do her justice she was trying to suppress it holding her handkerchief to her face it was of no use it would out she abandoned the struggle and gave way to it it astonished the sparrows into silence they stood in a row upon the low iron border and looked at one another  i am glad you think it funny i said  but it is funny she persisted dont say you have lost your sense of humour paul it was the one real thing you possessed you were so cockyyou dont know how cocky you were everybody was a fool but vane nobody else but he appreciated you at your true worth you and he between you were going to reform the stage to educate the public to put everything and everybody to rights i am awfully sorry for all youve gone through but now that it is over cant you see yourself that it is funny  faintly dimly this aspect of the case for the very first time began to present itself to me but i should have preferred norah to have been impressed by its tragedy  that is not all i said i nearly ran away with another mans wife  i was glad to notice that sobered her somewhat nearly why not quite she asked more seriously  she thought i was some young idiot with money i replied bitterly pleased with the effect i had produced vane had told her a pack of lies when she found out i was only a poor devil ruined disgraced without a sixpence i made a gesture expressive of eloquent contempt for female nature generally  i am sorry said norah i told you you would fall in love with something real  her words irritated me unreasonably i confess in love i replied good god i was never in love with her  then why did you nearly run away with her  i was wishing now i had not mentioned the matter it promised to be difficult of explanation i dont know i replied irritably i thought she was in love with me she was very beautifulat least other people seemed to think she was artists are not like ordinary men you must liveunderstand life before you can teach it to others when a beautiful woman is in love with youor pretends to be youyou must say something you cant stand like a fool and  again her laughter interrupted me this time she made no attempt to hide it the sparrows chirped angrily and flew off to continue their conversation somewhere where there would be less noise  you are the biggest baby paul she said so soon as she could speak i ever heard of she seized me by the shoulders and turned me round if you werent looking so ill and miserable i would shake you paul till there wasnt a bit of breath left in your body  how much money do you owe she askedto the people in the company and anybody else i meanroughly  about a hundred and fifty pounds i answered  then if you rest day or night paul till you have paid that hundred and fiftyevery penny of itill think you the meanest cad in london  her grey eyes were flashing quite alarmingly i felt almost afraid of her she could be so vehement at times  but how can i i asked  go straight home she commanded and write something funny an article storyanything you like only mind that it is funny post it to me tomorrow at the latest dan is in london editing a new weekly ill have it copied out and sent to him i shant say who it is from i shall merely ask him to read it and reply at once if youve a grain of grit left in you youll write something that he will be glad to have and to pay for pawn that ring on your finger and get yourself a good breakfastit was my mothers weddingring the only piece of dispensable property i had not parted withshe wont mind helping you but nobody else is going toexcept yourself  she looked at her watch i must be off she turned again there is something i was forgetting bshe mentioned the name of the dramatist whose play vane had stolenhas been looking for you for the last three months if you hadnt been an idiot you might have saved yourself a good deal of trouble he is quite certain it was vane stole the manuscript he asked the nurse to bring it to him an hour after vane had left the house and it couldnt be found besides the mans character is well known and so is yours i wont tell it you she laughed anyhow it isnt that of a knave  she made a step towards me then changed her mind no she said i shant shake hands with you till you have paid the last penny that you owe then i shall know that you are a man  she did not look back i watched her till the sunlight streaming in my eyes raised a golden mist between us  then i went to my work    chapter ix  the princess of the golden locks sends paul a ring  it took me three years to win that handshake for the first six months i remained in deptford there was excellent material to be found there for humorous articles essays stories likewise for stories tragic and pathetic but i owed a hundred and fifty poundsa little over two hundred it reached to i found when i came to add up the actual figures so i paid strict attention to business left the tears to be garnered by othersbetter fitted maybe for the task kept to my own patch reaped and took to market only the laughter  at the beginning i sent each manuscript to norah she had it copied out debited me with the cost received payment and sent me the balance at first my earnings were small but norah was an excellent agent rapidly they increased dan grew quite cross with her wrote in pained surprise at her greed the matter was fair but in no way remarkable any friend of hers of course he was anxious to assist but business was business in justice to his proprietors he could not and would not pay more than the market value miss deleglise replying curtly in the third person found herself in perfect accord with mr brian as to business being business if mr brian could not afford to pay her price for material so excellent other editors with whom miss deleglise was equally well acquainted could and would answer by return would greatly oblige pending which the manuscript then in her hands she retained mr brian understanding he had found his match grumbled but paid whether he had any suspicion who jack homer might be he never confessed but he would have played the game pulled his end of the rope in either case nor was he allowed to decide the question for himself competition was introduced into the argument of purpose a certain proportion of my work my agent sent elsewhere jack homer grew to be a commodity in demand for seated at my rickety table i laughed as i wrote the fourth wall of the dismal room fading before my eyes revealing vistas beyond  still it was slow work humour is not an industrious maid declines to be bustled will work only when she feels inclineddoes not often feel inclined gives herself a good many unnecessary airs if worried packs up and goes off heaven knows where comes back when she thinks she will a somewhat unreliable young person to my literary labours i found it necessary to add journalism i lacked dans magnificent assurance fate never befriends the nervous had i burst into the editorial sanctum the editor most surely would have been out if in would have been a man of short ways would have seen to it that i went out quickly but the idea was not to be thought of robert macaire himself in my one coat would have been diffident apologetic i joined the ranks of the pennyalinersto be literally exact three halfpence a liners in company with half a dozen other shabby outsiderssome of them young men like myself seeking to climb others older men who had sunki attended inquests police courts flew after fire engines rejoiced in street accidents yearned for murders somewhat vulturelike we lived precariously upon the misfortunes of others we made occasional half crowns by providing the public with scandal occasional crowns by keeping our information to ourselves  i think gentlemen would explain our spokesman in a hoarse whisper on returning to the table i think the corpses brotherinlaw is anxious that the affair if possible should be kept out of the papers  the closeness and attention with which we would follow that particular case the fulness and completeness of our notes would be quite remarkable our spokesman would rise drift carelessly away to return five minutes later wiping his mouth  not a very interesting case gentlemen i dont think shall we say five shillings apiece sometimes a sense of the dignity of our calling would induce us to stand out for ten  and here also my sense of humour came to my aid gave me perhaps an undue advantage over my competitors twelve good men and true had been asked to say how a lascar sailor had met his death it was perfectly clear how he had met his death a plumber working on the roof of a small twostoreyed house had slipped and fallen on him the plumber had escaped with a few bruises the unfortunate sailor had been picked up dead some blame attached to the plumber his mate an excellent witness told us the whole story  i was fixing a gaspipe on the first floor said the man the prisoner was on the roof  we wont call him the prisoner interrupted the coroner at least not yet refer to him if you please as the last witness  the last witness corrected himself the man he shouts down the chimney to know if i was ready for him  ready and waiting i says  right he says im coming in through the window  wait a bit i says ill go down and move the ladder for you  its all right he says i can reach it  no you cant i says its the other side of the chimney  i can get round he says  well before i knew what had happened i hears him go smack i rushes to the window and looks out i see him on the pavement sitting up like  hullo jim i says have you hurt yourself  i think im all right he says as far as i can tell but i wish youd come down this bloke ive fallen on looks a bit sick  the others headed their flimsy sad accident a title truthful but not alluring i altered mine to plumber in a hurryfatal result saying as little as possible about the unfortunate sailor i called the attention of plumbers generally to the coroners very just remarks upon the folly of undue haste pointed out to them as a body the trouble that would arise if somehow they could not cure themselves of this tendency to rush through their work without a moments loss of time  it established for me a useful reputation the subeditor of one evening paper condescended so far as to come out in his shirtsleeves and shake hands with me  thats the sort of thing we want he told me a light touch a bit of humour  i snatched fun from fires i sincerely trust the insurance premiums were not overdue culled quaintness from street rows extracted merriment from catastrophes the most painful and prospered  though often within a stones throw of the street i unremittingly avoided the old house at poplar i was suffering inconvenience at this period by reason of finding myself two distinct individuals contending with each other my object was to encourage the new paulthe sensible practical pushful paul whose career began to look promising to drive away from interfering with me his strangely unlike twinthe old childish paul of the sad farseeing eyes sometimes out of the cracked lookingglass his wistful yearning face would plead to me but i would sternly shake my head i knew well his cunning had i let him have his way he would have led me through the maze of streets he knew so well past the broken railings outside which he would have left my body standing along the weedy pathway through the cracked and dented door up the creaking staircase to the dismal little chamber where we oncehe and i togetherhad sat dreaming foolish dreams  come he would whisper it is so near let us push aside the chest of drawers very quietly softly raise the broken sash prop it open with the latin dictionary lean our elbows on the sill listen to the voices of the weary city voices calling to us from the darkness  but i was too wary to be caught later on i would reply to him when i have made my way when i am stronger to withstand your wheedling then i will go with you if you are still in existence my sentimental little friend we will dream again the old impractical foolish dreamsand laugh at them  so he would fade away and in his place would nod to me approvingly a businesslikelooking wideawake young fellow  but to one sentimental temptation i succumbed my position was by now assured there was no longer any reason for my hiding myself i determined to move westward i had not intended to soar so high but passing through guildford street one day the creepercovered corner house that my father had once thought of taking recalled itself to me a card was in the fanlight i knocked and made enquiries a bedsittingroom upon the third floor was vacant i remembered it well the moment the loquacious landlady opened its door  this shall be your room paul said my father so clearly his voice sounded behind me that i turned forgetting for the moment it was but a memory you will be quiet here and we can shut out the bed and washstand with a screen  so my father had his way it was a pleasant sunny little room overlooking the gardens of the hospital i followed my fathers suggestion shut out the bed and washstand with a screen and sometimes of an evening it would amuse me to hear my father turn the handle of the door  how are you getting onall right  famously  often there came back to me the words he had once used you must be the practical man paul and get on myself i have always been somewhat of a dreamer i meant to do such great things in the world and somehow i suppose i aimed too high i wasntpractical  but ought not one to aim high i had asked  my father had fidgeted in his chair it is very difficult to say it is all soso very ununderstandable you aim high and you dont hit anythingat least it seems as if you didnt perhaps after all it is better to aim at something low andand hit it yet it seems a pityones ideals all the best part of onei dont know why it is perhaps we do not understand  for some months i had been writing over my own name one day a letter was forwarded to me by an editor to whose care it had been addressed it was a short formal note from the maternal sellars inviting me to the wedding of her daughter with a mr reginald clapper i had almost forgotten the incident of the lady ortensia but it was not unsatisfactory to learn that it had terminated pleasantly also i judged from an invitation having been sent me that the lady wished me to be witness of the fact that my desertion had not left her disconsolate so much gratification i felt i owed her and accordingly purchasing a present as expensive as my means would permit i made my way on the following thursday clad in frock coat and light grey trousers to kennington church  the ceremony was already in progress creeping on tiptoe up the aisle i was about to slip into an empty pew when a hand was laid upon my sleeve  were all here whispered the okelly just room for ye  squeezing his hand as i passed i sat down between the signora and mrs peedles both ladies were weeping the signora silently one tear at a time clinging fondly to her pretty face as though loath to fall from it mrs peedles copiously with explosive gurgles as of water from a bottle  it is such a beautiful service murmured the signora pressing my hand as i settled myself down i should soso love to be married  me darling whispered the okelly seizing her other hand and kissing it covertly behind his open prayer book perhaps ye will beone day  the signora through her tears smiled at him but with a sigh shook her head  mrs peedles clad so far as the dim november light enabled me to judge in the costume of queen elizabethnothing regal the sort of thing one might assume to have been her majestys second best say third best frockexplained that weddings always reminded her how fleeting a thing was love  the poor dears she sobbed but there theres no telling perhaps theyll be happy im sure i hope they may be he looks harmless  jarman stretching out a hand to me from the other side of mrs peedles urged me to cheer up dont wear your eart upon your sleeve he advised try and smile  in the vestry i met old friends the maternal sellars stouter than ever had been accommodated with a chairat least i assumed so she being in a sitting posture the chair itself was not in evidence she greeted me with more graciousness than i had expected enquiring after my health with pointedness and an amount of tender solicitude that until the explanation broke upon me somewhat puzzled me  mr reginald clapper was a small but energetic gentleman much impressed i was glad to notice with a conviction of his own good fortune he expressed the greatest delight at being introduced to me shook me heartily by the hand and hoped we should always be friends  wont be my fault if were not he added come and see us whenever you like he repeated this three times i gathered the general sentiment to be that he was acting if anything with excess of generosity  mrs reginald clapper as i was relieved to know she now was received my salute to a subdued murmur of applause she looked to my eyes handsomer than when i had last seen her or maybe my taste was growing less exacting she also trusted she might always regard me as a friend i replied that it would be my hope to deserve the honour whereupon she kissed me of her own accord and embracing her mother shed some tears explaining the reason to be that everybody was so good to her  brother george less lank than formerly hampered by a pair of enormous white kid gloves superintended my signing of the register whispering to me sympathetically better luck next time old cock  the fat young ladyor maybe the lean young lady grown stouter i cannot say for certainwho feared i had forgotten her a thing i assured her utterly impossible was good enough to say that in her opinion i was worth all the others put together  and so i told her added the fat young ladyor the lean one grown stouter a dozen times if i told her once but there  i murmured my obligations  cousin joseph whom i found no difficulty in recognising by reason of his watery eyes appeared not so chirpy as of yore  you take my tip advised cousin joseph drawing me aside and keep out of it  you speak from experience i suggested  im as fond of a joke said the wateryeyed joseph as any man but when it comes to buckets of water  a reminder from the maternal sellars that breakfast had been ordered for eleven oclock caused a general movement and arrested josephs revelations  see you again perhaps he murmured and pushed past me  what mrs sellars i suppose would have alluded to as a cold collashon had been arranged for at a restaurant near by i walked there in company with uncle and aunt gutton not because i particularly desired their companionship but because uncle gutton seizing me by the arm left me no alternative  now then young man commenced uncle gutton kindly but boisterously so soon as we were in the street at some little distance behind the others if you want to pitch into me you pitch away i shant mind and maybe itll do you good  i informed him that nothing was further from my desire  oh all right returned uncle gutton seemingly disappointed if youre willing to forgive and forget so am i i never liked you as i daresay you saw and so i told rosie he may be cleverer than he looks i says or he may be a bigger fool than i think him though thats hardly likely you take my advice and get a fullgrown article then youll know what youre doing  i told him i thought his advice had been admirable  im glad you think so he returned somewhat puzzled though if you wanted to call me names i shouldnt have blamed you anyhow youve took it like a sensible chap youve got over it as i always told her you would young men out of storybooks dont die of broken hearts even if for a month or two they do feel like standing on their head in the waterbutt  why i was in love myself three times explained uncle gutton before i married the old woman  aunt gutton sighed and said she was afraid gentlemen didnt feel these things as much as they ought to  theyve got their living to earn retorted uncle gutton  i agreed with uncle gutton that life could not be wasted in vain regret  as for the rest admitted uncle gutton handsomely i was wrong youve turned out better than i expected you would  i thanked him for his improved opinion and as we entered the restaurant we shook hands  minikin we found there waiting for us he explained that having been able to obtain only limited leave of absence from business he had concluded the time would be better employed at the restaurant than at the church others were there also with whom i was unacquainted young sparks admirers i presume of the lady ortensia in her professional capacity fellowclerks of mr clapper who was something in the city altogether we must have numbered a score  breakfast was laid in a large room on the first floor the wedding presents stood displayed upon a sidetable my own with my card attached had not been seen by mrs clapper till that moment she and her mother lingered examining it  real silver i heard the maternal sellars whisper must have paid a ten pound note for it  i hope youll find it useful i said  the maternal sellars drifting away joined the others gathered together at the opposite end of the room  i suppose you think i set my cap at you merely because you were a gentleman said the lady ortensia  dont lets talk about it i answered we were both foolish  i dont want you to think it was merely that continued the lady ortensia i did like you and i wouldnt have disgraced youat least id have tried not to we women are quick to learn you never gave me time  believe me things are much better as they are i said  i suppose so she answered i was a fool she glanced round we still had the corner to ourselves i told a rare pack of lies she said i didnt seem able to help it i was feeling sore all over but i have always been ashamed of myself ill tell them the truth if you like  i thought i saw a way of making her mind easy my dear girl i said you have taken the blame upon yourself and let me go scotfree it was generous of you  you mean that she asked  the truth i answered would shift all the shame on to me it was i who broke my word acted shabbily from beginning to end  i hadnt looked at it in that light she replied very well ill hold my tongue  my place at breakfast was to the left of the maternal sellars the signora next to me and the okelly opposite uncle gutton faced the bride and bridegroom the disillusioned joseph was hidden from me by flowers so that his voice raised from time to time fell upon my ears embellished with the mysterious significance of the unseen oracle  for the first quarter of an hour or so the meal proceeded almost in silence the maternal sellars when not engaged in whispered argument with the perspiring waiter was furtively occupied in working sums upon the tablecloth by aid of a blunt pencil the signora strangely unlike her usual self was not in talkative mood  it was so kind of them to invite me said the signora speaking low but i feel i ought not to have come  why not i asked  im not fit to be here murmured the signora in a broken voice what right have i at wedding breakfasts of course for dear willie it is different he has been married  the okelly who never when the signora was present seemed to care much for conversation in which she was unable to participate took advantage of his neighbours being somewhat deaf to lapse into abstraction jarman essayed a few witticisms of a general character of which nobody took any notice the professional admirers of the lady ortensia seated together at a corner of the table appeared to be enjoying a small joke among themselves occasionally one or another of them would laugh nervously but for the most part the only sounds to be heard were the clatter of the knives and forks the energetic shuffling of the waiter and a curious hissing noise as of escaping gas caused by uncle gutton drinking champagne  with the cutting or rather the smashing into a hundred fragments of the wedding cakea work that taxed the united strength of bride and bridegroom to the utmostthe atmosphere lost something of its sombreness the company warmed by food displaying indications of being nearly done commenced to simmer the maternal sellars putting away with her blunt pencil considerations of material nature embraced the table with a smile  but it is a sad thing sighed the maternal sellars the next moment with a shake of her huge head when your daughter marries and goes away and leaves you  damned sight sadder commented uncle gutton when she dont go off but hangs on at home year after year and expects you to keep her  i credit uncle gutton with intending this as an aside for the exclusive benefit of the maternal sellars but his voice was not of the timbre that lends itself to secrecy one of the bridesmaids a plain elderly girl bending over her plate flushed scarlet i concluded her to be miss gutton  it doesnt seem to me said aunt gutton from the other end of the table that gentlemen are as keen on marrying nowadays as they used to be  got to know a bit about it i expect sounded the small shrill voice of the unseen joseph  to my thinking exclaimed a hatchetfaced gentleman one of the evils crying most loudly for redress at the present moment is the utterly needless and monstrous expense of legal proceedings he spoke rapidly and with warmth take divorce at present what is it the rich mans luxury  conversation appeared to be drifting in a direction unsuitable to the occasion but jarman was fortunately there to seize the helm  the plain fact of the matter is said jarman girls have gone up in value time was so ive heard when they used to be given away with a useful bit of household linen maybe a chair or two nowadayswell its only chaps wallowing in wealth like clapper there as can afford a really firstclass article  mr clapper not a gentleman in other respects of exceptional brilliancy possessed one quality that popularityseekers might have envied him the ability to explode on the slightest provocation into a laugh instinct with all the characteristics of genuine delight  give and take observed the maternal sellars so soon as mr clappers roar had died away thats what youve got to do when youre married  give a deal more than you bargained for and take what you dont wantthat sums it up came the bitter voice of the unseen  oh do be quiet joe advised the stout young lady from which i concluded she had once been the lean young lady you talk enough for a man  cant i open my mouth demanded the indignant oracle  you look less foolish when you keep it shut returned the stout young lady  well show them how to get on observed the lady ortensia to her bridegroom with a smile  mr clapper responded with a gurgle  when me and the old girl there fixed things up said uncle gutton we didnt talk no nonsense and we didnt start with no misunderstandings im not a duke i says  had she been mistaking you for one enquired minikin  mr clapper commented not tactfully but with appreciative laugh i feared for a moment lest uncle guttons little eyes should leave his head  not being a naturalborn oneeyed fool replied uncle gutton glaring at the unabashed minikin she did not im not a duke i says and she had sense enough to know as i was talking sarcastic like im not offering you a life of luxury and ease im offering you myself just what you see and nothing more  she took it asked minikin who was mopping up his gravy with his bread  she accepted me sir returned uncle gutton in a voice that would have awed any one but minikin can you give me any good reason for her not doing so  no need to get mad with me explained minikin im not blaming the poor woman we all have our moments of despair  the unfortunate clapper again exploded uncle gutton rose to his feet the ready jarman saved the situation  ear ear cried jarman banging the table with the handles of two knives silence for uncle gutton es going to propose a toast ear ear  mrs clapper seconding his efforts the whole table broke into applause  what as a matter of fact i did get up to say began uncle gutton  good old uncle gutton persisted the determined jarman bride and bridegroomlong life to em  uncle sutton evidently pleased allowed his indignation against minikin to evaporate  well said uncle gutton if you think im the one to do it  the response was unmistakable in our enthusiasm we broke two glasses and upset a cruet a small thin lady was unfortunate enough to shed her chignon thus encouraged uncle sutton launched himself upon his task personally i should have been better pleased had fate not interposed to assign to him the duty  starting with a somewhat uninstructive history of his own career he suddenly and for no reason at all obvious branched off into fierce censure of the adulteration act reminded of the time by the maternal sellars he got in his first sensible remark by observing that with such questions he took it the present company was not particularly interested and directed himself to the main argument to his uncle guttons foresight wisdom and instinctive understanding of humanity mr clapper it appeared owed his present happiness uncle gutton it was who had divined from the outset the sort of husband the fair rosina would come eventually to desirea plain simple hardworking levelheaded sort of chap with no hitytity nonsense about him such an one in short as mr clapper himselfat this mr clapper expressed approval by a lengthy laugha gentleman who so far as uncle guttons knowledge went had but one fault a silly habit of laughing when there was nothing whatever to laugh at of which it was to be hoped the cares and responsibilities of married life would cure him to the rest of the discourse mr clapper listened with a gravity painfully maintained there had been moments uncle gutton was compelled to admit when the fair rosina had shown inclination to make a fool of herselfto desire in place of honest worth mere painted baubles he used the term in no offensive sense speaking for himself what a man wanted beyond his weekly newspaper he uncle gutton was unable to understand but if there were fools in the world who wanted to read rubbish written by other fools then the other fools would of course write it uncle gutton did not blame them he mentioned no names but what he would say was a plain man for a sensible girl and no painted baubles  the waiter here entering with a message from the cabman to the effect that if he was to catch the twelvefortyfive from charing cross it was about full time he started uncle gutton was compelled to bring his speech to a premature conclusion the bride and bridegroom were hustled into their clothes there followed much female embracing and male handshaking the rice having been forgotten the waiter was almost thrown downstairs with directions to at once procure some there appearing danger of his not returning in time the resourceful jarman suggested cold semolina pudding as a substitute but the idea was discouraged by the bride a slipper of remarkable antiquity discovered on the floor and regarded as a gift from providence was flung from the window by brother george with admirable aim and alighted on the roof of the cab the waiter on his return not being able to find it seemed surprised    i walked back as far as the obelisk with the okelly and the signora who were then living together in lambeth till that morning i had not seen the okelly since my departure from london nearly two years before so that we had much to tell each other for the third time now had the okelly proved his utter unworthiness to be the husband of the lady to whom he still referred as his dear good wife  but under the circumstances would it not be better i suggested for her to obtain a divorce then you and the signora could marry and there would be an end to the whole trouble  from a strictly worldly point of view replied the okelly it certainly would be but mrs okellyhis voice took to itself unconsciously a tone of reverenceis not an ordinary woman you can have no conception my dear kelver of her goodness i had a letter from her only two months ago a few weeks after thethe last occurrence not one word of reproach only that if i trespassed against her even unto seven times seven she would still consider it her duty to forgive me that the home would always be there for me to return to and repent  a tear stood in the okellys eye a beautiful nature he commented there are not many women like her  not one in a million added the signora with enthusiasm  well to me it seems like pure obstinacy i said  the okelly spoke quite angrily dont ye say a word against her i wont listen to it ye dont understand her she never will despair of reforming me  you see mr kelver explained the signora the whole difficulty arises from my unfortunate profession it is impossible for me to keep out of dear willies way if i could earn my living by any other means i would but i cant and when he sees my name upon the posters its all over with him  i do wish willie dear added the signora in tones of gentle reproof that you were not quite so weak  me dear replied the okelly ye dont know how attractive ye are or ye wouldnt blame me  i laughed why dont you be firm i suggested to the signora send him packing about his business  i ought to admitted the signora i always mean to until i see him then i dont seem able to say anythingnot anything i ought to  ye do say it contradicted the okelly yere an angel only i wont listen to ye  i dont say it as if i meant it persisted the signora its evident i dont  i still think it a pity i said someone does not explain to mrs okelly that a divorce would be the truer kindness  it is difficult to decide argued the signora if ever you should want to leave me  me darling exclaimed the okelly  but you may insisted the signora something may happen to help you to show you how wicked it all is i shall be glad then to think that you will go back to her because she is a good woman willie you know she is  shes a saint agreed willie  at the obelisk i shook hands with them and alone pursued my way towards fleet street  the next friend whose acquaintance i renewed was dan he occupied chambers in the temple and one evening a week or two after the ortensia marriage i called upon him nothing in his manner of greeting me suggested the necessity of explanation dan never demanded anything of his friends beyond their need of him shaking hands with me he pushed me down into the easychair and standing with his back to the fire filled and lighted his pipe  i left you alone he said you had to go through it your slough of despond it lies across every paththat leads to anywhere clear of it  i think so i replied smiling  you are on the high road he continued you have only to walk steadily sure you have left nothing behind youin the slough  nothing worth bringing out of it i said why do you ask so seriously  he laid his hand upon my head rumpling my hair as in the old days  dont leave him behind you he said the little boy paulpaul the dreamer  i laughed oh he he was only in my way  yes here answered dan this is not his world he is of no use to you here wont help you to bread and cheeseno nor kisses either but keep him near you later you will find perhaps that all along he has been the real paulthe living growing paul the otherthe active worldly pushful paul only the stuff that dreams are made of his fretful life a troubled night rounded by a sleep  i have been driving him away i said he is soso impracticable  dan shook his head gravely it is not his world he repeated we must eat drinkbe husbands fathers he does not understand here he is the child take care of him  we sat in silence for a little whilefor longer perhaps than it seemed to usdan in the chair opposite to me each of us occupied with his own thoughts  you have an excellent agent said dan retain her services as long as you can she possesses the great advantage of having no conscience as regards your affairs women never have where they  he broke off to stir the fire  you like her i asked the words sounded feeble it is only the writer who fits the language to the emotion the living man more often selects by contrast  she is my ideal woman returned dan true and strong and tender clear as crystal pure as dawn like her  he knocked the ashes from his pipe we do not marry our ideals he went on we love with our hearts not with our souls the woman i shall marryhe sat gazing into the fire a smile upon his faceshe will be some sweet clinging childish woman david copperfields dora only i am not doady who always seems to me to have been somewhat of ahe reminds me of you paul a little dickens was right her helplessness as time went on would have bored him more and more instead of appealing to him  and the women i suggested do they marry their ideals  he laughed ask them  the difference between men and women he continued is very slight we exaggerate it for purposes of art what sort of man do you suppose he is norahs ideal cant you imagine himbut i can tell you the type of man she will marry ay and love with all her heart  he looked at me from under his strong brows drawn down a twinkle in his eye  a nice enough fellowclever perhaps but someonewell someone who will want looking after taking care of managing someone who will appeal to the mother side of hernot her ideal man but the man for whom nature intended her  perhaps with her help i said he may in time become her ideal  theres a long road before him growled dan  it was norah herself who broke to me the news of barbaras elopement with hal i had seen neither of them since my return to london old hasluck a month or so before i had met in the city one day by chance and he had insisted on my lunching with him i had found him greatly changed his buoyant selfassurance had deserted him in its place a fretful eagerness had become his motive force at first he had talked boastingly had i seen the post for last monday the court circular for the week before had i read that barbara had danced with the crown prince that the count and countess huescar had been entertaining a grand duke what duplicated line of text i think of that and such like was not money master of the world ay and the nobs should be made to acknowledge it  but as he had gulped down glass after glass the brag had died away  no children he had whispered to me across the table thats what i cant understand nearly four years and no children whatll be the good of it all where do i come in what do i get damn these rotten popinjays what do they think we buy them for  it was in the studio on a monday morning that norah told me it was the talk of the town for the next dayand the following eight she had heard it the evening before at supper and had written to me to come and see her  i thought you would rather hear it quietly said norah than learn it from a newspaper paragraph besides i wanted to tell you this she did wrong when she married putting aside love for position now she has done right she has put aside her shame with all the advantages she derived from it she has proved herself a woman i respect her  norah would not have said that to please me had she not really thought it i could see it from that light but it brought me no comfort my goddess had a heart passions was a mere human creature like myself from her cold throne she had stepped down to mingle with the world so some youthful page of arthurs court may have felt learning the great queen was but a woman  i never spoke with her again but once that was an evening three years later in brussels strolling idly after dinner the bright lights of a theatre invited me to enter it was somewhat late the second act had commenced i slipped quietly into my seat the only one vacant at the extreme end of the front row of the first range then looking down upon the stage met her eyes a little later an attendant whispered to me that madame g would like to see me so at the fall of the curtain i went round two men were in the dressingroom smoking and on the table were some bottles of champagne she was standing before her glass a loose shawl about her shoulders  excuse my shaking hands she said this damned hole is like a furnace i have to make up fresh after each act  she held them up for my inspection with a laugh they were smeared with grease  dyou know my husband she continued baron g mr paul kelver  the baron rose he was a redfaced potbellied little man delighted to meet mr kelver he said speaking in excellent english any friend of my wifes is always a friend of mine  he held out his fat perspiring hand i was not in the mood to attach much importance to ceremony i bowed and turned away careless whether he was offended or not  i am glad i saw you she continued do you remember a girl called barbara you and she were rather chums years ago  yes i answered i remember her  well she died poor girl three years ago she was rubbing paint into her cheeks as she spoke she asked me if ever i saw you to give you this i have been carrying it about with me ever since  she took a ring from her finger it was the one ring barbara had worn as a girl a chrysolite set plainly in a band of gold i had noticed it upon her hand the first time i had seen her sitting in my fathers office framed by the dusty books and papers she dropped it into my outstretched palm  quite a pretty little romance laughed the baron  thats all added the woman at the glass she said you would understand  from under her painted lashes she flashed a glance at me i hope never to see again that look upon a womans face  thank you i said yes i understand it was very kind of you i shall always wear it  placing the ring upon my finger i left the room    chapter x  paul finds his way  slowly surely steadily i climbed putting aside all dreams paying strict attention to business often my other self little paul of the sad eyes would seek to lure me from my work but for my vehement determination never to rest for a moment till i had purchased back my honesty my desiregrowing day by day till it became almost a physical hungerto feel again the pressure of norahs strong white hand in mine he might possibly have succeeded heaven only knows what then he might have made of me politician minor poet more or less able editor hampered by convictionssomething most surely of but little service to myself now and again with a week to sparemy humour making holiday nothing to be done but await patiently its returni would write stories for my own pleasure they made no mark but success in purposeful work is of slower growth had i persistedbut there was money to be earned and by the time my debts were paid i had established a reputation  madness argued practical friends you would be throwing away a certain fortune for at the best a doubtful competence the one you know you can do the otherit would be beginning your career all over again  you would find it almost impossible now explained those who spoke i knew words of wisdom of experience the world would never listen to you once a humourist always a humourist as well might a comic actor insist upon playing hamlet it might be the best hamlet ever seen upon the stage the audience would only laughor stop away  drawn by our mutual need of sympathy goggles and i seeking some quiet corner in the club would pour out our souls to each other he would lay before me at some length his conception of romeoan excellent conception i have no doubt though i confess it failed to interest me somehow i could not picture him to myself as romeo but i listened with every sign of encouragement it was the price i paid him for in turn listening to me while i unfolded to him my ideas how monumental literature helpful to mankind should be imagined and built up  perhaps in a future existence laughed goggles one evening rising as the clock struck seven i shall be a great tragedian and you a famous poet meanwhile i suppose as your friend brian puts it we are both sinning our mercies after all to live is the most important thing in life  i had strolled with him so far as the cloakroom and was helping him to get into his coat  take my advicetapping me on the chest he fixed his funny fishy eyes upon me had i not known his intention to be serious i should have laughed his expression was so comical marry some dear little woman he was married himself to a placid lady of about twice his own weight one never understands life properly till the babies come to explain it to one  i returned to my easychair before the fire wife children home after all was not that the true work of manof the live man not the dreamer i saw them round me giving to my life dignity responsibility the fair sweet woman helper comrade comforter the little faces fashioned in our image their questioning voices teaching us the answers to lifes riddles all other hopes ambitions dreams what were they phantoms of the morning mist fading in the sunlight  hodgson came to me one evening i want you to write me a comic opera he said he had an open letter in his hand which he was reading the public seem to be getting tired of these eternal translations from the french i want something english something new and original  the english is easy enough i replied but i shouldnt clamour for anything new and original if i were you  why not he asked looking up from his letter  you might get it i answered then you would be disappointed  he laughed well you know what i meansomething we could refer to as new and original on the programme what do you say it will be a big chance for you and im willing to risk it im sure you can do it people are beginning to talk about you  i had written a few farces comediettas and they had been successful but the chief piece of the evening is a serious responsibility a young man may be excused for hesitating it can make but also it can mar him a comic opera above all other forms of artif i may be forgiven for using the sacred word in connection with such a subjectdemands experience  i explained my fears i did not explain that in my desk lay a fouract drama throbbing with humanity with life with which it had been my hopegrowing each day fainterto take the theatrical public by storm to establish myself as a serious playwright  its very simple urged hodgson provide atherton plenty of comic business you ought to be able to do that all right give gleeson something pretty in waltz time and duncan a part in which she can change her frock every quarter of an hour or so and the thing is done  ill tell you what continued hodgson ill take the whole crowd down to richmond on sunday well have a coach and leave the theatre at halfpast ten it will be an opportunity for you to study them youll be able to have a talk with them and get to know just what they can do atherton has ideas in his head hell explain them to you then next week well draw up a contract and set to work  it was too good an opportunity to let slip though i knew that if successful i should find myself pinned down firmer than ever to my role of jester but it is remunerative the writing of comic opera  a small crowd had gathered in the strand to see us start  nothing wrong is there enquired the leading lady in a tone of some anxiety alighting a quarter of an hour late from her cab it isnt a fire is it  merely assembled to see you explained mr hodgson without raising his eyes from his letters  oh good gracious cried the leading lady do let us get away quickly  box seat my dear returned mr hodgson  the leading lady accepting the proffered assistance of myself and three other gentlemen mounted the ladder with charming hesitation some delay in getting off was caused by our low comedian who twice making believe to miss his footing slid down again into the arms of the stolid doorkeeper the crowd composed for the most part of small boys approving the endeavour to amuse them laughed and applauded our low comedian thus encouraged made a third attempt upon his hands and knees and gaining the roof sat down upon the tenor who smiled somewhat mechanically  the first dozen or so busses we passed our low comedian greeted by rising to his feet and bowing profoundly afterwards falling back upon either the tenor or myself except by the tenor and myself his performance appeared to be much appreciated charing cross passed and nobody seeming to be interested in our progress to the relief of the tenor and myself he settled down  people sometimes ask me said the low comedian brushing the dust off his knees why i do this sort of thing off the stage it amuses me  i was coming up to london the other day from birmingham he continued at willesden when the ticket collector opened the door i sprang out of the carriage and ran off down the platform of course he ran after me shouting to all the others to stop me i dodged them for about a minute you wouldnt believe the excitement there was quite fifty people left their seats to see what it was all about i explained to them when they caught me that i had been travelling second with a firstclass ticket which was the fact people think i do it to attract attention i do it for my own pleasure  it must be a troublesome way of amusing oneself i suggested  exactly what my wife says he replied she can never understand the desire that comes over us all i suppose at times to play the fool as a rule when she is with me i dont do it  shes not here today i asked glancing round  she suffers so from headaches he answered she hardly ever goes anywhere  im sorry i spoke not out of mere politeness i really did feel sorry  during the drive to richmond this irrepressible desire to amuse himself got the better of him more than once or twice through kensington he attracted a certain amount of attention by balancing the horn upon his nose at kew he stopped the coach to request of a young ladies boarding school change for sixpence at the foot of richmond hill he caused a crowd to assemble while trying to persuade a deaf old gentleman in a bathchair to allow his man to race us up the hill for a shilling  at these antics and such like our party laughed uproariously with the exception of hodgson who had his correspondence to attend to and an elegant young lady of some social standing who had lately emerged from the divorce court with a reputation worth to her in cash a hundred pounds a week  arriving at the hotel quarter of an hour or so before lunch time we strolled into the garden our low comedian observing an elderly gentleman of dignified appearance sipping a glass of vermouth at a small table stood for a moment rooted to the earth with astonishment then making a beeline for the stranger seized and shook him warmly by the hand we exchanged admiring glances with one another  charlie is in good form today we told one another and followed at his heels  the elderly gentleman had risen he looked puzzled and hows aunt martha asked him our low comedian dear old aunt martha well i am glad you do look bonny how is she  im afraid commenced the elderly gentleman our low comedian started back other visitors had gathered round  dont tell me anything has happened to her not dead dont tell me that  he seized the bewildered gentleman by the shoulders and presented to him a face distorted by terror  i really have not the faintest notion what you are talking about returned the gentleman who seemed annoyed i dont know you  not know me do you mean to tell me youve forgotten isnt your name steggles  no it isnt returned the stranger somewhat shortly  my mistake replied our low comedian he tossed off at one gulp what remained of the strangers vermouth and walked away rapidly  the elderly gentleman not seeing the humour of the joke one of our party to soothe him explained to him that it was atherton the athertoncharlie atherton  oh is it growled the elderly gentleman then will you tell him from me that when i want his damned tomfoolery ill come to the theatre and pay for it  what a disagreeable man we said as following our low comedian we made our way into the hotel  during lunch he continued in excellent spirits kissed the bald back of the waiters head pretending to mistake it for a face called for hot mustard and water made believe to steal the silver and when the fingerbowls arrived took off his coat and requested the ladies to look the other way  after lunch he became suddenly serious and slipping his arm through mine led me by unfrequented paths  now about this new opera he said we dont want any of the old stale business give us something new  i suggested that to do so might be difficult  not at all he answered now my idea is this i am a young fellow and im in love with a girl  i promised to make a note of it  her father apoplectic old idiotmake him comic damme sir by gad all that sort of thing  by persuading him that i understood what he meant i rose in his estimation  he wont have anything to say to methinks im an ass im a simple sort of fellowon the outside but im not such a fool as i look  you dont think we are getting too much out of the groove i enquired  his opinion was that the more so the better  very well then in the second act i disguise myself ill come on as an organgrinder sing a song in broken english then as a policeman or a young swell about town give me plenty of opportunity thats the great thingopportunity to be really funny i mean we dont want any of the old stale tricks  i promised him my support  put a little pathos in it he added give me a scene where i can show them ive something else in me besides merely humour we dont want to make them howl but just to feel a little lets send them out of the theatre saying well charlies often made me laugh but im damned if i knew he could make me cry before see what i mean  i told him i thought i did  the leading lady meeting us on our return requested with pretty tone of authority everybody else to go away and leave us there were cries of naughty the leading lady laughing girlishly took me by the hand and ran away with me  i want to talk to you said the leading lady as soon as we had reached a secluded seat overlooking the river about my part in the new opera now cant you give me something original do  her pleading was so pretty there was nothing for it but to pledge compliance  i am so tired of being the simple village maiden said the leading lady what i want is a part with some opportunity in ita coquettish part i can flirt assured me the leading lady archly try me  i satisfied her of my perfect faith  you might said the leading lady see your way to making the plot depend upon me it always seems to me that the womans part is never made enough of in comic opera i am sure a comic opera built round a woman would be a really great success dont you agree with me mr kelver pouted the leading lady laying her pretty hand on mine we are much more interesting than the mennow arent we  personally as i told her i agreed with her  the tenor sipping tea with me on the balcony beckoned me aside  about this new opera said the tenor doesnt it seem to you the time has come to make more of the storythat the public might prefer a little more human interest and a little less clowning  i admitted that a good plot was essential  it seems to me said the tenor that if you could write an opera round an interesting love story you would score a success of course let there be plenty of humour but reduce it to its proper place as a support it is excellent when it is made the entire structure it is apt to be tiresomeat least that is my view  i replied with sincerity that there seemed to me much truth in what he said  of course so far as i am personally concerned went on the tenor it is immaterial i draw the same salary whether im on the stage five minutes or an hour but when you have a man of my position in the cast and give him next to nothing to dowell the public are disappointed  most naturally i commented  the lover whispered the tenor noticing the careless approach towards us of the low comedian thats the character they are thinking about all the timemen and women both its human nature make your lover interestingthats the secret  waiting for the horses to be put to i became aware of the fact that i was standing some distance from the others in company with a tall thin somewhat oldishlooking man he spoke in low hurried tones fearful evidently of being overheard and interrupted  youll forgive me mr kelver he saidtrevor marmaduke trevor i play the duke of bayswater in the second act  i was unable to recall him for the moment there were quite a number of small parts in the second act but glancing into his sensitive face i shrank from wounding him  a capital performance i lied it has always amused me  he flushed with pleasure i made a great success some years ago he said in america with a sodawater syphon and it occurred to me that if you could mr kelver in a natural sort of way drop in a small part leading up to a little business with a sodawater syphon it might help the piece  i wrote him his sodawater scene i am glad to remember and insisted upon it in spite of a good deal of opposition some of the critics found fault with the incident as lacking in originality but marmaduke trevor was quite right it did help a little  our return journey was an exaggerated repetition of our morning drive our low comedian produced hideous noises from the horn and entered into contests of running wit with bus driversa decided mistake from his point of view the score generally remaining with the bus driver at hammersmith seizing the opportunity of a block in the traffic he assumed the role of cheap jack and standing up on the back seat offered all our hats for sale at temptingly low prices  got any ideas out of them asked hodgson when the time came for us to say goodnight  im thinking if you dont mind i answered of going down into the country and writing the piece quietly away from everybody  perhaps you are right agreed hodgson too many cooksbe sure and have it ready for the autumn  i wrote it with some pleasure to myself amid the yorkshire wolds and was able to read it to the whole company assembled before the close of the season my turning of the last page was followed by a dead silence the leading lady was the first to speak she asked if the clock upon the mantelpiece could be relied upon because if so by leaving at once she could just catch her train hodgson consulting his watch thought if anything it was a little fast the leading lady said she hoped it was and went the only comforting words were spoken by the tenor he recalled to our mind a successful comic opera produced some years before at the philharmonic he distinctly remembered that up to five minutes before the raising of the curtain everybody had regarded it as rubbish he also had a train to catch marmaduke trevor with a covert shake of the hand urged me not to despair the low comedian the last to go told hodgson he thought he might be able to do something with parts of it if given a free hand hodgson and i left alone looked at each other  its no good said hodgson from a boxoffice point of view very clever  how do you know it is no good from a boxoffice point of view i ventured to enquire  i never made a mistake in my life replied hodgson  you have produced one or two failures i reminded him  and shall again he laughed the right thing isnt easy to get  cheer up he added kindly this is only your first attempt we must try and knock it into shape at rehearsal  their notion of knocking it into shape was knocking it to pieces  ill tell you what well do would say the low comedian well cut that scene out altogether joyously he would draw his pencil through some four or five pages of my manuscript  but it is essential to the story i would argue  not at all  but it is it is the scene in which roderick escapes from prison and falls in love with the gipsy  my dear boy halfadozen words will do all that i meet roderick at the ball hallo what are you doing here oh i have escaped from prison good business and hows miriam well and happyshe is going to be my wife what more do you want  i have been speaking to mr hodgson would observe the leading lady and he agrees with me that if instead of falling in love with peter i fell in love with john  but john is in love with arabella  oh weve cut out arabella i can sing all her songs  the tenor would lead me into a corner i want you to write in a little scene for myself and miss duncan at the beginning of the first act ill talk to her about it i think it will be rather pretty i want herthe second time i see herto have come out of her room on to a balcony and to be standing there bathed in moonlight  but the first act takes place in the early morning  ive thought of that we must alter it to the evening  but the opera opens with a hunting scene people dont go hunting by moonlight  it will be a novelty thats whats wanted for comic opera the ordinary hunting scene my dear boy it has been done to death  i stood this sort of thing for a week they are people of experience i argued to myself they must know more about it than i do by the end of the week i had arrived at the conclusion that anyhow they didnt added to which i lost my temper it is a thing i should advise any lady or gentleman thinking of entering the ranks or dramatic authorship to lose as soon as possible i took both manuscripts with me and entering mr hodgsons private room closed the door behind me one parcel was the opera as i had originally written it a neat intelligible manuscript whatever its other merits the second scored interlined altered cut interleaved rewritten reversed turned inside out and topsyturvyone long hopeless confusion from beginning to endwas the opera as everybody helping we had knocked it into shape  thats your opera i said pushing across to him the bulkier bundle if you can understand it if you can make head or tail of it if you care to produce it it is yours and you are welcome to it this is mine i laid it on the table beside the other it may be good it may be bad if it is played at all it is played as it is written regard the contract as cancelled and make up your mind  he argued with force and he argued with eloquence he appealed to my selfinterest he appealed to my better nature it occupied him forty minutes by the clock then he called me an obstinate young fool flung the opera as knocked into shape into the wastepaper basketwhich was the only proper place for it and striding into the middle of the company gave curt directions that the damned opera was to be played as it was written and be damned to it  the company shrugged its shoulders and for the next month kept them shrugged for awhile hodgson remained away from the rehearsals then returning developed by degrees a melancholy interest in the somewhat gloomy proceedings  so far i had won but my difficulty was to maintain the position the low comedian reciting his lines with meaningless monotony would pause occasionally to ask of me politely whether this or that passage was intended to be serious or funny  you think the leading lady would enquire more in sorrow than in anger that any girl would behave in this wayany real girl i mean  perhaps the audience will understand it would console himself hopefully the tenor myself i confess i dont  with a sinking heart concealed beneath an aggressively disagreeable manner i remained firm in my pigheaded conceit as it was regarded hodgson generously supporting me against his own judgment  its bound to be a failure he told me i am spending some twelve to fifteen hundred pounds to teach you a lesson when you have learnt it well square accounts by your writing me an opera that will pay  and if it does succeed i suggested  my dear boy replied hodgson i never make mistakes  from all which a dramatic author of more experience would have gathered cheerfulness and hope knowing that the time to be depressed is when the manager and company unanimously and unhesitatingly predict a six months run but new to the business i regarded my literary career as already at an end belief in oneself is merely the match with which one lights oneself the oil is supplied by the belief in one of others if that be not forthcoming one goes out later on i might try to light myself again but for the present i felt myself dark and dismal my desire was to get away from my own smoke and smell the final dress rehearsal over i took my leave of all concerned the next morning i would pack a knapsack and start upon a walking tour through holland the english papers would not reach me no human being should know my address in a month or so i would return the piece would have disappearedwould be forgotten with courage i might be able to forget it myself  i shall run it for three weeks said hodgson then well withdraw it quietly owing to previous arrangements or duncan can suddenly fall illshes done it often enough to suit herself she can do it this once to suit me dont be upset theres nothing to be ashamed of in the piece indeed there is a good deal that will be praised the idea is distinctly original as a matter of fact thats the fault with it added hodgson its too original  you said you wanted it original i reminded him  he laughed yes but original for the stage i meantthe old dolls in new frocks  i thanked him for all his kindness and went home and packed my knapsack  for two months i wandered avoiding beaten tracks my only comrades a few books belonging to no age no country my worries fell from me the personal affairs of paul kelver ceasing to appear the be all and the end all of the universe but for a chance meeting with wellbourne deleglises amateur caretaker of gower street fame i should have delayed yet longer my return it was in one of the dead cities of the zuyder zee i was sitting under the lindens on the grassgrown quay awaiting a slow crawling boat that four miles off i watched a moving speck across the level pastures i heard his footsteps in the empty marketplace behind me and turned my head i did not rise felt even no astonishment anything might come to pass in that still land of dreams he seated himself beside me with a nod and for awhile we smoked in silence  all well with you i asked  i am afraid not he answered the poor fellow is in great trouble  im not wellbourne himself he went on in answer to my look i am only his spirit have you ever tested that belief the hindoos hold that a man may leave his body wander at will for a certain period remembering only to return ere the thread connecting him with flesh and blood be stretched to breaking point it is quite correct i often lock the door of my lodging leave myself behind wander a free spirit  he pulled from his pocket a handful of loose coins and looked at them the thread that connects us i am sorrow to say is wearing somewhat thin he sighed i shall have to be getting back to him before longconcern myself again with his troubles follies it is somewhat vexing life is really beautiful when one is dead  what was the trouble i enquired  havent you heard he replied tom died five weeks ago quite suddenly of syncope we had none of us any idea  so norah was alone in the world i rose to my feet the slowly moving speck had grown into a thin dark streak minute by minute it took shape and form  by the way i have to congratulate you said wellbourne your opera looked like being a big thing when i left london you didnt sell outright i hope  no i answered hodgson never expressed any desire to buy  lucky for you said wellbourne  i reached london the next evening passing the theatre on my way to queens square it occurred to me to stop my cab for a few minutes and look in  i met the low comedian on his way to his dressingroom he shook me warmly by the hand  well he said were pulling them in i was right you see give me plenty of opportunity thats what i told you didnt i come and see the piece i think you will agree with me that i have done you justice  i thanked him  not at all he returned its a pleasure to work when youve got something good to work on  i paid my respects to the leading lady  i am so grateful to you said the leading lady it is so delightful to play a real live woman for a change  the tenor was quite fatherly  it is what i have been telling hodgson for years he said give them a simple human story  crossing the stage i ran against marmaduke trevor  you will stay for my scene he urged  another night i answered i have only just returned  he sank his voice to a whisper i want to talk to you on business when you have the time i am thinking of taking a theatre myselfnot just now but later on of course i dont want it to get about  i assured him of my secrecy  if it comes off i want you to write for me you understand the public we will talk it over  he passed onward with stealthy tread  i found hodgson in the front of the house  two stalls not sold and six seats in the upper circle he informed me not bad for a thursday night  i expressed my gratification  i knew you could do it said hodgson i felt sure of it merely from seeing that comedietta of yours at the queens i never make a mistake  correction under the circumstances would have been unkind promising to see him again in the morning i left him with his customary good conceit of himself unimpaired and went on to the square i rang twice but there was no response i was about to sound a third and final summons when norah joined me on the step she had been out shopping and was laden with parcels  we must wait to shake hands she laughed as she opened the door i hope you have not been kept long poor annette grows deafer every day  have you nobody in the house with you but annette i asked  no one you know it was a whim of his i used to get quite cross with him at times but i should not like to go against his wishesnow  was there any reason for it i asked  no she answered if there had been i could have argued him out of it she paused at the door of the studio ill just get rid of these she said and then i will be with you  a wood fire was burning on the open hearth flashing alternate beams of light and shadow down the long bare room the high oak stool stood in its usual place beside the engraving desk upon which lay old deleglises last unfinished plate emitting a dull red glow i paced the creaking boards with halting steps as through some ghostly gallery hung with dim portraits of the dead and living in a little while norah entered and came to me with outstretched hand  we will not light the lamp she said the firelight is so pleasant  but i want to see you i replied  she had seated herself upon the broad stone kerb with her hand she stirred the logs they shot into a clear white flame thus the light upon her face she raised it gravely towards mine it spoke to me with fuller voice the clear grey eyes were frank and steadfast as ever but shadow had passed into them deepening them illuminating them  for a space we talked of our two selves our trivial plans and doings  tom left something to you said norah rising not in his will that was only a few lines he told me to give it to you with his love  she brought it to me it was the picture he had always treasured his first success a child looking on death the riddle he had named it  we spoke of him of his work which since had come to be appraised at truer value for it was out of fashion while he lived  was he a disappointed man do you think i asked  no answered norah i am sure not he was too fond of his work  but he dreamt of becoming a second millet he confessed it to me once and he died an engraver  but they were good engravings smiled norah  i remember a favourite saying of his continued norah after a pause i do not know whether it was original or not the stars guide us they are not our goal  ah yes we aim at the moon andhit the currant bush  it is necessary always to allow for deflection laughed norah apparently it takes a wouldbe poet to write a successful comic opera  ah you do not understand i cried it was not mere ambition cap and bells or laurel wreath that is small matter i wanted to help the worlds cry of pain i used to hear it as a boy i hear it yet i meant to help they that are heavy laden i hear their cry they cry from dawn to dawn and none heed them we pass upon the other side man and woman child and beast i hear their dumb cry in the night the childs sob in the silence the mans fierce curse of wrong the dog beneath the vivisectors knife the overdriven brute the creature tortured for an hour that a gourmet may enjoy an instants pleasure they cried to me the wrong and the sorrow and the pain the long low endless moan gods ears are weary of i hear it day and night i thought to help  i had risen she took my face between her quiet cool hands  what do we know we see but a corner of the scheme this fortress of laughter that a few of you have been set apart to guardthis rallyingpoint for all the forces of joy and gladness how do you know it may not be the key to the whole battle it is far removed from the grand charges and you think yourself forgotten trust your leader be true to your post  i looked into her sweet grey eyes  you always help me i said  do i she answered i am so glad  she put her firm white hand in mine
