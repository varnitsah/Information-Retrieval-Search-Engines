72815722	the history of samuel titmarsh and the the great hoggarty diamond   london john murray albemarle street w 1911     chapter i   gives an account of our village and the first glimpse of the diamond  when i came up to town for my second year my aunt hoggarty made me a present of a diamondpin that is to say it was not a diamondpin then but a large oldfashioned locket of dublin manufacture in the year 1795 which the late mr hoggarty used to sport at the lord lieutenants balls and elsewhere  he wore it he said at the battle of vinegar hill when his club pigtail saved his head from being taken offbut that is neither here nor there  in the middle of the brooch was hoggarty in the scarlet uniform of the corps of fencibles to which he belonged around it were thirteen locks of hair belonging to a bakers dozen of sisters that the old gentleman had and as all these little ringlets partook of the family hue of brilliant auburn hoggartys portrait seemed to the fanciful view like a great fat red round of beef surrounded by thirteen carrots  these were dished up on a plate of blue enamel and it was from the great hoggarty diamond as we called it in the family that the collection of hairs in question seemed as it were to spring  my aunt i need not say is rich and i thought i might be her heir as well as another  during my months holiday she was particularly pleased with me made me drink tea with her often though there was a certain person in the village with whom on those golden summer evenings i should have liked to have taken a stroll in the hayfields promised every time i drank her bohea to do something handsome for me when i went back to townnay three or four times had me to dinner at three and to whist or cribbage afterwards  i did not care for the cards for though we always played seven hours on a stretch and i always lost my losings were never more than nineteenpence a night but there was some infernal sour blackcurrant wine that the old lady always produced at dinner and with the tray at ten oclock and which i dared not refuse though upon my word and honour it made me very unwell  well i thought after all this obsequiousness on my part and my aunts repeated promises that the old lady would at least make me a present of a score of guineas of which she had a power in the drawer and so convinced was i that some such present was intended for me that a young lady by the name of miss mary smith with whom i had conversed on the subject actually netted me a little green silk purse which she gave me behind hickss hayrick as you turn to the right up churchyard lanewhich she gave me i say wrapped up in a bit of silver paper there was something in the purse too if the truth must be known  first there was a thick curl of the glossiest blackest hair you ever saw in your life and next there was threepence that is to say the half of a silver sixpence hanging by a little necklace of blue riband  ah but i knew where the other half of the sixpence was and envied that happy bit of silver  the last day of my holiday i was obliged of course to devote to mrs hoggarty  my aunt was excessively gracious and by way of a treat brought out a couple of bottles of the black currant of which she made me drink the greater part  at night when all the ladies assembled at her party had gone off with their pattens and their maids mrs hoggarty who had made a signal to me to stay first blew out three of the wax candles in the drawingroom and taking the fourth in her hand went and unlocked her escritoire  i can tell you my heart beat though i pretended to look quite unconcerned  sam my dear said she as she was fumbling with her keys take another glass of rosolio that was the name by which she baptised the cursed beverage it will do you good  i took it and you might have seen my hand tremble as the bottle went clickclick against the glass  by the time i had swallowed it the old lady had finished her operations at the bureau and was coming towards me the waxcandle bobbing in one hand and a large parcel in the other  nows the time thought i  samuel my dear nephew said she your first name you received from your sainted uncle my blessed husband and of all my nephews and nieces you are the one whose conduct in life has most pleased me  when you consider that my aunt herself was one of seven married sisters that all the hoggarties were married in ireland and mothers of numerous children i must say that the compliment my aunt paid me was a very handsome one  dear aunt says i in a slow agitated voice i have often heard you say there were seventythree of us in all and believe me i do think your high opinion of me very complimentary indeed im unworthy of itindeed i am  as for those odious irish people says my aunt rather sharply dont speak of them i hate them and every one of their mothers the fact is there had been a lawsuit about hoggartys property but of all my other kindred you samuel have been the most dutiful and affectionate to me your employers in london give the best accounts of your regularity and good conduct  though you have had eighty pounds a year a liberal salary you have not spent a shilling more than your income as other young men would and you have devoted your months holidays to your old aunt who i assure you is grateful  oh maam said i  it was all that i could utter  samuel continued she i promised you a present and here it is  i first thought of giving you money but you are a regular lad and dont want it  you are above money dear samuel  i give you what i value most in lifethe pthe po the poortrait of my sainted hoggarty tears set in the locket which contains the valuable diamond that you have often heard me speak of  wear it dear sam for my sake and think of that angel in heaven and of your dear aunt susy  she put the machine into my hands it was about the size of the lid of a shavingbox and i should as soon have thought of wearing it as of wearing a cockedhat and pigtail  i was so disgusted and disappointed that i really could not get out a single word  when i recovered my presence of mind a little i took the locket out of the bit of paper the locket indeed it was as big as a barndoor padlock and slowly put it into my shirt  thank you aunt said i with admirable raillery  i shall always value this present for the sake of you who gave it me and it will recall to me my uncle and my thirteen aunts in ireland  i dont want you to wear it in that way shrieked mrs hoggarty with the hair of those odious carroty women  you must have their hair removed  then the locket will be spoiled aunt  well sir never mind the locket have it set afresh  or suppose said i i put aside the setting altogether it is a little too large for the present fashion and have the portrait of my uncle framed and placed over my chimneypiece next to yours  its a sweet miniature  that miniature said mrs hoggarty solemnly was the great mulcahys chefdoeuvre pronounced shy dewver a favourite word of my aunts being with the words bongtong and ally mode de parry the extent of her french vocabulary  you know the dreadful story of that poor poor artist  when he had finished that wonderful likeness for the late mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty county mayo she wore it in her bosom at the lord lieutenants ball where she played a game of piquet with the commanderinchief  what could have made her put the hair of her vulgar daughters round micks portrait i cant think but so it was as you see it this day  madam says the commanderinchief if that is not my friend mick hoggarty im a dutchman  those were his lordships very words  mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty took off the brooch and showed it to him  who is the artist says my lord  its the most wonderful likeness i ever saw in my life  mulcahy says she of ormonds quay  begad i patronise him says my lord but presently his face darkened and he gave back the picture with a dissatisfied air  there is one fault in that portrait said his lordship who was a rigid disciplinarian and i wonder that my friend mick as a military man should have overlooked it  whats that says mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty  madam he has been painted without his swordbelt  and he took up the cards again in a passion and finished the game without saying a single word  the news was carried to mr mulcahy the next day and that unfortunate artist went mad immediately  he had set his whole reputation upon this miniature and declared that it should be faultless  such was the effect of the announcement upon his susceptible heart  when mrs hoggarty died your uncle took the portrait and always wore it himself  his sisters said it was for the sake of the diamond whereas ungrateful things it was merely on account of their hair and his love for the fine arts  as for the poor artist my dear some people said it was the profuse use of spirit that brought on delirium tremens but i dont believe it  take another glass of rosolio  the telling of this story always put my aunt into great goodhumour and she promised at the end of it to pay for the new setting of the diamond desiring me to take it on my arrival in london to the great jeweller mr polonius and send her the bill  the fact is said she that the gold in which the thing is set is worth five guineas at the very least and you can have the diamond reset for two  however keep the remainder dear sam and buy yourself what you please with it  with this the old lady bade me adieu  the clock was striking twelve as i walked down the village for the story of mulcahy always took an hour in the telling and i went away not quite so downhearted as when the present was first made to me  after all thought i a diamondpin is a handsome thing and will give me a distingue air though my clothes be never so shabbyand shabby they were without any doubt  well i said three guineas which i shall have over will buy me a couple of pairs of whatdyecallems of which entre nous i was in great want having just then done growing whereas my pantaloons were made a good eighteen months before  well i walked down the village my hands in my breeches pockets i had poor marys purse there having removed the little things which she gave me the day before and placed themnever mind where but look you in those days i had a heart and a warm one too  i had marys purse ready for my aunts donation which never came and with my own little stock of money besides that mrs hoggartys card parties had lessened by a good fiveandtwenty shillings i calculated that after paying my fare i should get to town with a couple of sevenshilling pieces in my pocket  i walked down the village at a deuce of a pace so quick that if the thing had been possible i should have overtaken ten oclock that had passed by me two hours ago when i was listening to mrs hs long stories over her terrible rosolio  the truth is at ten i had an appointment under a certain persons window who was to have been looking at the moon at that hour with her pretty quilled nightcap on and her blessed hair in papers  there was the window shut and not so much as a candle in it and though i hemmed and hawed and whistled over the garden paling and sang a song of which somebody was very fond and even threw a pebble at the window which hit it exactly at the opening of the latticei woke no one except a great brute of a housedog that yelled and howled and bounced so at me over the rails that i thought every moment he would have had my nose between his teeth  so i was obliged to go off as quickly as might be and the next morning mamma and my sisters made breakfast for me at four and at five came the true blue light sixinside postcoach to london and i got up on the roof without having seen mary smith  as we passed the house it did seem as if the window curtain in her room was drawn aside just a little bit  certainly the window was open and it had been shut the night before but away went the coach and the village cottage and the churchyard and hickss hayricks were soon out of sight        my hi what a pin said a stableboy who was smoking a cigar to the guard looking at me and putting his finger to his nose  the fact is that i had never undressed since my aunts party and being uneasy in mind and having all my clothes to pack up and thinking of something else had quite forgotten mrs hoggartys brooch which i had stuck into my shirtfrill the night before     chapter ii   tells how the diamond is brought up to london and produces wonderful effects both in the city and at the west end  the circumstances recorded in this story took place some score of years ago when as the reader may remember there was a great mania in the city of london for establishing companies of all sorts by which many people made pretty fortunes  i was at this period as the truth must be known thirteenth clerk of twentyfour young gents who did the immense business of the independent west diddlesex fire and life insurance company at their splendid stone mansion in cornhill  mamma had sunk a sum of four hundred pounds in the purchase of an annuity at this office which paid her no less than six andthirty pounds a year when no other company in london would give her more than twentyfour  the chairman of the directors was the great mr brough of the house of brough and hoff crutched friars turkey merchants  it was a new house but did a tremendous business in the fig and sponge way and more in the zante currant line than any other firm in the city  brough was a great man among the dissenting connection and you saw his name for hundreds at the head of every charitable society patronised by those good people  he had nine clerks residing at his office in crutched friars he would not take one without a certificate from the schoolmaster and clergyman of his native place strongly vouching for his morals and doctrine and the places were so run after that he got a premium of four or five hundred pounds with each young gent whom he made to slave for ten hours a day and to whom in compensation he taught all the mysteries of the turkish business  he was a great man on change too and our young chaps used to hear from the stockbrokers clerks we commonly dined together at the cock and woolpack a respectable house where you get a capital cut of meat bread vegetables cheese half a pint of porter and a penny to the waiter for a shillingthe young stockbrokers used to tell us of immense bargains in spanish greek and columbians that brough made  hoff had nothing to do with them but stopped at home minding exclusively the business of the house  he was a young chap very quiet and steady of the quaker persuasion and had been taken into partnership by brough for a matter of thirty thousand pounds and a very good bargain too  i was told in the strictest confidence that the house one year with another divided a good seven thousand pounds of which brough had half hoff twosixths and the other sixth went to old tudlow who had been mr broughs clerk before the new partnership began  tudlow always went about very shabby and we thought him an old miser  one of our gents bob swinney by name used to say that tudlows share was all nonsense and that brough had it all but bob was always too knowing by half used to wear a green cutaway coat and had his free admission to covent garden theatre  he was always talking down at the shop as we called it it wasnt a shop but as splendid an office as any in cornhillhe was always talking about vestris and miss tree and singing     the bramble the bramble    the jolly jolly bramble  one of charles kembles famous songs in maid marian a play that was all the rage then taken from a famous storybook by one peacock a clerk in the india house and a precious good place he has too  when brough heard how master swinney abused him and had his admission to the theatre he came one day down to the office where we all were four andtwenty of us and made one of the most beautiful speeches i ever heard in my life  he said that for slander he did not care contumely was the lot of every public man who had austere principles of his own and acted by them austerely but what he did care for was the character of every single gentleman forming a part of the independent west diddlesex association  the welfare of thousands was in their keeping millions of money were daily passing through their hands the citythe country looked upon them for order honesty and good example  and if he found amongst those whom he considered as his childrenthose whom he loved as his own flesh and bloodthat that order was departed from that that regularity was not maintained that that good example was not kept up mr b always spoke in this emphatic wayif he found his children departing from the wholesome rules of morality religion and decorumif he found in high or lowin the head clerk at six hundred a year down to the porter who cleaned the stepsif he found the slightest taint of dissipation he would cast the offender from himyea though he were his own son he would cast him from him  as he spoke this mr brough burst into tears and we who didnt know what was coming looked at each other as pale as parsnips all except swinney who was twelfth clerk and made believe to whistle  when mr b had wiped his eyes and recovered himself he turned round and oh how my heart thumped as he looked me full in the face  how it was relieved though when he shouted out in a thundering voice  mr robert swinney  sir to you says swinney as cool as possible and some of the chaps began to titter  mr swinney roared brough in a voice still bigger than before when you came into this officethis family sir for such it is as i am proud to sayyou found threeandtwenty as pious and wellregulated young men as ever laboured togetheras ever had confided to them the wealth of this mighty capital and famous empire  you found sir sobriety regularity and decorum no profane songs were uttered in this place sacred toto business no slanders were whispered against the heads of the establishmentbut over them i pass i can afford sir to pass them byno worldly conversation or foul jesting disturbed the attention of these gentlemen or desecrated the peaceful scene of their labours  you found christians and gentlemen sir  i paid for my place like the rest said swinney  didnt my governor take sha  silence sir  your worthy father did take shares in this establishment which will yield him one day an immense profit  he did take shares sir or you never would have been here  i glory in saying that every one of my young friends around me has a father a brother a dear relative or friend who is connected in a similar way with our glorious enterprise and that not one of them is there but has an interest in procuring at a liberal commission other persons to join the ranks of our association but sir i am its chief  you will find sir your appointment signed by me and in like manner i john brough annul it  go from us sirleave usquit a family that can no longer receive you in its bosom  mr swinney i have wepti have prayed sir before i came to this determination i have taken counsel sir and am resolved  depart from out of us  not without three months salary though mr b that cock wont fight  they shall be paid to your father sir  my father be hanged  i tell you what brough im of age and if you dont pay me my salary ill arrest youby jingo i will  ill have you in quod or my names not bob swinney  make out a cheque mr roundhand for the three months salary of this perverted young man  twentyone pun five roundhand and nothing for the stamp cried out that audacious swinney  there it is sir receipted  you neednt cross it to my bankers  and if any of you gents like a glass of punch this evening at eight oclock bob swinneys your man and nothing to pay  if mr brough would do me the honour to come in and take a whack come dont say no if youd rather not  we couldnt stand this impudence and all burst out laughing like mad  leave the room yelled mr brough whose face had turned quite blue and so bob took his white hat off the peg and strolled away with his tile as he called it very much on one side  when he was gone mr brough gave us another lecture by which we all determined to profit and going up to roundhands desk put his arm round his neck and looked over the ledger  what money has been paid in today roundhand he said in a very kind way  the widow sir came with her money nine hundred and four ten and sixsay 904l 10s 6d  captain sparr sir paid his shares up grumbles though and says hes no more fifty shares two instalmentsthree fifties sir  hes always grumbling  he says he has not a shilling to bless himself with until our dividend day  any more  mr roundhand went through the book and made it up nineteen hundred pounds in all  we were doing a famous business now though when i came into the office we used to sit and laugh and joke and read the newspapers all day bustling into our seats whenever a stray customer came  brough never cared about our laughing and singing then and was hand and glove with bob swinney but that was in early times before we were well in harness  nineteen hundred pounds and a thousand pounds in shares  bravo roundhandbravo gentlemen  remember every share you bring in brings you five per cent down on the nail  look to your friendsstick to your desksbe regulari hope none of you forget church  who takes mr swinneys place  mr samuel titmarsh sir  mr titmarsh i congratulate you  give me your hand sir you are now twelfth clerk of this association and your salary is consequently increased five pounds a year  how is your worthy mother siryour dear and excellent parent  in good health i trust  and longlong i fervently pray may this office continue to pay her annuity  remember if she has more money to lay out there is higher interest than the last for her for she is a year older and five per cent for you my boy  why not you as well as another  young men will be young men and a tenpound note does no harm  does it mr abednego  oh no says abednego who was third clerk and who was the chap that informed against swinney and he began to laugh as indeed we all did whenever mr brough made anything like a joke not that they were jokes only we used to know it by his face  oh bythebye roundhand says he a word with you on business  mrs brough wants to know why the deuce you never come down to fulham  law thats very polite said mr roundhand quite pleased  name your day my boy  say saturday and bring your nightcap with you  youre very polite im sure  i should be delighted beyond anything but  butno buts my boy  hark ye the chancellor of the exchequer does me the honour to dine with us and i want you to see him for the truth is i have bragged about you to his lordship as the best actuary in the three kingdoms  roundhand could not refuse such an invitation as that though he had told us how mrs r and he were going to pass saturday and sunday at putney and we who knew what a life the poor fellow led were sure that the head clerk would be prettily scolded by his lady when she heard what was going on  she disliked mrs brough very much that was the fact because mrs b kept a carriage and said she didnt know where pentonville was and couldnt call on mrs roundhand  though to be sure her coachman might have found out the way  and oh roundhand continued our governor draw a cheque for seven hundred will you  come dont stare man im not going to run away thats rightseven hundredand ninety say while youre about it  our board meets on saturday and never fear ill account for it to them before i drive you down  we shall take up the chancellor at whitehall  so saying mr brough folded up the cheque and shaking hands with mr roundhand very cordially got into his carriageandfour he always drove four horses even in the city where its so difficult which was waiting at the officedoor for him  bob swinney used to say that he charged two of the horses to the company but there was never believing half of what that bob said he used to laugh and joke so  i dont know how it was but i and a gent by the name of hoskins eleventh clerk who lived together with me in salisbury square fleet streetwhere we occupied a very genteel twopairfound our flute duet rather tiresome that evening and as it was a very fine night strolled out for a walk west end way  when we arrived opposite covent garden theatre we found ourselves close to the globe tavern and recollected bob swinneys hospitable invitation  we never fancied that he had meant the invitation in earnest but thought we might as well look in at any rate there could be no harm in doing so  there to be sure in the back drawingroom where he said he would be we found bob at the head of a table and in the midst of a great smoke of cigars and eighteen of our gents rattling and banging away at the table with the bottoms of their glasses  what a shout they made as we came in  hurray says bob heres two more  two more chairs mary two more tumblers two more hot waters and two more goes of gin  who would have thought of seeing tit in the name of goodness  why said i we only came in by the merest chance  at this word there was another tremendous roar and it is a positive fact that every man of the eighteen had said he came by chance  however chance gave us a very jovial night and that hospitable bob swinney paid every shilling of the score  gentlemen says he as he paid the bill ill give you the health of john brough esquire and thanks to him for the present of 21l 5s which he made me this morning  what do i say21l 5s  that and a months salary that i should have had to payforfeitdown on the nail by jingo for leaving the shop as i intended to do tomorrow morning ive got a placea tiptop place i tell you  five guineas a week six journeys a year my own horse and gig and to travel in the west of england in oil and spermaceti  heres confusion to gas and the health of messrs gann and co of thames street in the city of london  i have been thus particular in my account of the west diddlesex insurance office and of mr brough the managing director though the real names are neither given to the office nor to the chairman as you may be sure because the fate of me and my diamond pin was mysteriously bound up with both as i am about to show  you must know that i was rather respected among our gents at the west diddlesex because i came of a better family than most of them had received a classical education and especially because i had a rich aunt mrs hoggarty about whom as must be confessed i used to boast a good deal  there is no harm in being respected in this world as i have found out and if you dont brag a little for yourself depend on it there is no person of your acquaintance who will tell the world of your merits and take the trouble off your hands  so that when i came back to the office after my visit at home and took my seat at the old daybook opposite the dingy window that looks into birchin lane i pretty soon let the fellows know that mrs hoggarty though she had not given me a large sum of money as i expectedindeed i had promised a dozen of them a treat down the river should the promised riches have come to mei let them know i say that though my aunt had not given me any money she had given me a splendid diamond worth at least thirty guineas and that some day i would sport it at the shop  oh lets see it says abednego whose father was a mockjewel and gold lace merchant in hanway yard and i promised that he should have a sight of it as soon as it was set  as my pocketmoney was run out too by coachhire to and from home five shillings to our maid at home ten to my aunts maid and man fiveandtwenty shillings lost at whist as i said and fifteenandsix paid for a silver scissors for the dear little fingers of somebody roundhand who was very goodnatured asked me to dine and advanced me 7l 1s 8d a months salary  it was at roundhands house myddelton square pentonville over a fillet of veal and bacon and a glass of port that i learned and saw how his wife ill treated him as i have told before  poor fellowwe underclerks all thought it was a fine thing to sit at a desk by oneself and have 50l per month as roundhand had but ive a notion that hoskins and i blowing duets on the flute together in our second floor in salisbury square were a great deal more at ease than our headand more in harmony too though we made sad work of the music certainly  one day gus hoskins and i asked leave from roundhand to be off at three oclock as we had particular business at the west end  he knew it was about the great hoggarty diamond and gave us permission so off we set when we reached st martins lane gus got a cigar to give himself as it were a distingue air and pulled at it all the way up the lane and through the alleys into coventry street where mr poloniuss shop is as everybody knows  the door was open and a number of carriages full of ladies were drawing up and setting down  gus kept his hands in his pocketstrousers were worn very full then with large tucks and pigeonholes for your boots or bluchers to come through the fashionables wore boots but we chaps in the city on 80l a year contented ourselves with bluchers and as gus stretched out his pantaloons as wide as he could from his hips and kept blowing away at his cheroot and clamping with the iron heels of his boots and had very large whiskers for so young a man he really looked quite the genteel thing and was taken by everybody to be a person of consideration  he would not come into the shop though but stood staring at the gold pots and kettles in the window outside  i went in and after a little hemming and hawingfor i had never been at such a fashionable place beforeasked one of the gentlemen to let me speak to mr polonius  what can i do for you sir says mr polonius who was standing close by as it happened serving three ladiesa very old one and two young ones who were examining pearl necklaces very attentively  sir said i producing my jewel out of my coatpocket this jewel has i believe been in your house before it belonged to my aunt mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty  the old lady standing near looked round as i spoke  i sold her a gold neckchain and repeating watch in the year 1795 said mr polonius who made it a point to recollect everything and a silver punchladle to the captain  how is the majorcolonelgeneraleh sir  the general said i i am sorry to saythough i was quite proud that this man of fashion should address me somr hoggarty isno more  my aunt has made me a present however of thisthis trinketwhich as you see contains her husbands portrait that i will thank you sir to preserve for me very carefully and she wishes that you would set this diamond neatly  neatly and handsomely of course sir  neatly in the present fashion and send down the account to her  there is a great deal of gold about the trinket for which of course you will make an allowance  to the last fraction of a sixpence says mr polonius bowing and looking at the jewel  its a wonderful piece of goods certainly said he though the diamonds a neat little bit certainly  do my lady look at it  the thing is of irish manufacture bears the stamp of 95 and will recall perhaps the times of your ladyships earliest youth  get ye out mr polonius said the old lady a little wizenfaced old lady with her face puckered up in a million of wrinkles  how dar you sir to talk such nonsense to an old woman like me  wasnt i fifty years old in 95 and a grandmother in 96  she put out a pair of withered trembling hands took up the locket examined it for a minute and then burst out laughing as i live its the great hoggarty diamond  good heavens what was this talisman that had come into my possession  look girls continued the old lady this is the great jewl of all ireland  this redfaced man in the middle is poor

sistersbiddy minny thedy widdy short for williamina freddy izzy tizzy mysie grizzy polly dolly nell and bellall married all ugly and all carrty hair  and of which are you the son young manthough to do you justice youre not like the family  two pretty young ladies turned two pretty pairs of black eyes at me and waited for an answer which they would have had only the old lady began rattling on a hundred stories about the thirteen ladies above named and all their lovers all their disappointments and all the duels of mick hoggarty  she was a chronicle of fiftyyearsold scandal  at last she was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing at the conclusion of which mr polonius very respectfully asked me where he should send the pin and whether i would like the hair kept  no says i never mind the hair  and the pin sir  i had felt ashamed about telling my address but bang it thought i why should i     a king can make a belted knight       a marquess duke and a that    an honest mans abune his might       gude faith he canna fa that  why need i care about telling these ladies where i live  sir says i have the goodness to send the parcel when done to mr titmarsh no 3 bell lane salisbury

carrage  give me your arm mr hwat and get inside and tell me all about your thirteen aunts  she seized on my elbow and hobbled through the shop as fast as possible the young ladies following her laughing  now jump in do you hear said she poking her sharp nose out of the window  i cant maam says i i have a friend  pooh pooh send um to the juice and jump in  and before almost i could say a word a great powdered fellow in yellowplush breeches pushed me up the steps and banged the door to  i looked just for one minute as the barouche drove away at hoskins and never shall forget his figure  there stood gus his mouth wide open his eyes staring a smoking cheroot in his hand wondering with all his might at the strange thing that had just happened to me  who is that titmarsh says gus theres a coronet on the carriage by jingo     chapter iii   how the possessor of the diamond is whisked into a magnificent chariot and has yet further good luck  i sat on the back seat of the carriage near a very nice young lady about my dear marys agethat is to say seventeen and threequarters and opposite us sat the old countess and her other granddaughterhandsome too but ten years older  i recollect i had on that day my blue coat and brass buttons nankeen trousers a white sprig waistcoat and one of dandos silk hats that had just come in in the year 22 and looked a great deal more glossy than the best beaver  and who was that hidjus mansterthat was the way her ladyship pronouncedthat ojous vulgar wretch with the iron heels to his boots and the big mouth and the imitation goold neckchain who steered at us so as we got into the carriage  how she should have known that guss chain was mosaic i cant tell but so it was and we had bought it for fiveandtwenty and sixpence only the week before at mphails in st pauls churchyard  but i did not like to hear my friend abused and so spoke out for him  maam says i that young gentlemans name is augustus hoskins  we live together and a better or more kindhearted fellow does not exist  you are quite right to stand up for your friends sir said the second lady whose name it appears was lady jane but whom the grandmamma called lady jene  well upon me conscience so he is now lady jene and i like spert in a young man  so his name is hoskins is it  i know my dears all the hoskinses in england  there are the lincolnshire hoskinses the shropshire hoskinses they say the admirals daughter bell was in love with a black footman or boatswain or some such thing but the worlds so censorious  theres old doctor hoskins of bath who attended poor dear drum in the quinsy and poor dear old fred hoskins the gouty general i remember him as thin as a lath in the year 84 and as active as a harlequin and in love with meoh how he was in love with me  you seem to have had a host of admirers in those days grandmamma said lady jane  hundreds my dearhundreds of thousands  i was the toast of bath and a great beauty too would you ever have thought it now upon your conscience and without flattery mrawhatdyecallim  indeed maam i never should i answered for the old lady was as ugly as possible and at my saying this the two young ladies began screaming with laughter and i saw the two greatwhiskered footmen grinning over the back of the carriage  upon my word youre mighty candid mr whatsyournamemighty candid indeed but i like candour in young people  but a beauty i was  just ask your friends uncle the general  hes one of the lincolnshire hoskinsesi knew he was by the strong family likeness  is he the eldest son  its a pretty property though sadly encumbered for old sir george was the divvle of a mana friend of hanbury williams and lyttleton and those horrid monstrous ojous people  how much will he have now mister when the admiral dies  why maam i cant say but the admiral is not my friends father  not his fatherbut he is i tell you and im never wrong  who is his father then  maam guss fathers a leatherseller in skinner street snow hilla very respectable house maam  but gus is only third son and so cant expect a great share in the property  the two young ladies smiled at thisthe old lady said hwat  i like you sir lady jane said for not being ashamed of your friends whatever their rank of life may be  shall we have the pleasure of setting you down anywhere mr titmarsh  noways particular my lady says i  we have a holiday at our office todayat least roundhand gave me and gus leave and i shall be very happy indeed to take a drive in the park if its no offence  im sure it will give usinfinite pleasure said lady jane though rather in a grave way  oh that it will says lady fanny clapping her hands wont it grandmamma  and after we have been in the park we can walk in kensington gardens if mr titmarsh will be good enough to accompany us  indeed fanny we will do no such thing says lady jane  indeed but we will though shrieked out lady drum  aint i dying to know everything about his uncle and thirteen aunts and youre all chattering so you young women that not a blessed syllable will you allow me or my young friend here to speak  lady jane gave a shrug with her shoulders and did not say a single word more  lady fanny who was as gay as a young kitten if i may be allowed so to speak of the aristocracy laughed and blushed and giggled and seemed quite to enjoy her sisters illhumour  and the countess began at once and entered into the history of the thirteen misses hoggarty which was not near finished when we entered the park  when there you cant think what hundreds of gents on horseback came to the carriage and talked to the ladies  they had their joke for lady drum who seemed to be a character in her way their bow for lady jane and the young ones especially their compliment for lady fanny  though she bowed and blushed as a young lady should lady fanny seemed to be thinking of something else for she kept her head out of the carriage looking eagerly among the horsemen as if she expected to see somebody  aha my lady fanny i knew what it meant when a young pretty lady like you was absent and on the lookout and only half answered the questions put to her  let alone sam titmarshhe knows what somebody means as well as another i warrant  as i saw these manoeuvres going on i could not help just giving a wink to lady jane as much as to say i knew what was what  i guess the young lady is looking for somebody says i  it was then her turn to look queer i assure you and she blushed as red as scarlet but after a minute the goodnatured little thing looked at her sister and both the young ladies put their handkerchiefs up to their faces and began laughinglaughing as if i had said the funniest thing in the world  il est charmant votre monsieur said lady jane to her grandmamma and on which i bowed and said madame vous me faites beaucoup dhonneur for i know the french language and was pleased to find that these good ladies had taken a liking to me  im a poor humble lad maam not used to london society and do really feel it quite kind of you to take me by the hand so and give me a drive in your fine carriage  at this minute a gentleman on a black horse with a pale face and a tuft to his chin came riding up to the carriage and i knew by a little start that lady fanny gave and by her instantly looking round the other way that somebody was come at last  lady drum said he your most devoted servant  i have just been riding with a gentleman who almost shot himself for love of the beautiful countess of drum in the yearnever mind the year  was it killblazes said the lady hes a dear old man and im quite ready to go off with him this minute  or was it that delight of an old bishop  hes got a lock of my hair nowi gave it him when he was papas chaplain and let me tell you it would be a hard matter to find another now in the same place  law my lady says i you dont say so  but indeed i do my good sir says she for between ourselves my heads as bare as a cannonballask fanny if it isnt  such a fright as the poor thing got when she was a babby and came upon me suddenly in my dressingroom without my wig  i hope lady fanny has recovered from the shock said somebody looking first at her and then at me as if he had a mind to swallow me and would you believe it all that lady fanny could say was pretty well i thank you my lord and she said this with as much fluttering and blushing as we used to say our virgil at schoolwhen we hadnt learned it  my lord still kept on looking very fiercely at me and muttered something about having hoped to find a seat in lady drums carriage as he was tired of riding on which lady fanny muttered something too about a friend of grandmammas  you should say a friend of yours fanny says lady jane i am sure we should never have come to the park if fanny had not insisted upon bringing mr titmarsh hither  let me introduce the earl of tiptoff to mr titmarsh  but instead of taking off his hat as i did mine his lordship growled out that he hoped for another opportunity and galloped off again on his black horse  why the deuce i should have offended him i never could understand  but it seemed as if i was destined to offend all the men that day for who should presently come up but the right honourable edmund preston one of his majestys secretaries of state as i know very well by the almanac in our office and the husband of lady jane  the right honourable edmund was riding a grey cob and was a fat pale faced man who looked as if he never went into the open air  who the devils that said he to his wife looking surlily both at me and her  oh its a friend of grandmammas and janes said lady fanny at once looking like a sly rogue as she was quite archly at her sisterwho in her turn appeared quite frightened and looked imploringly at her sister and never dared to breathe a syllable  yes indeed continued lady fanny mr titmarsh is a cousin of grandmammas by the mothers side by the hoggarty side  didnt you know the hoggarties when you were in ireland edmund with lord bagwig  let me introduce you to grandmammas cousin mr titmarsh mr titmarsh my brother mr edmund preston  there was lady jane all the time treading upon her sisters foot as hard as possible and the little wicked thing would take no notice and i who had never heard of the cousinship feeling as confounded as could be  but i did not know the countess of drum near so well as that sly minx her granddaughter did for the old lady who had just before called poor gus hoskins her cousin had it appeared the mania of fancying all the world related to her and said  yes were cousins and not very far removed  mick hoggartys grandmother was millicent brady and she and my aunt towzer were related as all the world knows for decimus brady of ballybrady married an own cousin of aunt towzers mother bell swiftthat was no relation of the deans my love who came but of a soso familyand isnt that clear  oh perfectly grandmamma said lady jane laughing while the right honourable gent still rode by us looking sour and surly  and sure you knew the hoggarties edmundthe thirteen redhaired girlsthe nine graces and four over as poor clanboy used to call them poor clana cousin of yours and mine mr titmarsh and sadly in love with me he was too  not remember them all now edmundnot remembernot remember biddy and minny and thedy and widdy and mysie and grizzy and polly and dolly and the rest  d the miss hoggarties maam said the right honourable gent and he said it with such energy that his grey horse gave a sudden lash out that well nigh sent him over his head  lady jane screamed lady fanny laughed old lady drum looked as if she did not care twopence and said serve you right for swearing you ojous man you  hadnt you better come into the carriage edmundmr preston cried out the lady anxiously  oh im sure ill slip out maam says i  poohpooh dont stir said lady drum its my carriage and if mr preston chooses to swear at a lady of my years in that ojous vulgar wayin that ojous vulgar way i repeati dont see why my friends should be inconvenienced for him  let him sit on the dicky if he likes or come in and ride bodkin  it was quite clear that my lady drum hated her grandsoninlaw heartily and ive remarked somehow in families that this kind of hatred is by no means uncommon  mr preston one of his majestys secretaries of state was to tell the truth in a great fright upon his horse and was glad to get away from the kicking plunging brute  his pale face looked still paler than before and his hands and legs trembled as he dismounted from the cob and gave the reins to his servant  i disliked the looks of the chapof the master i meanat the first moment he came up when he spoke rudely to that nice gentle wife of his and i thought he was a cowardly fellow as the adventure of the cob showed him to be  heaven bless you a baby could have ridden it and here was the man with his soul in his mouth at the very first kick  oh quick do come in edmund said lady fanny laughing and the carriage steps being let down and giving me a great scowl as he came in he was going to place himself in lady fannys corner i warrant you i wouldnt budge from mine when the little rogue cried out oh no by no means mr preston  shut the door thomas  and oh what fun it will be to show all the world a secretary of state riding bodkin  and pretty glum the secretary of state looked i assure you  take my place edmund and dont mind fannys folly said lady jane timidly  oh no  pray madam dont stir  im comfortable very comfortable and so i hope is this mrthis gentleman  perfectly i assure you says i  i was going to offer to ride your horse home for you as you seemed to be rather frightened at it but the fact was i was so comfortable here that really i couldnt move  such a grin as old lady drum gave when i said thathow her little eyes twinkled and her little sly mouth puckered up  i couldnt help speaking for look you my blood was up  we shall always be happy of your company cousin titmarsh says she and handed me a gold snuffbox out of which i took a pinch and sneezed with the air of a lord  as you have invited this gentleman into your carriage lady jane preston hadnt you better invite him home to dinner says mr preston quite blue with rage  i invited him into my carriage says the old lady and as we are going to dine at your house and you press it im sure i shall be very happy to see him there  im very sorry im engaged said i  oh indeed what a pity says right honourable ned still glowering at his wife  what a pity that this gentlemani forget his namethat your friend lady jane is engaged  i am sure you would have had such gratification in meeting your relation in whitehall  lady drum was overfond of finding out relations to be sure but this speech of right honourable neds was rather too much  now sam says i be a man and show your spirit  so i spoke up at once and said why ladies as the right honourable gent is so very pressing ill give up my engagement and shall have sincere pleasure in cutting mutton with him  whats your hour sir  he didnt condescend to answer and for me i did not care for you see i did not intend to dine with the man but only to give him a lesson of manners  for though i am but a poor fellow and hear people cry out how vulgar it is to eat peas with a knife or ask three times for cheese and such like points of ceremony theres something i think much more vulgar than all this and that is insolence to ones inferiors  i hate the chap that uses it as i scorn him of humble rank that affects to be of the fashion and so i determined to let mr preston know a piece of my mind  when the carriage drove up to his house i handed out the ladies as politely as possible and walked into the hall and then taking hold of mr prestons button at the door i said before the ladies and the two big servantsupon my word i didsir says i this kind old lady asked me into her carriage and i rode in it to please her not myself when you came up and asked who the devil i was i thought you might have put the question in a more polite manner but it wasnt my business to speak  when by way of a joke you invited me to dinner i thought i would answer in a joke too and here i am  but dont be frightened im not agoing to dine with you only if you play the same joke upon other partieson some of the chaps in our office for examplei recommend you to have a care or they will take you at your word  is that all sir says mr preston still in a rage  if you have done will you leave this house or shall my servants turn you out  turn out this fellow do you hear me and he broke away from me and flung into his study in a rage  hes an ojous horrid monsther of a man that husband of yours said lady drum seizing hold of her elder granddaughters arm and i hate him and so come away for the dinnerll be getting cold and she was for hurrying away lady jane without more ado  but that kind lady coming forward looking very pale and trembling said mr titmarsh i do hope youll not be angrythat is that youll forget what has happened for believe me it has given me very great  very great what i never could say for here the poor things eyes filled with tears and lady drum crying out tut tut none of this nonsense pulled her away by the sleeve and went upstairs  but little lady fanny walked boldly up to me and held me out her little hand and gave mine such a squeeze and said goodbye my dear mr titmarsh so very kindly that im blest if i did not blush up to the ears and all the blood in my body began to tingle  so when she was gone i clapped my hat on my head and walked out of the halldoor feeling as proud as a peacock and as brave as a lion and all i wished for was that one of those saucy grinning footmen should say or do something to me that was the least uncivil so that i might have the pleasure of knocking him down with my best compliments to his master but neither of them did me any such favour and i went away and dined at home off boiled mutton and turnips with gus hoskins quite peacefully  i did not think it was proper to tell gus who between ourselves is rather curious and inclined to tittletattle all the particulars of the family quarrel of which i had been the cause and witness and so just said that the old ladythey were the drum arms says gus for i went and looked them out that minute in the peeragethat the old lady turned out to be a cousin of mine and that she had taken me to drive in the park  next day we went to the office as usual when you may be sure that hoskins told everything of what had happened and a great deal more and somehow though i did not pretend to care sixpence about the matter i must confess that i was rather pleased that the gents in our office should hear of a part of my adventure  but fancy my surprise on coming home in the evening to find mrs stokes the landlady miss selina stokes her daughter and master bob stokes her son an idle young vagabond that was always playing marbles on st brides steps and in salisbury squarewhen i found them all bustling and tumbling up the steps before me to our rooms on the second floor and there on the table between our two flutes on one side my album guss don juan and peerage on the other i saw as follows  1  a basket of great red peaches looking like the cheeks of my dear mary smith  2  a ditto of large fat luscious heavylooking grapes  3  an enormous piece of raw mutton as i thought it was but mrs stokes said it was the primest haunch of venison that ever she saw  and three cardsviz  dowager countess of drum lady fanny rakes  mr preston lady jane preston  earl of tiptoff  sich a carriage says mrs stokes for that was the way the poor thing spoke  sich a carriageall over coronites sich liveriestwo great footmen with red whiskers and yellowplush smallclothes and inside a very old lady in a white poke bonnet and a young one with a great leghorn hat and blue ribands and a great tall pale gentleman with a tuft on his chin  pray madam does mr titmarsh live here says the young lady with her clear voice  yes my lady says i but hes at the officethe west diddlesex fire and life office cornhill  charles get out the things says the gentleman quite solemn  yes my lord says charles and brings me out the haunch in a newspaper and on the chany dish as you see it and the two baskets of fruit besides  have the kindness madam says my lord to take these things to mr titmarshs rooms with our with lady jane prestons compliments and request his acceptance of them and then he pulled out the cards on your table and this letter sealed with his lordships own crown  and herewith mrs stokes gave me a letter which my wife keeps to this day by the way and which runs thus     the earl of tiptoff has been commissioned by lady jane preston to    express her sincere regret and disappointment that she was not able    yesterday to enjoy the pleasure of mr titmarshs company  lady jane    is about to leave town immediately she will therefore be unable to    receive her friends in whitehall place this season  but lord tiptoff    trusts that mr titmarsh will have the kindness to accept some of the    produce of her ladyships garden and park with which perhaps he    will entertain some of those friends in whose favour he knows so well    how to speak  along with this was a little note containing the words lady drum at home  friday evening june 17  and all this came to me because my aunt hoggarty had given me a diamondpin  i did not send back the venison as why should i  gus was for sending it at once to brough our director and the grapes and peaches to my aunt in somersetshire  but no says i well ask bob swinney and halfadozen more of our gents and well have a merry night of it on saturday  and a merry night we had too and as we had no wine in the cupboard we had plenty of ale and ginpunch afterwards  and gus sat at the foot of the table and i at the head and we sang songs both comic and sentimental and drank toasts and i made a speech that there is no possibility of mentioning here because entre nous i had quite forgotten in the morning everything that had taken place after a certain period on the night before     chapter iv   how the happy diamondwearer dines at pentonville  i did not go to the office till halfanhour after opening time on monday  if the truth must be told i was not sorry to let hoskins have the start of me and tell the chaps what had taken placefor we all have our little vanities and i liked to be thought well of by my companions  when i came in i saw my business had been done by the way in which the chaps looked at me especially abednego who offered me a pinch out of his gold snuffbox the very first thing  roundhand shook me too warmly by the hand when he came round to look over my daybook said i wrote a capital hand and indeed i believe i do without any sort of flattery and invited me for dinner next sunday in myddelton square  you wont have said he quite such a grand turnout as with your friends at the west endhe said this with a particular accentbut amelia and i are always happy to see a friend in our plain waypale sherry old port and cut and come again  hey  i said i would come and bring hoskins too  he answered that i was very polite and that he should be very happy to see hoskins and we went accordingly at the appointed day and hour but though gus was eleventh clerk and i twelfth i remarked that at dinner i was helped first and best  i had twice as many forcemeat balls as hoskins in my mockturtle and pretty nearly all the oysters out of the sauceboat  once roundhand was going to help gus before me when his wife who was seated at the head of the table looking very big and fierce in red crape and a turban shouted out antony and poor r dropped the plate and blushed as red as anything  how mrs r did talk to me about the west end to be sure  she had a peerage as you may be certain and knew everything about the drum family in a manner that quite astonished me  she asked me how much lord drum had a year whether i thought he had twenty thirty forty or a hundred and fifty thousand a year whether i was invited to drum castle what the young ladies wore and if they had those odious gigot sleeves which were just coming in then and here mrs r looked at a pair of large mottled arms that she was very proud of  i say sam my boy cried in the midst of our talk mr roundhand who had been passing the portwine round pretty freely i hope you looked to the main chance and put in a few shares of the west diddlesexhey  mr roundhand have you put up the decanters downstairs cries the lady quite angry and wishing to stop the conversation  no milly ive emptied em says r  dont milly me sir and have the goodness to go down and tell lancy my maid a look at me to make the tea in the study  we have a gentleman here who is not used to pentonville ways another look but he wont mind the ways of friends  and here mrs roundhand heaved her very large chest and gave me a third look that was so severe that i declare to goodness it made me look quite foolish  as to gus she never so much as spoke to him all the evening but he consoled himself with a great lot of muffins and sat most of the evening it was a cruel hot summer whistling and talking with roundhand on the verandah  i think i should like to have been with themfor it was very close in the room with that great big mrs roundhand squeezing close up to one on the sofa  do you recollect what a jolly night we had here last summer i heard hoskins say who was leaning over the balcony and ogling the girls coming home from church  you and me with our coats off plenty of cold rumandwater mrs roundhand at margate and a whole box of manillas  hush said roundhand quite eagerly milly will hear  but milly didnt hear for she was occupied in telling me an immense long story about her waltzing with the count de schloppenzollern at the city ball to the allied sovereigns and how the count had great large white moustaches and how odd she thought it to go whirling round the room with a great mans arm round your waist  mr roundhand has never allowed it since our marriagenever but in the year fourteen it was considered a proper compliment you know to pay the sovereigns  so twentynine young ladies of the best families in the city of london i assure you mr titmarshthere was the lord mayors own daughters alderman dobbinss gals sir charles hoppers three who have the great house in baker street and your humble servant who was rather slimmer in those daystwentynine of us had a dancingmaster on purpose and practised waltzing in a room over the egyptian hall at the mansion house  he was a splendid man that count schloppenzollern  i am sure maam says i he had a splendid partner and blushed up to my eyes when i said it  get away you naughty creature says mrs roundhand giving me a great slap youre all the same you men in the west endall deceivers  the count was just like you  heigho  before you marry its all honey and compliments when you win us its all coldness and indifference  look at roundhand the great baby trying to beat down a butterfly with his yellow bandanna  can a man like that comprehend me can he fill the void in my heart  she pronounced it without the h but that there should be no mistake laid her hand upon the place meant  ah no  will you be so neglectful when you marry mr titmarsh  as she spoke the bells were just tolling the people out of church and i fell athinking of my dear dear mary smith in the country walking home to her grandmothers in her modest grey cloak as the bells were chiming and the air full of the sweet smell of the hay and the river shining in the sun all crimson purple gold and silver  there was my dear mary a hundred and twenty miles off in somersetshire walking home from church along with mr snorters family with which she came and went and i was listening to the talk of this great leering vulgar woman  i could not help feeling for a certain half of a sixpence that you have heard me speak of and putting my hand mechanically upon my chest i tore my fingers with the point of my new diamondpin  mr polonius had sent it home the night before and i sported it for the first time at roundhands to dinner  its a beautiful diamond said mrs roundhand  i have been looking at it all dinnertime  how rich you must be to wear such splendid things and how can you remain in a vulgar office in the cityyou who have such great acquaintances at the west end  the woman had somehow put me in such a passion that i bounced off the sofa and made for the balcony without answering a worday and half broke my head against the sash too as i went out to the gents in the open air  gus says i i feel very unwell i wish youd come home with me  and gus did not desire anything better for he had ogled the last girl out of the last church and the night was beginning to fall  what already said mrs roundhand there is a lobster coming upa trifling refreshment not what hes accustomed to but  i am sorry to say i nearly said d the lobster as roundhand went and whispered to her that i was ill  ay said gus looking very knowing  recollect mrs r that he was at the west end on thursday asked to dine maam with the tiptop nobs  chaps dont dine at the west end for nothing do they r  if you play at bowls you know  you must look out for rubbers said roundhand as quick as thought  not in my house of a sunday said mrs r looking very fierce and angry  not a card shall be touched here  are we in a protestant land sir in a christian country  my dear you dont understand  we were not talking of rubbers of whist  there shall be no game at all in the house of a sabbath eve said mrs roundhand and out she flounced from the room without ever so much as wishing us goodnight  do stay said the husband looking very much frighteneddo stay  she wont come back while youre here and i do wish youd stay so  but we wouldnt and when we reached salisbury square i gave gus a lecture about spending his sundays idly and read out one of blairs sermons before we went to bed  as i turned over in bed i could not help thinking about the luck the pin had brought me and it was not over yet as you will see in the next chapter     chapter v   how the diamond introduces him to a still more fashionable place  to tell the truth though about the pin although i mentioned it almost the last thing in the previous chapter i assure you it was by no means the last thing in my thoughts  it had come home from mr poloniuss as i said on saturday night and gus and i happened to be out enjoying ourselves halfprice at sadlers wells and perhaps we took a little refreshment on our way back but that has nothing to do with my story  on the table however was the little box from the jewellers and when i took it outmy how the diamond did twinkle and glitter by the light of our one candle  im sure it would light up the room of itself says gus  ive read they do inin history  it was in the history of cogia hassan alhabbal in the arabian nights as i knew very well  but we put the candle out nevertheless to try  well i declare to goodness it does illuminate the old place says gus but the fact was that there was a gaslamp opposite our window and i believe that was the reason why we could see pretty well  at least in my bedroom to which i was obliged to go without a candle and of which the window looked out on a dead wall i could not see a wink in spite of the hoggarty diamond and was obliged to grope about in the dark for a pincushion which somebody gave me i dont mind owning it was mary smith and in which i stuck it for the night  but somehow i did not sleep much for thinking of it and woke very early in the morning and if the truth must be told stuck it in my nightgown like a fool and admired myself very much in the glass  gus admired it as much as i did for since my return and especially since my venison dinner and drive with lady drum he thought i was the finest fellow in the world and boasted about his west end friend everywhere  as we were going to dine at roundhands and i had no black satin stock to set it off i was obliged to place it in the frill of my best shirt which tore the muslin sadly by the way  however the diamond had its effect on my entertainers as we have seen rather too much perhaps on one of them and next day i wore it down at the office as gus would make me do though it did not look near so well in the second days shirt as on the first day when the linen was quite clear and bright with somersetshire washing  the chaps at the west diddlesex all admired it hugely except that snarling scotchman mwhirter fourth clerkout of envy because i did not think much of a great yellow stone named a carumgorum or some such thing which he had in a snuffmull as he called itall except mwhirter i say were delighted with it and abednego himself who ought to know as his father was in the line told me the jewel was worth at least ten poundsh and that his governor would give me as much for it  thats a proof says roundhand that tits diamond is worth at least thirty  and we all laughed and agreed it was  now i must confess that all these praises and the respect that wag paid me turned my head a little and as all the chaps said i must have a black satin stock to set the stone off was fool enough to buy a stock that cost me fiveandtwenty shillings at ludlams in piccadilly for gus said i must go to the best place to be sure and have none of our cheap and common east end stuff  i might have had one for sixteen and six in cheapside every whit as good but when a young lad becomes vain and wants to be fashionable you see he cant help being extravagant  our director mr brough did not fail to hear of the haunch of venison business and my relationship with lady drum and the right honourable edmund preston only abednego who told him said i was her ladyships first cousin and this made brough think more of me and no worse than before  mr b was as everybody knows member of parliament for rottenburgh and being considered one of the richest men in the city of london used to receive all the great people of the land at his villa at fulham and we often read in the papers of the rare doings going on there  well the pin certainly worked wonders for not content merely with making me a present of a ride in a countesss carriage of a haunch of venison and two baskets of fruit and the dinner at roundhands above described my diamond had other honours in store for me and procured me the honour of an invitation to the house of our director mr brough  once a year in june that honourable gent gave a grand ball at his house at fulham and by the accounts of the entertainment brought back by one or two of our chaps who had been invited it was one of the most magnificent things to be seen about london  you saw members of parliament there as thick as peas in july lords and ladies without end there was everything and everybody of the tiptop sort and i have heard that mr gunter of berkeley square supplied the ices supper and footmenthough of the latter brough kept a plenty but not enough to serve the host of people who came to him  the party it must be remembered was mrs broughs party not the gentlemanshe being in the dissenting way would scarcely sanction any entertainments of the kind but he told his city friends that his lady governed him in everything and it was generally observed that most of them would allow their daughters to go to the ball if asked on account of the immense number of the nobility which our director assembled together mrs roundhand i know for one would have given one of her ears to go but as i have said before nothing would induce brough to ask her  roundhand himself and gutch nineteenth clerk son of the brother of an east indian director were the only two of our gents invited as we knew very well for they had received their invitations many weeks before and bragged about them not a little  but two days before the ball and after my diamondpin had had its due effect upon the gents at the office abednego who had been in the directors room came to my desk with a great smirk and said tit mr b says that he expects you will come down with roundhand to the ball on thursday  i thought moses was jokingat any rate that mr bs message was a queer one for people dont usually send invitations in that abrupt peremptory sort of way but sure enough he presently came down himself and confirmed it saying as he was going out of the office mr titmarsh you will come down on thursday to mrs broughs party where you will see some relations of yours  west end again says that gus hoskins and accordingly down i went taking a place in a cab which roundhand hired for himself gutch and me and for which he very generously paid eight shillings  there is no use to describe the grand gala nor the number of lamps in the lodge and in the garden nor the crowd of carriages that came in at the gates nor the troops of curious people outside nor the ices fiddlers wreaths of flowers and cold supper within  the whole description was beautifully given in a fashionable paper by a reporter who observed the same from the yellow lion over the way and told it in his journal in the most accurate manner getting an account of the dresses of the great people from their footmen and coachmen when they came to the alehouse for their porter  as for the names of the guests they you may be sure found their way to the same newspaper and a great laugh was had at my expense because among the titles of the great people mentioned my name appeared in the list of the honourables  next day brough advertised a hundred and fifty guineas reward for an emerald necklace lost at the party of john brough esq at fulham though some of our people said that no such thing was lost at all and that brough only wanted to advertise the magnificence of his society but this doubt was raised by persons not invited and envious no doubt  well i wore my diamond as you may imagine and rigged myself in my best clothes viz my blue coat and brass buttons before mentioned nankeen trousers and silk stockings a white waistcoat and a pair of white gloves bought for the occasion  but my coat was of country make very high in the waist and short in the sleeves and i suppose must have looked rather odd to some of the great people assembled for they stared at me a great deal and a whole crowd formed to see me dancewhich i did to the best of my power performing all the steps accurately and with great agility as i had been taught by our dancingmaster in the country  and with whom do you think i had the honour to dance  with no less a person than lady jane preston who it appears had not gone out of town and who shook me most kindly by the hand when she saw me and asked me to dance with her  we had my lord tiptoff and lady fanny rakes for our vis avis  you should have seen how the people crowded to look at us and admired my dancing too for i cut the very best of capers quite different to the rest of the gents my lord among the number who walked through the quadrille as if they thought it a trouble and stared at my activity with all their might  but when i have a dance i like to enjoy myself and mary smith often said i was the very best partner at our assemblies while we were dancing i told lady jane how roundhand gutch and i had come down three in a cab besides the driver and my account of our adventures made her ladyship laugh i warrant you  lucky it was for me that i didnt go back in the same vehicle for the driver went and intoxicated himself at the yellow lion threw out gutch and our head clerk as he was driving them back and actually fought gutch afterwards and blacked his eye because he said that gutchs red waistcoat frightened the horse  lady jane however spared me such an uncomfortable ride home for she said she had a fourth place in her carriage and asked me if i would accept it and positively at two oclock in the morning there was i after setting the ladies and my lord down driven to salisbury square in a great thundering carriage with flaming lamps and two tall footmen who nearly knocked the door and the whole little street down with the noise they made at the rapper  you should have seen guss head peeping out of window in his white nightcap  he kept me up the whole night telling him about the ball and the great people i had seen there and next day he told at the office my stories with his own usual embroideries upon them  mr titmarsh said lady fanny laughing to me who is that great fat curious man the master of the house  do you know he asked me if you were not related to us and i said oh yes you were  fanny says lady jane  well answered the other did not grandmamma say mr titmarsh was her cousin  but you know that grandmammas memory is not very good  indeed youre wrong lady jane says my lord i think its prodigious  yes but not verynot very accurate  no my lady says i for her ladyship the countess of drum said if you remember that my friend gus hoskins  whose cause you supported so bravely cries lady fanny  that my friend gus is her ladyships cousin too which cannot be for i know all his family they live in skinner street and st mary axe and are notnot quite so respectable as my relatives  at this they all began to laugh and my lord said rather haughtily  depend upon it mr titmarsh that lady drum is no more your cousin than she is the cousin of your friend mr hoskinson  hoskins my lordand so i told gus but you see he is very fond of me and will have it that i am related to lady d and say what i will to the contrary tells the story everywhere  though to be sure added i with a laugh it has gained me no small good in my time  so i described to the party our dinner at mrs roundhands which all came from my diamondpin and my reputation as a connection of the aristocracy  then i thanked lady jane handsomely for her magnificent present of fruit and venison and told her that it had entertained a great number of kind friends of mine who had drunk her ladyships health with the greatest gratitude  a haunch of venison cried lady jane quite astonished indeed mr titmarsh i am quite at a loss to understand you  as we passed a gaslamp i saw lady fanny laughing as usual and turning her great arch sparkling black eyes at lord tiptoff  why lady jane said he if the truth must out the great haunch of venison trick was one of this young ladys performing  you must know that i had received the abovenamed haunch from lord guttleburys park and knowing that preston is not averse to guttlebury venison was telling lady drum in whose carriage i had a seat that day as mr titmarsh was not in the way that i intended the haunch for your husbands table whereupon my lady fanny clapping together her little hands declared and vowed that the venison should not go to preston but should be sent to a gentleman about whose adventures on the day previous we had just been talkingto mr titmarsh in fact whom preston as fanny vowed had used most cruelly and to whom she said a reparation was due  so my lady fanny insists upon our driving straight to my rooms in the albany you know i am only to stay in my bachelors quarters a month longer  nonsense says lady fanny  insists upon driving straight to my chambers in the albany extracting thence the abovenamed haunch  grandmamma was very sorry to part with it cries lady fanny  and then she orders us to proceed to mr titmarshs house in the city where the venison was left in company with a couple of baskets of fruit bought at granges by lady fanny herself  and what was more said lady fanny i made grandmamma go into frinto lord tiptoffs rooms and dictated out of my own mouth the letter which he wrote and pinned up the haunch of venison that his hideous old housekeeper brought usi am quite jealous of heri pinned up the haunch of venison in a copy of the john bull newspaper  it had one of the ramsbottom letters in it i remember which gus and i read on sunday at breakfast and we nearly killed ourselves with laughing  the ladies laughed too when i told them this and goodnatured lady jane said she would forgive her sister and hoped i would too which i promised to do as often as her ladyship chose to repeat the offence  i never had any more venison from the family but ill tell you what i had  about a month after came a card of lord and lady tiptoff and a great piece of plumcake of which i am sorry to say gus ate a great deal too much     chapter vi   of the west diddlesex association and of the effect the diamond had there  well the magic of the pin was not over yet  very soon after mrs broughs grand party our director called me up to his room at the west diddlesex and after examining my accounts and speaking awhile about business said thats a very fine diamondpin master titmarsh he spoke in a grave patronising way and i called you on purpose to speak to you upon the subject  i do not object to seeing the young men of this establishment well and handsomely dressed but i know that their salaries cannot afford ornaments like those and i grieve to see you with a thing of such value  you have paid for it siri trust you have paid for it for of all things my deardear young friend beware of debt  i could not conceive why brough was reading me this lecture about debt and my having bought the diamondpin as i knew that he had been asking about it already and how i came by itabednego told me so  why sir says i mr abednego told me that he had told you that i had told him  oh aybythebye now i recollect mr titmarshi do recollectyes though i suppose sir you will imagine that i have other more important things to remember  oh sir in course says i  that one of the clerks did say something about a pinthat one of the other gentlemen had it  and so your pin was given you was it  it was given me sir by my aunt mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty said i raising my voice for i was a little proud of castle hoggarty  she must be very rich to make such presents titmarsh  why thank you sir says i she is pretty well off  four hundred a year jointure a farm at slopperton sir three houses at squashtail and three thousand two hundred loose cash at the bankers as i happen to know sirthats all  i did happen to know this you see because while i was down in somersetshire mr macmanus my aunts agent in ireland wrote to say that a mortgage she had on lord brallaghans property had just been paid off and that the money was lodged at couttss  ireland was in a very disturbed state in those days and my aunt wisely determined not to invest her money in that country any more but to look out for some good security in england  however as she had always received six per cent in ireland she would not hear of a smaller interest and had warned me as i was a commercial man on coming to town to look out for some means by which she could invest her money at that rate at least  and how do you come to know mrs hoggartys property so accurately said mr brough upon which i told him  good heavens sir and do you mean that you a clerk in the west diddlesex insurance office applied to by a respectable lady as to the manner in which she should invest property never spoke to her about the company which you have the honour to serve  do you mean sir that you knowing there was a bonus of five per cent for yourself upon shares taken did not press mrs hoggarty to join us  sir says i im an honest man and would not take a bonus from my own relation  honest i know you are my boygive me your hand  so am i honestso is every man in this company honest but we must be prudent as well  we have five millions of capital on our books as you seefive bona fide millions of bona fide sovereigns paid up sirthere is no dishonesty there  but why should we not have twenty millionsa hundred millions why should not this be the greatest commercial association in the worldas it shall be sirit shall as sure as my name is john brough if heaven bless my honest endeavours to establish it  but do you suppose that it can be so unless every man among us use his utmost exertions to forward the success of the enterprise  never sirnever and for me i say so everywhere  i glory in what i do  there is not a house in which i enter but i leave a prospectus of the west diddlesex there is not a single tradesman i employ but has shares in it to some amount  my servants sirmy very servants and grooms are bound up with it  and the first question i ask of anyone who applies to me for a place is are you insured or a shareholder in the west diddlesex the second have you a good character  and if the first question is answered in the negative i say to the party coming to me then be a shareholder before you ask for a place in my household  did you not see meme john brough whose name is good for millionsstep out of my coachandfour into this office with four pounds nineteen which i paid in to mr roundhand as the price of half a share for the porter at my lodgegate did you remark that i deducted a shilling from the five pound  yes sir it was the day you drew out eight hundred and seventythree ten and sixthursday week says i  and why did i deduct that shilling sir  because it was my commissionjohn broughs commission honestly earned by him and openly taken  was there any disguise about it  no  did i do it for the love of a shilling  no says brough laying his hand on his heart i did it from principlefrom that motive which guides every one of my actions as i can look up to heaven and say  i wish all my young men to see my example and follow it i wishi pray that they may  think of that example sir  that porter of mine has a sick wife and nine young children he is himself a sick man and his tenure of life is feeble he has earned money sir in my servicesixty pounds and moreit is all his children have to look toall but for that in the event of his death they would be houseless beggars in the street  and what have i done for that family sir  i have put that money out of the reach of robert gates and placed it so that it shall be a blessing to his family at his death  every farthing is invested in shares in this office and robert gates my lodgeporter is a holder of three shares in the west diddlesex association and in that capacity your master and mine  do you think i want to cheat gates  oh sir says i  to cheat that poor helpless man and those tender innocent childrenyou cant think so sir i should be a disgrace to human nature if i did  but what boots all my energy and perseverance  what though i place my friends money my familys money my own moneymy hopes wishes desires ambitionsall upon this enterprise  you young men will not do so  you whom i treat with love and confidence as my children make no return to me  when i toil you remain still when i struggle you look on  say the word at onceyou doubt me  o heavens that this should be the reward of all my care and love for you  here mr brough was so affected that he actually burst into tears and i confess i saw in its true light the negligence of which i had been guilty  sir says i i am veryvery sorry it was a matter of delicacy rather than otherwise which induced me not to speak to my aunt about the west diddlesex  delicacy my dear dear boyas if there can be any delicacy about making your aunts fortune  say indifference to me say ingratitude say follybut dont say delicacyno no not delicacy  be honest my boy and call things by their right namesalways do  it was folly and ingratitude mr brough says i i see it all now and ill write to my aunt this very post  you had better do no such thing says brough bitterly the stocks are at ninety and mrs hoggarty can get three per cent for her money  i will write sirupon my word and honour i will write  well as your honour is passed you must i suppose for never break your wordno not in a trifle titmarsh  send me up the letter when you have done and ill frank itupon my word and honour i will says mr brough laughing and holding out his hand to me  i took it and he pressed mine very kindlyyou may as well sit down here says he as he kept hold of it there is plenty of paper  and so i sat down and mended a beautiful pen and began and wrote independent west diddlesex association june 1822 and my dear aunt in the best manner possible  then i paused a little thinking what i should next say for i have always found that difficulty about letters the date and my dear soandso one writes off immediatelyit is the next part which is hard and i put my pen in my mouth flung myself back in my chair and began to think about it  bah said brough are you going to be about this letter all day my good fellow  listen to me and ill dictate to you in a moment  so he began     my dear auntsince my return from somersetshire i am very happy    indeed to tell you that i have so pleased the managing director of our    association and the board that they have been good enough to appoint    me third clerk  sir says i  write what i say  mr roundhand as has been agreed by the board yesterday quits the clerks desk and takes the title of secretary and actuary  mr highmore takes his place mr abednego follows him and i place you as third clerkas     third clerk write with a salary of a hundred and fifty pounds per    annum  this news will i know gratify my dear mother and you who    have been a second mother to me all my life     when i was last at home i remember you consulted me as to the best    mode of laying out a sum of money which was lying useless in your    bankers hands  i have since lost no opportunity of gaining what    information i could and situated here as i am in the very midst of    affairs i believe although very young i am as good a person to    apply to as many others of greater age and standing     i frequently thought of mentioning to you our association but    feelings of delicacy prevented me from doing so  i did not wish that    anyone should suppose that a shadow of selfinterest could move me in    any way     but i believe without any sort of doubt that the west diddlesex    association offers the best security that you can expect for your    capital and at the same time the highest interest you can anywhere    procure     the situation of the company as i have it from the very best    authority underline that is as follows     the subscribed and bona fide capital is five millions sterling     the body of directors you know  suffice it to say that the managing    director is john brough esq of the firm of brough and hoff a    member of parliament and a man as well known as mr rothschild in the    city of london  his private fortune i know for a fact amounts to    half a million and the last dividends paid to the shareholders of the    i w d association amounted to 6125 per cent per annum  that i know was the dividend declared by us     although the shares in the market are at a very great premium it is    the privilege of the four first clerks to dispose of a certain number    5000l each at par and if you my dearest aunt would wish for    2500l worth i hope you will allow me to oblige you by offering    you so much of my new privileges     let me hear from you immediately upon the subject as i have already    an offer for the whole amount of my shares at market price  but i havent sir says i  you have sir  i will take the shares but i want you  i want as many respectable persons in the company as i can bring  i want you because i like you and i dont mind telling you that i have views of my own as well for i am an honest man and say openly what i mean and ill tell you why i want you  i cant by the regulations of the company have more than a certain number of votes but if your aunt takes shares i expecti dont mind owning itthat she will vote with me  now do you understand me  my object is to be all in all with the company and if i be i will make it the most glorious enterprise that ever was conducted in the city of london  so i signed the letter and left it with mr b to frank  the next day i went and took my place at the third clerks desk being led to it by mr b who made a speech to the gents much to the annoyance of the other chaps who grumbled about their services though as for the matter of that our services were very much alike the company was only three years old and the oldest clerk in it had not six months more standing in it than i  look out said that envious mwhirter to me  have you got money or have any of your relations money or are any of them going to put it into the concern  i did not think fit to answer him but took a pinch out of his mull and was always kind to him and he to say the truth was always most civil to me  as for gus hoskins he began to think i was a superior being and i must say that the rest of the chaps behaved very kindly in the matter and said that if one man were to be put over their heads before another they would have pitched upon me for i had never harmed any of them and done little kindnesses to several  i know says abednego how you got the place  it was i who got it you  i told brough you were a cousin of prestons the lord of the treasury had venison from him and all that and depend upon it he expects that you will be able to do him some good in that quarter  i think there was some likelihood in what abednego said because our governor as we called him frequently spoke to me about my cousin told me to push the concern in the west end of the town get as many noblemen as we could to insure with us and so on  it was in vain i said i could do nothing with mr preston  bah bah says mr brough dont tell me  people dont send haunches of venison to you for nothing and im convinced he thought i was a very cautious prudent fellow for not bragging about my great family and keeping my connection with them a secret  to be sure he might have learned the truth from gus who lived with me but gus would insist that i was hand in glove with all the nobility and boasted about me ten times as much as i did myself  the chaps used to call me the west ender  see thought i what i have gained by aunt hoggarty giving me a diamondpin  what a lucky thing it is that she did not give me the money as i hoped she would  had i not had the pinhad i even taken it to any other person but mr polonius lady drum would never have noticed me had lady drum never noticed me mr brough never would and i never should have been third clerk of the west diddlesex  i took heart at all this and wrote off on the very evening of my appointment to my dearest mary smith giving her warning that a certain event for which one of us was longing very earnestly might come off sooner than we had expected  and why not  miss ss own fortune was 70l a year mine was 150l and when we had 300l we always vowed we would marry  ah thought i if i could but go to somersetshire now i might boldly walk up to old smiths door he was her grandfather and a halfpay lieutenant of the navy i might knock at the knocker and see my beloved mary in the parlour and not be obliged to sneak behind hayricks on the lookout for her or pelt stones at midnight at her window  my aunt in a few days wrote a pretty gracious reply to my letter  she had not determined she said as to the manner in which she should employ her three thousand pounds but should take my offer into consideration begging me to keep my shares open for a little while until her mind was made up  what then does mr brough do  i learned afterwards in the year 1830 when he and the west diddlesex association had disappeared altogether how he had proceeded  who are the attorneys at slopperton says he to me in a careless way  mr ruck sir says i is the tory solicitor and messrs hodge and smithers the liberals  i knew them very well for the fact is before mary smith came to live in our parts i was rather partial to miss hodge and her great goldcoloured ringlets but mary came and soon put her nose out of joint as the saying is  and you are of what politics  why sir we are liberals  i was rather ashamed of this for mr brough was an outandout tory but hodge and smithers is a most respectable firm  i brought up a packet from them to hickson dixon paxton and jackson our solicitors who are their london correspondents  mr brough only said oh indeed and did not talk any further on the subject but began admiring my diamondpin very much  titmarsh my dear boy says he i have a young lady at fulham who is worth seeing i assure you and who has heard so much about you from her father for i like you my boy i dont care to own it that she is rather anxious to see you too  suppose you come down to us for a week abednego will do your work  law sir you are very kind says i  well you shall come down and i hope you will like my claret  but hark ye  i dont think my dear fellow you are quite smart enoughquite well enough dressed  do you understand me  ive my blue coat and brass buttons at home sir  what that thing with the waist between your shoulders that you wore at mrs broughs party  it was rather highwaisted being made in the country two years before  nono that will never do  get some new clothes sirtwo new suits of clothes  sir says i im already if the truth must be told very short of money for this quarter and cant afford myself a new suit for a long time to come  pooh pooh dont let that annoy you  heres a tenpound notebut no on second thoughts you may as well go to my tailors  ill drive you down there and never mind the bill my good lad  and drive me down he actually did in his grand coachandfour to mr von stiltz in clifford street who took my measure and sent me home two of the finest coats ever seen a dresscoat and a frock a velvet waistcoat a silk ditto and three pairs of pantaloons of the most beautiful make  brough told me to get some boots and pumps and silk stockings for evenings so that when the time came for me to go down to fulham i appeared as handsome as any young nobleman and gus said that i looked by jingo like a regular tiptop swell  in the meantime the following letter had been sent down to hodge and smithers     ram alley cornhill london july 1822     dear sirs              this part being on private affairs relative to the cases of dixon v    haggerstony snodgrass v rubbidge and another i am not permitted to    extract              likewise we beg to hand you a few more prospectuses of the    independent west diddlesex fire and life insurance company of which    we have the honour to be the solicitors in london  we wrote to you    last year requesting you to accept the slopperton and somerset agency    for the same and have been expecting for some time back that either    shares or assurances should be effected by you     the capital of the company as you know is five millions sterling    say 5000000l and we are in a situation to offer more than the    usual commission to our agents of the legal profession  we shall be    happy to give a premium of 6 per cent for shares to the amount of    1000l 65 per cent above a thousand to be paid immediately upon    the taking of the shares     i am dear sirs for self and partners    yours most faithfully    samuel jackson  this letter as i have said came into my hands some time afterwards  i knew nothing of it in the year 1822 when in my new suit of clothes i went down to pass a week at the rookery fulham residence of john brough esquire mp     chapter vii   how samuel titmarsh reached the highest point of prosperity  if i had the pen of a george robins i might describe the rookery properly suffice it however to say it is a very handsome country place with handsome lawns sloping down to the river handsome shrubberies and conservatories fine stables outhouses kitchengardens and everything belonging to a firstrate rus in urbe as the great auctioneer called it when he hammered it down some years after  i arrived on a saturday at halfanhour before dinner a grave gentleman out of livery showed me to my room a man in a chocolate coat and gold lace with broughs crest on the buttons brought me a silver shavingpot of hot water on a silver tray and a grand dinner was ready at six at which i had the honour of appearing in von stiltzs dresscoat and my new silk stockings and pumps  brough took me by the hand as i came in and presented me to his lady a stout fairhaired woman in light blue satin then to his daughter a tall thin darkeyed girl with beetlebrows looking very illnatured and about eighteen  belinda my love said her papa this young gentleman is one of my clerks who was at our ball  oh indeed says belinda tossing up her head  but not a common clerk miss belindaso if you please we will have none of your aristocratic airs with him  he is a nephew of the countess of drum and i hope he will soon be very high in our establishment and in the city of london  at the name of countess i had a dozen times rectified the error about our relationship miss belinda made a low curtsey and stared at me very hard and said she would try and make the rookery pleasant to any friend of papas  we have not much monde today continued miss brough and are only in petit comite but i hope before you leave us you will see some societe that will make your sejour agreeable  i saw at once that she was a fashionable girl from her using the french language in this way  isnt she a fine girl said brough whispering to me and evidently as proud of her as a man could be  isnt she a fine girleh you dog  do you see breeding like that in somersetshire  no sir upon my word answered i rather slily for i was thinking all the while how somebody was a thousand times more beautiful simple and ladylike  and what has my dearest love been doing all day said her papa  oh pa  i have pinced the harp a little to captain fizgigs flute didnt i captain fizgig  captain the honourable francis fizgig said yes brough your fair daughter pinced the harp and touched the piano and egratigned the guitar and ecorched a song or two and we had the pleasure of a promenade a leauof a walk upon the water  law captain cries mrs brough walk on the water  hush mamma you dont understand french says miss belinda with a sneer  its a sad disadvantage madam says fizgig gravely and i recommend you and brough here who are coming out in the great world to have some lessons or at least get up a couple of dozen phrases and introduce them into your conversation here and there  i suppose sir you speak it commonly at the office mr what you call it  and mr fizgig put his glass into his eye and looked at me  we speak english sir says i knowing it better than french  everybody has not had your opportunities miss brough continued the gentleman  everybody has not voyage like nous autres hey  mais que voulezvous my good sir you must stick to your cursed ledgers and things  whats the french for ledger miss belinda  how can you ask  je nen scais rien im sure  you should learn miss brough said her father  the daughter of a british merchant need not be ashamed of the means by which her father gets his bread  im not ashamedim not proud  those who know john brough know that ten years ago he was a poor clerk like my friend titmarsh here and is now worth halfamillion  is there any man in the house better listened to than john brough  is there any duke in the land that can give a better dinner than john brough or a larger fortune to his daughter than john brough  why sir the humble person now speaking to you could buy out many a german duke  but im not proudno no not proud  theres my daughterlook at herwhen i die she will be mistress of my fortune but am i proud  no  let him who can win her marry her thats what i say  be it you mr fizgig son of a peer of the realm or you bill tidd  be it a duke or a shoeblack what do i care heywhat do i care  oooh sighed the gent who went by the name of bill tidd a very pale young man with a black riband round his neck instead of a handkerchief and his collars turned down like lord byron  he was leaning against the mantelpiece and with a pair of great green eyes ogling miss brough with all his might  oh johnmy dear john cried mrs brough seizing her husbands hand and kissing it you are an angel that you are  isabella dont flatter me im a mana plain downright citizen of london without a particle of pride except in you and my daughter heremy two bells as i call them  this is the way that we live titmarsh my boy ours is a happy humble christian home and thats all isabella leave go my hand  mamma you mustnt do so before company its odious shrieked miss b and mamma quietly let the hand fall and heaved from her ample bosom a great large sigh  i felt a liking for that simple woman and a respect for brough too  he couldnt be a bad man whose wife loved him so  dinner was soon announced and i had the honour of leading in miss b who looked back rather angrily i thought at captain fizgig because that gentleman had offered his arm to mrs brough  he sat on the right of mrs brough and miss flounced down on the seat next to him leaving me and mr tidd to take our places at the opposite side of the table  at dinner there was turbot and soup first and boiled turkey afterwards of course  how is it that at all the great dinners they have this perpetual boiled turkey  it was real turtlesoup the first time i had ever tasted it and i remarked how mrs b who insisted on helping it gave all the green lumps of fat to her husband and put several slices of the breast of the bird under the body until it came to his turn to be helped  im a plain man says john and eat a plain dinner  i hate your kickshaws though i keep a french cook for those who are not of my way of thinking  im no egotist look you ive no prejudices and miss there has her bechamels and fallals according to her taste  captain try the vollyvong  we had plenty of champagne and old madeira with dinner and great silver tankards of porter which those might take who chose  brough made especially a boast of drinking beer and when the ladies retired said gentlemen tiggins will give you an unlimited supply of wine theres no stinting here and then laid himself down in his easychair and fell asleep  he always does so whispered mr tidd to me  get some of that yellowsealed wine tiggins says the captain  that other claret we had yesterday is loaded and disagrees with me infernally  i must say i liked the yellow seal much better than aunt hoggartys rosolio  i soon found out what mr tidd was and what he was longing for  isnt she a glorious creature says he to me  who sir says i  miss belinda to be sure cried tidd  did mortal ever look upon eyes like hers or view a more sylphlike figure  she might have a little more flesh mr tidd says the captain and a little less eyebrow  they look vicious those scowling eyebrows in a girl  quen ditesvous mr titmarsh as miss brough would say  i think it remarkably good claret sir says i  egad youre the right sort of fellow says the captain  volto sciolto eh  you respect our sleeping host yonder  that i do sir as the first man in the city of london and my managing director  and so do i says tidd and this day fortnight when im of age ill prove my confidence too  as how says i  why sir you must know that i come intoahema considerable property sir on the 14th of july which my father madein business  say at once he was a tailor tidd  he was a tailor sirbut what of that  ive had a university education and have the feelings of a gentleman as muchay perhaps and more than some members of an effete aristocracy  tidd dont be severe says the captain drinking a tenth glass  well mr titmarsh when of age i come into a considerable property and mr brough has been so good as to say he can get me twelve hundred a year for my twenty thousand pounds and i have promised to invest them  in the west diddlesex sir says iin our office  no in another company of which mr brough is director and quite as good a thing  mr brough is a very old friend of my family sir and he has taken a great liking to me and he says that with my talents i ought to get into parliament and thenand then after i have laid out my patrimony i may look to matrimony you see  oh you designing dog said the captain  when i used to lick you at school who ever would have thought that i was thrashing a sucking statesman  talk away boys said brough waking out of his sleep i only sleep with half an eye and hear you all  yes you shall get into parliament tidd my man or my names not brough  you shall have six per cent for your money or never believe me  but as for my daughterask her and not me you or the captain or titmarsh may have her if you can get her  all i ask in a soninlaw is that he should be as every one of you is an honourable and highminded man  tidd at this looked very knowing and as our host sank off to sleep again pointed archly at his eyebrows and wagged his head at the captain  bah says the captain  i say what i think and you may tell miss brough if you like  and so presently this conversation ended and we were summoned in to coffee  after which the captain sang songs with miss brough tidd looked at her and said nothing i looked at prints and mrs brough sat knitting stockings for the poor  the captain was sneering openly at miss brough and her affected ways and talk but in spite of his bullying contemptuous way i thought she seemed to have a great regard for him and to bear his scorn very meekly  at twelve captain fizgig went off to his barracks at knightsbridge and tidd and i to our rooms  next day being sunday a great bell woke us at eight and at nine we all assembled in the breakfastroom where mr brough read prayers a chapter and made an exhortation afterwards to us and all the members of the household except the french cook monsieur nontongpaw whom i could see from my chair walking about in the shrubberies in his white nightcap smoking a cigar  every morning on weekdays punctually at eight mr brough went through the same ceremony and had his family to prayers but though this man was a hypocrite as i found afterwards im not going to laugh at the family prayers or say he was a hypocrite because he had them  there are many bad and good men who dont go through the ceremony at all but i am sure the good men would be the better for it and am not called upon to settle the question with respect to the bad ones and therefore i have passed over a great deal of the religious part of mr broughs behaviour suffice it that religion was always on his lips that he went to church thrice every sunday when he had not a party and if he did not talk religion with us when we were alone had a great deal to say upon the subject upon occasions as i found one day when we had a quaker and dissenter party to dine and when his talk was as grave as that of any minister present  tidd was not there that dayfor nothing could make him forsake his byron riband or refrain from wearing his collars turned down so tidd was sent with the buggy to astleys  and hark ye titmarsh my boy said he leave your diamond pin upstairs our friends today dont like such gewgaws and though for my part i am no enemy to harmless ornaments yet i would not shock the feelings of those who have sterner opinions  you will see that my wife and miss brough consult my wishes in this respect  and so they didfor they both came down to dinner in black gowns and tippets whereas miss b had commonly her dress half off her shoulders  the captain rode over several times to see us and miss brough seemed always delighted to see him  one day i met him as i was walking out alone by the river and we had a long talk together  mr titmarsh says he from what little i have seen of you you seem to be an honest straightminded young fellow and i want some information that you can give  tell me in the first place if you willand upon my honour it shall go no fartherabout this insurance company of yours  you are in the city and see how affairs are going on  is your concern a stable one  sir said i frankly then and upon my honour too i believe it is  it has been set up only four years it is true but mr brough had a great name when it was established and a vast connection  every clerk in the office has to be sure in a manner paid for his place either by taking shares himself or by his relations taking them  i got mine because my mother who is very poor devoted a small sum of money that came to us to the purchase of an annuity for herself and a provision for me  the matter was debated by the family and our attorneys messrs hodge and smithers who are very well known in our part of the country and it was agreed on all hands that my mother could not do better with her money for all of us than invest it in this way  brough alone is worth half a million of money and his name is a host in itself  nay more i wrote the other day to an aunt of mine who has a considerable sum of money in loose cash and who had consulted me as to the disposal of it to invest it in our office  can i give you any better proof of my opinion of its solvency  did brough persuade you in any way  yes he certainly spoke to me but he very honestly told me his motives and tells them to us all as honestly  he says gentlemen it is my object to increase the connection of the office as much as possible  i want to crush all the other offices in london  our terms are lower than any office and we can bear to have them lower and a great business will come to us that way  but we must work ourselves as well  every single shareholder and officer of the establishment must exert himself and bring us customersno matter for how little they are engagedengage them that is the great point  and accordingly our director makes all his friends and servants shareholders his very lodgeporter yonder is a shareholder and he thus endeavours to fasten upon all whom he comes near  i for instance have just been appointed over the heads of our gents to a much better place than i held  i am asked down here and entertained royally and why  because my aunt has three thousand pounds which mr brough wants her to invest with us  that looks awkward mr titmarsh  not a whit sir he makes no disguise of the matter  when the question is settled one way or the other i dont believe mr brough will take any further notice of me  but he wants me now  this place happened to fall in just at the very moment when he had need of me and he hopes to gain over my family through me  he told me as much as we drove down  you are a man of the world titmarsh said he you know that i dont give you this place because you are an honest fellow and write a good hand if i had a lesser bribe to offer you at the moment i should only have given you that but i had no choice and gave you what was in my power  thats fair enough but what can make brough so eager for such a small sum as three thousand pounds  if it had been ten sir he would have been not a bit more eager  you dont know the city of london and the passion which our great men in the sharemarket have for increasing their connection  mr brough sir would canvass and wheedle a chimneysweep in the way of business  see here is poor tidd and his twenty thousand pounds  our director has taken possession of him just in the same way  he wants all the capital he can lay his hands on  yes and suppose he runs off with the capital  mr brough of the firm of brough and hoff sir  suppose the bank of england runs off  but here we are at the lodgegate  lets ask gates another of mr broughs victims  and we went in and spoke to old gates  well mr gates says i beginning the matter cleverly you are one of my masters you know at the west diddlesex yonder  yees sure says old gates grinning  he was a retired servant with a large family come to him in his old age  may i ask you what your wages are mr gates that you can lay by so much money and purchase shares in our company  gates told us his wages and when we inquired whether they were paid regularly swore that his master was the kindest gentleman in the world that he had put two of his daughters into service two of his sons to charity schools made one apprentice and narrated a hundred other benefits that he had received from the family  mrs brough clothed half the children master gave them blankets and coats in winter and soup and meat all the year round  there never was such a generous family sure since the world began  well sir said i to the captain does that satisfy you  mr brough gives to these people fifty times as much as he gains from them and yet he makes mr gates take shares in our company  mr titmarsh says the captain you are an honest fellow and i confess your argument sounds well  now tell me do you know anything about miss brough and her fortune  brough will leave her everythingor says so  but i suppose the captain saw some particular expression in my countenance for he laughed and said  i suppose my dear fellow you think shes dear at the price  well i dont know that you are far wrong  why then if i may make so bold captain fizgig are you always at her heels  mr titmarsh says the captain i owe twenty thousand pounds and he went back to the house directly and proposed for her  i thought this rather cruel and unprincipled conduct on the gentlemans part for he had been introduced to the family by mr tidd with whom he had been at school and had supplanted tidd entirely in the great heiresss affections  brough stormed and actually swore at his daughter as the captain told me afterwards when he heard that the latter had accepted mr fizgig and at last seeing the captain made him give his word that the engagement should be kept secret for a few months  and captain f only made a confidant of me and the mess as he said but this was after tidd had paid his twenty thousand pounds over to our governor which he did punctually when he came of age  the same day too he proposed for the young lady and i need not say was rejected presently the captains engagement began to be whispered about all his great relations the duke of doncaster the earl of cinqbars the earl of crabs c came and visited the brough family the hon henry ringwood became a shareholder in our company and the earl of crabs offered to be our shares rose to a premium our director his lady and daughter were presented at court and the great west diddlesex association bid fair to be the first assurance office in the kingdom  a very short time after my visit to fulham my dear aunt wrote to me to say that she had consulted with her attorneys messrs hodge and smithers who strongly recommended that she should invest the sum as i advised  she had the sum invested too in my name paying me many compliments upon my honesty and talent of which she said mr brough had given her the most flattering account  and at the same time my aunt informed me that at her death the shares should be my own  this gave me a great weight in the company as you may imagine  at our next annual meeting i attended in my capacity as a shareholder and had great pleasure in hearing mr brough in a magnificent speech declare a dividend of six per cent that we all received over the counter  you lucky young scoundrel said brough to me do you know what made me give you your place  why my aunts money to be sure sir said i  no such thing  do you fancy i cared for those paltry three thousand pounds  i was told you were nephew of lady drum and lady drum is grandmother of lady jane preston and mr preston is a man who can do us a world of good  i knew that they had sent you venison and the deuce knows what and when i saw lady jane at my party shake you by the hand and speak to you so kindly i took all abednegos tales for gospel that was the reason you got the place mark you and not on account of your miserable three thousand pounds  well sir a fortnight after you were with us at fulham i met preston in the house and made a merit of having given the place to his cousin  confound the insolent scoundrel said he he my cousin  i suppose you take all old drums stories for true  why man its her mania she never is introduced to a man but she finds out a cousinship and would not fail of course with that cur of a titmarsh  well said i laughing that cur has got a good place in consequence and the matter cant be mended  so you see continued our director that you were indebted for your place not to your aunts money but  but to my aunts diamond pin  lucky rascal said brough poking me in the side and going out of the way  and lucky in faith i thought i was     chapter viii   relates the happiest day of samuel titmarshs life  i dont know how it was that in the course of the next six months mr roundhand the actuary who had been such a profound admirer of mr brough and the west diddlesex association suddenly quarrelled with both and taking his money out of the concern he disposed of his 5000l worth of shares to a pretty good profit and went away speaking everything that was evil both of the company and the director  mr highmore now became secretary and actuary mr abednego was first clerk and your humble servant was second in the office at a salary of 250l a year  how unfounded were mr roundhands aspersions of the west diddlesex appeared quite clearly at our meeting in january 1823 when our chief director in one of the most brilliant speeches ever heard declared that the halfyearly dividend was 4l per cent at the rate of 8l per cent per annum and i sent to my aunt 120l sterling as the amount of the interest of the stock in my name  my excellent aunt mrs hoggarty delighted beyond measure sent me back 10l for my own pocket and asked me if she had not better sell slopperton and squashtail and invest all her money in this admirable concern  on this point i could not surely do better than ask the opinion of mr brough  mr b told me that shares could not be had but at a premium but on my representing that i knew of 5000l worth in the market at par he saidwell if so he would like a fair price for his and would not mind disposing of 5000l worth as he had rather a glut of west diddlesex shares and his other concerns wanted feeding with ready money  at the end of our conversation of which i promised to report the purport to mrs hoggarty the director was so kind as to say that he had determined on creating a place of private secretary to the managing director and that i should hold that office with an additional salary of 150l  i had 250l a year miss smith had 70l per annum to her fortune what had i said should be my line of conduct whenever i could realise 300l a year  gus of course and all the gents in our office through him knew of my engagement with mary smith  her father had been a commander in the navy and a very distinguished officer and though mary as i have said only brought me a fortune of 70l a year and i as everybody said in my present position in the office and the city of london might have reasonably looked out for a lady with much more money yet my friends agreed that the connection was very respectable and i was content as who would not have been with such a darling as mary  i am sure for my part i would not have taken the lord mayors own daughter in place of mary even with a plum to her fortune  mr brough of course was made aware of my approaching marriage as of everything else relating to every clerk in the office and i do believe abednego told him what we had for dinner every day  indeed his knowledge of our affairs was wonderful  he asked me how marys money was invested  it was in the three per cent consols2333l 6s 8d  remember says he my lad mrs sam titmarsh that is to be may have seven per cent for her money at the very least and on better security than the bank of england for is not a company of which john brough is the head better than any other company in england and to be sure i thought he was not far wrong and promised to speak to marys guardians on the subject before our marriage  lieutenant smith her grandfather had been at the first very much averse to our union  i must confess that one day finding me alone with her and kissing i believe the tips of her little fingers he had taken me by the collar and turned me out of doors  but sam titmarsh with a salary of 250l a year a promised fortune of 150l more and the righthand man of mr john brough of london was a very different man from sam the poor clerk and the poor clergymans widows son and the old gentleman wrote me a kind letter enough and begged me to get him six pairs of lambswool stockings and four ditto waistcoats from romanis and accepted them too as a present from me when i went down in junein happy june of 1823to fetch my dear mary away  mr brough was likewise kindly anxious about my aunts slopperton and squashtail property which she had not as yet sold as she talked of doing and as mr b represented it was a sin and a shame that any person in whom he took such interest as he did in all the relatives of his dear young friend should only have three per cent for her money when she could have eight elsewhere  he always called me sam now praised me to the other young men who brought the praises regularly to me said there was a cover always laid for me at fulham and repeatedly took me thither  there was but little company when i went and mwhirter used to say he only asked me on days when he had his vulgar acquaintances  but i did not care for the great people not being born in their sphere and indeed did not much care for going to the house at all  miss belinda was not at all to my liking  after her engagement with captain fizgig and after mr tidd had paid his 20000l and fizgigs great relations had joined in some of our directors companies mr brough declared he believed that captain fizgigs views were mercenary and put him to the proof at once by saying that he must take miss brough without a farthing or not have her at all  whereupon captain fizgig got an appointment in the colonies and miss brough became more illhumoured than ever  but i could not help thinking she was rid of a bad bargain and pitying poor tidd who came back to the charge again more lovesick than ever and was rebuffed pitilessly by miss belinda  her father plainly told tidd too that his visits were disagreeable to belinda and though he must always love and value him he begged him to discontinue his calls at the rookery  poor fellow he had paid his 20000l away for nothing for what was six per cent to him compared to six per cent and the hand of miss belinda brough  well mr brough pitied the poor lovesick swain as he called me so much and felt such a warm sympathy in my wellbeing that he insisted on my going down to somersetshire with a couple of months leave and away i went as happy as a lark with a couple of brandnew suits from von stiltzs in my trunk i had them made looking forward to a certain event and inside the trunk lieutenant smiths fleecy hosiery wrapping up a parcel of our prospectuses and two letters from john brough esq to my mother our worthy annuitant and to mrs hoggarty our excellent shareholder  mr brough said i was all that the fondest father could wish that he considered me as his own boy and that he earnestly begged mrs hoggarty not to delay the sale of her little landed property as land was high now and must fall whereas the west diddlesex association shares were comparatively low and must inevitably in the course of a year or two double treble quadruple their present value  in this way i was prepared and in this way i took leave of my dear gus as we parted in the yard of the boltintun fleet street i felt that i never should go back to salisbury square again and had made my little present to the landladys family accordingly  she said i was the respectablest gentleman she had ever had in her house nor was that saying much for bell lane is in the rules of the fleet and her lodgers used commonly to be prisoners on rule from that place  as for gus the poor fellow cried and blubbered so that he could not eat a morsel of the muffins and grilled ham with which i treated him for breakfast in the boltintun coffeehouse and when i went away was waving his hat and his handkerchief so in the archway of the coachoffice that i do believe the wheels of the true blue went over his toes for i heard him roaring as we passed through the arch  ah how different were my feelings as i sat proudly there on the box by the side of jim ward the coachman to those i had the last time i mounted that coach parting from my dear mary and coming to london with my diamond pin  when arrived near home at grumpley three miles from our village where the true blue generally stops to take a glass of ale at the poppleton arms it was as if our member mr poppleton himself was come into the country so great was the concourse of people assembled round the inn and there was the landlord of the inn and all the people of the village then there was tom wheeler the postboy from mrs rincers postinghotel in our town he was riding on the old bay posters and they heaven bless us were drawing my aunts yellow chariot in which she never went out but thrice in a year and in which she now sat in her splendid cashmere shawl and a new hat and feather  she waved a white handkerchief out of the window and tom wheeler shouted out huzza as did a number of the little blackguard boys of grumpley who to be sure would huzza for anything  what a change on tom wheelers part however i remembered only a few years before how he had whipped me from the box of the chaise as i was hanging on for a ride behind  next to my aunts carriage came the fourwheeled chaise of lieutenant smith rn who was driving his old fat pony with his lady by his side i looked in the back seat of the chaise and felt a little sad at seeing that somebody was not there  but o silly fellow there was somebody in the yellow chariot with my aunt blushing like a peony i declare and looking so happyoh so happy and pretty  she had a white dress and a light blue and yellow scarf which my aunt said were the hoggarty colours though what the hoggartys had to do with light blue and yellow i dont know to this day  well the true blue guard made a great bellowing on his horn as his four horses dashed away the boys shouted again i was placed bodkin between mrs hoggarty and mary tom wheeler cut into his bays the lieutenant who had shaken me cordially by the hand and whose big dog did not make the slightest attempt at biting me this time beat his pony till its fat sides lathered again and thus in this i may say unexampled procession i arrived in triumph at our village  my dear mother and the girlsheaven bless themnine of them in their nankeen spencers i had something pretty in my trunk for each of themcould not afford a carriage but had posted themselves on the road near the village and there was such a waving of hands and handkerchiefs and though my aunt did not much notice them except by a majestic toss of the head which is pardonable in a woman of her property yet mary smith did even more than i and waved her hands as much as the whole nine  ah how my dear mother cried and blessed me when we met and called me her souls comfort and her darling boy and looked at me as if i were a paragon of virtue and genius whereas i was only a very lucky young fellow that by the aid of kind friends had stepped rapidly into a very pretty property  i was not to stay with my motherthat had been arranged beforehand for though she and mrs hoggarty were not remarkably good friends yet mother said it was for my benefit that i should stay with my aunt and so give up the pleasure of having me with her and though hers was much the humbler house of the two i need not say i preferred it far to mrs hoggartys more splendid one let alone the horrible rosolio of which i was obliged now to drink gallons  it was to mrs hs then we were driven she had prepared a great dinner that evening and hired an extra waiter and on getting out of the carriage she gave a sixpence to tom wheeler saying that was for himself and that she would settle with mrs rincer for the horses afterwards  at which tom flung the sixpence upon the ground swore most violently and was very justly called by my aunt an impertinent fellow  she had taken such a liking to me that she would hardly bear me out of her sight  we used to sit for morning after morning over her accounts debating for hours together the propriety of selling the slopperton property but no arrangement was come to yet about it for hodge and smithers could not get the price she wanted  and moreover she vowed that at her decease she would leave every shilling to me  hodge and smithers too gave a grand party and treated me with marked consideration as did every single person of the village  those who could not afford to give dinners gave teas and all drank the health of the young couple and many a time after dinner or supper was my mary made to blush by the allusions to the change in her condition  the happy day for that ceremony was now fixed and the 24th july 1823 saw me the happiest husband of the prettiest girl in somersetshire  we were married from my mothers house who would insist upon that at any rate and the nine girls acted as bridesmaids ay and gus hoskins came from town express to be my groomsman and had my old room at my mothers and stayed with her for a week and cast a sheepseye upon miss winny titmarsh too my dear fourth sister as i afterwards learned  my aunt was very kind upon the marriage ceremony indeed  she had desired me some weeks previous to order three magnificent dresses for mary from the celebrated madame mantalini of london and some elegant trinkets and embroidered pockethandkerchiefs from howell and jamess these were sent down to me and were to be my present to the bride but mrs hoggarty gave me to understand that i need never trouble myself about the payment of the bill and i thought her conduct very generous also she lent us her chariot for the wedding journey and made with her own hands a beautiful crimson satin reticule for mrs samuel titmarsh her dear niece  it contained a huswife completely furnished with needles c for she hoped mrs titmarsh would never neglect her needle and a purse containing some silver pennies and a very curious pocket piece  as long as you keep these my dear said mrs hoggarty you will never want and ferventlyfervently do i pray that you will keep them  in the carriagepocket we found a paper of biscuits and a bottle of rosolio  we laughed at this and made it over to tom wheelerwho however did not seem to like it much better than we  i need not say i was married in mr von stiltzs coat the third and fourth coats heaven help us in a year and that i wore sparkling in my bosom the great hoggarty diamond     chapter ix   brings back sam his wife aunt and diamond to london  we pleased ourselves during the honeymoon with forming plans for our life in london and a pretty paradise did we build for ourselves  well we were but forty years old between us and for my part i never found any harm come of castlebuilding but a great deal of pleasure  before i left london i had to say the truth looked round me for a proper place befitting persons of our small income and gus hoskins and i who hunted after officehours in couples bad fixed on a very snug little cottage in camden town where there was a garden that certain small people might play in when they came a horse and gighouse if ever we kept oneand why not in a few yearsand a fine healthy air at a reasonable distance from change all for 30l a year  i had described this little spot to mary as enthusiastically as sancho describes lizias to don quixote and my dear wife was delighted with the prospect of housekeeping there vowed she would cook all the best dishes herself especially jampudding of which i confess i am very fond and promised gus that he should dine with us at clematis bower every sunday only he must not smoke those horrid cigars  as for gus he vowed he would have a room in the neighbourhood too for he could not bear to go back to bell lane where we two had been so happy together and so good natured mary said she would ask my sister winny to come and keep her company  at which hoskins blushed and said pooh nonsense now  but all our hopes of a happy snug clematis lodge were dashed to the ground on our return from our little honeymoon excursion when mrs hoggarty informed us that she was sick of the country and was determined to go to london with her dear nephew and niece and keep house for them and introduce them to her friends in the metropolis  what could we do  we wished her atbath certainly not in london  but there was no help for it and we were obliged to bring her for as my mother said if we offended her her fortune would go out of our family and were we two young people not likely to want it  so we came to town rather dismally in the carriage posting the whole way for the carriage must be brought and a person of my aunts rank in life could not travel by the stage  and i had to pay 14l for the posters which pretty nearly exhausted all my little hoard of cash  first we went into lodgingsinto three sets in three weeks  we quarrelled with the first landlady because my aunt vowed that she cut a slice off the leg of mutton which was served for our dinner from the second lodgings we went because aunt vowed the maid would steal the candles from the third we went because aunt hoggarty came down to breakfast the morning after our arrival with her face shockingly swelled and bitten bynever mind what  to cut a long tale short i was half mad with the continual choppings and changings and the long stories and scoldings of my aunt  as for her great acquaintances none of them were in london and she made it a matter of quarrel with me that i had not introduced her to john brough esquire mp and to lord and lady tiptoff her relatives  mr brough was at brighton when we arrived in town and on his return i did not care at first to tell our director that i had brought my aunt with me or mention my embarrassments for money  he looked rather serious when perforce i spoke of the latter to him and asked for an advance but when he heard that my lack of money had been occasioned by the bringing of my aunt to london his tone instantly changed  that my dear boy alters the question mrs hoggarty is of an age when all things must be yielded to her  here are a hundred pounds and i beg you to draw upon me whenever you are in the least in want of money  this gave me breathingtime until she should pay her share of the household expenses and the very next day mr and mrs john brough in their splendid carriageandfour called upon mrs hoggarty and my wife at our lodgings in lambs conduit street  it was on the very day when my poor aunt appeared with her face in that sad condition and she did not fail to inform mrs brough of the cause and to state that at castle hoggarty or at her country place in somersetshire she had never heard or thought of such vile odious things  gracious heavens shouted john brough esquire a lady of your rank to suffer in this waythe excellent relative of my dear boy titmarsh never madamnever let it be said that mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty should be subject to such horrible humiliation while john brough has a home to offer hera humble happy christian home madam though unlike perhaps the splendour to which you have been accustomed in the course of your distinguished career  isabella my lovebelinda speak to mrs hoggarty  tell her that john broughs house is hers from garret to cellar  i repeat it madam from garret to cellar  i desirei insisti order that mrs hoggarty of castle hoggartys trunks should be placed this instant in my carriage  have the goodness to look to them yourself mrs titmarsh and see that your dear aunts comforts are better provided for than they have been  mary went away rather wondering at this order  but to be sure mr brough was a great man and her samuels benefactor and though the silly child absolutely began to cry as she packed and toiled at aunts enormous valises yet she performed the work and came down with a smiling face to my aunt who was entertaining mr and mrs brough with a long and particular account of the balls at the castle in dublin in lord charlevilles time  i have packed the trunks aunt but i am not strong enough to bring them down said mary  certainly not certainly not said john brough perhaps a little ashamed  hallo  george frederic augustus come upstairs this instant and bring down the trunks of mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty which this young lady will show you  nay so great was mr broughs condescension that when some of his fashionable servants refused to meddle with the trunks he himself seized a pair of them with both bands carried them to the carriage and shouted loud enough for all lambs conduit street to hear john brough is not proudno no and if his footmen are too high and mighty hell show them a lesson of humility  mrs brough was for running downstairs too and taking the trunks from her husband but they were too heavy for her so she contented herself with sitting on one and asking all persons who passed her whether john brough was not an angel of a man  in this way it was that my aunt left us  i was not aware of her departure for i was at the office at the time and strolling back at five with gus saw my dear mary smiling and bobbing from the window and beckoning to us both to come up  this i thought was very strange because mrs hoggarty could not abide hoskins and indeed had told me repeatedly that either she or he must quit the house  well we went upstairs and there was mary who had dried her tears and received us with the most smiling of faces and laughed and clapped her hands and danced and shook guss hand  and what do you think the little rogue proposed  i am blest if she did not say she would like to go to vauxhall  as dinner was laid for three persons only gus took his seat with fear and trembling and then mrs sam titmarsh related the circumstances which had occurred and how mrs hoggarty had been whisked away to fulham in mr broughs splendid carriageandfour  let her go i am sorry to say said i and indeed we relished our vealcutlets and jampudding a great deal more than mrs hoggarty did her dinner off plate at the rookery  we had a very merry party to vauxhall gus insisting on standing treat and you may be certain that my aunt whose absence was prolonged for three weeks was heartily welcome to remain away for we were much merrier and more comfortable without her  my little mary used to make my breakfast before i went to office of mornings and on sundays we had a holiday and saw the dear little children eat their boiled beef and potatoes at the foundling and heard the beautiful music but beautiful as it is i think the children were a more beautiful sight still and the look of their innocent happy faces was better than the best sermon  on weekdays mrs titmarsh would take a walk about five oclock in the evening on the lefthand side of lambs conduit street as you go to holbornay and sometimes pursue her walk as far as snow hill when two young gents from the i w d fire and life were pretty sure to meet her and then how happily we all trudged off to dinner  once we came up as a monster of a man with high heels and a goldheaded cane and whiskers all over his face was grinning under marys bonnet and chattering to her close to day and martins blacking manufactory not near such a handsome thing then as it is nowthere was the man chattering and ogling his best when who should come up but gus and i  and in the twinkling of a pegpost as lord duberley says my gentleman was seized by the collar of his coat and found himself sprawling under a stand of hackneycoaches where all the watermen were grinning at him  the best of it was he left his head of hair and whiskers in my hand but mary said dont be hard upon him samuel its only a frenchman  and so we gave him his wig back which one of the grinning stableboys put on and carried to him as he lay in the straw  he shrieked out something about arretez and francais and champ dhonneur but we walked on gus putting his thumb to his nose and stretching out his finger at master frenchman  this made everybody laugh and so the adventure ended  about ten days after my aunts departure came a letter from her of which i give a copy     my dear nephewit was my earnest whish eer this to have returned    to london where i am sure you and my niece titmarsh miss me very    much and where she poor thing quite inexperienced in the ways of    the great metropulus in aconamy and indeed in every qualaty    requasit in a good wife and the mistress of a famaly can hardly    manidge i am sure without me     tell her on no account to pay more than 65d for the prime    pieces 475d for soup meat and that the very best of london    butter is to be had for 85d of course for pudns and the kitchin    youll employ a commoner sort  my trunks were sadly packed by mrs    titmarsh and the hasp of the portmantyoulock has gone through my    yellow satn  i have darned it and woar it already twice at two    ellygant though quiat eveningparties given by my hospatable host    and my pegreen velvet on saturday at a grand dinner when lord    scaramouch handed me to table  everything was in the most sumptious    style  soup top and bottom white and brown removed by turbit and    sammon with immense boles of lobstersauce  lobsters alone cost    15s  turbit three guineas  the hole sammon weighing im sure    15 lbs and never seen at table again not a bitt of pickled sammon    the hole weak afterwards  this kind of extravigance would just suit    mrs sam titmarsh who as i always say burns the candle at both    ends  well young people it is lucky for you you have an old aunt    who knows better and has a long purse without witch i dare say    some folks would be glad to see her out of doors  i dont mean you    samuel who have i must say been a dutiful nephew to me  well i    dare say i shant live long and some folks wont be sorry to have me    in my grave     indeed on sunday i was taken in my stomick very ill and thought it    might have been the lobstersauce but doctor blogg who was called    in said it was he very much feared cumsumptive but gave me some    pills and a draft wh made me better  please call upon himhe lives    at pimlico and you can walk out there after office hoursand present    him with 1l 1s with my compliments  i have no money here but a    10l note the rest being locked up in my box at lambs cundit    street     although the flesh is not neglected in mr bs sumptious    establishment i can assure you the sperrit is likewise cared for    mr b reads and igspounds every morning and o but his exorcises    refresh the hungry sole before breakfast  everything is in the    handsomest stylesilver and goold plate at breakfast lunch and    dinner and his crest and motty a beehive with the latn word    industria meaning industry on everythingeven on the chany    juggs and things in my beddroom  on sunday we were favoured by a    special outpouring from the rev grimes wapshot of the amabaptist    congrigation here and who egshorted for 3 hours in the afternoon in    mr bs private chapel  as the widow of a hoggarty i have always    been a staunch supporter of the established church of england and    ireland but i must say mr wapshots stirring way was far superior to    that of the rev bland blenkinsop of the establishment who lifted up    his voice after dinner for a short discourse of two hours     mrs brough is between ourselves a poor creature and has no    sperrit of her own  as for miss b she is so saucy that once i    promised to box her years and would have left the house had not mr    b taken my part and miss made me a suitable apollogy     i dont know when i shall return to town being made really so    welcome here  dr blogg says the air of fulham is the best in the    world for my simtums and as the ladies of the house do not choose to    walk out with me the rev grimes wapshot has often been kind enough    to lend me his arm and tis sweet with such a guide to wander both to    putney and wandsworth and igsamin the wonderful works of nature  i    have spoke to him about the slopperton property and he is not of mr    bs opinion that i should sell it but on this point i shall follow    my own counsel     meantime you must gett into more comfortable lodgings and lett my    bedd be warmed every night and of rainy days have a fire in the    grate and let mrs titmarsh look up my blue silk dress and turn it    against i come and there is my purple spencer she can have for    herself and i hope she does not wear those three splendid gowns you    gave her but keep them until better times  i shall soon introduse    her to my friend mr brough and others of my acquaintances and am    always     your loving aunt     i have ordered a chest of the rosolio to be sent from somersetshire    when it comes please to send half down here paying the carriage of    course  twill be an acceptable present to my kind entertainer mr    b  this letter was brought to me by mr brough himself at the office who apologised to me for having broken the seal by inadvertence for the letter had been mingled with some more of his own and he opened it without looking at the superscription  of course he had not read it and i was glad of that for i should not have liked him to see my aunts opinion of his daughter and lady  the next day a gentleman at toms coffeehouse cornhill sent me word at the office that he wanted particularly to speak to me and i stopped thither and found my old friend smithers of the house of hodge and smithers just off the coach with his carpetbag between his legs  sam my boy said he you are your aunts heir and i have a piece of news for you regarding her property which you ought to know  she wrote us down a letter for a chest of that homemade wine of hers which she calls rosolio and which lies in our warehouse along with her furniture  well says i smiling she may part with as much rosolio as she likes for me  i cede all my right  psha says smithers its not that though her furniture puts us to a deuced inconvenience to be sureits not that but in the postscript of her letter she orders us to advertise the slopperton and squashtail estates for immediate sale as she purposes placing her capital elsewhere  i know that the slopperton and squashtail property had been the source of a very pretty income to messrs  hodge and smithers for aunt was always at law with her tenants and paid dearly for her litigious spirit so that mr smitherss concern regarding the sale of it did not seem to me to be quite disinterested  and did you come to london mr smithers expressly to acquaint me with this fact  it seems to me you had much better have obeyed my aunts instructions at once or go to her at fulham and consult with her on this subject  sdeath mr titmarsh dont you see that if she makes a sale of her property she will hand over the money to brough and if brough gets the money he  will give her seven per cent for it instead of threetheres no harm in that  but theres such a thing as security look you  he is a warm man certainlyvery warmquite respectablemost undoubtedly respectable but who knows  a panic may take place and then these five hundred companies in which he is engaged may bring him to ruin  theres the ginger beer company of which brough is a director awkward reports are abroad concerning it  the consolidated baffins bay muff and tippet companythe shares are down very low and brough is a director there the patent pump companyshares at 65 and a fresh call which nobody will pay  nonsense mr smithers  has not mr brough five hundred thousand pounds worth of shares in the independent west diddlesex and is that at a discount  who recommended my aunt to invest her money in that speculation i should like to know  i had him there  well well it is a very good speculation certainly and has brought you three hundred a year sam my boy and you may thank us for the interest we took in you indeed we loved you as a son and miss hodge has not recovered a certain marriage yet  you dont intend to rebuke us for making your fortune do you  no hang it no says i and shook hands with him and accepted a glass of sherry and biscuits which he ordered forthwith  smithers returned however to the charge  sam he said mark my words and take your aunt away from the rookery  she wrote to mrs s a long account of a reverend gent with whom she walks out therethe reverend grimes wapshot  that man has an eye upon her  he was tried at lancaster in the year 14 for forgery and narrowly escaped with his neck  have a care of himhe has an eye to her money  nay said i taking out mrs hoggartys letter read for yourself  he read it over very carefully seemed to be amused by it and as he returned it to me well sam he said i have only two favours to ask of you one is not to mention that i am in town to any living soul and the other is to give me a dinner in lambs conduit street with your pretty wife  i promise you both gladly i said laughing  but if you dine with us your arrival in town must be known for my friend gus hoskins dines with us likewise and has done so nearly every day since my aunt went  he laughed too and said we must swear gus to secrecy over a bottle and so we parted till dinnertime  the indefatigable lawyer pursued his attack after dinner and was supported by gus and by my wife too who certainly was disinterested in the mattermore than disinterested for she would have given a great deal to be spared my aunts company  but she said she saw the force of mr smitherss arguments and i admitted their justice with a sigh however i rode my high horse and vowed that my aunt should do what she liked with her money and that i was not the man who would influence her in any way in the disposal of it  after tea the two gents walked away together and gus told me that smithers had asked him a thousand questions about the office about brough about me and my wife and everything concerning us  you are a lucky fellow mr hoskins and seem to be the friend of this charming young couple said smithers and gus confessed he was and said he had dined with us fifteen times in six weeks and that a better and more hospitable fellow than i did not exist  this i state not to trumpet my own praisesno no but because these questions of smitherss had a good deal to do with the subsequent events narrated in this little history  being seated at dinner the next day off the cold leg of mutton that smithers had admired so the day before and gus as usual having his legs under our mahogany a hackneycoach drove up to the door which we did not much heed a step was heard on the floor which we hoped might be for the twopair lodger when who should burst into the room but mrs hoggarty herself  gus who was blowing the froth off a pot of porter preparatory to a delicious drink of the beverage and had been making us die of laughing with his stories and jokes laid down the pewter pot as mrs h came in and looked quite sick and pale  indeed we all felt a little uneasy  my aunt looked haughtily in marys face then fiercely at gus and saying it is too truemy poor boyalready flung herself hysterically into my arms and swore almost choking that she would never never leave me  i could not understand the meaning of this extraordinary agitation on mrs hoggartys part nor could any of us  she refused marys hand when the poor thing rather nervously offered it and when gus timidly said i think sam im rather in the way here and perhapshad better go mrs h looked him full in the face pointed to the door majestically with her forefinger and said i think sir you had better go  i hope mr hoskins will stay as long as he pleases said my wife with spirit  of course you hope so madam answered mrs hoggarty very sarcastic but marys speech and my aunts were quite lost upon gus for he had instantly run to his hat and i heard him tumbling downstairs  the quarrel ended as usual by marys bursting into a fit of tears and by my aunts repeating the assertion that it was not too late she trusted and from that day forth she would never never leave me  what could have made aunt return and be so angry said i to mary that night as we were in our own room but my wife protested she did not know and it was only some time after that i found out the reason of this quarrel and of mrs hs sudden reappearance  the horrible fat coarse little smithers told me the matter as a very good joke only the other year when he showed me the letter of hickson dixon paxton and jackson which has before been quoted in my memoirs  sam my boy said he you were determined to leave mrs hoggarty in broughs clutches at the rookery and i was determined to have her away i resolved to kill two of your mortal enemies with one stone as it were it was quite clear to me that the reverend grimes wapshot had an eye to your aunts fortune and that mr brough had similar predatory intentions regarding her  predatory is a mild word sam if i had said robbery at once i should express my meaning clearer  well i took the fulham stage and arriving made straight for the lodgings of the reverend gentleman  sir said i on finding that worthy genthe was drinking warm brandyandwater sam at two oclock in the day or at least the room smelt very strongly of that beveragesir says i you were tried for forgery in the year 14 at lancaster assizes  and acquitted sir  my innocence was by providence made clear said wapshot  but you were not acquitted of embezzlement in 16 sir says i and passed two years in york gaol in consequence  i knew the fellows history for i had a writ out against him when he was a preacher at clifton  i followed up my blow  mr wapshot said i you are making love to an excellent lady now at the house of mr brough if you do not promise to give up all pursuit of her i will expose you  i have promised said wapshot rather surprised and looking more easy  i have given my solemn promise to mr brough who was with me this very morning storming and scolding and swearing  oh sir it would have frightened you to hear a christian babe like him swear as he did  mr brough been here says i rather astonished  yes i suppose you are both here on the same scent says wapshot  you want to marry the widow with the slopperton and squashtail estate do you  well well have your way  ive promised not to have anything more to do with the widow and a wapshots honour is sacred  i suppose sir says i mr brough has threatened to kick you out of doors if you call again  you have been with him i see says the reverend gent with a shrug then i remembered what you had told me of the broken seal of your letter and have not the slightest doubt that brough opened and read every word of it  well the first bird was bagged both i and brough had had a shot at him  now i had to fire at the whole rookery and off i went primed and loaded sirprimed and loaded  it was past eight when i arrived and i saw after i passed the lodge gates a figure that i knew walking in the shrubberythat of your respected aunt sir but i wished to meet the amiable ladies of the house before i saw her because look friend titmarsh i saw by mrs hoggartys letter that she and they were at daggers drawn and hoped to get her out of the house at once by means of a quarrel with them  i laughed and owned that mr smithers was a very cunning fellow  as luck would have it continued he miss brough was in the drawing room twangling on a guitar and singing most atrociously out of tune but as i entered at the door i cried hush to the footman as loud as possible stood stockstill and then walked forward on tiptoe lightly miss b could see in the glass every movement that i made she pretended not to see however and finished the song with a regular roulade  gracious heaven said i do madam pardon me for interrupting that delicious harmonyfor coming unaware upon it for daring uninvited to listen to it  do you come for mamma sir said miss brough with as much graciousness as her physiognomy could command  i am miss brough sir  i wish madam you would let me not breathe a word regarding my business until you have sung another charming strain  she did not sing but looked pleased and said la sir what is your business  my business is with a lady your respected fathers guest in this house  oh mrs hoggarty says miss brough flouncing towards the bell and ringing it  john send to mrs hoggarty in the shrubbery here is a gentleman who wants to see her  i know continued i mrs hoggartys peculiarities as well as anyone madam and aware that those and her education are not such as to make her a fit companion for you  i know you do not like her she has written to us in somersetshire that you do not like her  what she has been abusing us to her friends has she cried miss brough it was the very point i wished to insinuate  if she does not like us why does she not leave us  she has made rather a long visit said i and i am sure that her nephew and niece are longing for her return  pray madam do not move for you may aid me in the object for which i come  the object for which i came sir was to establish a regular battleroyal between the two ladies at the end of which i intended to appeal to mrs hoggarty and say that she ought really no longer to stay in a house with the members of which she had such unhappy differences well sir the battleroyal was foughtmiss belinda opening the fire by saying she understood mrs hoggarty had been calumniating her to her friends  but though at the end of it miss rushed out of the room in a rage and vowed she would leave her home unless that odious woman left it your dear aunt said ha ha  i know the minxs vile stratagems but thank heaven i have a good heart and my religion enables me to forgive her  i shall not leave her excellent papas house or vex by my departure that worthy admirable man  i then tried mrs h on the score of compassion  your niece said i mrs titmarsh madam has been of late sam says rather poorlyqualmish of mornings madama little nervous and low in spiritssymptoms madam that are scarcely to be mistaken in a young married person  mrs hoggarty said she had an admirable cordial that she would send mrs samuel titmarsh and she was perfectly certain it would do her good  with very great unwillingness i was obliged now to bring my last reserve into the field and may tell you what that was sam my boy now that the matter is so long passed  madam said i theres a matter about which i must speak though indeed i scarcely dare  i dined with your nephew yesterday and met at his table a young mana young man of low manners but evidently one who has blinded your nephew and i too much fear has succeeded in making an impression upon your niece  his name is hoskins madam and when i state that he who was never in the house during your presence there has dined with your too confiding nephew sixteen times in three weeks i may leave you to imagine what i dare notdare not imagine myself  the shot told  your aunt bounced up at once and in ten minutes more was in my carriage on our way back to london  there sir was not that generalship  and you played this pretty trick off at my wifes expense mr smithers said i  at your wifes expense certainly but for the benefit of both of you  its lucky sir that you are an old man i replied and that the affair happened ten years ago or by the lord mr smithers i would have given you such a horsewhipping as you never heard of  but this was the way in which mrs hoggarty was brought back to her relatives and this was the reason why we took that house in bernard street the doings at which must now he described     chapter x   of sams private affairs and of the firm of brough and hoff  we took a genteel house in bernard street russell square and my aunt sent for all her furniture from the country which would have filled two such houses but which came pretty cheap to us young housekeepers as we had only to pay the carriage of the goods from bristol  when i brought mrs h her third halfyears dividend having not for four months touched a shilling of her money i must say she gave me 50l of the 80l and told me that was ample pay for the board and lodging of a poor old woman like her who did not eat more than a sparrow  i have myself in the country seen her eat nine sparrows in a pudding but she was rich and i could not complain  if she saved 600l a year at the least by living with us why all the savings would one day come to me and so mary and i consoled ourselves and tried to manage matters as well as we might  it was no easy task to keep a mansion in bernard street and save money out of 470l a year which was my income  but what a lucky fellow i was to have such an income  as mrs hoggarty left the rookery in smitherss carriage mr brough with his four greys was entering the lodgegate and i should like to have seen the looks of these two gentlemen as the one was carrying the others prey off out of his own very den under his very nose  he came to see her the next day and protested that he would not leave the house until she left it with him that he had heard of his daughters infamous conduct and had seen her in tearsin tears madam and on her knees imploring heaven to pardon her  but mr b was obliged to leave the house without my aunt who had a causa major for staying and hardly allowed poor mary out of her sightopening every one of the letters that came into the house directed to my wife and suspecting hers to everybody  mary never told me of all this pain for many many years afterwards but had always a smiling face for her husband when he came home from his work  as for poor gus my aunt had so frightened him that he never once showed his nose in the place all the time we lived there but used to be content with news of mary of whom he was as fond as he was of me  mr brough when my aunt left him was in a furious illhumour with me he found fault with me ten times a day and openly before the gents of the office but i let him one day know pretty smartly that i was not only a servant but a considerable shareholder in the company that i defied him to find fault with my work or my regularity and that i was not minded to receive any insolent language from him or any man  he said it was always so that he had never cherished a young man in his bosom but the ingrate had turned on him that he was accustomed to wrong and undutifulness from his children and that he would pray that the sin might be forgiven me  a moment before he had been cursing and swearing at me and speaking to me as if i had been his shoeblack  but look you i was not going to put up with any more of madam broughs airs or of his  with me they might act as they thought fit but i did not choose that my wife should be passed over by them as she had been in the matter of the visit to fulham  brough ended by warning me of hodge and smithers  beware of these men said he but for my honesty your aunts landed property would have been sacrificed by these cormorants and when for her benefitwhich you obstinate young man will not perceivei wished to dispose of her land her attorneys actually had the audacitythe unchristian avarice i may sayto ask ten per cent commission on the sale  there might be some truth in this i thought at any rate when rogues fall out honest men come by their own and now i began to suspect i am sorry to say that both the attorney and the director had a little of the rogue in their composition  it was especially about my wifes fortune that mr b showed his cloven foot for proposing as usual that i should purchase shares with it in our company i told him that my wife was a minor and as such her little fortune was vested out of my control altogether  he flung away in a rage at this and i soon saw that he did not care for me any more by abednegos manner to me  no more holidays no more advances of money had i on the contrary the private clerkship at 150l was abolished and i found myself on my 250l a year again well what then it was always a good income and i did my duty and laughed at the director  about this time in the beginning of 1824 the jamaica ginger beer company shut up shopexploded as gus said with a bang  the patent pump shares were down to 15l upon a paidup capital of 65l  still ours were at a high premium and the independent west diddlesex held its head up as proudly as any office in london  roundhands abuse had had some influence against the director certainly for he hinted at malversation of shares but the company still stood as united as the hand inhand and as firm as the rock  to return to the state of affairs in bernard street russell square my aunts old furniture crammed our little rooms and my aunts enormous old jingling grand piano with crooked legs and half the strings broken occupied threefourths of the little drawingroom  here used mrs h to sit and play us for hours sonatas that were in fashion in lord charlevilles time and sung with a cracked voice till it was all that we could do to refrain from laughing  and it was queer to remark the change that had taken place in mrs hoggartys character now for whereas she was in the country among the topping persons of the village and quite content with a teaparty at six and a game of twopenny whist afterwardsin london she would never dine till seven would have a fly from the mews to drive in the park twice a week cut and uncut and ripped up and twisted over and over all her old gowns flounces caps and fallals and kept my poor mary from morning till night altering them to the present mode  mrs hoggarty moreover appeared in a new wig and i am sorry to say turned out with such a pair of red cheeks as nature never gave her and as made all the people in bernard street stare where they are not as yet used to such fashions  moreover she insisted upon our establishing a servant in liverya boy that is of about sixteenwho was dressed in one of the old liveries that she had brought with her from somersetshire decorated with new cuffs and collars and new buttons on the latter were represented the united crests of the titmarshes and hoggartys viz a tomtit rampant and a hog in armour  i thought this livery and crestbutton rather absurd i must confess though my family is very ancient  and heavens what a roar of laughter was raised in the office one day when the little servant in the big livery with the immense cane walked in and brought me a message from mrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty  furthermore all letters were delivered on a silver tray  if we had had a baby i believe aunt would have had it down on the tray but there was as yet no foundation for mr smitherss insinuation upon that score any more than for his other cowardly fabrication before narrated  aunt and mary used to walk gravely up and down the new road with the boy following with his great goldheaded stick but though there was all this ceremony and parade and aunt still talked of her acquaintances we did not see a single person from weeks end to weeks end and a more dismal house than ours could hardly be found in london town  on sundays mrs hoggarty used to go to st pancras church then just built and as handsome as covent garden theatre and of evenings to a meetinghouse of the anabaptists and that day at least mary and i had to ourselvesfor we chose to have seats at the foundling and heard the charming music there and my wife used to look wistfully in the pretty childrens facesand so for the matter of that did i  it was not however till a year after our marriage that she spoke in a way which shall be here passed over but which filled both her and me with inexpressible joy  i remember she had the news to give me on the very day when the muff and tippet company shut up after swallowing a capital of 300000l as some said and nothing to show for it except a treaty with some indians who had afterwards tomahawked the agent of the company  some people said there were no indians and no agent to be tomahawked at all but that the whole had been invented in a house in crutched friars  well i pitied poor tidd whose 20000l were thus gone in a year and whom i met in the city that day with a most ghastly face  he had 1000l of debts he said and talked of shooting himself but he was only arrested and passed a long time in the fleet  marys delightful news however soon put tidd and the muff and tippet company out of my head as you may fancy  other circumstances now occurred in the city of london which seemed to show that our director waswhat is not to be found in johnsons dictionaryrather shaky  three of his companies had broken four more were in a notoriously insolvent state and even at the meetings of the directors of the west diddlesex some stormy words passed which ended in the retirement of several of the board  friends of mr bs filled up their places mr puppet mr straw mr query and other respectable gents coming forward and joining the concern  brough and hoff dissolved partnership and mr b said he had quite enough to do to manage the i w d and intended gradually to retire from the other affairs  indeed such an association as ours was enough work for any man let alone the parliamentary duties which brough was called on to perform and the seventytwo lawsuits which burst upon him as principal director of the late companies  perhaps i should here describe the desperate attempts made by mrs hoggarty to introduce herself into genteel life  strange to say although we had my lord tiptoffs word to the contrary she insisted upon it that she and lady drum were intimately related and no sooner did she read in the morning post of the arrival of her ladyship and her granddaughters in london than she ordered the fly before mentioned and left cards at their respective houses her card that ismrs hoggarty of castle hoggarty magnificently engraved in gothic letters and flourishes and ours viz mr and mrs s titmarsh which she had printed for the purpose  she would have stormed lady jane prestons door and forced her way upstairs in spite of marys entreaties to the contrary had the footman who received her card given her the least encouragement but that functionary no doubt struck by the oddity of her appearance placed himself in the front of the door and declared that he had positive orders not to admit any strangers to his lady  on which mrs hoggarty clenched her fist out of the coachwindow and promised that she would have him turned away  yellowplush only burst out laughing at this and though aunt wrote a most indignant letter to mr edmund preston complaining of the insolence of the servants of that right honourable gent mr preston did not take any notice of her letter further than to return it with a desire that he might not be troubled with such impertinent visits for the future  a pretty day we had of it when this letter arrived owing to my aunts disappointment and rage in reading the contents for when solomon brought up the note on the silver teatray as usual my aunt seeing mr prestons seal and name at the corner of the letter which is the common way of writing adopted by those official gentsmy aunt i say seeing his name and seal cried now mary who is right and betted my wife a sixpence that the envelope contained an invitation to dinner  she never paid the sixpence though she lost but contented herself by abusing mary all day and said i was a poorspirited sneak for not instantly horsewhipping mr p  a pretty joke indeed  they would have hanged me in those days as they did the man who shot mr perceval  and now i should be glad to enlarge upon that experience in genteel life which i obtained through the perseverance of mrs hoggarty but it must be owned that my opportunities were but few lasting only for the brief period of six months and also genteel society has been fully described already by various authors of novels whose names need not here be set down but who being themselves connected with the aristocracy viz as members of noble families or as footmen or hangerson thereof naturally understand their subject a great deal better than a poor young fellow from a fireoffice can  there was our celebrated adventure in the opera house whither mrs h would insist upon conducting us and where in a room of the establishment called the crushroom where the ladies and gents after the music and dancing await the arrival of their carriages a pretty figure did our little solomon cut by the way with his big cane among the gentlemen of the shoulderknot assembled in the lobbywhere i say in the crushroom mrs h rushed up to old lady drum whom i pointed out to her and insisted upon claiming relationship with her ladyship  but my lady drum had only a memory when she chose as i may say and had entirely on this occasion thought fit to forget her connection with the titmarshes and hoggarties  far from recognising us indeed she called mrs hoggarty an ojus oman and screamed out as loud as possible for a policeofficer  this and other rebuffs made my aunt perceive the vanities of this wicked world as she said and threw her more and more into really serious society  she formed several very valuable acquaintances she said at the independent chapel and among others lighted upon her friend of the rookery mr grimes wapshot  we did not know then the interview which he had had with mr smithers nor did grimes think proper to acquaint us with the particulars of it but though i did acquaint mrs h with the fact that her favourite preacher had been tried for forgery she replied that she considered the story an atrocious calumny and he answered by saying that mary and i were in lamentable darkness and that we should infallibly find the way to a certain bottomless pit of which he seemed to know a great deal  under the reverend gentlemans guidance and advice she after a time separated from st pancras altogethersat under him as the phrase is regularly thrice a weekbegan to labour in the conversion of the poor of bloomsbury and st giless and made a deal of babylinen for distribution among those benighted people  she did not make any however for mrs sam titmarsh who now showed signs that such would be speedily necessary but let mary and my mother and sisters in somersetshire provide what was requisite for the coming event  i am not indeed sure that she did not say it was wrong on our parts to make any such provision and that we ought to let the morrow provide for itself  at any rate the reverend grimes wapshot drank a deal of brandyandwater at our house and dined there even oftener than poor gus used to do  but i had little leisure to attend to him and his doings for i must confess at this time i was growing very embarrassed in my circumstances and was much harassed both as a private and public character  as regards the former mrs hoggarty had given me 50l but out of that 50l i had to pay a journey post from somersetshire all the carriage of her goods from the country the painting papering and carpeting of my house the brandy and strong liquors drunk by the reverend grimes and his friends for the reverend gent said that rosolio did not agree with him and finally a thousand small bills and expenses incident to all housekeepers in the town of london  add to this i received just at the time when i was most in want of cash madame mantalinis bill messrs  howell and jamess ditto the account of baron von stiltz and the bill of mr polonius for the setting of the diamond pin  all these bills arrived in a week as they have a knack of doing and fancy my astonishment in presenting them to mrs hoggarty when she said well my dear you are in the receipt of a very fine income  if you choose to order dresses and jewels from firstrate shops you must pay for them and dont expect that i am to abet your extravagance or give you a shilling more than the munificent sum i pay you for board and lodging  how could i tell mary of this behaviour of mrs hoggarty and mary in such a delicate condition  and bad as matters were at home i am sorry to say at the office they began to look still worse  not only did roundhand leave but highmore went away  abednego became head clerk and one day old abednego came to the place and was shown into the directors private room when he left it he came trembling chattering and cursing downstairs and had begun shentlemen a speech to the very clerks in the office when mr brough with an imploring look and crying out stop till saturday at length got him into the street  on saturday abednego junior left the office for ever and i became head clerk with 400l a year salary  it was a fatal week for the office too  on monday when i arrived and took my seat at the head desk and my first read of the newspaper as was my right the first thing i read was frightful fire in houndsditch  total destruction of mr meshachs sealingwax manufactory and of mr shadrachs clothing depot adjoining in the former was 20000l worth of the finest dutch wax which the voracious element attacked and devoured in a twinkling  the latter estimable gentleman had just completed forty thousand suits of clothes for the cavalry of hh the cacique of poyais  both of these jewish gents who were connections of mr abednego were insured in our office to the full amount of their loss  the calamity was attributed to the drunkenness of a scoundrelly irish watchman who was employed on the premises and who upset a bottle of whisky in the warehouse of messrs shadrach and incautiously looked for the liquor with a lighted candle  the man was brought to our office by his employers and certainly as we all could testify was even then in a state of frightful intoxication  as if this were not sufficient in the obituary was announced the demise of alderman pashalderman callypash we used to call him in our lighter hours knowing his propensity to green fat but such a moment as this was no time for joking  he was insured by our house for 5000l  and now i saw very well the truth of a remark of gussviz that lifeassurance companies go on excellently for a year or two after their establishment but that it is much more difficult to make them profitable when the assured parties begin to die  the jewish fires were the heaviest blows we had had for though the waddingley cottonmills had been burnt in 1822 at a loss to the company of 80000l and though the patent erostratus match manufactory had exploded in the same year at a charge of 14000l there were those who said that the loss had not been near so heavy as was supposednay that the company had burnt the abovenamed establishments as advertisements for themselves  of these facts i cant be positive having never seen the early accounts of the concern  contrary to the expectation of all us gents who were ourselves as dismal as mutes mr brough came to the office in his coachandfour laughing and joking with a friend as he stepped out at the door  gentlemen said he you have read the papers they announce an event which i most deeply deplore  i mean the demise of the excellent alderman pash one of our constituents  but if anything can console me for the loss of that worthy man it is to think that his children and widow will receive at eleven oclock next saturday 5000l from my friend mr titmarsh who is now head clerk here  as for the accident which has happened to messrs shadrach and meshachin that at least there is nothing that can occasion any person sorrow  on saturday next or as soon as the particulars of their loss can be satisfactorily ascertained my friend mr titmarsh will pay to them across the counter a sum of forty fifty eighty one hundred thousand poundsaccording to the amount of their loss  they at least will be remunerated and though to our proprietors the outlay will no doubt be considerable yet we can afford it gentlemen  john brough can afford it himself for the matter of that and not be very much embarrassed and we must learn to bear ill fortune as we have hitherto borne good and show ourselves to be men always  mr b concluded with some allusions which i confess i dont like to give here for to speak of heaven in connection with common worldly matters has always appeared to me irreverent and to bring it to bear witness to the lie in his mouth as a religious hypocrite does is such a frightful crime that one should be careful even in alluding to it  mr broughs speech somehow found its way into the newspapers of that very evening nor can i think who gave a report of it for none of our gents left the office that day until the evening papers had appeared  but there was the speechay and at the weeks end although roundhand was heard on change that day declaring he would bet five to one that alderman pashs money would never be paidat the weeks end the money was paid by me to mrs pashs solicitor across the counter and no doubt roundhand lost his money  shall i tell how the money was procured  there can be no harm in mentioning the matter now after twenty years lapse of time and moreover it is greatly to the credit of two individuals now dead  as i was head clerk i had occasion to be frequently in broughs room and he now seemed once more disposed to take me into his confidence  titmarsh my boy said he one day to me after looking me hard in the face did you ever hear of the fate of the great mr silberschmidt of london  of course i had  mr silberschmidt the rothschild of his day indeed i have heard the latter famous gent was originally a clerk in silberschmidts housesilberschmidt fancying he could not meet his engagements committed suicide and had he lived till four oclock that day would have known that he was worth 400000l  to tell you frankly the truth says mr b i am in silberschmidts case  my late partner hoff has given bills in the name of the firm to an enormous amount and i have been obliged to meet them  i have been cast in fourteen actions brought by creditors of that infernal ginger beer company and all the debts are put upon my shoulders on account of my known wealth  now unless i have time i cannot pay and the long and short of the matter is that if i cannot procure 5000l before saturday our concern is ruined  what the west diddlesex ruined says i thinking of my poor mothers annuity  impossible our business is splendid  we must have 5000l on saturday and we are saved and if you will as you can get it for me i will give you 10000l for the money  b then showed me to a fraction the accounts of the concern and his own private account proving beyond the possibility of a doubt that with the 5000l our office must be set agoing and without it that the concern must stop  no matter how he proved the thing but there is you know a dictum of a statesman that give him but leave to use figures and he will prove anything  i promised to ask mrs hoggarty once more for the money and she seemed not to be disinclined  i told him so and that day he called upon her his wife called upon her his daughter called upon her and once more the brough carriageandfour was seen at our house  but mrs brough was a bad manager and instead of carrying matters with a high hand fairly burst into tears before mrs hoggarty and went down on her knees and besought her to save dear john  this at once aroused my aunts suspicions and instead of lending the money she wrote off to mr smithers instantly to come up to her desired me to give her up the 3000l scrip shares that i possessed called me an atrocious cheat and heartless swindler and vowed i had been the cause of her ruin  how was mr brough to get the money  i will tell you  being in his room one day old gates the fulham porter came and brought him from mr balls the pawnbroker a sum of 1200l  missus told him he said to carry the plate to mr balls and having paid the money old gates fumbled a great deal in his pockets and at last pulled out a 5l note which he said his daughter jane had just sent him from service and begged mr b would let him have another share in the company  he was mortal sure it would go right yet  and when he heard master crying and cursing as he and missus were walking in the shrubbery and saying that for the want of a few poundsa few shillingsthe finest fortune in europe was to be overthrown why gates and his woman thought that they should come forard to be sure with all they could to help the kindest master and missus ever was  this was the substance of gatess speech and mr brough shook his hand andtook the 5l  gates said he that 5l note shall be the best outlay you ever made in your life and i have no doubt it wasbut it was in heaven that poor old gates was to get the interest of his little mite  nor was this the only instance  mrs broughs sister miss dough who had been on bad terms with the director almost ever since he had risen to be a great man came to the office with a power of attorney and said john isabella has been with me this morning and says you want money and i have brought you my 4000l it is all i have john and pray god it may do you goodyou and my dear sister who was the best sister in the world to metilltill a little time ago  and she laid down the paper i was called up to witness it and brough with tears in his eyes told me her words for he could trust me he said  and thus it was that i came to be present at gatess interview with his master which took place only an hour afterwards  brave mrs brough how she was working for her husband  good woman and kind but you had a true heart and merited a better fate  though wherefore say so  the woman to this day thinks her husband an angel and loves him a thousand times better for his misfortunes  on saturday alderman pashs solicitor was paid by me across the counter as i said  never mind your aunts money titmarsh my boy said brough never mind her having resumed her shares  you are a true honest fellow you have never abused me like that pack of curs downstairs and ill make your fortune yet        the next week as i was sitting with my wife with mr smithers and with mrs hoggarty taking our tea comfortably a knock was heard at the door and a gentleman desired to speak to me in the parlour  it was mr aminadab of chancery lane who arrested me as a shareholder of the independent west diddlesex association at the suit of von stiltz of clifford street tailor and draper  i called down smithers and told him for heavens sake not to tell mary  where is brough says mr smithers  why says mr aminadab hes once more of the firm of brough and off sirhe breakfasted at calais this morning     chapter xi   in which it appears that a man may possess a diamond and yet be very hard pressed for a dinner  on that fatal saturday evening in a hackneycoach fetched from the foundling was i taken from my comfortable house and my dear little wife whom mr smithers was left to console as he might  he said that i was compelled to take a journey upon business connected with the office and my poor mary made up a little portmanteau of clothes and tied a comforter round my neck and bade my companion particularly to keep the coach windows shut which injunction the grinning wretch promised to obey  our journey was not long it was only a shilling fare to cursitor street chancery lane and there i was set down  the house before which the coach stopped seemed to be only one of halfa dozen in that street which were used for the same purpose  no man be he ever so rich can pass by those dismal houses i think without a shudder  the front windows are barred and on the dingy pillar of the door was a shining brassplate setting forth that aminadab officer to the sheriff of middlesex lived therein  a little redhaired israelite opened the first door as our coach drove up and received me and my baggage  as soon as we entered the door he barred it and i found myself in the face of another huge door which was strongly locked and at last passing through that we entered the lobby of the house  there is no need to describe it  it is very like ten thousand other houses in our dark city of london  there was a dirty passage and a dirty stair and from the passage two dirty doors let into two filthy rooms which had strong bars at the windows and yet withal an air of horrible finery that makes me uncomfortable to think of even yet  on the walls hung all sorts of trumpery pictures in tawdry frames how different from those capital performances of my cousin michael angelo on the mantelpiece huge french clocks vases and candlesticks on the sideboards enormous trays of birmingham plated ware for mr aminadab not only arrested those who could not pay money but lent it to those who could and had already in the way of trade sold and bought these articles many times over  i agreed to take the backparlour for the night and while a hebrew damsel was arranging a little dusky sofabedstead woe betide him who has to sleep on it i was invited into the front parlour where mr aminadab bidding me take heart told me i should have a dinner for nothing with a party who had just arrived  i did not want for dinner but i was glad not to be alonenot alone even till gus came for whom i despatched a messenger to his lodgings hard by  i found there in the front parlour at eight oclock in the evening four gentlemen just about to sit down to dinner  surprising there was mr b a gentleman of fashion who had only within halfanhour arrived in a postchaise with his companion mr lock an officer of horsham gaol  mr b was arrested in this wisehe was a careless goodhumoured gentleman and had indorsed bills to a large amount for a friend who a man of high family and unquestionable honour had pledged the latter along with a number of the most solemn oaths for the payment of the bills in question  having indorsed the notes young mr b with a proper thoughtlessness forgot all about them and so by some chance did the friend whom he obliged for instead of being in london with the money for the payment of his obligations this latter gentleman was travelling abroad and never hinted one word to mr b that the notes would fall upon him  the young gentleman was at brighton lying sick of a fever was taken from his bed by a bailiff and carried on a rainy day to horsham gaol had a relapse of his complaint and when sufficiently recovered was brought up to london to the house of mr aminadab where i found hima pale thin goodhumoured lost young man he was lying on a sofa and had given orders for the dinner to which i was invited  the lads face gave one pain to look at it was impossible not to see that his hours were numbered  now mr b has not anything to do with my humble story but i cant help mentioning him as i saw him  he sent for his lawyer and his doctor the former settled speedily his accounts with the bailiff and the latter arranged all his earthly accounts for after he went from the spunging house he never recovered from the shock of the arrest and in a few weeks he died  and though this circumstance took place many years ago i cant forget it to my dying day and often see the author of mr bs deatha prosperous gentleman riding a fine horse in the park lounging at the window of a club with many friends no doubt and a good reputation  i wonder whether the man sleeps easily and eats with a good appetite  i wonder whether he has paid mr bs heirs the sum which that gentleman paid and died for  if mr bs history has nothing to do with mine and is only inserted here for the sake of a moral what business have i to mention particulars of the dinner to which i was treated by that gentleman in the spunging house in cursitor street  why for the moral too and therefore the public must be told of what really and truly that dinner consisted  there were five guests and three silver tureens of soup viz mockturtle soup oxtail soup and giblet soup  next came a great piece of salmon likewise on a silver dish a roast goose a roast saddle of mutton roast game and all sorts of adjuncts  in this way can a gentleman live in a spunginghouse if he be inclined and over this repast which in truth i could not touch for let alone having dined my heart was full of careover this meal my friend gus hoskins found me when he received the letter that i had despatched to him  gus who had never been in a prison before and whose heart failed him as the redheaded young moses opened and shut for him the numerous iron outer doors was struck dumb to see me behind a bottle of claret in a room blazing with gilt lamps the curtains were down too and you could not see the bars at the windows and mr b mr lock the brighton officer mr aminadab and another rich gentleman of his trade and religious persuasion were chirping as merrily and looked as respectably as any noblemen in the land  have him in said mr b if hes a friend of mr titmarshs for cuss me i like to see a rogue and run me through titmarsh but i think you are one of the best in london  you beat brough you do by jove for he looks like a rogueanybody would swear to him but you by jove you look the very picture of honesty  a deep file said aminadab winking and pointing me out to his friend mr jehoshaphat  a good one says jehoshaphat  in for three hundred thousand pound says aminadab broughs right hand man and only threeandtwenty  mr titmarsh sir your ealth sir says mr lock in an ecstasy of admiration  your very good earth sir and better luck to you next time  pooh pooh hes all right says aminadab let him alone  in for what shouted i quite amazed  why sir you arrested me for 90l  yes but you are in for half a millionyou know you are  them debts i dont countthem paltry tradesmens accounts  i mean broughs business  its an ugly one but youll get through it  we all know you and i lay my life that when you come through the court mrs titmarsh has got a handsome thing laid by  mrs titmarsh has a small property says i  what then  the three gentlemen burst into a loud laugh said i was a rum chapa downy cove and made other remarks which i could not understand then but the meaning of which i have since comprehended for they took me to be a great rascal i am sorry to say and supposed that i had robbed the i w d association and in order to make my money secure settled it on my wife  it was in the midst of this conversation that as i said gus came in and whew when he saw what was going on he gave such a whistle  herr von joel by jove says aminadab  at which all laughed  sit down says mr bsit down and wet your whistle my piper  i say egad youre the piper that played before moses  had you there dab  dab get a fresh bottle of burgundy for mr hoskins  and before he knew where he was there was gus for the first time in his life drinking closvougeot  gus said he had never tasted bergamy before at which the bailiff sneered and told him the name of the wine  old clo  what says gus and we laughed but the hebrew gents did not this time  come come sir says mr aminadabs friend vere all shentlemen here and shentlemen never makish reflexunsh upon other gentlemensh pershuashunsh  after this feast was concluded gus and i retired to my room to consult about my affairs  with regard to the responsibility incurred as a shareholder in the west diddlesex i was not uneasy for though the matter might cause me a little trouble at first i knew i was not a shareholder that the shares were scrip shares making the dividend payable to the bearer and my aunt had called back her shares and consequently i was free  but it was very unpleasant to me to consider that i was in debt nearly a hundred pounds to tradesmen chiefly of mrs hoggartys recommendation and as she had promised to be answerable for their bills i determined to send her a letter reminding her of her promise and begging her at the same time to relieve me from mr von stiltzs debt for which i was arrested and which was incurred not certainly at her desire but at mr broughs and would never have been incurred by me but at the absolute demand of that gentleman  i wrote to her therefore begging her to pay all these debts and promised myself on monday morning again to be with my dear wife  gus carried off the letter and promised to deliver it in bernhard street after churchtime taking care that mary should know nothing at all of the painful situation in which i was placed  it was near midnight when we parted and i tried to sleep as well as i could in the dirty little sofabedstead of mr aminadabs backparlour  that morning was fine and sunshiny and i heard all the bells ringing cheerfully for church and longed to be walking to the foundling with my wife but there were the three iron doors between me and liberty and i had nothing for it but to read my prayers in my own room and walk up and down afterwards in the court at the back of the house  would you believe it  this very court was like a cage great iron bars covered it in from one end to another and here it was that mr aminadabs gaolbirds took the air  they had seen me reading out of the prayerbook at the backparlour window and all burst into a yell of laughter when i came to walk in the cage  one of them shouted out amen when i appeared another called me a muff which means in the slang language a very silly fellow a third wondered that i took to my prayerbook yet  when do you mean sir says i to the fellowa rough man a horsedealer  why when you are going to be hanged you young hypocrite says the man  but that is always the way with broughs people continued he  i had four greys once for hima great bargain but he would not go to look at them at tattersalls nor speak a word of business about them because it was a sunday  because there are hypocrites sir says i religion is not to be considered a bad thing and if mr brough would not deal with you on a sunday he certainly did his duty  the men only laughed the more at this rebuke and evidently considered me a great criminal  i was glad to be released from their society by the appearance of gus and mr smithers  both wore very long faces  they were ushered into my room and without any orders of mine a bottle of wine and biscuits were brought in by mr aminadab which i really thought was very kind of him  drink a glass of wine mr titmarsh says smithers and read this letter  a pretty note was that which you sent to your aunt this morning and here you have an answer to it  i drank the wine and trembled rather as i read as follows     sirif because you knew i had desined to leave you my proparty    you wished to murdar me and so stepp into it you are dissapointed    your villiany and ingratitude would have murdard me had i not by    heavens grace been inabled to look for consalation elsewhere     for nearly a year i have been a martar to you  i gave up    everythingmy happy home in the country where all respected the    name of hoggarty my valuble furnitur and wines my plate glass and    crockry i brought allall to make your home happy and rispectable  i    put up with the airs and impertanencies of mrs titmarsh i loaded    her and you with presents and bennafits  i sacrafised myself i gave    up the best sociaty in the land to witch i have been accustomed in    order to be a gardian and compannion to you and prevent if possible    that waist and ixtravygance which i prophycied would be your ruin    such waist and ixtravygance never never never did i see  buttar    waisted as if it had been dirt coles flung away candles burnt at    both ends tea and meat the same  the butchers bill in this house    was enough to support six famalies     and now you have the audassaty being placed in prison justly for    your crimesfor cheating me of 3000l for robbing your mother of    an insignificient summ which to her poor thing was everything    though she will not feel her loss as i do being all her life next    door to a beggar for incurring detts which you cannot pay wherein    you knew that your miserable income was quite unable to support your    ixtravyganceyou come upon me to pay your detts  no sir it is    quite enough that your mother should go on the parish and that your    wife should sweep the streets to which you have indeed brought them    i at least though cheated by you of a large summ and obliged to    pass my days in comparative ruin can retire and have some of the    comforts to which my rank entitles me  the furnitur in this house is    mine and as i presume you intend your lady to sleep in the streets    i give you warning that i shall remove it all tomorrow     mr smithers will tell you that i had intended to leave you my intire    fortune  i have this morning in his presents solamly toar up my    will and hereby renounce all connection with you and your beggarly    family     susan hoggarty     psi took a viper into my bosom and it stung me  i confess that on the first reading of this letter i was in such a fury that i forgot almost the painful situation in which it plunged me and the ruin hanging over me  what a fool you were titmarsh to write that letter said mr smithers  you have cut your own throat sirlost a fine propertywritten yourself out of five hundred a year  mrs hoggarty my client brought the will as she says downstairs and flung it into the fire before our faces  its a blessing that your wife was from home added gus  she went to church this morning with dr salts family and sent word that she would spend the day with them  she was always glad to be away from mrs h you know  she never knew on which side her bread was buttered said mr smithers you should have taken the lady when she was in the humour sir and have borrowed the money elsewhere  why sir i had almost reconciled her to her loss in that cursed company  i showed her how i had saved out of broughs claws the whole of her remaining fortune which he would have devoured in a day the scoundrel  and if you would have left the matter to me mr titmarsh i would have had you reconciled completely to mrs hoggarty i would have removed all your difficulties i would have lent you the pitiful sum of money myself  will you says gus thats a trump and he seized smitherss hand and squeezed it so that the tears came into the attorneys eyes  generous fellow said i lend me money when you know what a situation i am in and not able to pay  ay my good sir theres the rub says mr smithers  i said i would have lent the money and so to the acknowledged heir of mrs hoggarty i wouldwould at this moment for nothing delights the heart of bob smithers more than to do a kindness  i would have rejoiced in doing it and a mere acknowledgment from that respected lady would have amply sufficed  but now sir the case is alteredyou have no security to offer as you justly observe  not a whit certainly  and without security sir of course can expect no moneyof course not you are a man of the world mr titmarsh and i see our notions exactly agree  theres his wifes property says gus  wifes property  bah  mrs sam titmarsh is a minor and cant touch a shilling of it  no no no meddling with minors for me  but stopyour mother has a house and shop in our village  get me a mortgage of that  ill do no such thing sir says i  my mother has suffered quite enough on my score already and has my sisters to provide for and i will thank you mr smithers not to breathe a syllable to her regarding my present situation  you speak like a man of honour sir says mr smithers and i will obey your injunctions to the letter  i will do more sir  i will introduce you to a respectable firm here my worthy friends messrs higgs biggs and blatherwick who will do everything in their power to serve you  and so sir i wish you a very good morning  and with this mr smithers took his hat and left the room and after a further consultation with my aunt as i heard afterwards quitted london that evening by the mail  i sent my faithful gus off once more to break the matter gently to my wife fearing lest mrs hoggarty should speak of it abruptly to her as i knew in her anger she would do  but he came in an hour panting back to say that mrs h had packed and locked her trunks and had gone off in a hackneycoach  so knowing that my poor mary was not to return till night hoskins remained with me till then and after a dismal day left me once more at nine to carry the dismal tidings to her  at ten oclock on that night there was a great rattling and ringing at the outer door and presently my poor girl fell into my arms and gus hoskins sat blubbering in a corner as i tried my best to console her        the next morning i was favoured with a visit from mr blatherwick who hearing from me that i had only three guineas in my pocket told me very plainly that lawyers only lived by fees  he recommended me to quit cursitor street as living there was very expensive  and as i was sitting very sad my wife made her appearance it was with great difficulty that she could be brought to leave me the night previous  the horrible men came at four this morning said she four hours before light  what horrible men says i  your aunts men said she to remove the furniture they had it all packed before i came away  and i let them carry all said she i was too sad to look what was ours and what was not  that odious mr wapshot was with them and i left him seeing the last waggonload from the door i have only brought away your clothes added she and a few of mine and some of the books you used to like to read and somesome things i have been getting for thefor the baby  the servants wages were paid up to christmas and i paid them the rest  and see just as i was going away the post came and brought to me my halfyears income35l dear sam  isnt it a blessing  will you pay my bill mr whatdyecallim here cried mr aminadab flinging open the door he had been consulting with mr blatherwick i suppose  i want the room for a gentleman  i guess its too dear for the like of you  and herewill you believe itthe man handed me a bill of three guineas for two days board and lodging in his odious house        there was a crowd of idlers round the door as i passed out of it and had i been alone i should have been ashamed of seeing them but as it was i was only thinking of my dear dear wife who was leaning trustfully on my arm and smiling like heaven into my faceay and took heaven too into the fleet prison with meor an angel out of heaven  ah i had loved her before and happy it is to love when one is hopeful and young in the midst of smiles and sunshine but be unhappy and then see what it is to be loved by a good woman  i declare before heaven that of all the joys and happy moments it has given me that was the crowning onethat little ride with my wifes cheek on my shoulder down holborn to the prison  do you think i cared for the bailiff that sat opposite no by the lord  i kissed her and hugged heryes and cried with her likewise  but before our ride was over her eyes dried up and she stepped blushing and happy out of the coach at the prison door as if she were a princess going to the queens drawingroom     chapter xii   in which the heros aunts diamond makes acquaintance with the heros uncle  the failure of the great diddlesex association speedily became the theme of all the newspapers and every person concerned in it was soon held up to public abhorrence as a rascal and a swindler  it was said that brough had gone off with a million of money  even it was hinted that poor i had sent a hundred thousand pounds to america and only waited to pass through the court in order to be a rich man for the rest of my days  this opinion had some supporters in the prison where strange to say it procured me considerationof which as may be supposed i was little inclined to avail myself  mr aminadab however in his frequent visits to the fleet persisted in saying that i was a poorspirited creature a mere tool in broughs hands and had not saved a shilling  opinions however differed and i believe it was considered by the turnkeys that i was a fellow of exquisite dissimulation who had put on the appearance of poverty in order more effectually to mislead the public  messrs abednego and son were similarly held up to public odium and in fact what were the exact dealings of these gentlemen with mr brough i have never been able to learn  it was proved by the books that large sums of money had been paid to mr abednego by the company but he produced documents signed by mr brough which made the latter and the west diddlesex association his debtors to a still further amount  on the day i went to the bankruptcy court to be examined mr abednego and the two gentlemen from houndsditch were present to swear to their debts and made a sad noise and uttered a vast number of oaths in attestation of their claim  but messrs jackson and paxton produced against them that very irish porter who was said to have been the cause of the fire and i am told hinted that they had matter for hanging the jewish gents if they persisted in their demand  on this they disappeared altogether and no more was ever heard of their losses  i am inclined to believe that our director had had money from abednegohad given him shares as bonus and securityhad been suddenly obliged to redeem these shares with ready money and so had precipitated the ruin of himself and the concern  it is needless to say here in what a multiplicity of companies brough was engaged  that in which poor mr tidd invested his money did not pay 2d in the pound and that was the largest dividend paid by any of them  as for oursah there was a pretty scene as i was brought from the fleet to the bankruptcy court to give my testimony as late head clerk and accountant of the west diddlesex association  my poor wife then very near her time insisted upon accompanying me to basinghall street and so did my friend gus hoskins that true and honest fellow  if you had seen the crowd that was assembled and the hubbub that was made as i was brought up  mr titmarsh says the commissioner as i came to the table with a peculiar sarcastic accent on the titmr titmarsh you were the confidant of mr brough the principal clerk of mr brough and a considerable shareholder in the company  only a nominal one sir said i  of course only nominal continued the commissioner turning to his colleague with a sneer and a great comfort it must be to you sir to think that you had a share in all the plunthe profits of the speculation and now can free yourself from the losses by saying you are only a nominal shareholder  the infernal villain shouted out a voice from the crowd  it was that of the furious halfpay captain and late shareholder captain sparr  silence in the court there the commissioner continued and all this while mary was anxiously looking in his face and then in mine as pale as death while gus on the contrary was as red as vermilion  mr titmarsh i have had the good fortune to see a list of your debts from the insolvent court and find that you are indebted to mr stiltz the great tailor in a handsome sum to mr polonius the celebrated jeweller likewise to fashionable milliners and dressmakers moreoverand all this upon a salary of 200l per annum  for so young a gentleman it must be confessed you have employed your time well  has this anything to do with the question sir says i  am i here to give an account of my private debts or to speak as to what i know regarding the affairs of the company  as for my share in it i have a mother sir and many sisters  the dd scoundrel shouts the captain  silence that there fellow shouts gus as bold as brass at which the court burst out laughing and this gave me courage to proceed  my mother sir four years since having a legacy of 400l left to her advised with her solicitor mr smithers how she should dispose of this sum and as the independent west diddlesex was just then established the money was placed in an annuity in that office where i procured a clerkship  you may suppose me a very hardened criminal because i have ordered clothes of mr von stiltz but you will hardly fancy that i a lad of nineteen knew anything of the concerns of the company into whose service i entered as twentieth clerk my own mothers money paying as it were for my place  well sir the interest offered by the company was so tempting that a rich relative of mine was induced to purchase a number of shares  who induced your relative if i may make so bold as to inquire  i cant help owning sir says i blushing that i wrote a letter myself  but consider my relative was sixty years old and i was twenty one  my relative took several months to consider and had the advice of her lawyers before she acceded to my request  and i made it at the instigation of mr brough who dictated the letter which i wrote and who i really thought then was as rich as mr rothschild himself  your friend placed her money in your name and you if i mistake not mr titmarsh were suddenly placed over the heads of twelve of your fellowclerks as a reward for your service in obtaining it  it is very true sirand as i confessed it poor mary began to wipe her eyes and guss ears i could not see his face looked like two red hot muffinsits quite true sir and as matters have turned out i am heartily sorry for what i did  but at the time i thought i could serve my aunt as well as myself and you must remember then how high our shares were  well sir having procured this sum of money you were straightway taken into mr broughs confidence  you were received into his house and from third clerk speedily became head clerk in which post you were found at the disappearance of your worthy patron  sir you have no right to question me to be sure but here are a hundred of our shareholders and im not unwilling to make a clean breast of it said i pressing marys hand  i certainly was the head clerk and why  because the other gents left the office  i certainly was received into mr broughs house  and why  because sir my aunt had more money to lay out  i see it all clearly now though i could not understand it then and the proof that mr brough wanted my aunts money and not me is that when she came to town our director carried her by force out of my house to fulham and never so much as thought of asking me or my wife thither  ay sir and he would have had her remaining money had not her lawyer from the country prevented her disposing of it before the concern finally broke and as soon as she heard there was doubt concerning it she took back her sharesscrip shares they were sir as you knowand has disposed of them as she thought fit  here sir and gents says i you have the whole of the history as far as regards me  in order to get her only son a means of livelihood my mother placed her little money with the companyit is lost  my aunt invested larger sums with it which were to have been mine one day and they are lost too and here am i at the end of four years a disgraced and ruined man  is there anyone present however much he has suffered by the failure of the company that has had worse fortune through it than i  mr titmarsh says mr commissioner in a much more friendly way and at the same time casting a glance at a newspaper reporter that was sitting hard by your story is not likely to get into the newspapers for as you say it is a private affair which you had no need to speak of unless you thought proper and may be considered as a confidential conversation between us and the other gentlemen here  but if it could be made public it might do some good and warn people if they will be warned against the folly of such enterprises as that in which you have been engaged  it is quite clear from your story that you have been deceived as grossly as anyone of the persons present  but look you sir if you had not been so eager after gain i think you would not have allowed yourself to be deceived and would have kept your relatives money and inherited it according to your story one day or other directly people expect to make a large interest their judgment seems to desert them and because they wish for profit they think they are sure of it and disregard all warnings and all prudence  besides the hundreds of honest families who have been ruined by merely placing confidence in this association of yours and who deserve the heartiest pity there are hundreds more who have embarked in it like yourself not for investment but for speculation and these upon my word deserve the fate they have met with  as long as dividends are paid no questions are asked and mr brough might have taken the money for his shareholders on the highroad and they would have pocketed it and not been too curious  but whats the use of talking says mr commissioner in a passion here is one rogue detected and a thousand dupes made and if another swindler starts tomorrow there will be a thousand more of his victims round this table a year hence and so i suppose to the end  and now lets go to business gentlemen and excuse this sermon  after giving an account of all i knew which was very little other gents who were employed in the concern were examined and i went back to prison with my poor little wife on my arm  we had to pass through the crowd in the rooms and my heart bled as i saw amongst a score of others poor gates broughs porter who had advanced every shilling to his master and was now with ten children houseless and penniless in his old age  captain sparr was in this neighbourhood but by no means so friendly disposed for while gates touched his hat as if i had been a lord the little captain came forward threatening with his bamboocane and swearing with great oaths that i was an accomplice of brough  curse you for a smoothfaced scoundrel says he  what business have you to ruin an english gentleman as you have me  and again he advanced with his stick  but this time officer as he was gus took him by the collar and shoved him back and said look at the lady you brute and hold your tongue  and when he looked at my wifes situation captain sparr became redder for shame than he had before been for anger  im sorry shes married to such a goodfornothing muttered he and fell back and my poor wife and i walked out of the court and back to our dismal room in the prison  it was a hard place for a gentle creature like her to be confined in and i longed to have some of my relatives with her when her time should come but her grandmother could not leave the old lieutenant and my mother had written to say that as mrs hoggarty was with us she was quite as well at home with her children  what a blessing it is for you under your misfortunes continued the good soul to have the generous purse of your aunt for succour  generous purse of my aunt indeed  where could mrs hoggarty be  it was evident that she had not written to any of her friends in the country nor gone thither as she threatened  but as my mother had already lost so much money through my unfortunate luck and as she had enough to do with her little pittance to keep my sisters at home and as on hearing of my condition she would infallibly have sold her last gown to bring me aid mary and i agreed that we would not let her know what our real condition wasbad enough heaven knows and sad and cheerless  old lieutenant smith had likewise nothing but his halfpay and his rheumatism so we were in fact quite friendless  that period of my life and that horrible prison seem to me like recollections of some fever  what an awful placenot for the sadness strangely enough as i thought but for the gaiety of it for the long prison galleries were i remember full of life and a sort of grave bustle  all day and all night doors were clapping to and fro and you heard loud voices oaths footsteps and laughter  next door to our room was one where a man sold gin under the name of tape and here from morning till night the people kept up a horrible revelryand sangsad songs some of them but my dear little girl was thank god unable to understand the most part of their ribaldry  she never used to go out till nightfall and all day she sat working at a little store of caps and dresses for the expected strangerand not she says to this day unhappy  but the confinement sickened her who had been used to happy country air and she grew daily paler and paler  the fives court was opposite our window and here i used very unwillingly at first but afterwards i do confess with much eagerness to take a couple of hours daily sport  ah it was a strange place there was an aristocracy there as elsewhereamongst other gents a son of my lord deuceace and many of the men in the prison were as eager to walk with him and talked of his family as knowingly as if they were bond street bucks  poor tidd especially was one of these  of all his fortune he had nothing left but a dressingcase and a flowered dressing gown and to these possessions he added a fine pair of moustaches with which the poor creature strutted about and though cursing his ill fortune was i do believe as happy whenever his friends brought him a guinea as he had been during his brief career as a gentleman on town  i have seen sauntering dandies in wateringplaces ogling the women watching eagerly for steamboats and stagecoaches as if their lives depended upon them and strutting all day in jackets up and down the public walks  well there are such fellows in prison quite as dandified and foolish only a little more shabbydandies with dirty beards and holes at their elbows  i did not go near what is called the poor side of the prisoni dared not that was the fact  but our little stock of money was running low and my heart sickened to think what might be my dear wifes fate and on what sort of a couch our child might be born  but heaven spared me that pangheaven and my dear good friend gus hoskins  the attorneys to whom mr smithers recommended me told me that i could get leave to live in the rules of the fleet could i procure sureties to the marshal of the prison for the amount of the detainer lodged against me but though i looked mr blatherwick hard in the face he never offered to give the bail for me and i knew no housekeeper in london who would procure it  there was however one whom i did not knowand that was old mr hoskins the leatherseller of skinner street a kind fat gentleman who brought his fat wife to see mrs titmarsh and though the lady gave herself rather patronising airs her husband being free of the skinners company and bidding fair to be alderman nay lord mayor of the first city in the world she seemed heartily to sympathise with us and her husband stirred and bustled about until the requisite leave was obtained and i was allowed comparative liberty  as for lodgings they were soon had  my old landlady mrs stokes sent her jemima to say that her first floor was at our service and when we had taken possession of it and i offered at the end of the week to pay her bill the good soul with tears in her eyes told me that she did not want for money now and that she knew i had enough to do with what i had i did not refuse her kindness for indeed i had but five guineas left and ought not by rights to have thought of such expensive apartments as hers but my wifes time was very near and i could not bear to think that she should want for any comfort in her lyingin  the admirable woman with whom the misses hoskins came every day to keep companyand very nice kind ladies they arerecovered her health a good deal now she was out of the odious prison and was enabled to take exercise  how gaily did we pace up and down bridge street and chatham place to be sure and yet in truth i was a beggar and felt sometimes ashamed of being so happy  with regard to the liabilities of the company my mind was now made quite easy for the creditors could only come upon our directors and these it was rather difficult to find  mr brough was across the water and i must say to the credit of that gentleman that while everybody thought he had run away with hundreds of thousands of pounds he was in a garret at boulogne with scarce a shilling in his pocket and his fortune to make afresh  mrs brough like a good brave woman remained faithful to him and only left fulham with the gown on her back and miss belinda though grumbling and sadly out of temper was no better off  for the other directorswhen they came to inquire at edinburgh for mr mull w s it appeared there was a gentleman of that name who had practised in edinburgh with good reputation until 1800 since when he had retired to the isle of skye and on being applied to knew no more of the west diddlesex association than queen anne did  general sir dionysius ohalloran had abruptly quitted dublin and returned to the republic of guatemala  mr shirk went into the gazette  mr macraw mp and kings counsel had not a single guinea in the world but what he received for attending our board and the only man seizable was mr manstraw a wealthy navy contractor as we understood at chatham  he turned out to be a small dealer in marine stores and his whole stock in trade was not worth 10l  mr abednego was the other director and we have already seen what became of him  why as there is no danger from the west diddlesex suggested mr hoskins senior should you not now endeavour to make an arrangement with your creditors and who can make a better bargain with them than pretty mrs titmarsh here whose sweet eyes would soften the hardesthearted tailor or milliner that ever lived  accordingly my dear girl one bright day in february shook me by the hand and bidding me be of good cheer set forth with gus in a coach to pay a visit to those persons  little did i think a year before that the daughter of the gallant smith should ever be compelled to be a suppliant to tailors and haberdashers but she heaven bless her felt none of the shame which oppressed meor said she felt noneand went away nothing doubting on her errand  in the evening she came back and my heart thumped to know the news  i saw it was bad by her face  for some time she did not speak but looked as pale as death and wept as she kissed me  you speak mr augustus at last said she sobbing and so gus told me the circumstances of that dismal day  what do you think sam says he that infernal aunt of yours at whose command you had the things has written to the tradesmen to say that you are a swindler and impostor that you give out that she ordered the goods that she is ready to drop down dead and to take her bibleoath she never did any such thing and that they must look to you alone for payment  not one of them would hear of letting you out and as for mantalini the scoundrel was so insolent that i gave him a box on the ear and would have halfkilled him only poor marymrs titmarsh i meanscreamed and fainted and i brought her away and here she is as ill as can be  that night the indefatigable gus was obliged to run posthaste for doctor salts and next morning a little boy was born  i did not know whether to be sad or happy as they showed me the little weakly thing but mary was the happiest woman she declared in the world and forgot all her sorrows in nursing the poor baby she went bravely through her time and vowed that it was the loveliest child in the world and that though lady tiptoff whose confinement we read of as having taken place the same day might have a silk bed and a fine house in grosvenor square she never never could have such a beautiful child as our dear little gus for after whom should we have named the boy if not after our good kind friend  we had a little party at the christening and i assure you were very merry over our tea  the mother thank heaven was very well and it did ones heart good to see her in that attitude in which i think every woman be she ever so plain looks beautifulwith her baby at her bosom  the child was sickly but she did not see it we were very poor but what cared she she had no leisure to be sorrowful as i was i had my last guinea now in my pocket and when that was goneah my heart sickened to think of what was to come and i prayed for strength and guidance and in the midst of my perplexities felt yet thankful that the danger of the confinement was over and that for the worst fortune which was to befall us my dear wife was at least prepared and strong in health  i told mrs stokes that she must let us have a cheaper rooma garret that should cost but a few shillings and though the good woman bade me remain in the apartments we occupied yet now that my wife was well i felt it would be a crime to deprive my kind landlady of her chief means of livelihood and at length she promised to get me a garret as i wanted and to make it as comfortable as might be and little jemima declared that she would be glad beyond measure to wait on the mother and the child  the room then was made ready and though i took some pains not to speak of the arrangement too suddenly to mary yet there was no need of disguise or hesitation for when at last i told heris that all said she and took my hand with one of her blessed smiles and vowed that she and jemima would keep the room as pretty and neat as possible  and i will cook your dinners added she for you know you said i make the best rolypoly puddings in the world  god bless her  i do think some women almost love poverty but i did not tell mary how poor i was nor had she any idea how lawyers and prisons and doctors fees had diminished the sum of money which she brought me when we came to the fleet  it was not however destined that she and her child should inhabit that little garret  we were to leave our lodgings on monday morning but on saturday evening the child was seized with convulsions and all sunday the mother watched and prayed for it but it pleased god to take the innocent infant from us and on sunday at midnight it lay a corpse in its mothers bosom  amen  we have other children happy and well now round about us and from the fathers heart the memory of this little thing has almost faded but i do believe that every day of her life the mother thinks of the firstborn that was with her for so short a while many and many a time has she taken her daughters to the grave in saint brides where he lies buried and she wears still at her neck a little little lock of gold hair which she took from the head of the infant as he lay smiling in his coffin  it has happened to me to forget the childs birthday but to her never and often in the midst of common talk comes something that shows she is thinking of the child stillsome simple allusion that is to me inexpressibly affecting  i shall not try to describe her grief for such things are sacred and secret and a man has no business to place them on paper for all the world to read  nor should i have mentioned the childs loss at all but that even that loss was the means of a great worldly blessing to us as my wife has often with tears and thanks acknowledged  while my wife was weeping over her child i am ashamed to say i was distracted with other feelings besides those of grief for its loss and i have often since thought what a masternay destroyerof the affections want is and have learned from experience to be thankful for daily bread  that acknowledgment of weakness which we make in imploring to be relieved from hunger and from temptation is surely wisely put in our daily prayer  think of it you who are rich and take heed how you turn a beggar away  the child lay there in its wicker cradle with its sweet fixed smile in its face i think the angels in heaven must have been glad to welcome that pretty innocent smile and it was only the next day after my wife had gone to lie down and i sat keeping watch by it that i remembered the condition of its parents and thought i cant tell with what a pang that i had not money left to bury the little thing and wept bitter tears of despair  now at last i thought i must apply to my poor mother for this was a sacred necessity and i took paper and wrote her a letter at the babys side and told her of our condition  but thank heaven  i never sent the letter for as i went to the desk to get sealingwax and seal that dismal letter my eyes fell upon the diamond pin that i had quite forgotten and that was lying in the drawer of the desk  i looked into the bedroommy poor wife was asleep she had been watching for three nights and days and had fallen asleep from sheer fatigue and i ran out to a pawnbrokers with the diamond and received seven guineas for it and coming back put the money into the landladys hand and told her to get what was needful  my wife was still asleep when i came back and when she woke we persuaded her to go downstairs to the landladys parlour and meanwhile the necessary preparations were made and the poor child consigned to its coffin  the next day after all was over mrs stokes gave me back three out of the seven guineas and then i could not help sobbing out to her my doubts and wretchedness telling her that this was the last money i had and when that was gone i knew not what was to become of the best wife that ever a man was blest with  my wife was downstairs with the woman  poor gus who was with me and quite as much affected as any of the party took me by the arm and led me downstairs and we quite forgot all about the prison and the rules and walked a long long way across blackfriars bridge the kind fellow striving as much as possible to console me  when we came back it was in the evening  the first person who met me in the house was my kind mother who fell into my arms with many tears and who rebuked me tenderly for not having told her of my necessities  she never should have known of them she said but she had not heard from me since i wrote announcing the birth of the child and she felt uneasy about my silence and meeting mr smithers in the street asked from him news concerning me whereupon that gentleman with some little show of alarm told her that he thought her daughterinlaw was confined in an uncomfortable place that mrs hoggarty had left us finally that i was in prison  this news at once despatched my poor mother on her travels and she had only just come from the prison where she learned my address  i asked her whether she had seen my wife and how she found her  rather to my amaze she said that mary was out with the landlady when she arrived and eightnine oclock came and she was absent still  at ten oclock returnednot my wife but mrs stokes and with her a gentleman who shook hands with me on coming into the room and said mr titmarsh  i dont know whether you will remember me my name is tiptoff  i have brought you a note from mrs titmarsh and a message from my wife who sincerely commiserates your loss and begs you will not be uneasy at mrs titmarshs absence  she has been good enough to promise to pass the night with lady tiptoff and i am sure you will not object to her being away from you while she is giving happiness to a sick mother and a sick child  after a few more words my lord left us my wifes note only said that mrs stokes would tell me all     chapter xiii   in which it is shown that a good wife is the best diamond a man can wear in his bosom  mrs titmarsh maam says mrs stokes before i gratify your curiosity maam permit me to observe that angels is scarce and its rare to have one much more two in a family  both your son and your daughterinlaw maam are of that uncommon sort they are now reely maam  my mother said she thanked god for both of us and mrs stokes proceeded  when the fu when the seminary maam was concluded this morning your poor daughterinlaw was glad to take shelter in my humble parlour maam where she wept and told a thousand stories of the little cherub thats gone  heaven bless us it was here but a month and no one could have thought it could have done such a many things in that time  but a mothers eyes are clear maam and i had just such another angel my dear little antony that was born before jemima and would have been twentythree now were he in this wicked world maam  however i wont speak of him maam but of what took place  you must know maam that mrs titmarsh remained downstairs while mr samuel was talking with his friend mr hoskins and the poor thing would not touch a bit of dinner though we had it made comfortable and after dinner it was with difficulty i could get her to sup a little drop of wineandwater and dip a toast in it  it was the first morsel that had passed her lips for many a long hour maam  well she would not speak and i thought it best not to interrupt her but she sat and looked at my two youngest that were playing on the rug and just as mr titmarsh and his friend gus went out the boy brought the newspaper maamit always comes from three to four and i began areading of it  but i couldnt read much for thinking of poor mr sams sad face as he went out and the sad story he told me about his money being so low and every now and then i stopped reading and bade mrs t not to take on so and told her some stories about my dear little antony  ah says she sobbing and looking at the young ones you have other children mrs stokes but thatthat was my only one and she flung back in her chair and cried fit to break her heart and i knew that the cry would do her good and so went back to my paperthe morning post maam i always read it for i like to know whats agoing on in the west end  the very first thing that my eyes lighted upon was thiswanted immediately a respectable person as wetnurse  apply at no  grosvenor square  bless us and save us says i heres poor lady tiptoff ill for i knew her ladyships address and how she was confined on the very same day with mrs t and for the matter of that her ladyship knows my address having visited here  a sudden thought came over me  my dear mrs titmarsh said i you know how poor and how good your husband is  yes says she rather surprised  well my dear says i looking her hard in the face lady tiptoff who knows him wants a nurse for her son lord poynings  will you be a brave woman and look for the place and mayhap replace the little one that god has taken from you  she began to tremble and blush and then i told her what you mr sam had told me the other day about your money matters and no sooner did she hear it than she sprung to her bonnet and said come come and in five minutes she had me by the arm and we walked together to grosvenor square  the air did her no harm mr sam and during the whole of the walk she never cried but once and then it was at seeing a nurserymaid in the square  a great fellow in livery opens the door and says youre the forty fifth as come about this ere place but fust let me ask you a preliminary question  are you a hirishwoman  no sir says mrs t  that suffishnt mem says the gentleman in plush i see youre not by your axnt  step this way ladies if you please  youll find some more candidix for the place upstairs but i sent away fortyfour happlicants because they was hirish  we were taken upstairs over very soft carpets and brought into a room and told by an old lady who was there to speak very softly for my lady was only two rooms off  and when i asked how the baby and her ladyship were the old lady told me both were pretty well only the doctor said lady tiptoff was too delicate to nurse any longer and so it was considered necessary to have a wetnurse  there was another young woman in the rooma tall fine woman as ever you sawthat looked very angry and contempshious at mrs t and me and said ive brought a letter from the duchess whose daughter i nust and i think mrs blenkinsop mem my lady tiptoff may look far before she finds such another nuss as me  five feet six high had the smallpox married to a corporal in the lifeguards perfectly healthy best of charactiers only drink water and as for the child maam if her ladyship had six ive a plenty for them all  as the woman was making this speech a little gentleman in black came in from the next room treading as if on velvet  the woman got up and made him a low curtsey and folding her arms on her great broad chest repeated the speech she had made before  mrs t did not get up from her chair but only made a sort of a bow which to be sure i thought was ill manners as this gentleman was evidently the apothecary  he looked hard at her and said well my good woman and are you come about the place too  yes sir says she blushing  you seem very delicate  how old is your child  how many have you had what character have you  your wife didnt answer a word so i stepped up and said sir says i this lady has just lost her first child and isnt used to look for places being the daughter of a captain in the navy so youll excuse her want of manners in not getting up when you came in  the doctor at this sat down and began talking very kindly to her he said he was afraid that her application would be unsuccessful as mrs horner came very strongly recommended from the duchess of doncaster whose relative lady tiptoff was and presently my lady appeared looking very pretty maam in an elegant lacecap and a sweet muslin robede sham  a nurse came out of her ladyships room with her and while my lady was talking to us walked up and down in the next room with something in her arms  first my lady spoke to mrs horner and then to mrs t but all the while she was talking mrs titmarsh rather rudely as i thought maam was looking into the next room lookinglooking at the baby there with all her might  my lady asked her her name and if she had any character and as she did not speak i spoke up for her and said she was the wife of one of the best men in the world that her ladyship knew the gentleman too and had brought him a haunch of venison  then lady tiptoff looked up quite astonished and i told the whole story how you had been head clerk and that rascal brough had brought you to ruin poor thing said my lady mrs titmarsh did not speak but still kept looking at the baby and the great big grenadier of a mrs horner looked angrily at her  poor thing says my lady taking mrs ts hand very kind she seems very young  how old are you my dear  five weeks and two days says your wife sobbing  mrs horner burst into a laugh but there was a tear in my ladys eyes for she knew what the poor thing was athinking of  silence woman says she angrily to the great grenadier woman and at this moment the child in the next room began crying  as soon as your wife heard the noise she sprung from her chair and made a stop forward and put both her hands to her breast and said the childthe childgive it me and then began to cry again  my lady looked at her for a moment and then ran into the next room and brought her the baby and the baby clung to her as if he knew her and a pretty sight it was to see that dear woman with the child at her bosom  when my lady saw it what do you think she did  after looking on it for a bit she put her arms round your wifes neck and kissed her  my dear said she i am sure you are as good as you are pretty and you shall keep the child and i thank god for sending you to me  these were her very words and dr bland who was standing by says its a second judgment of solomon  i suppose my lady you dont want me says the big woman with another curtsey  not in the least answers my lady haughtily and the grenadier left the room and then i told all your story at full length and mrs blenkinsop kept me to tea and i saw the beautiful room that mrs titmarsh is to have next to lady tiptoffs and when my lord came home what does he do but insist upon coming back with me here in a hackney coach as he said he must apologise to you for keeping your wife away  i could not help in my own mind connecting this strange event which in the midst of our sorrow came to console us and in our poverty to give us breadi could not help connecting it with the diamond pin and fancying that the disappearance of that ornament had somehow brought a different and a better sort of luck into my family  and though some gents who read this may call me a poorspirited fellow for allowing my wife to go out to service who was bred a lady and ought to have servants herself yet for my part i confess i did not feel one minutes scruple or mortification on the subject  if you love a person is it not a pleasure to feel obliged to him  and this in consequence i felt  i was proud and happy at being able to think that my dear wife should be able to labour and earn bread for me now misfortune had put it out of my power to support me and her  and now instead of making any reflections of my own upon prison discipline i will recommend the reader to consult that admirable chapter in the life of mr pickwick in which the same theme is handled and which shows how silly it is to deprive honest men of the means of labour just at the moment when they most want it  what could i do  there were one or two gents in the prison who could work literary gentsone wrote his travels in mesopotamia and the other his sketches at almacks in the place but all the occupation i could find was walking down bridge street and then up bridge street and staring at alderman waithmans windows and then at the black man who swept the crossing  i never gave him anything but i envied him his trade and his broom and the money that continually fell into his old hat  but i was not allowed even to carry a broom  twice or thricefor lady tiptoff did not wish her little boy often to breathe the air of such a close place as salisbury squaremy dear mary came in the thundering carriage to see me  they were merry meetings andif the truth must be toldtwice when nobody was by i jumped into the carriage and had a drive with her and when i had seen her home jumped into another hackneycoach and drove back  but this was only twice for the system was dangerous and it might bring me into trouble and it cost three shillings from grosvenor square to ludgate hill  here meanwhile my good mother kept me company and what should we read of one day but the marriage of mrs hoggarty and the rev grimes wapshot my mother who never loved mrs h now said that she should repent all her life having allowed me to spend so much of my time with that odious ungrateful woman and added that she and i too were justly punished for worshipping the mammon of unrighteousness and forgetting our natural feelings for the sake of my aunts paltry lucre  well amen said i this is the end of all our fine schemes  my aunts money and my aunts diamond were the causes of my ruin and now they are clear gone thank heaven and i hope the old lady will be happy and i must say i dont envy the rev grimes wapshot  so we put mrs hoggarty out of our thoughts and made ourselves as comfortable as might be  rich and great people are slower in making christians of their children than we poor ones and little lord poynings was not christened until the month of june  a duke was one godfather and mr edmund preston the state secretary another and that kind lady jane preston whom i have before spoken of was the godmother to her nephew  she had not long been made acquainted with my wifes history and both she and her sister loved her heartily and were very kind to her  indeed there was not a single soul in the house high or low but was fond of that good sweet creature and the very footmen were as ready to serve her as they were their own mistress  i tell you what sir says one of them  you see tit my boy im a connyshure and up to snough and if ever i see a lady in my life mrs titmarsh is one  i cant be fimiliar with herive tried  have you sir said i  dont look so indignant  i cant i say be fimiliar with her as i am with you  theres a somethink in her a jennysquaw that haws me sir and even my lords own man that as ad as much success as any gentleman in europehe says that cuss him  mr charles says i tell my lords own man that if he wants to keep his place and his whole skin he will never address a single word to that lady but such as a servant should utter in the presence of his mistress and take notice that i am a gentleman though a poor one and will murder the first man who does her wrong  mr charles only said gammin to this but psha in bragging about my own spirit i forgot to say what great good fortune my dear wifes conduct procured for me  on the christeningday mr preston offered her first a five and then a twentypound note but she declined either but she did not decline a present that the two ladies made her together and this was no other than my release from the fleet  lord tiptoffs lawyer paid every one of the bills against me and that happy christeningday made me a free man  ah who shall tell the pleasure of that day or the merry dinner we had in marys room at lord tiptoffs house when my lord and my lady came upstairs to shake hands with me  i have been speaking to mr preston says my lord the gentleman with whom you had the memorable quarrel and he has forgiven it although he was in the wrong and promises to do something for you  we are going down meanwhile to his house at richmond and be sure mr titmarsh i will not fail to keep you in his mind  mrs titmarsh will do that says my lady for edmund is woefully smitten with her  and mary blushed and i laughed and we were all very happy and sure enough there came from richmond a letter to me stating that i was appointed fourth clerk in the tape and sealingwax office with a salary of 80l per annum  here perhaps my story ought to stop for i was happy at last and have never since thank heaven known want but gus insists that i should add how i gave up the place in the tape and sealingwax office and for what reason  that excellent lady jane preston is long gone and so is mr p off in an apoplexy and there is no harm now in telling the story  the fact was that mr preston had fallen in love with mary in a much more serious way than any of us imagined for i do believe he invited his brotherinlaw to richmond for no other purpose than to pay court to his sons nurse  and one day as i was coming posthaste to thank him for the place he had procured for me being directed by mr charles to the scrubbery as he called it which led down to the riverthere sure enough i found mr preston on his knees too on the gravelwalk and before him mary holding the little lord  dearest creature says mr preston do but listen to me and ill make your husband consul at timbuctoo  he shall never know of it i tell you he can never know of it  i pledge you my word as a cabinet minister oh dont look at me in that arch way by heavens your eyes kill me  mary when she saw me burst out laughing and ran down the lawn my lord making a huge crowing too and holding out his little fat hands  mr preston who was a heavy man was slowly getting up when catching a sight of me looking as fierce as the crater of mount etnahe gave a start back and lost his footing and rolled over and over walloping into the water at the gardens edge  it was not deep and he came bubbling and snorting out again in as much fright as fury  you dd ungrateful villain says he what do you stand there laughing for  im waiting your orders for timbuctoo sir says i and laughed fit to die and so did my lord tiptoff and his party who joined us on the lawn and jeames the footman came forward and helped mr preston out of the water  oh you old sinner says my lord as his brotherinlaw came up the slope  will that heart of yours be always so susceptible you romantic apoplectic immoral man  mr preston went away looking blue with rage and illtreated his wife for a whole month afterwards  at any rate says my lord titmarsh here has got a place through our friends unhappy attachment and mrs titmarsh has only laughed at him so there is no harm there  its an ill wind that blows nobody good you know  such a wind as that my lord with due respect to you shall never do good to me  i have learned in the past few years what it is to make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness and that out of such friendship no good comes in the end to honest men  it shall never be said that sam titmarsh got a place because a great man was in love with his wife and were the situation ten times as valuable i should blush every day i entered the officedoors in thinking of the base means by which my fortune was made  you have made me free my lord and thank god i am willing to work  i can easily get a clerkship with the assistance of my friends and with that and my wifes income we can manage honestly to face the world  this rather long speech i made with some animation for look you i was not over well pleased that his lordship should think me capable of speculating in any way on my wifes beauty  my lord at first turned red and looked rather angry but at last he held out his hand and said you are right titmarsh and i am wrong and let me tell you in confidence that i think you are a very honest fellow  you shant lose by your honesty i promise you  nor did i for i am at this present moment lord tiptoffs steward and righthand man and am i not a happy father and is not my wife loved and respected by all the country and is not gus hoskins my brotherinlaw partner with his excellent father in the leather way and the delight of all his nephews and nieces for his tricks and fun  as for mr brough that gentlemans history would fill a volume of itself  since he vanished from the london world he has become celebrated on the continent where he has acted a thousand parts and met all sorts of changes of high and low fortune  one thing we may at least admire in the man and that is his undaunted courage and i cant help thinking as i have said before that there must be some good in him seeing the way in which his family are faithful to him  with respect to roundhand i had best also speak tenderly  the case of roundhand v tidd is still in the memory of the public nor can i ever understand how bill tidd so poetic as he was could ever take on with such a fat odious vulgar woman as mrs r who was old enough to be his mother  as soon as we were in prosperity mr and mrs grimes wapshot made overtures to be reconciled to us and mr wapshot laid bare to me all the baseness of mr smitherss conduct in the brough transaction  smithers had also endeavoured to pay his court to me once when i went down to somersetshire but i cut his pretensions short as i have shown  he it was said mr wapshot who induced mrs grimes mrs hoggarty she was then to purchase the west diddlesex shares receiving of course a large bonus for himself  but directly he found that mrs hoggarty had fallen into the hands of mr brough and that he should lose the income he made from the lawsuits with her tenants and from the management of her landed property he determined to rescue her from that villain brough and came to town for the purpose  he also added mr wapshot vented his malignant slander against me but heaven was pleased to frustrate his base schemes  in the proceedings consequent on broughs bankruptcy mr smithers could not appear for his own share in the transactions of the company would have been most certainly shown up  during his absence from london i became the husbandthe happy husbandof your aunt  but though my dear sir i have been the means of bringing her to grace i cannot disguise from you that mrs w has faults which all my pastoral care has not enabled me to eradicate  she is close of her money sirvery close nor can i make that charitable use of her property which as a clergyman i ought to do for she has tied up every shilling of it and only allows me halfacrown a week for pocketmoney  in temper too she is very violent  during the first years of our union i strove with her yea i chastised her but her perseverance i must confess got the better of me  i make no more remonstrances but am as a lamb in her hands and she leads me whithersoever she pleases  mr wapshot concluded his tale by borrowing halfacrown from me it was at the somerset coffeehouse in the strand where he came in the year 1832 to wait upon me and i saw him go from thence into the ginshop opposite and come out of the ginshop halfanhour afterwards reeling across the streets and perfectly intoxicated  he died next year when his widow who called herself mrs hoggartygrimeswapshot of castle hoggarty said that over the grave of her saint all earthly resentments were forgotten and proposed to come and live with us paying us of course a handsome remuneration  but this offer my wife and i respectfully declined and once more she altered her will which once more she had made in our favour called us ungrateful wretches and pampered menials and left all her property to the irish hoggarties  but seeing my wife one day in a carriage with lady tiptoff and hearing that we had been at the great ball at tiptoff castle and that i had grown to be a rich man she changed her mind again sent for me on her deathbed and left me the farms of slopperton and squashtail with all her savings for fifteen years  peace be to her soul for certainly she left me a very pretty property  though i am no literary man myself my cousin michael who generally when he is short of coin comes down and passes a few months with us says that my memoirs may be of some use to the public meaning i suspect to himself and if so i am glad to serve him and them and hereby take farewell bidding all gents who peruse this to be cautious of their money if they have it to be still more cautious of their friends money to remember that great profits imply great risks and that the great shrewd capitalists of this country would not be content with four per cent for their money if they could securely get more above all i entreat them never to embark in any speculation of which the conduct is not perfectly clear to them and of which the agents are not perfectly open and loyal
