4632594	androcles and the lion  bernard shaw  1912    prologue  overture forest sounds roaring of lions christian hymn faintly  a jungle path a lions roar a melancholy suffering roar comes from the jungle it is repeated nearer the lion limps from the jungle on three legs holding up his right forepaw in which a huge thorn sticks he sits down and contemplates it he licks it he shakes it he tries to extract it by scraping it along the ground and hurts himself worse he roars piteously he licks it again tears drop from his eyes he limps painfully off the path and lies down under the trees exhausted with pain heaving a long sigh like wind in a trombone he goes to sleep  androcles and his wife megaera come along the path he is a small thin ridiculous little man who might be any age from thirty to fiftyfive he has sandy hair watery compassionate blue eyes sensitive nostrils and a very presentable forehead but his good points go no further his arms and legs and back though wiry of their kind look shrivelled and starved he carries a big bundle is very poorly clad and seems tired and hungry  his wife is a rather handsome pampered slattern well fed and in the prime of life she has nothing to carry and has a stout stick to help her along  megaera suddenly throwing down her stick i wont go another step  androcles pleading wearily oh not again dear whats the good of stopping every two miles and saying you wont go another step we must get on to the next village before night there are wild beasts in this wood lions they say  megaera i dont believe a word of it you are always threatening me with wild beasts to make me walk the very soul out of my body when i can hardly drag one foot before another we havent seen a single lion yet  androcles well dear do you want to see one  megaera tearing the bundle from his back you cruel beast you dont care how tired i am or what becomes of me she throws the bundle on the ground always thinking of yourself self self self always yourself she sits down on the bundle  androcles sitting down sadly on the ground with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands we all have to think of ourselves occasionally dear  megaera a man ought to think of his wife sometimes  androcles he cant always help it dear you make me think of you a good deal not that i blame you  megaera blame me i should think not indeed is it my fault that im married to you  androcles no dear that is my fault  megaera thats a nice thing to say to me arent you happy with me  androcles i dont complain my love  megaera you ought to be ashamed of yourself  androcles i am my dear  megaera youre not you glory in it  androcles in what darling  megaera in everything in making me a slave and making yourself a laughingstock its not fair you get me the name of being a shrew with your meek ways always talking as if butter wouldnt melt in your mouth and just because i look a big strong woman and because im goodhearted and a bit hasty and because youre always driving me to do things im sorry for afterwards people say poor man what a life his wife leads him oh if they only knew and you think i dont know but i do i do screaming i do  androcles yes my dear i know you do  megaera then why dont you treat me properly and be a good husband to me  androcles what can i do my dear  megaera what can you do you can return to your duty and come back to your home and your friends and sacrifice to the gods as all respectable people do instead of having us hunted out of house and home for being dirty disreputable blaspheming atheists  androcles im not an atheist dear i am a christian  megaera well isnt that the same thing only ten times worse everybody knows that the christians are the very lowest of the low  androcles just like us dear  megaera speak for yourself dont you dare to compare me to common people my father owned his own publichouse and sorrowful was the day for me when you first came drinking in our bar  androcles i confess i was addicted to it dear but i gave it up when i became a christian  megaera youd much better have remained a drunkard i can forgive a man being addicted to drink its only natural and i dont deny i like a drop myself sometimes what i cant stand is your being addicted to christianity and whats worse again your being addicted to animals how is any woman to keep her house clean when you bring in every stray cat and lost cur and lame duck in the whole countryside you took the bread out of my mouth to feed them you know you did dont attempt to deny it  androcles only when they were hungry and you were getting too stout dearie  megaera yes insult me do rising oh i wont bear it another moment you used to sit and talk to those dumb brute beasts for hours when you hadnt a word for me  androcles they never answered back darling he rises and again shoulders the bundle  megaera well if youre fonder of animals than of your own wife you can live with them here in the jungle ive had enough of them and enough of you im going back im going home  androcles barring the way back no dearie dont take on like that we cant go back weve sold everything we should starve and i should be sent to rome and thrown to the lions  megaera serve you right i wish the lions joy of you screaming are you going to get out of my way and let me go home  androcles no dear  megaera then ill make my way through the forest and when im eaten by the wild beasts youll know what a wife youve lost she dashes into the jungle and nearly falls over the sleeping lion oh oh andy andy she totters back and collapses into the arms of androcles who crushed by her weight falls on his bundle  androcles extracting himself from beneath her and slapping her hands in great anxiety what is it my precious my pet whats the matter he raises her head speechless with terror she points in the direction of the sleeping lion he steals cautiously towards the spot indicated by megaera she rises with an effort and totters after him  megaera no andy youll be killed come back  the lion utters a long snoring sigh androcles sees the lion and recoils fainting into the arms of megaera who falls back on the bundle they roll apart and lie staring in terror at one another the lion is heard groaning heavily in the jungle  androcles whispering did you see a lion  megaera despairing the gods have sent him to punish us because youre a christian take me away andy save me  androcles rising meggy theres one chance for you itll take him pretty nigh twenty minutes to eat me im rather stringy and tough and you can escape in less time than that  megaera oh dont talk about eating the lion rises with a great groan and limps towards them oh she faints  androcles quaking but keeping between the lion and megaera dont you come near my wife do you hear the lion groans androcles can hardly stand for trembling meggy run run for your life if i take my eye off him its all up the lion holds up his wounded paw and flaps it piteously before androcles oh hes lame poor old chap hes got a thorn in his paw a frightfully big thorn full of sympathy oh poor old man did um get an awful thorn into ums tootsums wootsums has it made um too sick to eat a nice little christian man for ums breakfast oh a nice little christian man will get ums thorn out for um and then um shall eat the nice christian man and the nice christian

little now make velvet paws thats right he pulls gingerly at the thorn the lion with an angry yell of pain jerks back his paw so abruptly that androcles is thrown on his back steadeee oh did the nasty cruel little christian man hurt the sore paw the lion moans assentingly but apologetically well one more little pull and it will be all over just one little little leetle pull and then um will live happily ever after he gives the thorn another pull the lion roars and snaps his jaws with a terrifying clash oh mustnt frighten ums good kind doctor ums affectionate nursey that didnt hurt at all not

understands ums dear old friend andy wandy the lion licks his face yes kissums andy wandy the lion wagging his tail violently rises on his hind legs and embraces androcles who makes a wry face and cries velvet paws velvet paws the lion draws in his claws thats right he embraces the lion who finally takes the end of his tail in one paw places that tight around androcles waist resting it on his hip androcles takes the other paw in his hand stretches out his arm and the two waltz rapturously round and round and finally away through the jungle  megaera who has revived during the waltz oh you coward you havent danced with me for years and now you go off dancing with a great brute beast that you havent known for ten minutes and that wants to eat your own wife coward coward coward she rushes off after them into the jungle    act i  evening the end of three converging roads to rome three triumphal arches span  them where they debouch on a square at the gate of the city looking north through the arches one can see the campagna threaded by the three long dusty tracks on the east and west sides of the square are long stone benches an old beggar sits on the east side of the square his bowl at his feet through the eastern arch a squad of roman soldiers tramps along escorting a batch of christian prisoners of both sexes and all ages among them one lavinia a goodlooking resolute young woman apparently of higher social standing than her fellowprisoners a centurion carrying his vinewood cudgel trudges alongside the squad on its right in command of it all are tired and dusty but the soldiers are dogged and indifferent the christians lighthearted and determined to treat their hardships as a joke and encourage one another  a bugle is heard far behind on the road where the rest of the cohort is following  centurion stopping halt orders from the captain they halt and wait now then you christians none of your larks the captains coming mind you behave yourselves no singing look respectful look serious if youre capable of it see that big building over there thats the coliseum thats where youll be thrown to the lions or set to fight the gladiators presently think of that and itll help you to behave properly before the captain the captain arrives attention salute the soldiers salute  a christian cheerfully god bless you captain  the centurion scandalised silence  the captain a patrician handsome about thirtyfive very cold and distinguished very superior and authoritative steps up on a stone seat at the west side of the square behind the centurion so as to dominate the others more effectually  the captain centurion  the centurion standing at attention and saluting sir  the captain speaking stiffly and officially you will remind your men centurion that we are now entering rome you will instruct them that once inside the gates of rome they are in the presence of the emperor you will make them understand that the lax discipline of the march cannot be permitted here you will instruct them to shave every day not every week you will impress on them particularly that there must be an end to the profanity and blasphemy of singing christian hymns on the march i have to reprimand you centurion for not only allowing this but actually doing it yourself  the centurion the men march better captain  the captain no doubt for that reason an exception is made in the case of the march called onward christian soldiers this may be sung except when marching through the forum or within hearing of the emperors palace but the words must be altered to throw them to the lions  the christians burst into shrieks of uncontrollable laughter to the great scandal of the centurion  centurion silence silennnnnce wheres your behavior is that the way to listen to an officer to the captain thats what we have to put up with from these christians every day sir theyre always laughing and joking something scandalous theyve no religion thats how it is  lavinia but i think the captain meant us to laugh centurion it was so funny  centurion youll find out how funny it is when youre thrown to the lions tomorrow to the captain who looks displeased beg pardon sir to the christians silennnnce  the captain you are to instruct your men that all intimacy with christian prisoners must now cease the men have fallen into habits of dependence upon the prisoners especially the female prisoners for cooking repairs to uniforms writing letters and advice in their private affairs in a roman soldier such dependence is inadmissible let me see no more of it whilst we are in the city further your orders are that in addressing christian prisoners the manners and tone of your men must express abhorrence and contempt any shortcoming in this respect will be regarded as a breach of disciplinehe turns to the prisoners prisoners  centurion fiercely prisonerrrrrs tention silence  the captain i call your attention prisoners to the fact that you may be called on to appear in the imperial circus at any time from tomorrow onwards according to the requirements of the managers i may inform you that as there is a shortage of christians just now you may expect to be called on very soon  lavinia what will they do to us captain  centurion silence  the captain the women will be conducted into the arena with the wild beasts of the imperial menagerie and will suffer the consequences the men if of an age to bear arms will be given weapons to defend themselves if they choose against the imperial gladiators  lavinia captain is there no hope that this cruel persecution  centurion shocked silence hold your tongue there persecution indeed  the captain unmoved and somewhat sardonic persecution is not a term applicable to the acts of the emperor the emperor is the defender of the faith in throwing you to the lions he will be upholding the interests of religion in rome if you were to throw him to the lions that would no doubt be persecution  the christians again laugh heartily  centurion horrified silence i tell you keep silence there did anyone ever hear the like of this  lavinia captain there will be nobody to appreciate your jokes when we are gone  the captain unshaken in his official delivery i call the attention of the female prisoner lavinia to the fact that as the emperor is a divine personage her imputation of cruelty is not only treason but sacrilege i point out to her further that there is no foundation for the charge as the emperor does not desire that any prisoner should suffer nor can any christian be harmed save through his or her own obstinacy all that is necessary is to sacrifice to the gods a simple and convenient ceremony effected by dropping a pinch of incense on the altar after which the prisoner is at once set free under such circumstances you have only your own perverse folly to blame if you suffer i suggest to you that if you cannot burn a morsel of incense as a matter of conviction you might at least do so as a matter of good taste to avoid shocking the religious convictions of your fellow citizens i am aware that these considerations do not weigh with christians but it is my duty to call your attention to them in order that you may have no ground for complaining of your treatment or of accusing the emperor of cruelty when he is showing you the most signal clemency looked at from this point of view every christian who has perished in the arena has really committed suicide  lavinia captain your jokes are too grim do not think it is easy for us to die our faith makes life far stronger and more wonderful in us than when we walked in darkness and had nothing to live for death is harder for us than for you the martyrs agony is as bitter as his triumph is glorious  the captain rather troubled addressing her personally and gravely a martyr lavinia is a fool your death will prove nothing  lavinia then why kill me  the captain i mean that truth if there be any truth needs no martyrs  lavinia no but my faith like your sword needs testing can you test your sword except by staking your life on it  the captain suddenly resuming his official tone i call the attention of the female prisoner to the fact that christians are not allowed to draw the emperors officers into arguments and put questions to them for which the military regulations provide no answer the christians titter  lavinia captain how can you  the captain i call the female prisoners attention specially to the fact that four comfortable homes have been offered her by officers of this regiment of which she can have her choice the moment she chooses to sacrifice as all wellbred roman ladies do i have no more to say to the prisoners  centurion dismiss but stay where you are  the captain centurion you will remain here with your men in charge of the prisoners until the arrival of three christian prisoners in the custody of a cohort of the tenth legion among these prisoners you will particularly identify an armorer named ferrovius of dangerous character and great personal strength and a greek tailor reputed to be a sorcerer by name androcles you will add the three to your charge here and march them all to the coliseum where you will deliver them into the custody of the master of the gladiators and take his receipt countersigned by the keeper of the beasts and the acting manager you understand your instructions  centurion yes sir  the captain dismiss he throws off his air of parade and descends down from the perch the centurion seats on it and prepares for a nap whilst his men stand at ease the christians sit down on the west side of the square glad to rest lavinia alone remains standing to speak to the captain  lavinia captain is this man who is to join us the famous ferrovius who has made such wonderful conversions in the northern cities  the captain yes we are warned that he has the strength of an elephant and the temper of a mad bull also that he is stark mad not a model christian it would seem  lavinia you need not fear him if he is a christian captain  the captain coldly i shall not fear him in any case lavinia  lavinia her eyes dancing how brave of you captain  the captain you are right it was silly thing to say in a lower tone humane and urgent lavinia do christians know how to love  lavinia composedly yes captain they love even their enemies  the captain is that easy  lavinia very easy captain when their enemies are as handsome as you  the captain lavinia you are laughing at me  lavinia at you captain impossible  the captain then you are flirting with me which is worse dont be foolish  lavinia but such a very handsome captain  the captain incorrigible urgently listen to me the men in that audience tomorrow will be the vilest of voluptuaries men in whom the only passion excited by a beautiful woman is a lust to see her tortured and torn shrieking limb from limb it is a crime to dignify that passion it is offering yourself for violation by the whole rabble of the streets and the riffraff of the court at the same time why will you not choose rather a kindly love and an honorable alliance  lavinia they cannot violate my soul i alone can do that by sacrificing to false gods  the captain sacrifice then to the true god what does his name matter we call him jupiter the greeks call him zeus call him what you will as you drop the incense on the altar flame he will understand  lavinia no i couldnt that is the strange thing captain that a little pinch of incense should make all that difference religion is such a great thing that when i meet really religious people we are friends at once no matter what name we give to the divine will that made us and moves us oh do you think that i a woman would quarrel with you for sacrificing to a woman god like diana if diana meant to you what christ means to me no we should kneel side by side before her altar like two children but when men who believe neither in my god nor in their ownmen who do not know the meaning of the word religionwhen these men drag me to the foot of an iron statue that has become the symbol of the terror and darkness through which they walk of their cruelty and greed of their hatred of god and their oppression of manwhen they ask me to pledge my soul before the people that this hideous idol is god and that all this wickedness and falsehood is divine truth i cannot do it not if they could put a thousand cruel deaths on me i tell you it is physically impossible listen captain did you ever try to catch a mouse in your hand once there was a dear little mouse that used to come out and play on my table as i was reading i wanted to take him in my hand and caress him and sometimes he got among my books so that he could not escape me when i stretched out my hand and i did stretch out my hand but it always came back in spite of me i was not afraid of him in my heart but my hand refused it is not in the nature of my hand to touch a mouse well captain if i took a pinch of incense in my hand and stretched it out over the altar fire my hand would come back my body would be true to my faith even if you could corrupt my mind and all the time i should believe more in diana than my persecutors have ever believed in anything can you understand that  the captain simply yes i understand that but my hand would not come back the hand that holds the sword has been trained not to come back from anything but victory  lavinia not even from death  the captain least of all from death  lavinia then i must not come back either a woman has to be braver than a soldier  the captain prouder you mean  lavinia startled prouder you call our courage pride  the captain there is no such thing as courage there is only pride you christians are the proudest devils on earth  lavinia hurt pray god then my pride may never become a false pride she turns away as if she did not wish to continue the conversation but softens and says to him with a smile thank you for trying to save me from death  the captain i knew it was no use but one tries in spite of ones knowledge  lavinia something stirs even in the iron breast of a roman soldier  the captain it will soon be iron again i have seen many women die and forgotten them in a week  lavinia remember me for a fortnight handsome captain i shall be watching you perhaps  the captain from the skies do not deceive yourself lavinia there is no future for you beyond the grave  lavinia what does that matter do you think i am only running away from the terrors of life into the comfort of heaven if there were no future or if the future were one of torment i should have to go just the same the hand of god is upon me  the captain yes when all is said we are both patricians lavinia and must die for our beliefs farewell he offers her his hand she takes it and presses it he walks away trim and calm she looks after him for a moment and cries a little as he disappears through the eastern arch a trumpetcall is heard from the road through the western arch  centurion waking up and rising cohort of the tenth with prisoners two file out with me to receive them he goes out through the western arch followed by four soldiers in two files  lentulus and metellus come into the square from the west side with a little retinue of servants both are young courtiers dressed in the extremity of fashion lentulus is slender fairhaired epicene metellus is manly compactly built olive skinned not a talker  lentulus christians by jove lets chaff them  metellus awful brutes if you knew as much about them as i do you wouldnt want to chaff them leave them to the lions  lentulus indicating lavinia who is still looking towards the arches after the captain that womans got a figure he walks past her staring at her invitingly but she is preoccupied and is not conscious of him do you turn the other cheek when they kiss you  lavinia starting what  lentulus do you turn the other cheek when they kiss you fascinating christian  lavinia dont be foolish to metellus who has remained on her right so that she is between them please dont let your friend behave like a cad before the soldiers how are they to respect and obey patricians if they see them behaving like street boys sharply to lentulus pull yourself together man hold your head up keep the corners of your mouth firm and treat me respectfully what do you take me for  lentulus irresolutely look here you know iyoui  lavinia stuff go about your business she turns decisively away and sits down with her comrades leaving him disconcerted  metellus you didnt get much out of that i told you they were brutes  lentulus plucky little filly i suppose she thinks i care with an air of indifference he strolls with metellus to the east side of the square where they stand watching the return of the centurion through the western arch with his men escorting three prisoners ferrovius androcles and spintho ferrovius is a powerful choleric man in the prime of life with large nostrils staring eyes and a thick neck a man whose sensibilities are keen and violent to the verge of madness spintho is a debauchee the wreck of a goodlooking man gone hopelessly to the bad androcles is overwhelmed with grief and is restraining his tears with great difficulty  the centurion to lavinia here are some pals for you this little bit is ferrovius that you talk so much about ferrovius turns on him threateningly the centurion holds up his left forefinger in admonition now remember that youre a christian and that youve got to return good for evil ferrovius controls himself convulsively moves away from temptation to the east side near lentulus clasps his hands in silent prayer and throws himself on his knees thats the way to manage them eh this fine fellow indicating androcles who comes to his left and makes lavinia a heartbroken salutation is a sorcerer a greek tailor he is a real sorcerer too no mistake about it the tenth marches with a leopard at the head of the column he made a pet of the leopard and now hes crying at being parted from it androcles sniffs lamentably aint you old chap well cheer up we march with a billy goat androcles brightens up thats killed two leopards and ate a turkeycock you can have him for a pet if you like androcles quite consoled goes past the centurion to lavinia and sits down contentedly on the ground on her left this dirty dog collaring spintho is a real christian he mobs the temples he does at each accusation he gives the neck of spinthos tunic a twist he goes smashing things mad drunk he does he steals the gold vessels he does he assaults the priestesses he does pah he flings spintho into the middle of the group of prisoners youre the sort that makes duty a pleasure you are  spintho gasping thats it strangle me kick me beat me revile me our lord was beaten and reviled thats my way to heaven every martyr goes to heaven no matter what hes done that is so isnt it brother  centurion well if youre going to heaven i dont want to go there i wouldnt be seen with you  lentulus haw good indicating the kneeling ferrovius is this one of the turntheothercheek gentlemen centurion  centurion yes sir lucky for you too sir if you want to take any liberties with him  lentulus to ferrovius you turn the other cheek when youre struck im told  ferrovius slowly turning his great eyes on him yes by the grace of  god i do now  lentulus not that youre a coward of course but out of pure piety  ferrovius i fear god more than man at least i try to  lentulus lets see he strikes him on the cheek androcles makes a wild movement to rise and interfere but lavinia holds him down watching ferrovius intently ferrovius without flinching turns the other cheek lentulus rather out of countenance titters foolishly and strikes him again feebly you know i should feel ashamed if i let myself be struck like that and took it lying down but then im not a christian im a man ferrovius rises impressively and towers over him lentulus becomes white with terror and a shade of green flickers in his cheek for a moment  ferrovius with the calm of a steam hammer i have not always been faithful the first man who struck me as you have just struck me was a stronger man than you he hit me harder than i expected i was tempted and fell and it was then that i first tasted bitter shame i never had a happy moment after that until i had knelt and asked his forgiveness by his bedside in the hospital putting his hands on lentuluss shoulders with paternal weight but now i have learnt to resist with a strength that is not my own i am not ashamed now nor angry  lentulus uneasily ergood evening he tries to move away  ferrovius gripping his shoulders oh do not harden your heart young man come try for yourself whether our way is not better than yours i will now strike you on one cheek and you will turn the other and learn how much better you will feel than if you gave way to the promptings of anger he holds him with one hand and clenches the other fist  lentulus centurion i call on you to protect me  centurion you asked for it sir its no business of ours youve had two whacks at him better pay him a trifle and square it that way  lentulus yes of course to ferrovius it was only a bit of fun i assure you i meant no harm here he proffers a gold coin  ferrovius taking it and throwing it to the old beggar who snatches it up eagerly and hobbles off to spend it give all thou hast to the poor come friend courage i may hurt your body for a moment but your soul will rejoice in the victory of the spirit over the flesh he prepares to strike  androcles easy ferrovius easy you broke the last mans jaw  lentulus with a moan of terror attempts to fly but ferrovius holds him ruthlessly  ferrovius yes but i saved his soul what matters a broken jaw  lentulus dont touch me do you hear the law  ferrovius the law will throw me to the lions tomorrow what worse could it do were i to slay you pray for strength and it shall be given to you  lentulus let me go your religion forbids you to strike me  ferrovius on the contrary it commands me to strike you how can you turn the other cheek if you are not first struck on the one cheek  lentulus almost in tears but im convinced already that what you said is quite right i apologize for striking you  ferrovius greatly pleased my son have i softened your heart has the good seed fallen in a fruitful place are your feet turning towards a better path  lentulus abjectly yes yes theres a great deal in what you say  ferrovius radiant join us come to the lions come to suffering and death  lentulus falling on his knees and bursting into tears oh help me mother mother  ferrovius these tears will water your soul and make it bring forth good fruit my son god has greatly blessed my efforts at conversion shall i tell you a miracleyes a miraclewrought by me in cappadocia a young manjust such a one as you with golden hair like yoursscoffed at and struck me as you scoffed at and struck me i sat up all night with that youth wrestling for his soul and in the morning not only was he a christian but his hair was as white as snow lentulus falls in a dead faint there there take him away the spirit has overwrought him poor lad carry him gently to his house and leave the rest to heaven  centurion take him home the servants intimidated hastily carry him out metellus is about to follow when ferrovius lays his hand on his shoulder  ferrovius you are his friend young man you will see that he is taken safely home  metellus with awestruck civility certainly sir i shall do whatever you think best most happy to have made your acquaintance im sure you may depend on me good evening sir  ferrovius with unction the blessing of heaven upon you and him  metellus follows lentulus the centurion returns to his seat to resume his interrupted nap the deepest awe has settled on the spectators ferrovius with a long sigh of happiness goes to lavinia and offers her his hand  lavinia taking it so that is how you convert people ferrovius  ferrovius yes there has been a blessing on my work in spite of my unworthiness and my backslidingsall through my wicked devilish temper this man  androcles hastily dont slap me on the back brother she knows you mean me  ferrovius how i wish i were weak like our brother here for then i should perhaps be meek and gentle like him and yet there seems to be a special providence that makes my trials less than his i hear tales of the crowd scoffing and casting stones and reviling the brethren but when i come all this stops my influence calms the passions of the mob they listen to me in silence and infidels are often converted by a straight hearttoheart talk with me every day i feel happier more confident every day lightens the load of the great terror  lavinia the great terror what is that  ferrovius shakes his head and does not answer he sits down beside her on her left and buries his face in his hands in gloomy meditation  androcles well you see sister hes never quite sure of himself suppose at the last moment in the arena with the gladiators there to fight him one of them was to say anything to annoy him he might forget himself and lay that gladiator out  lavinia that would be splendid  ferrovius springing up in horror what  androcles oh sister  ferrovius splendid to betray my master like peter splendid to act like any common blackguard in the day of my proving woman you are no christian he moves away from her to the middle of the square as if her neighborhood contaminated him  lavinia laughing you know ferrovius i am not always a christian i dont think anybody is there are moments when i forget all about it and something comes out quite naturally as it did then  spintho what does it matter if you die in the arena youll be a martyr and all martyrs go to heaven no matter what they have done thats so isnt it ferrovius  ferrovius yes that is so if we are faithful to the end  lavinia im not so sure  spintho dont say that thats blasphemy dont say that i tell you we shall be saved no matter what we do  lavinia perhaps you men will all go into heaven bravely and in triumph with your heads erect and golden trumpets sounding for you but i am sure i shall only be allowed to squeeze myself in through a little crack in the gate after a great deal of begging i am not good always i have moments only  spintho youre talking nonsense woman i tell you martyrdom pays all scores  androcles well let us hope so brother for your sake youve had a gay time havent you with your raids on the temples i cant help thinking that heaven will be very dull for a man of your temperament spintho snarls dont be angry i say it only to console you in case you should die in your bed tonight in the natural way theres a lot of plague about  spintho rising and running about in abject terror i never thought of that o lord spare me to be martyred oh what a thought to put into the mind of a brother oh let me be martyred today now i shall die in the night and go to hell youre a sorcerer youve put death into my mind oh curse you curse you he tries to seize androcles by the throat  ferrovius holding him in a grip of iron whats this brother anger violence raising your hand to a brother christian  spintho its easy for you youre strong your nerves are all right but im full of disease ferrovius takes his hand from him with instinctive disgust ive drunk all my nerves away i shall have the horrors all night  androcles sympathetic oh dont take on so brother were all sinners  spintho snivelling trying to feel consoled yes i daresay if the truth were known youre all as bad as i am  lavinia contemptuously does that comfort you  ferrovius sternly pray man pray  spintho whats the good of praying if were martyred we shall go to heaven shant we whether we pray or not  ferrovius whats that not pray seizing him again pray this instant you dog you rotten hound you slimy snake you beastly goat or  spintho yes beat me kick me i forgive you mind that  ferrovius spurning him with loathing yah spintho reels away and falls in front of ferrovius  androcles reaching out and catching the skirt of ferroviuss tunic dear brother if you wouldnt mindjust for my sake  ferrovius well  androcles dont call him by the names of the animals weve no right to ive had such friends in dogs a pet snake is the best of company i was nursed on goats milk is it fair to them to call the like of him a dog or a snake or a goat  ferrovius i only meant that they have no souls  androcles anxiously protesting oh believe me they have just the same as you and me i really dont think i could consent to go to heaven if i thought there were to be no animals there think of what they suffer here  ferrovius thats true yes that is just they will have their share in heaven  spintho who has picked himself up and is sneaking past ferrovius on his left sneers derisively  ferrovius turning on him fiercely whats that you say  spintho cornering nothing  ferrovius clenching his fist do animals go to heaven or not  spintho i never said they didnt  ferrovius implacable do they or do they not  spintho they do they do scrambling out of ferroviuss reach oh curse you for frightening me  a bugle call is heard  centurion waking up tention form as before now then prisoners up with you and trot along spry the soldiers fall in the

die  centurion fitter than you are to live you swine  they pass from the square westward the oxen drawing a waggon with a great wooden cage and the lion in it arrive through the central arch    act ii  behind the emperors box at the coliseum where the performers assemble before entering the arena in the middle a wide passage leading to the arena descends from the floor level under the imperial box on both sides of this passage steps ascend to a landing at the back entrance to the box the landing forms a bridge across the passage at the entrance to the passage are two bronze mirrors one on each side  on the west side of this passage on the right hand of any one coming from the box and standing on the bridge the martyrs are sitting on the steps lavinia is seated halfway up thoughtful trying to look death in the face on her left androcles consoles himself by nursing a cat ferrovius stands behind them his eyes blazing his figure stiff with intense resolution at the foot of the steps crouches spintho with his head clutched in his hands full of horror at the approach of martyrdom  on the east side of the passage the gladiators are standing and sitting at ease waiting like the christians for their turn in the arena one retiarius is a nearly naked man with a net and a trident another secutor is in armor with a sword he carries a helmet with a barred visor the editor of the gladiators sits on a chair a little apart from them  the call boy enters from the passage  the call boy number six retiarius versus secutor  the gladiator with the net picks it up the gladiator with the helmet puts it on and the two go into the arena the net thrower taking out a little brush and arranging his hair as he goes the other tightening his straps and shaking his shoulders loose both look at themselves in the mirrors before they enter the passage  lavinia will they really kill one another  spintho yes if the people turn down their thumbs  the editor you know nothing about it the people indeed do you suppose we would kill a man worth perhaps fifty talents to please the riffraff i should like to catch any of my men at it  spintho i thought  the editor contemptuously you thought who cares what you think youll be killed all right enough  spintho groans and again hides his face then is nobody ever killed except us poor  lavinia christians  the editor if the vestal virgins turn down their thumbs thats another matter theyre ladies of rank  lavinia does the emperor ever interfere  the editor oh yes he turns his thumbs up fast enough if the vestal virgins want to have one of his pet fighting men killed  androcles but dont they ever just only pretend to kill one another why shouldnt you pretend to die and get dragged out as if you were dead and then get up and go home like an actor  the editor see here you want to know too much there will be no pretending about the new lion let that be enough for you hes hungry  spintho groaning with horror oh lord cant you stop talking about it isnt it bad enough for us without that  androcles im glad hes hungry not that i want him to suffer poor chap but then hell enjoy eating me so much more theres a cheerful side to everything  the editor rising and striding over to androcles here dont you be obstinate come with me and drop the pinch of incense on the altar thats all you need do to be let off  androcles no thank you very much indeed but i really mustnt  the editor what not to save your life  androcles id rather not i couldnt sacrifice to diana shes a huntress you know and kills things  the editor that dont matter you can choose your own altar sacrifice to jupiter he likes animals he turns himself into an animal when he goes off duty  androcles no its very kind of you but i feel i cant save myself that way  the editor but i dont ask you to do it to save yourself i ask you to do it to oblige me personally  androcles scrambling up in the greatest agitation oh please dont say that that is dreadful you mean so kindly by me that it seems quite horrible to disoblige you if you could arrange for me to sacrifice when theres nobody looking i shouldnt mind but i must go into the arena with the rest my honor you know  the editor honor the honor of a tailor  androcles apologetically well perhaps honor is too strong an expression still you know i couldnt allow the tailors to get a bad name through me  the editor how much will you remember of all that when you smell the beasts breath and see his jaws opening to tear out your throat  spintho rising with a yell of terror i cant bear it wheres the altar ill sacrifice  ferrovius dog of an apostate iscariot  spintho ill repent afterwards i fully mean to die in the arena ill die a martyr and go to heaven but not this time not now not until my nerves are better besides im too young i want to have just one more good time the gladiators laugh at him oh will no one tell me where the altar is he dashes into the passage and vanishes  androcles to the editor pointing after spintho brother i cant do that not even to oblige you dont ask me  the editor well if youre determined to die i cant help you but i wouldnt be put off by a swine like that  ferrovius peace peace tempt him not get thee behind him satan  the editor flushing with rage for two pins id take a turn in the arena myself today and pay you out for daring to talk to me like that  ferrovius springs forward  lavinia rising quickly and interposing brother brother you forget  ferrovius curbing himself by a mighty effort oh my temper my wicked temper to the editor as lavinia sits down again reassured forgive me brother my heart was full of wrath i should have been thinking of your dear precious soul  the editor yah he turns his back on ferrovius contemptuously and goes back to his seat  ferrovius continuing and i forgot it all i thought of nothing but offering to fight you with one hand tied behind me  the editor turning pugnaciously what  ferrovius on the border line between zeal and ferocity oh dont give way to pride and wrath brother i could do it so easily i could  they are separated by the menagerie keeper who rushes in from the passage furious  the keeper heres a nice business who let that christian out of here down to the dens when we were changing the lion into the cage next the arena  the editor nobody let him he let himself  the keeper well the lions ate him  consternation the christians rise greatly agitated the gladiators sit callously but are highly amused all speak or cry out or laugh at once tumult  lavinia oh poor wretch ferrovius the apostate has perished praise be to gods justice androcles the poor beast was starving it couldnt help itself the christians what ate him how frightful how terrible without a moment to repent god be merciful to him a sinner oh i cant bear to think of it in the midst of his sin horrible horrible the editor serve the rotter right the gladiators just walked into it he did hes martyred all right enough good old lion old jock doesnt like that look at his face devil a better the emperor will laugh when he hears of it i cant help smiling ha ha ha  the keeper now his appetites taken off he wont as much as look at another christian for a week  androcles couldnt you have saved him brother  the keeper saved him saved him from a lion that id just got mad with hunger a wild one that came out of the forest not four weeks ago he bolted him before you could say balbus  lavinia sitting down again poor spintho and it wont even count as martyrdom  the keeper serve him right what call had he to walk down the throat of one of my lions before he was asked  androcles perhaps the lion wont eat me now  the keeper yes thats just like a christian think only of yourself what am i to do what am i to say to the emperor when he sees one of my lions coming into the arena half asleep  the editor say nothing give your old lion some bitters and a morsel of fried fish to wake up his appetite laughter  the keeper yes its easy for you to talk but  the editor scrambling to his feet sh attention there the emperor the keeper bolts precipitately into the passage the gladiators rise smartly and form into line  the emperor enters on the christians side conversing with metellus and followed by his suite  the gladiators hail caesar those about to die salute thee  caesar good morrow friends  metellus shakes hands with the editor who accepts  his condescension with bluff respect  lavinia blessing caesar and forgiveness  caesar turning in some surprise at the salutation there is no forgiveness for christianity  lavinia i did not mean that caesar i mean that we forgive you  metellus an inconceivable liberty do you not know woman that the emperor can do no wrong and therefore cannot be forgiven  lavinia i expect the emperor knows better anyhow we forgive him  the christians amen  caesar metellus you see now the disadvantage of too much severity these people have no hope therefore they have nothing to restrain them from saying what they like to me they are almost as impertinent as the gladiators which is the greek sorcerer  androcles humbly touching his forelock me your worship  caesar my worship good a new title well what miracles can you perform  androcles i can cure warts by rubbing them with my tailors chalk and i can live with my wife without beating her  caesar is that all  androcles you dont know her caesar or you wouldnt say that  caesar ah well my friend we shall no doubt contrive a happy release for you which is ferrovius  ferrovius i am he  caesar they tell me you can fight  ferrovius it is easy to fight i can die caesar  caesar that is still easier is it not  ferrovius not to me caesar death comes hard to my flesh and fighting comes very easily to my spirit beating his breast and lamenting o sinner that i am he throws himself down on the steps deeply discouraged  caesar metellus i should like to have this man in the pretorian guard  metellus i should not caesar he looks a spoilsport there are men in whose presence it is impossible to have any fun men who are a sort of walking conscience he would make us all uncomfortable  caesar for that reason perhaps it might be well to have him an emperor can hardly have too many consciences to ferrovius listen ferrovius ferrovius shakes his head and will not look up you and your friends shall not be outnumbered today in the arena you shall have arms and there will be no more than one gladiator to each christian if you come out of the arena alive i will consider favorably any request of yours and give you a place in the pretorian guard even if the request be that no questions be asked about your faith i shall perhaps not refuse it  ferrovius i will not fight i will die better stand with the archangels than with the pretorian guard  caesar i cannot believe that the archangelswhoever they may bewould not prefer to be recruited from the pretorian guard however as you please come let us see the show  as the court ascends the steps secutor and the retiarius return from the arena through the passage secutor covered with dust and very angry retiarius grinning  secutor ha the emperor now we shall see caesar i ask you whether it is fair for the retiarius instead of making a fair throw of his net at me to swish it along the ground and throw the dust in my eyes and then catch me when im blinded if the vestals had not turned up their thumbs i should have been a dead man  caesar halting on the stair there is nothing in the rules against it  secutor indignantly caesar is it a dirty trick or is it not  caesar it is a dusty one my friend obsequious laughter be on your guard next time  secutor let him be on his guard next time ill throw my sword at his heels and strangle him with his own net before he can hop off to retiarius you see if i dont he goes out past the gladiators sulky and furious  caesar to the chuckling retiarius these tricks are not wise my friend the audience likes to see a dead man in all his beauty and splendor if you smudge his face and spoil his armor they will show their displeasure by not letting you kill him and when your turn comes they will remember it against you and turn their thumbs down  the retiarius perhaps that is why i did it caesar he bet me ten sesterces that he would vanquish me if i had had to kill him i should not have had the money  caesar indulgent laughing you rogues there is no end to your tricks ill dismiss you all and have elephants to fight they fight fairly he goes up to his box and knocks at it it is opened from within by the captain who stands as on parade to let him pass the call boy comes from the passage followed by three attendants carrying respectively a bundle of swords some helmets and some breastplates and pieces of armor which they throw down in a heap  the call boy by your leave caesar number eleven gladiators and christians  ferrovius springs up ready for martyrdom the other christians take the summons as best they can some joyful and brave some patient and dignified some tearful and helpless some embracing one another with emotion the call boy goes back into the passage  caesar turning at the door of the box the hour has come ferrovius i shall go into my box and see you killed since you scorn the pretorian guard he goes into the box the captain shuts the door remaining inside with the emperor metellus and the rest of the suite disperse to their seats the christians led by ferrovius move towards the passage  lavinia to ferrovius farewell  the editor steady there you christians have got to fight here arm yourselves  ferrovius picking up a sword ill die sword in hand to show people that i could fight if it were my masters will and that i could kill the man who kills me if i chose  the editor put on that armor  ferrovius no armor  the editor bullying him do what youre told put on that armor  ferrovius gripping the sword and looking dangerous i said no armor  the editor and what am i to say when i am accused of sending a naked man in to fight my men in armor  ferrovius say your prayers brother and have no fear of the princes of this world  the editor tsha you obstinate fool he bites his lips irresolutely not knowing exactly what to do  androcles to ferrovius farewell brother till we meet in the sweet byandby  the editor to androcles you are going too take a sword there and put on any armor you can find to fit you  androcles no really i cant fight i never could i cant bring myself to dislike anyone enough im to be thrown to the lions with the lady  the editor then get out of the way and hold your noise androcles steps aside with cheerful docility now then are you all ready there a trumpet is heard from the arena  ferrovius starting convulsively heaven give me strength  the editor aha that frightens you does it  ferrovius man there is no terror like the terror of that sound to me when i hear a trumpet or a drum or the clash of steel or the hum of the catapult as the great stone flies fire runs through my veins i feel my blood surge up hot behind my eyes i must charge i must strike i must conquer caesar himself will not be safe in his imperial seat if once that spirit gets loose in me oh brothers pray exhort me remind me that if i raise my sword my honor falls and my master is crucified afresh  androcles just keep thinking how cruelly you might hurt the poor gladiators  ferrovius it does not hurt a man to kill him  lavinia nothing but faith can save you  ferrovius faith which faith there are two faiths there is our faith and there is the warriors faith the faith in fighting the faith that sees god in the sword how if that faith should overwhelm me  lavinia you will find your real faith in the hour of trial  ferrovius that is what i fear i know that i am a fighter how can i feel sure that i am a christian  androcles throw away the sword brother  ferrovius i cannot it cleaves to my hand i could as easily throw a woman i loved from my arms starting who spoke that blasphemy not i  lavinia i cant help you friend i cant tell you not to save your own life something wilful in me wants to see you fight your way into heaven  ferrovius ha  androcles but if you are going to give up our faith brother why not do it without hurting anybody dont fight them burn the incense  ferrovius burn the incense never  lavinia that is only pride ferrovius  ferrovius only pride what is nobler than pride conscience stricken oh im steeped in sin im proud of my pride  lavinia they say we christians are the proudest devils on earththat only the weak are meek oh i am worse than you i ought to send you to death and i am tempting you  androcles brother brother let them rage and kill let us be brave and suffer you must go as a lamb to the slaughter  ferrovius aye aye that is right not as a lamb is slain by the butcher but as a butcher might let himself be slain by a looking at the editor by a silly ram whose head he could fetch off in one twist  before the editor can retort the call boy rushes up through the passage and the captain comes from the emperors box and descends the steps  the call boy in with you into the arena the stage is waiting  the captain the emperor is waiting to the editor what are you dreaming of man send your men in at once  the editor yes sir its these christians hanging back  ferrovius in a voice of thunder liar  the editor not heeding him march the gladiators told off to fight with the christians march down the passage follow up there you  the christian men and women as they part be steadfast brother farewell hold up the faith brother farewell go to glory dearest farewell remember we are praying for you farewell be strong brother farewell dont forget that the divine love and our love surround you farewell nothing can hurt you remember that brother farewell eternal glory dearest farewell  the editor out of patience shove them in there  the remaining gladiators and the call boy make a movement towards them  ferrovius interposing touch them dogs and we die here and cheat the heathen of their spectacle to his fellow christians brothers the great moment has come that passage is your hill to calvary mount it bravely but meekly and remember not a word of reproach not a blow nor a struggle go they go out through the passage he turns to lavinia farewell  lavinia you forget i must follow before you are cold  ferrovius it is true do not envy me because i pass before you to glory he goes through the passage  the editor to the call boy sickening work this why cant they all be thrown to the lions its not a mans job he throws himself moodily into his chair  the remaining gladiators go back to their former places indifferently the call boy shrugs his shoulders and squats down at the entrance to the passage near the editor  lavinia and the christian women sit down again wrung with grief some weeping silently some praying some calm and steadfast androcles sits down at lavinias feet the captain stands on the stairs watching her curiously  androcles im glad i havent to fight that would really be an awful martyrdom i am lucky  lavinia looking at him with a pang of remorse androcles burn the incense youll be forgiven let my death atone for both i feel as if i were killing you  androcles dont think of me sister think of yourself that will keep your heart up  the captain laughs sardonically  lavinia startled she had forgotten his presence are you there handsome captain have you come to see me die  the captain coming to her side i am on duty with the emperor lavinia  lavinia is it part of your duty to laugh at us  the captain no that is part of my private pleasure your friend here is a humorist i laughed at his telling you to think of yourself to keep up your heart i say think of yourself and burn the incense  lavinia he is not a humorist he was right you ought to know that captain you have been face to face with death  the captain not with certain death lavinia only death in battle which spares more men than death in bed what you are facing is certain death you have nothing left now but your faith in this craze of yours this christianity are your christian fairy stories any truer than our stories about jupiter and diana in which i may tell you i believe no more than the emperor does or any educated man in rome  lavinia captain all that seems nothing to me now ill not say that death is a terrible thing but i will say that it is so real a thing that when it comes close all the imaginary thingsall the stories as you call themfade into mere dreams beside that inexorable reality i know now that i am not dying for stories or dreams did you hear of the dreadful thing that happened here while we were waiting  the captain i heard that one of your fellows bolted and ran right into the jaws of the lion i laughed i still laugh  lavinia then you dont understand what that meant  the captain it meant that the lion had a cur for his breakfast  lavinia it meant more than that captain it meant that a man cannot die for a story and a dream none of us believed the stories and the dreams more devoutly than poor spintho but he could not face the great reality what he would have called my faith has been oozing away minute by minute whilst ive been sitting here with death coming nearer and nearer with reality becoming realler and realler with stories and dreams fading away into nothing  the captain are you then going to die for nothing  lavinia yes that is the wonderful thing it is since all the stories and dreams have gone that i have now no doubt at all that i must die for something greater than dreams or stories  the captain but for what  lavinia i dont know if it were for anything small enough to know it would be too small to die for i think im going to die for god nothing else is real enough to die for  the captain what is god  lavinia when we know that captain we shall be gods ourselves  the captain lavinia come down to earth burn the incense and marry me  lavinia handsome captain would you marry me if i hauled down the flag in the day of battle and burnt the incense sons take after their mothers you know do you want your son to be a coward  the captain strongly moved by great diana i think i would strangle you if you gave in now  lavinia putting her hand on the head of androcles the hand of god is on us three captain  the captain what nonsense it all is and what a monstrous thing that you should die for such nonsense and that i should look on helplessly when my whole soul cries out against it die then if you must but at least i can cut the emperors throat and then my own when i see your blood  the emperor throws open the door of his box angrily and appears in wrath on the threshold the editor the call boy and the gladiators spring to their feet  the emperor the christians will not fight and your curs cannot get their blood up to attack them its all that fellow with the blazing eyes send for the whip the call boy rushes out on the east side for the whip if that will not move them bring the hot irons the man is like a mountain he returns angrily into the box and slams the door  the call boy returns with a man in a hideous etruscan mask carrying a whip they both rush down the passage into the arena  lavinia rising oh that is unworthy can they not kill him without dishonoring him  androcles scrambling to his feet and running into the middle of the space between the staircases its dreadful now i want to fight i cant bear the sight of a whip the only time i ever hit a man was when he lashed an old horse with a whip it was terrible i danced on his face when he was on the ground he mustnt strike ferrovius ill go into the arena and kill him first he makes a wild dash into the passage as he does so a great clamor is heard from the arena ending in wild applause the gladiators listen and look inquiringly at one another  the editor whats up now  lavinia to the captain what has happened do you think  the captain what can happen they are killing them i suppose  androcles running in through the passage screaming with horror and hiding his eyes  lavinia androcles androcles whats the matter  androcles oh dont ask me dont ask me something too dreadful oh he crouches by her and hides his face in her robe sobbing  the call boy rushing through from the passage as before ropes and hooks there ropes and hooks  the editor well need you excite yourself about it another burst of applause  two slaves in etruscan masks with ropes and drag hooks hurry in  one of the slaves how many dead  the call boy six the slave blows a whistle twice and four more masked slaves rush through into the arena with the same apparatus and the basket bring the baskets the slave whistles three times and runs through the passage with his companion  the captain who are the baskets for  the call boy for the whip hes in pieces theyre all in pieces more or less lavinia hides her face  two more masked slaves come in with a basket and follow the others into the arena as the call boy turns to the gladiators and exclaims exhausted boys hes killed the lot  the emperor again bursting from his box this time in an ecstasy of delight where is he magnificent he shall have a laurel crown  ferrovius madly waving his bloodstained sword rushes through the passage in despair followed by his coreligionists and by the menagerie keeper who goes to the gladiators the gladiators draw their swords nervously  ferrovius lost lost forever i have betrayed my master cut off this right hand it has offended ye have swords my brethren strike  lavinia no no what have you done ferrovius  ferrovius i know not but there was blood behind my eyes and theres blood on my sword what does that mean  the emperor enthusiastically on the landing outside his box what does it mean it means that you are the greatest man in rome it means that you shall have a laurel crown of gold superb fighter i could almost yield you my throne it is a record for my reign i shall live in history once in domitians time a gaul slew three men in the arena and gained his freedom but when before has one naked man slain six armed men of the bravest and best the persecution shall cease if christians can fight like this i shall have none but christians to fight for me to the gladiators you are ordered to become christians you there do you hear  retiarius it is all one to us caesar had i been there with my net the story would have been different  the captain suddenly seizing lavinia by the wrist and dragging her up the steps to the emperor caesar this woman is the sister of ferrovius if she is thrown to the lions he will fret he will lose weight get out of condition  the emperor the lions nonsense to lavinia madam i am proud to have the honor of making your acquaintance your brother is the glory of rome  lavinia but my friends here must they die  the emperor die certainly not there has never been the slightest idea of harming them ladies and gentlemen you are all free pray go into the front of the house and enjoy the spectacle to which your brother has so splendidly contributed captain oblige me by conducting them to the seats reserved for my personal friends  the menagerie keeper caesar i must have one christian for the lion the people have been promised it and they will tear the decorations to bits if they are disappointed  the emperor true true we must have somebody for the new lion  ferrovius throw me to him let the apostate perish  the emperor no no you would tear him in pieces my friend and we cannot afford to throw away lions as if they were mere slaves but we must have somebody this is really extremely awkward  the menagerie keeper why not that little greek chap hes not a christian hes a sorcerer  the emperor the very thing he will do very well  the call boy issuing from the passage number twelve the christian for the new lion  androcles rising and pulling himself sadly together well it was to be after all  lavinia ill go in his place caesar ask the captain whether they do not like best to see a woman torn to pieces he told me so yesterday  the emperor there is something in that there is certainly something in thatif only i could feel sure that your brother would not fret  androcles no i should never have another happy hour no on the faith of a christian and the honor of a tailor i accept the lot that has fallen on me if my wife turns up give her my love and say that my wish was that she should be happy with her next poor fellow caesar go to your box and see how a tailor can die make way for number twelve there he marches out along the passage  the vast audience in the amphitheatre now sees the emperor reenter his box and take his place as androcles desperately frightened but still marching with piteous devotion emerges from the other end of the passage and finds himself at the focus of thousands of eager eyes the lions cage with a heavy portcullis grating is on his left the emperor gives a signal a gong sounds androcles shivers at the sound then falls on his knees and prays  the grating rises with a clash the lion bounds into the arena he rushes round frisking in his freedom he sees androcles he stops rises stiffly by straightening his legs stretches out his nose forward and his tail in a horizontal line behind like a pointer and utters an appalling roar androcles crouches and hides his face in his hands the lion gathers himself for a spring swishing his tail to and fro through the dust in an ecstasy of anticipation androcles throws up his hands in supplication to heaven the lion checks at the sight of androcless face he then steals towards him smells him arches his back purrs like a motor car finally rubs himself against androcles knocking him over androcles supporting himself on his wrist looks affrightedly at the lion the lion limps on three paws holding up the other as if it was wounded a flash of recognition lights up the face of androcles he flaps his hand as if it had a thorn in it and pretends to pull the thorn out and to hurt himself the lion nods repeatedly androcles holds out his hands to the lion who gives him both paws which he shakes with enthusiasm they embrace rapturously finally waltz round the arena amid a sudden burst of deafening applause and out through the passage the emperor watching them in breathless astonishment until they disappear when he rushes from his box and descends the steps in frantic excitement  the emperor my friends an incredible an amazing thing has happened i can no longer doubt the truth of christianity the christians press to him joyfully this christian sorcererwith a yell he breaks off as he sees androcles and the lion emerge from the passage waltzing he bolts wildly up the steps into his box and slams the door all christians and gladiators alike fly for their lives the gladiators bolting into the arena the others in all directions the place is emptied with magical suddenness  androcles naively now i wonder why they all run away from us like that the lion combining a series of yawns purrs and roars achieves something very like a laugh  the emperor standing on a chair inside his box and looking over the wall sorcerer i command you to put that lion to death instantly it is guilty of high treason your conduct is most disgra the lion charges at him up the stairs help he disappears the lion rears against the box looks over the partition at him and roars the emperor darts out through the door and down to androcles pursued by the lion  androcles dont run away sir he cant help springing if you run he seizes the emperor and gets between him and the lion who stops at once dont be afraid of him  the emperor i am not afraid of him the lion crouches growling the emperor clutches androcles keep between us  androcles never be afraid of animals your worship thats the great secret hell be as gentle as a lamb when he knows that you are his friend stand quite still and smile and let him smell you all over just to reassure him for you see hes afraid of you and he must examine you thoroughly before he gives you his confidence to the lion come now tommy and speak nicely to the emperor the great good emperor who has power to have all our heads cut off if we dont behave very very respectfully to him  the lion utters a fearful roar the emperor dashes madly up the steps across the landing and down again on the other side with the lion in hot pursuit androcles rushes after the lion overtakes him as he is descending and throws himself on his back trying to use his toes as a brake before he can stop him the lion gets hold of the trailing end of the emperors robe  androcles oh bad wicked tommy to chase the emperor like that let go the emperors robe at once sir wheres your manners the lion growls and worries the robe dont pull it away from him your worship hes only playing now i shall be really angry with you tommy if you dont let go the lion growls again ill tell you what it is sir he thinks you and i are not friends  the emperor trying to undo the clasp of his brooch friends you infernal scoundrel the lion growls dont let him go curse this brooch i cant get it loose  androcles we mustnt let him lash himself into a rage you must show him that you are my particular friendif you will have the condescension he seizes the emperors hands and shakes them cordially look tommy the nice emperor is the dearest friend andy wandy has in the whole world he loves him like a brother  the emperor you little brute you damned filthy little dog of a greek tailor ill have you burnt alive for daring to touch the divine person of the emperor the lion roars  androcles oh dont talk like that sir he understands every word you say all animals do they take it from the tone of your voice the lion growls and lashes his tail i think hes going to spring at your worship if you wouldnt mind saying something affectionate the lion roars  the emperor shaking androcles hands frantically my dearest mr androcles my sweetest friend my long lost brother come to my arms he embraces androcles oh what an abominable smell of garlic  the lion lets go the robe and rolls over on his back clasping his forepaws over one another coquettishly above his nose  androcles there you see your worship a child might play with him now see he tickles the lions belly the lion wriggles ecstatically come and pet him  the emperor i must conquer these unkingly terrors mind you dont go away from him though he pats the lions chest  androcles oh sir how few men would have the courage to do that  the emperor yes it takes a bit of nerve let us invite the court in and frighten them is he safe do you think  androcles quite safe now sir  the emperor majestically what ho there all who are within hearing return without fear caesar has tamed the lion all the fugitives steal cautiously in the menagerie keeper comes from the passage with other keepers armed with iron bars and tridents take those things away i have subdued the beast he places his foot on it  ferrovius timidly approaching the emperor and looking down with awe on the lion it is strange that i who fear no man should fear a lion  the captain every man fears something ferrovius  the emperor how about the pretorian guard now  ferrovius in my youth i worshipped mars the god of war i turned from him to serve the christian god but today the christian god forsook me and mars overcame me and took back his own the christian god is not yet he will come when mars and i are dust but meanwhile i must serve the gods that are not the god that will be until then i accept service in the guard caesar  the emperor very wisely said all really sensible men agree that the prudent course is to be neither bigoted in our attachment to the old nor rash and unpractical in keeping an open mind for the new but to make the best of both dispensations  the captain what do you say lavinia will you too be prudent  lavinia on the stair no ill strive for the coming of the god who is not yet  the captain may i come and argue with you occasionally  lavinia yes handsome captain you may he kisses her hands  the emperor and now my friends though i do not as you see fear this lion yet the strain of his presence is considerable for none of us can feel quite sure what he will do next  the menagerie keeper caesar give us this greek sorcerer to be a slave in the menagerie he has a way with the beasts  androcles distressed not if they are in cages they should not be kept in cages they must all be let out  the emperor i give this sorcerer to be a slave to the first man who lays hands on him the menagerie keepers and the gladiators rush for androcles the lion starts up and faces them they surge back you see how magnanimous we romans are androcles we suffer you to go in peace  androcles i thank your worship i thank you all ladies and gentlemen come tommy whilst we stand together no cage for you no slavery for me he goes out with the lion everybody crowding away to give him as wide a berth as possible    in this play i have represented one of the roman persecutions of the early christians not as the conflict of a false theology with a true but as what all such persecutions essentially are an attempt to suppress a propaganda that seemed to threaten the interests involved in the established law and order organized and maintained in the name of religion and justice by politicians who are pure opportunist haveandholders people who are shown by their inner light the possibility of a better world based on the demand of the spirit for a nobler and more abundant life not for themselves at the expense of others but for everybody are naturally dreaded and therefore hated by the haveandholders who keep always in reserve two sure weapons against them the first is a persecution effected by the provocation organization and arming of that herd instinct which makes men abhor all departures from custom and by the most cruel punishments and the wildest calumnies force eccentric people to behave and profess exactly as other people do the second is by leading the herd to war which immediately and infallibly makes them forget everything even their most cherished and hardwon public liberties and private interests in the irresistible surge of their pugnacity and the tense preoccupation of their terror  there is no reason to believe that there was anything more in the roman persecutions than this the attitude of the roman emperor and the officers of his staff towards the opinions at issue were much the same as those of a modern british home secretary towards members of the lower middle classes when some pious policeman charges them with bad taste technically called blasphemy bad taste being a violation of good taste which in such matters practically means hypocrisy the home secretary and the judges who try the case are usually far more sceptical and blasphemous than the poor men whom they persecute and their professions of horror at the blunt utterance of their own opinions are revolting to those behind the scenes who have any genuine religious sensibility but the thing is done because the governing classes provided only the law against blasphemy is not applied to themselves strongly approve of such persecution because it enables them to represent their own privileges as part of the religion of the country  therefore my martyrs are the martyrs of all time and my persecutors the persecutors of all time my emperor who has no sense of the value of common peoples lives and amuses himself with killing as carelessly as with sparing is the sort of monster you can make of any sillyclever gentleman by idolizing him we are still so easily imposed on by such idols that one of the leading pastors of the free churches in london denounced my play on the ground that my persecuting emperor is a very fine fellow and the persecuted christians ridiculous from which i conclude that a popular pulpit may be as perilous to a mans soul as an imperial throne  all my articulate christians the reader will notice have different enthusiasms which they accept as the same religion only because it involves them in a common opposition to the official religion and consequently in a common doom androcles is a humanitarian naturalist whose views surprise everybody lavinia a clever and fearless freethinker shocks the pauline ferrovius who is comparatively stupid and conscience ridden spintho the blackguardly debauchee is presented as one of the typical christians of that period on the authority of st augustine who seems to have come to the conclusion at one period of his development that most christians were what we call wrong uns no doubt he was to some extent right i have had occasion often to point out that revolutionary movements attract those who are not good enough for established institutions as well as those who are too good for them  but the most striking aspect of the play at this moment is the terrible topicality given it by the war we were at peace when i pointed out by the mouth of ferrovius the path of an honest man who finds out when the trumpet sounds that he cannot follow jesus many years earlier in the devils disciple i touched the same theme even more definitely and showed the minister throwing off his black coat for ever when he discovered amid the thunder of the captains and the shouting that he was a born fighter great numbers of our clergy have found themselves of late in the position of ferrovius and anthony anderson they have discovered that they hate not only their enemies but everyone who does not share their hatred and that they want to fight and to force other people to fight they have turned their churches into recruiting stations and their vestries into munition workshops but it has never occurred to them to take off their black coats and say quite simply i find in the hour of trial that the sermon on the mount is tosh and that i am not a christian i apologize for all the unpatriotic nonsense i have been preaching all these years have the goodness to give me a revolver and a commission in a regiment which has for its chaplain a priest of the god mars my god not a bit of it they have stuck to their livings and served mars in the name of christ to the scandal of all religious mankind when the archbishop of york behaved like a gentleman and the head master of eton preached a christian sermon and were reviled by the rabble the martian parsons encouraged the rabble for this they made no apologies or excuses good or bad they simple indulged their passions just as they had always indulged their class prejudices and commercial interests without troubling themselves for a moment as to whether they were christians or not they did not protest even when a body calling itself the antigerman league not having noticed apparently that it had been anticipated by the british empire the french republic and the kingdoms of italy japan and serbia actually succeeded in closing a church at forest hill in which god was worshipped in the german language one would have supposed that this grotesque outrage on the commonest decencies of religion would have provoked a remonstrance from even the worldliest bench of bishops but no apparently it seemed to the bishops as natural that the house of god should be looted when he allowed german to be spoken in it as that a bakers shop with a german name over the door should be pillaged their verdict was in effect serve god right for creating the germans the incident would have been impossible in a country where the church was as powerful as the church of england had it had at the same time a spark of catholic as distinguished from tribal religion in it as it is the thing occurred and as far as i have observed the only people who gasped were the freethinkers thus we see that even among men who make a profession of religion the great majority are as martian as the majority of their congregations the average clergyman is an official who makes his living by christening babies marrying adults conducting a ritual and making the best he can when he has any conscience about it of a certain routine of school superintendence district visiting and organization of almsgiving which does not necessarily touch christianity at any point except the point of the tongue the exceptional or religious clergyman may be an ardent pauline salvationist in which case his more cultivated parishioners dislike him and say that he ought to have joined the methodists or he may be an artist expressing religious emotion without intellectual definition by means of poetry music vestments and architecture also producing religious ecstacy by physical expedients such as fasts and vigils in which case he is denounced as a ritualist or he may be either a unitarian deist like voltaire or tom paine or the more modern sort of anglican theosophist to whom the holy ghost is the elan vital of bergson and the father and son are an expression of the fact that our functions and aspects are manifold and that we are all sons and all either potential or actual parents in which case he is strongly suspected by the straiter salvationists of being little better than an atheist all these varieties you see excite remark they may be very popular with their congregations but they are regarded by the average man as the freaks of the church the church like the society of which it is an organ is balanced and steadied by the great central philistine mass above whom theology looms as a highly spoken of and doubtless most important thing like greek tragedy or classical music or the higher mathematics but who are very glad when church is over and they can go home to lunch or dinner having in fact for all practical purposes no reasoned convictions at all and being equally ready to persecute a poor freethinker for saying that st james was not infallible and to send one of the peculiar people to prison for being so very peculiar as to take st james seriously  in short a christian martyr was thrown to the lions not because he was a christian but because he was a crank that is an unusual sort of person and multitudes of people quite as civilized and amiable as we crowded to see the lions eat him just as they now crowd the lionhouse in the zoo at feedingtime not because they really cared twopence about diana or christ or could have given you any intelligent or correct account of the things diana and christ stood against one another for but simply because they wanted to see a curious and exciting spectacle you dear reader have probably run to see a fire and if somebody came in now and told you that a lion was chasing a man down the street you would rush to the window and if anyone were to say that you were as cruel as the people who let the lion loose on the man you would be justly indignant now that we may no longer see a man hanged we assemble outside the jail to see the black flag run up that is our duller method of enjoying ourselves in the old roman spirit and if the government decided to throw persons of unpopular or eccentric views to the lions in the albert hall or the earls court stadium tomorrow can you doubt that all the seats would be crammed mostly by people who could not give you the most superficial account of the views in question much less unlikely things have happened it is true that if such a revival does take place soon the martyrs will not be members of heretical religious sects they will be peculiars antivivisectionists flatearth men scoffers at the laboratories or infidels who refuse to kneel down when a procession of doctors goes by but the lions will hurt them just as much and the spectators will enjoy themselves just as much as the roman lions and spectators used to do  it was currently reported in the berlin newspapers that when androcles was first performed in berlin the crown prince rose and left the house unable to endure the i hope very clear and fair exposition of autocratic imperialism given by the roman captain to his christian prisoners no english imperialist was intelligent and earnest enough to do the same in london if the report is correct i confirm the logic of the crown prince and am glad to find myself so well understood but i can assure him that the empire which served for my model when i wrote androcles was as he is now finding to his cost much nearer my home than the german one
