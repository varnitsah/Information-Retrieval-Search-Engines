21404009	their wedding journey  by william dean howells    contents       the outset      a midsummerdays dream      the night boat      a days railroading      the enchanted city and beyond      niagara      down the st lawrence      the sentiment of montreal      homeward and home      niagara revisited twelve years after their wedding     their wedding journey  by william dean howells  1871     i the outset  they first met in boston but the match was made in europe where they afterwards saw each other whither indeed he followed her and there the match was also broken off why it was broken off and why it was renewed after a lapse of years is part of quite a long lovestory which i do not think myself qualified to rehearse distrusting my fitness for a sustained or involved narration though i am persuaded that a skillful romancer could turn the courtship of basil and isabel march to excellent account fortunately for me however in attempting to tell the reader of the weddingjourney of a newly married couple no longer very young to be sure but still fresh in the light of their love i shall have nothing to do but to talk of some ordinary traits of american life as these appeared to them to speak a little of wellknown and easily accessible places to present now a bit of landscape and now a sketch of character  they had agreed to make their weddingjourney in the simplest and quietest way and as it did not take place at once after their marriage but some weeks later it had all the desired charm of privacy from the outset  how much better said isabel to go now when nobody cares whether you go or stay than to have started off upon a wretched weddingbreakfast all tears and trousseau and had people wanting to see you aboard the cars now there will not be a suspicion of honeymoonshine about us we shall go just like anybody elsewith a difference dear with a difference and she took basils cheeks between her hands in order to do this she had to ran round the table for they were at dinner and isabels aunt with whom they had begun married life sat substantial between them it was rather a girlish thing for isabel and she added with a conscious blush we are past our first youth you know and we shall not strike the public as bridal shall we my one horror in life is an evident bride  basil looked at her fondly as if he did not think her at all too old to be taken for a bride and for my part i do not object to a womans being of isabels age if she is of a good heart and temper life must have been very unkind to her if at that age she have not won more than she has lost it seemed to basil that his wife was quite as fair as when they met first eight years before but he could not help recurring with an inextinguishable regret to the long interval of their broken engagement which but for that fatality they might have spent together he imagined in just such rapture as this the regret always haunted him more or less it was part of his love the loss accounted irreparable really enriched the final gain  i dont know he said presently with as much gravity as a man can whose cheeks are clasped between a ladys hands you dont begin very well for a bride who wishes to keep her secret if you behave in this way they will put us into the bridal chambers at all the hotels and the carstheyre beginning to have them on the palacecars  just then a shadow fell into the room  wasnt that thunder isabel asked her aunt who had been contentedly surveying the tender spectacle before her o dear youll never be able to go by the boat tonight if it storms it s actually raining now  in fact it was the beginning of that terrible storm of june 1870 all in a moment out of the hot sunshine of the day it burst upon us before we quite knew that it threatened even before we had fairly noticed the clouds and it went on from passion to passion with an inexhaustible violence in the square upon which our friends looked out of their diningroom windows the trees whitened in the gusts and darkened in the driving floods of the rainfall and in some paroxysms of the tempest bent themselves in desperate submission and then with a great shudder rent away whole branches and flung them far off upon the ground hail mingled with the rain and now the few umbrellas that had braved the storm vanished and the hurtling ice crackled upon the pavement where the lightning played like flames burning from the earth while the thunder roared overhead without ceasing there was something splendidly theatrical about it all and when a streetcar laden to the last inch of its capacity came by with horses that pranced and leaped under the stinging blows of the hailstones our friends felt as if it were an effective and very naturalistic bit of pantomime contrived for their admiration yet as to themselves they were very sensible of a potent reality in the affair and at intervals during the storm they debated about going at all that day and decided to go and not to go according to the changing complexion of the elements basil had said that as this was their first journey together in america he wished to give it at the beginning as pungent a national character as possible and that as he could imagine nothing more peculiarly american than a voyage to new york by a fall river boat they ought to take that route thither so much upholstery so much music such variety cf company he understood could not be got in any other way and it might be that they would even catch a glimpse of the inventor of the combination who represented the very excess and extremity of a certain kind of americanism isabel had eagerly consented but these aesthetic motives were paralyzed for her by the thought of passing point judith in a storm and she descended from her high intents first to the inside boats without the magnificence and the orchestra and then to the idea of going by land in a sleepingcar having comfortably accomplished this feat she treated basils consent as a matter of course not because she did not regard him but because as a woman she could not conceive of the steps to her conclusion as unknown to him and always treated her own decisions as the product of their common reasoning but her husband held out for the boat and insisted that if the storm fell before seven oclock they could reach it at newport by the last express and it was this obstinacy that in proof of isabels wisdom obliged them to wait two hours in the station before going by the land route the storm abated at five oclock and though the rain continued it seemed well by a quarter of seven to set out for the old colony depot in sight of which a sudden and vivid flash of lightning caused isabel to seize her husbands arm and to implore him o dont go by the boat on this basil had the incredible weakness to yield and bade the driver take them to the worcester depot it was the first swerving from the ideal in their wedding journey but it was by no means the last though it must be confessed that it was early to begin  they both felt more tranquil when they were irretrievably committed by the purchase of their tickets and when they sat down in the waiting room of the station with all the time between seven and nine oclock before them basil would have eked out the business of checking the trunks into an affair of some length but the baggagemaster did his duty with pitiless celerity and so basil in the mere excess of his disoccupation bought an accidentinsurance ticket this employed him half a minute and then he gave up the unequal contest and went and took his place beside isabel who sat prettily wrapped in her shawl perfectly content  isnt it charming she said gayly having to wait so long it puts me in mind of some of those other journeys we took together but i cant think of those times with any patience when we might really have had each other and didnt do you remember how long we had to wait at chambery and the numbers of military gentlemen that waited too with their little waists and their kisses when they met and that poor married military gentleman with the plain wife and the two children and a tarnished uniform he seemed to be somehow in misfortune and his mustache hung down in such a spiritless way while all the other military mustaches about curled and bristled with so much boldness i think salles dattente everywhere are delightful and there is such a community of interest in them all that when i come here only to go out to brookline i feel myself a traveller once morea blessed stranger in a strange land o dear basil those were happy times after all when we might have had each other and didnt and now were the more precious for having been so long lost  she drew closer and closer to him and looked at him in a way that threatened betrayal of her bridal character  isabel you will be having your head on my shoulder next said he  never she answered fiercely recovering her distance with a start but dearest if you do see me going toact absurdly you know do stop me  im very sorry but ive got myself to stop besides i didnt undertake to preserve the incognito of this bridal party  if any accident of the sort dreaded had really happened it would not have mattered so much for as yet they were the sole occupants of the waiting room to be sure the ticketseller was there and the lady who checked packages left in her charge but these must have seen so many endearments pass between passengersthat a fleeting caress or so would scarcely have drawn their notice to our pair yet isabel did not so much even as put her hand into her husbands and as basil afterwards said it was very good practice  our temporary state whatever it is is often mirrored in all that come near us and our friends were fated to meet frequent parodies of their happiness from first to last on this journey the travesty began with the very first people who entered the waitingroom after themselves and who were a very young couple starting like themselves upon a pleasure tour which also was evidently one of the first tours of any kind that they had made it was of modest extent and comprised going to new york and back but they talked of it with a fluttered and joyful expectation as if it were a voyage to europe presently there appeared a burlesque of their happiness but with a touch of tragedy in that kind of young man who is called by the females of his class a fellow and two young women of that kind known to him as girls he took a place between these and presently began a robust flirtation with one of them he possessed himself after a brief struggle of her parasol and twirled it about as he uttered with a sort of tender rudeness inconceivable vapidities such as you would expect from none but a man of the highest fashion the girl thus courted became selfishly unconscious of everything but her own joy and made no attempt to bring the other girl within its warmth but left her to languish forgotten on the other side the latter sometimes leaned forward and tried to divert a little of the flirtation to herself but the flirters snubbed her with short answers and presently she gave up and sat still in the sad patience of uncourted women in this attitude she became a burden to isabel who was glad when the three took themselves away and were succeeded by a very stylish couplefrom new york she knew as well as if they had given her their address on west 999th street the lady was not pretty and she was not isabel thought dressed in the perfect taste of boston but she owned frankly to herself that the newyorkeress was stylish undeniably effective the gentleman bought a ticket for new york and remained at the window of the office talking quite easily with the seller  you couldnt do that my poor basil said isabel youd be afraid  o dear yes im only too glad to get off without browbeating though i must say that this officer looks affable enough really he added as an acquaintance of the ticketseller came in and nodded to him and said hot today this is very strange i always felt as if these men had no private life no friendships like the rest of us on duty they seem so like sovereigns set apart from mankind and above us all that its quite incredible they should have the common personal relations  at intervals of their talk and silence there came vivid flashes of lightning and quite heavy shocks of thunder very consoling to our friends who took them as so many compliments to their prudence in not going by the boat and who had secret doubts of their wisdom whenever these acknowledgments were withheld isabel went so far as to say that she hoped nothing would happen to the boat but i think she would cheerfully have learnt that the vessel had been obliged to put back to newport on account of the storm or even that it had been driven ashore at a perfectly safe place  people constantly came and went in the waitingroom which was sometimes quite full and again empty of all but themselves in the course of their observations they formed many cordial friendships and bitter enmities upon the ground of personal appearance or particulars of dress with people whom they saw for half a minute upon an average and they took such a keen interest in every one that it would be hard to say whether they were more concerned in an old gentleman with vigorously upright irongray hair who sat fronting them and reading all the evening papers or a young man who hurled himself through the door bought a ticket with terrific precipitation burst out again and then ran down a departing train before it got out of the station they loved the old gentleman for a certain stubborn benevolence of expression and if they had been friends of the young man and his family for generations and felt bound if any harm befell him to go and break the news gently to his parents their nerves could not have been more intimately wrought upon by his hazardous behavior still as they had their tickets for new york and he was going out on a merely local trainto brookline i believe they could not even in their anxiety repress a feeling of contempt for his unambitious destination  they were already as completely cut off from local associations and sympathies as if they were a thousand miles and many months away from boston they enjoyed the lonely flaring of the gasjets as a gust of wind drew through the station they shared the gloom and isolation of a man who took a seat in the darkest corner of the room and sat there with folded arms the genius of absence in the patronizing spirit of travellers in a foreign country they noted and approved the vases of cutflowers in the booth of the lady who checked packages and the pots of ivy in her windows these poor bostonians they said have some love of the beautiful in their rugged natures  but after all was said and thought it was only eight oclock and they still had an hour to wait  basil grew restless and isabel said with a subtile interpretation of his uneasiness i dont want anything to eat basil but i think i know the weaknesses of men and you had better go and pass the next halfhour over a plate of something indigestible  this was said con stizza the least little suggestion of it but basil rose with shameful alacrity darling if its your wish  its my fate basil said isabel  ill go he exclaimed because it isnt bridal and will help us to pass for old married people  no no basil be honest fibbing isnt your forte i wonder you went into the insurance business you ought to have been a lawyer go because you like eating and are hungry perhaps or think you may be so before we get to new york  i shall amuse myself well enough here  i suppose it is always a little shocking and grievous to a wife when she recognizes a rival in butchersmeat and the vegetables of the season with her slender relishes for pastry and confectionery and her dainty habits of lunching she cannot reconcile with the idea of her husbands capacity for breakfasting dining supping and hot meals at all hours of the day and nightas they write it on the signboards of barbaric eatinghouses but isabel would have only herself to blame if she had not perceived this trait of basils before marriage she recurred now as his figure disappeared down the station to memorable instances of his appetite in their european travels during their first engagement yes he ate terribly at susa when i was too full of the notion of getting into italy to care for bouillon and cold roast chicken at rome i thought i must break with him on account of the wildboar and at heidelberg the sausage and the hamhow could he in my presence but i took him with all his faultsand was glad to get him she added ending her meditation with a little burst of candor and she did not even think of basils appetite when he reappeared  with the thronging of many sorts of people in parties and singly into the waiting room they became once again mere observers of their kind more or less critical in temper until the crowd grew so that individual traits were merged in the character of multitude even then they could catch glimpses of faces so sweet or fine that they made themselves felt like moments of repose in the tumult and here and there was something so grotesque in dress of manner that it showed distinct from the rest the ticketsellers stamp clicked incessantly as he sold tickets to all points south and west to new york philadelphia charleston to new orleans chicago omaha to st paul duluth st louis and it would not have been hard to find in that anxious bustle that unsmiling eagerness an image of the whole busy affair of life it was not a particularly sane spectacle that impatience to be off to some place that lay not only in the distance but also in the futureto which no line of road carries you with absolute certainty across an interval of time full of every imaginable chance and influence it is easy enough to buy a ticket to cincinnati but it is somewhat harder to arrive there say that all goes well is it exactly you who arrive  in the midst of the disquiet there entered at last an old woman so very infirm that she had to be upheld on either hand by her husband and the hackman who had brought them while a young girl went before with shawls and pillows which she arranged upon the seat there the invalid lay down and turned towards the crowd a white suffering face which was yet so heavenly meek and peaceful that it comforted whoever looked at it  in spirit our happy friends bowed themselves before it and owned that there was something better than happiness in it  what is it like isabel  o i dont know darling she said but she thought perhaps it is like some blessed sorrow that takes us out of this prison of a world and sets us free of our everyday hates and desires our aims our fears ourselves maybe a long and mortal sickness might come to wear such a face in one of us two and the other could see it and not regret the poor mask of youth and pretty looks that had fallen away  she rose and went over to the sick woman on whose face beamed a tender smile as isabel spoke to her a chord thrilled in two lives hitherto unknown to each other but what was said basil would not ask when the invalid had taken isabels hand between her own as for adieu and she came back to his side with swimming eyes perhaps his wife could have given no good reason for her emotion if he had asked it but it made her very sweet and dear to him and i suppose that when a tolerably unselfish man is once secure of a womans love he is ordinarily more affected by her compassion and tenderness for other objects than by her feelings towards himself he likes well enough to think she loves me but still better how kind and good she is  they lost sight of the invalid in the hurry of getting places on the cars and they never saw her again the man at the wicketgate leading to the train had thrown it up and the people were pressing furiously through as if their lives hung upon the chance of instant passage basil had secured his ticket for the sleepingcar and so he and isabel stood aside and watched the tumult when the rash was over they passed through and as they walked up and down the platform beside the train i was thinking said isabel after i spoke to that poor old lady of what clara williams says that she wonders the happiest women in the world can look each other in the face without bursting into tears their happiness is so unreasonable and so built upon and hedged about with misery she declares that theres nothing so sad to her as a bride unless its a young mother or a little girl growing up in the innocent gayety of her heart she wonders they can live through it  clara is very much of a reformer and would make an end of all of us men i supposeexcept her father who supports her in the leisure that enables her to do her deep thinking she little knows what we poor fellows have to suffer and how often we break down in business hours and sob upon one anothers necks did that old lady talk to you in the same strain  o no she spoke very calmly of her sickness and said she had lived a blessed life perhaps it was that made me shed those few small tears she seemed a very religious person  yes said basil it is almost a pity that religion is going out but then you are to have the franchise  all aboard  this warning cry saved him from whatever heresy he might have been about to utter and presently the train carried them out into the gassprinkled darkness with an evergrowing speed that soon left the city lamps far behind it is a phenomenon whose commonness alone prevents it from being most impressive that departure of the nightexpress the two hundred miles it is to travel stretch before it traced by those slender clews to lose which is ruin and about which hang so many dangers the draw bridges that gape upon the way the trains that stand smoking and steaming on the track the rail that has borne the wear so long that it must soon snap under it the deep cut where the overhanging mass of rock trembles to its fall the obstruction that a pitiless malice may have placed in your pathyou think of these after the journey is done but they seldom haunt your fancy while it lasts the knowledge of your helplessness in any circumstances is so perfect that it begets a sense of irresponsibility almost of security and as you drowse upon the pallet of the sleeping car and feel yourself hurled forward through the obscurity you are almost thankful that you can do nothing for it is upon this condition only that you can endure it and some such condition as this i suppose accounts for many heroic facts in the world to the fantastic mood which possesses you equally sleeping or waking the stoppages of the train have a weird character and worcester springfield new haven and stamford are rather points in dreamland than wellknown towns of new england as the train stops you drowse if you have been waking and wake if you have been in a doze but in any case you are aware of the locomotive hissing and coughing beyond the station of flaring gasjets of clattering feet of passengers getting on and off then of some one conductor or stationmaster walking the whole length of the train and then you are aware of an insane satisfaction in renewed flight through the darkness you think hazily of the folk in their beds in the town left behind who stir uneasily at the sound of your trains departing whistle and so all is a blank vigil or a blank slumber  by daylight basil and isabel found themselves at opposite ends of the car struggling severally with the problem of the mornings toilet when the combat was ended they were surprised at the decency of their appearance and isabel said i think im presentable to an early broadway public and ive a fancy for not going to a hotel lucy will be expecting us out there before noon and we can pass the time pleasantly enough for a few hours just wandering about  she was a woman who loved any cheap defiance of custom and she had an agreeable sense of adventure in what she proposed besides she felt that nothing could be more in the unconventional spirit in which they meant to make their whole journey than a stroll about new york at halfpast six in the morning  delightful answered basil who was always charmed with these small originalities you look well enough for an evening party and besides you wont meet one of your own critical class on broadway at this hour we will breakfast at one of those gilded metropolitan restaurants and then go round to leonards who will be able to give us just three unhurried seconds after that well push on out to his place  at that early hour there were not many people astir on the wide avenue down which our friends strolled when they left the station but in the aspect of those they saw there was something that told of a greater heat than they had yet known in boston and they were sensible of having reached a more southern latitude the air though freshened by the overnights storm still wanted the briskness and sparkle and pungency of the boston air which is as delicious in summer as it is terrible in winter and the faces that showed themselves were sodden from the yesterdays heat and perspiration a cornergrocer seated in a sort of fierce despondency upon a keg near his shop door had lightly equipped himself for the struggle of the day in the battered armor of the day before and in a pair of roomy pantaloons and a baggy shirt of neutral tintperhaps he had made a vow not to change it whilst the siege of the hot weather lastednow confronted the advancing sunlight before which the long shadows of the buildings were slowly retiring a marketing mother of a family paused at a provisionstore and looking weakly in at the whiteaproned butcher among his meats and flies passes without an effort to purchase hurried and wearied shopgirls tripped by in the draperies that betrayed their sad necessity to be both fine and shabby from a boardinghouse door issued briskly one of those cool young new yorkers whom no circumstances can oppress breezycoated whitelivened clean with a good cigar in the mouth a light cane caught upon the elbow of one of the arms holding up the paper from which the mornings news is snatched whilst the person sways lightly with the walk in the streetcars that slowly tinkled up and down were rows of people with baskets between their legs and papers before their faces and all showed by some peculiarity of air or dress the excess of heat which they had already borne and to which they seemed to look forward and gave by the scantiness of their number a vivid impression of the uncounted thousands within doors prolonging before the days terror began the oblivion of sleep  as they turned into one of the numerical streets to cross to broadway and found themselves in a yet deeper seclusion basilbegan to utter in a musing tone          a city against the worlds gray prime         lost in some desert far from time         where noiseless ages gliding through         have only sifted sands and dew         yet still a marble head of man         lying on all the haunted plan         the passions of the human heart         beating the marble breast of art         were not more lone to one who first         upon its giant silence burst         than this strange quiet where the tide         of life upheaved on either aide         hangs trembling ready soon to beat         with human waves the morning street  how lovely said isabel swiftly catching at her skirt and deftly escaping contact with one of a long row of ashbarrels posted sentinellike on the edge of the pavement whose is it basil  ah a poets answered her husband a man of whom we shall one day any of us be glad to say that we liked him before he was famous what a nebulous sweetness the first lines have and what a clear cool light of daybreak in the last  you could have been as good a poet as that basil said the everpersonal and concretelyspeaking isabel who could not look at a mountain without thinking what basil might have done in that way if he had tried  o no i couldnt dear its very difficult being any poet at all though its easy to be like one but ive done with it i broke with the muse the day you accepted me she came into my office looking so shabbynot unlike one of those poor shopgirls and as i was very well dressed from having just been to see you why you know i felt the difference well my dear said i not quite liking the look of reproach she was giving me you are groins to leave me she answered sadly well yes i suppose i must you see the insurance business is very absorbing and besides it has a bad appearance your coming about so in office hours and in those clothes o she moaned out you used to welcome me at all times out in the country and thought me prettily dressed yes yes but this is boston and boston makes a great difference in ones ideas and im going to be married too come i dont want to seem ungrateful we have had many pleasant times together i own it and ive no objections to your being present at christmas and thanksgiving and birthdays but really i must draw the line there she gave me a look that made my heart ache and went straight to my desk and took out of a pigeon hole a lot of papersodes upon your cruelty isabel songs to you sonnetsthe sonnet a mighty poor one id made the day beforeand threw them all into the grate then she turned to me again signed adieu with mute lips and passed out i could hear the bottom wire of the poor things hoopskirt clicking against each step of the stairway as she went slowly and heavily down to the street o dontdont basil said his wife it seems like something wrong i think you ought to have been ashamed  ashamed i was heart broken but it had to come to that as i got hopeful about you the muse became a sad bore and more than once i found myself smiling at her when her back was turned the muse doesnt like being laughed at any more than another woman would and she would have left me shortly no i couldnt be a poet like our morningstreet friend but see the human wave is beginning to sprinkle the pavement with cooks and secondgirls  they were frowzy servingmaids and silent each swept down her own door steps and the pavement in front of her own house and then knocked her broom on the curbstone and vanished into the house on which the hand of change had already fallen it was no longer a street solely devoted to the domestic gods but had been invaded at more than one point by the bustling deities of business in such streets the irregular inspired doctors and doctresses come first with inordinate doorplates then a milliner filling the parlor window with new bonnets here even a publisher had hung his sign beside a door through which the feet of young ladies used to trip and the feet of little children to patter here and there stood groups of dwellings unmolested as yet outwardly but even these had a certain careworn and guilty air as if they knew themselves to be cheapish boardinghouses or furnished lodgings for gentlemen and were trying to hide it to these belonged the frowzy servingwomen to these the rows of ashbarrels in which the decrepit children and mothers of the streets were clawing for bits of coal  by the time basil and isabel reached broadway there were already some omnibuses beginning their long days travel up and down the handsome tiresome length of that avenue but for the most part it was empty there was of course a hurry of footpassengers upon the sidewalks but these were sparse and uncharacteristic for new york proper was still fast asleep the waiter at the restaurant into which our friends stepped was so well aware of this and so perfectly assured they were not of the city that he could not forbear a little patronage of them which they did not resent he brought basil what he had ordered in barbaric abundance and charged for it with barbaric splendor it is all but impossible not to wish to stand well with your waiter i have myself been often treated with conspicuous rudeness by the tribe yet i have never been able to withhold the douceur that marked me for a gentleman in their eyes and entitled me to their dishonorable esteem basil was not superior to this folly and left the waster with the conviction that if he was not a new yorker he was a highbred man of the world at any rate  vexed by a sense of his own pitifulness this man of the world continued his pilgrimage down broadway which even in that desert state was full of a certain interest troops of laborers straggled along the pavements each with his dinnerpail in hand and in many places the eternal building up and pulling down was already going on carts were struggling up the slopes of vast cellars with loads of distracting rubbish here stood the halfdemolished walls of a house with a sad variety of wallpaper showing in the different rooms there clinked the trowel upon the brick yonder the hammer on the stone overhead swung and threatened the marble block that the derrick was lifting to its place as yet these forces of demolition and construction had the business of the street almost to themselves  why how shabby the street is said isabel at last  when i landed after being abroad i remember that broadway impressed me with its splendor  ah i but you were merely coming from europe then and now you arrive from burton and are contrasting this poor broadway with washington street dont be hard upon it isabel every street cant be a boston street you know said basil isabel herself a bostonian of great intensity both by birth and conviction believed her husband the only man able to have thoroughly baffled the malignity of the stars in causing him to be born out of boston yet he sometimes trifled with his hardly achieved triumph and even showed an indifference to it with an insincerity of which there can be no doubt whatever  o stuff she retorted as if i had any of that silly local pride though you know well enough that boston is the best place in the world but basil i suppose broadway strikes us as so fine on coming ashore from europe because we hardly expect anything of america then  well i dont know perhaps the street has some positive grandeur of its own though it needs a multitude of people in it to bring out its best effects ill allow its disheartening shabbiness and meanness in many ways but to stand in front of grace church on a clear daya day of late september sayand look down the swarming length of broadway on the movement and the numbers while the niagara roar swelled and swelled from those human rapids was always like strong new wine to me i dont think the world affords such another sight and for one moment at such times id have been willing to be an irish councilman that i might have some right to the pride i felt in the capital of the irish republic what a fine thing it must be for each victim of six centuries of oppression to reflect that he owns at least a dozen americans and that with his fellows he rules a hundred helpless millionaires  like all daughters of a free country isabel knew nothing about politics and she felt that she was getting into deep water she answered buoyantly but she was glad to make her weariness the occasion of hailing a stage and changing the conversation the farther down town they went the busier the street grew and about the astor house where they alighted there was already a bustle that nothing but a fire could have created at the same hour in boston a little farther on the steeple of trinity rose high into the scorching sunlight while below in the shadow that was darker than it was cool slumbered the old graves among their flowers  how still they lie mused the happy wife peering through the iron fence in passing  yes their weddingjourneys are ended poor things said basil and through both their minds flashed the wonder if they should ever come to something like that but it appeared so impossible that they both smiled at the absurdity  its too early yet for leonard continued basil what a pity the churchyard is locked up we could spend the time so delightfully in it but never mind let us go down to the batteryit s not a very pleasant place but its near and its historical and its openwhere these drowsy friends of ours used to take the air when they were in the fashion and had some occasion for the element in its freshness you can imagineits cheaphow they used to see mr burr and mr hamilton down there  all places that fashion has once loved and abandoned are very melancholy but of all such places i think the battery is the most forlorn are there some sickly locusttrees there that cast a tremulous and decrepit shade upon the mangy grassplots i believe so but i do not make sure i am certain only of the mangy grassplots or rather the spaces between the paths thinly overgrown with some kind of refuse and opprobrious weed a stunted and pauper vegetation proper solely to the new york battery at that hour of the summer morning when our friends with the aimlessness of strangers who are waiting to do something else saw the ancient promenade a few scant and hungryeyed little boys and girls were wandering over this weedy growth not playing but moving listlessly to and fro fantastic in the wild inaptness of their costumes one of these little creatures wore with an odd involuntary jauntiness the castoff best drew of some happier child a gay little garment cut low in the neck and short in the sleeves which gave her the grotesque effect of having been at a party the night before presently came two jaded women a mother and a grandmother that appeared when they had crawled out of their beds to have put on only so much clothing as the law compelled they abandoned themselves upon the green stuff whatever it was and with their lean hands clasped outside their knees sat and stared silent and hopeless at the eastern sky at the heart of the terrible furnace into which in those days the world seemed cast to be burnt up while the child which the younger woman had brought with her feebly wailed unheeded at her side on one side of these women were the shameless houses out of which they might have crept and which somehow suggested riotous maritime dissipation on the other side were those houses in which had once dwelt rich and famous folk but which were now dropping down the boardinghouse scale through various unhomelike occupations to final dishonor and despair down nearer the water and not far from the castle that was once a playhouse and is now the depot of emigration stood certain expresswagons and about these lounged a few hardlooking men beyond laughed and danced the fresh blue water of the bay dotted with sails and smokestacks  well said basil i think if i could choose i should like to be a friendless german boy setting foot for the first time on this happy continent fancy his rapture on beholding this lovely spot and these charming american faces what a smiling aspect life in the new world must wear to his young eyes and how his heart must leap within him  yes basil its all very pleasing and thank you for bringing me but if you dont think of any other new york delights to show me do let us go and sit in leonards office till he comes and then get out into the country as soon as possible  basil defended himself against the imputation that he had been trying to show new york to his wife or that he had any thought but of whiling away the long morning hours until it should be time to go to leonard he protested that a knowledge of europe made new york the most uninteresting town in america and that it was the last place in the world where he should think of amusing himself or any one else and then they both upbraided the citys bigness and dullness with an enjoyment that none but bostonians can know they particularly derided the notion of new yorks being loved by any one it was immense it was grand in some ways parts of it were exceedingly handsome but it was too vast too coarse too restless they could imagine its being liked by a successful young man of business or by a rich young girl ignorant of life and with not too nice a taste in her pleasures but that it should be dear to any poet or scholar or any woman of wisdom and refinement that they could not imagine they could not think of any ones loving new york as dante loved florence or as madame de stael loved paris or as johnson loved black homely homelike london and as they twittered their little dispraises the giant mother of commerce was growing more and more conscious of herself waking from her nights sleep and becoming aware of her fleets and trains and the myriad hands and wheels that throughout the whole sea and land move for her and do her will even while she sleeps all about the weddingjourneyers swelled the deep tide of life back from its nightlong ebb broadway had filled her length with people not yet the most characteristic new york crowd but the not less interesting multitude of strangers arrived by the early boats and trams and that easily distinguishable class of lately newyorkized people from other places about whom in the metropolis still hung the provincial traditions of early rising and over all from moment to moment the eager audacious welldressed proper life of the mighty city was beginning to prevailthough this was not so notable where basil and isabel had paused at a certain window it was the office of one of the english steamers and he was saying it was by this line i sailed you knowand she was interrupting him with when who could have dreamed that you would ever be telling me of it here so the old marvel was wondered over anew till it filled the world in which there was room for nothing but the strangeness that they should have loved each other so long and not made it known that they should ever have uttered it and that being uttered it should be so much more and better than ever could have been dreamed the broken engagement was a fable of disaster that only made their present fortune more prosperous the city ceased about them and they walked on up the street the first man and first woman in the garden of the newmade earth as they were both very conscious people they recognized in themselves some sense of this and presently drolled it away in the opulence of a time when every moment brought some beautiful dream and the soul could be prodigal of its bliss  i think if i had the naming of the animals over again this morning i shouldnt call snakes snakes should you eve laughed basil in intricate acknowledgment of his happiness  o no adam wed look out all the most graceful euphemisms in the newspapers and we wouldnt hurt the feelings of a spider     ii midsummerdays dream  they had waited to see leonard in order that they might learn better how to find his house in the country and now when they came in upon him at nine oclock he welcomed them with all his friendly heart he rose from the pile of mornings letters to which he had but just sat down he placed them the easiest chairs he made a feint of its not being a busy hour with him and would have had them look upon his office which was still damp and odorous from the porters broom as a kind of downtown parlor but after they had briefly accounted to his amazement for their appearance then and there and isabel had boasted of the original fashion in which they had that morning seen new york they took pity on him and bade him adieu till evening  they crossed from broadway to the noisome street by the ferry and in a little while had taken their places in the train on the other side of the water  dont tell me basil said isabel that leonard travels fifty miles every day by rail going to and from his work  i must dearest if i would be truthful  then darling there are worse things in this world than living up at the south end arent there and in agreement upon boston as a place of the greatest natural advantages as well as all acquirable merits with after talk that need not be recorded they arrived in the best humor at the little country station near which the leonards dwelt  i must inevitably follow mrs isabel thither though i do it at the cost of the reader who suspects the excitements which a long description of the movement would delay the ladies were very old friends and they had not met since isabels return from europe and renewal of her engagement upon the news of this mrs leonard had swallowed with surprising ease all that she had said in blame of basils conduct during the rupture and exacted a promise from her friend that she should pay her the first visit after their marriage and now that they had come together their only talk was of husbands whom they viewed in every light to which husbands could be turned and still found an inexhaustible novelty in the theme mrs leonard beheld in her friends joy the sweet reflection of her own honeymoon and isabel was pleased to look upon the prosperous marriage of the former as the image of her future thus with immense profit and comfort they reassured one another by every question and answer and in their weak content lapsed far behind the representative women of our age when husbands are at best a necessary evil and the relation of wives to them is known to be one of pitiable subjection when these two pretty fogies put their heads of false hair together they were as silly and benighted as their greatgrandmothers could have been in the same circumstances and as i say shamefully encouraged each other in their absurdity the absurdity appeared too good and blessed to be true do you really suppose basil isabel would say to her oppressor after having given him some elegant extract from the last conversation upon husbands that we shall get on as smoothly as the leonards when we have been married ten years lucy says that things go more hitchily the first year than ever they do afterwards and that people love each other better and better just because theyve got used to it well our bliss does seem a little crude and garish compared with their happiness and yetshe put up both her palms against his and gave a vehement little pushthere is something agreeable about it even at this stage of the proceedings  isabel said her husband with severity this is bridal  no matter i only want to seem an old married woman to the general public but the application of it is that you must be careful not to contradict me or cross me in anything so that we can be like the leonards very much sooner than they became so the great object is not to have any hitchiness and you know you are provokingat times  they both educated themselves for continued and tranquil happiness by the example and precept of their friends and the time passed swiftly in the pleasant learning and in the novelty of the life led by the leonards this indeed merits a closer study than can be given here for it is the life led by vast numbers of prosperous new yorkers who love both the excitement of the city and the repose of the country and who aspire to unite the enjoyment of both in their daily existence the suburbs of the metropolis stretch landward fifty miles in every direction and everywhere are handsome villas like leonards inhabited by men like himself whom strict study of the timetable enables to spend all their working hours in the city and all their smoking and sleeping hours in the country  the home and the neighborhood of the leonards put on their best looks for our bridal pair and they were charmed they all enjoyed the visit said guests and hosts they were all sorry to have it come to an end yet they all resigned themselves to this conclusion practically it had no other result than to detain the travellers into the very heart of the hot weather in that weather it was easy to do anything that did not require an active effort and resignation was so natural with the mercury at ninety that i aan not sure but there was something sinful in it  they had given up their cherished purpose of going to albany by the day boat which was represented to them in every impossible phase it would be dreadfully crowded and whenever it stopped the heat would be insupportable besides it would bring them to albany at an hour when they must either spend the night there or push on to niagara by the night train you had better go by the evening boat it will be light almost till you reach west point and youll see all the best scenery then you can get a good nights rest and start fresh in the morning so they were counseled and they assented as they would have done if they had been advised you had better go by the morning boat its deliciously cool travelling you see the whole of the river you reach albany for supper and you push through to niagara that night and are done with it  they took leave of leonard at breakfast and of his wife at noon and fifteen minutes later they were rushing from the heat of the country into the heat of the city where some affairs and pleasures were to employ them till the evening boat should start  their spirits were low for the terrible spell of the great heat brooded upon them all abroad burned the fierce white light of the sun in which not only the earth seemed to parch and thirst but the very air withered and was faint and thin to the troubled respiration their train was full of people who had come long journeys from broiling cities of the west and who were dusty and ashen and reeking in the slumbers at which some of them still vainly caught on every one lay an awful languor here and there stirred a fan like the broken wing of a dying bird now and then a sweltering young mother shifted her hot baby from one arm to another after every station the desperate conductor swung through the long aisle and punched the ticket which each passenger seemed to yield him with a tacit malediction a suffering child hung about the empty tank which could only gasp out a cindery drop or two of icewater the wind buffeted faintly at the windows when the door was opened the clatter of the rails struck through and through the car like a demoniac yell  yet when they arrived at the station by the ferryside they seemed to have entered its stifling darkness from fresh and vigorous atmosphere so close and dead and mined with the carbonic breath of the locomotives was the air of the place the thin old wooden walls that shut out the glare of the sun transmitted an intensified warmth the roof seemed to hover lower and lower and in its coalsmoked raftery hollow to generate a heat deadlier than that poured upon it from the skies  in a convenient place in the station hung a thermometer before which every passenger on going aboard the ferryboat paused as at a shrine and mutely paid his devotions at the altar of this fetich our friends also paused and saw that the mercury was above ninety and exulting with the pride that savages take in the cruel might of their idols bowed their souls to the great god heat  on the boat they found a place where the breath of the sea struck cool across their faces and made them forget the thermometer for the brief time of the transit but presently they drew near that strange irregular row of wooden buildings and jutting piers which skirts the river on the new york aide and before the boats motion ceased the air grew thick and warm again and tainted with the foulness of the street on which the buildings front upon this the boats passengers issued passing up through a gangway on one side of which a throng of returnpassengers was pent by a gate of iron barn like a herd of wild animals they were streaming with perspiration and according to their different temperaments had faces of deep crimson or deadly pallor  now the question is my dear said basil when free of the press they lingered for a moment in the shade outside whether we had better walk up to broadway at an immediate sacrifice of fibre and get a stage there or take one of these cars here and be landed a little nearer with half the exertion by this route we shall have sights end smells which the other cant offer us but whichever we take we shall be sorry  then i say take this decided isabel i want to be sorry upon the easiest possible terms this weather  they hailed the first car that passed and got into it well for them both if she could have exercised this philosophy with regard to the whole days business or if she could have given up her plans for it with the same resignation she had practiced in regard to the day boat it seems to me a proof of the small advance our race has made in true wisdom that we find it so hard to give up doing anything we have meant to do it matters very little whether the affair is one of enjoyment or of business we feel the same bitter need of pursuing it to the end the mere fact of intention gives it a flavor of duty and dutiolatry as one may call the devotion has passed so deeply into our life that we have scarcely a sense any more of the sweetness of even a neglected pleasure we will not taste the fine guilty rapture of a deliberate dereliction the gentle sin of omission is all but blotted from the calendar of our crimes if i had been columbus i should have thought twice before setting sail when i was quite ready to do so and as for plymouth rock i should have sternly resisted the blandishments of those twin sirens starvation and cold who beckoned the puritans shoreward and as soon as ever i came in sight of their granite perch should have turned back to england but it is now too late to repair these errors and so on one of the hottest days of last year behold my obdurate bridal pair in a tenth or twentieth avenue horsecar setting forth upon the fulfillment of a series of intentions any of which had wiselier been left unaccomplished isabel had said they would call upon certain people in fiftieth street and then shop slowly down icecreaming and staging and variously cooling and calming by the way until they reached the ticketoffice on broadway whence they could indefinitely betake themselves to the steamboat an hour or two before her departure she felt that they had yielded sufficiently to circumstances and conditions already on this journey and she was resolved that the present halfday in new york should be the halfday of her original design  it was not the most advisable thing as i have allowed but it was inevitable and it afforded them a spectacle which is by no means wanting in sublimity and which is certainly uniquethe spectacle of that great city on a hot day defiant of the elements and prospering on with every form of labor and at a terrible cost of life the man carrying the hod to the top of the walls that rankly grow and grow as from his lifes blood will only lay down his load when he feels the mortal glare of the sun blaze in upon heart and brain the plethoric millionaire for whom he toils will plot and plan in his office till he swoons at the desk the trembling beast must stagger forward while the flamefaced tormentor on the box has strength to lash him on in all those vast palaces of commerce there are ceaseless sale and purchase packing and unpacking lifting up and laying down arriving and departing loads in thousands of shops is the unspared and unsparing weariness of selling in the street filled by the hurry and suffering of tens of thousands is the weariness of buying  their afternoons experience was something that basil and isabel could when it was past look upon only as a kind of vision magnificent at times and at other times full of indignity and pain they seemed to have dreamed of a long horsecar pilgrimage through that squalid street by the riverside where presently they came to a market opening upon the view hideous vistas of carnage and then into a wide avenue with processions of cars like their own coming and going up and down the centre of a foolish and useless breadth which made even the tall buildings rising gauntly up among the older houses of one or two stories on either hand look low and let in the sun to bake the dust that the hot breaths of wind caught up and gent swirling into the shabby shops here they dreamed of the eternal demolition and construction of the city and farther on of vacant lots full of granite boulders clambered over by goats in their dream they had fellowpassengers whose sufferings made them odious and whom they were glad to leave behind when they alighted from the car and running out of the blaze of the avenue quenched themselves in the shade of the crossstreet a little strip of shadow lay along the row of brownstone fronts but there were intervals where the vacant lots cast no shadow with great bestowal of thought they studied hopelessly how to avoid these spaces as if they had been difficult torrents or vast expanses of desert sand they crept slowly along till they came to such a place and dashed swiftly across it and then fainter than before moved on they seemed now and then to stand at doors and to be told that people were out and again that they were in and they had a sense of cool dark parlors and the airy rustling of lightmuslined ladies of chat and of fans and icewater and then they came forth again and evermore       the day increased from heat to heat  at last they were aware of an end of their visits and of a purpose to go down town again and of seeking the nearest car by endless blocks of brownstone fronts which with their eternal brownstone flights of steps and their handsome intolerable uniformity oppressed them like a procession of houses trying to pass a given point and never getting by upon these streets there was seldom a soul to be seen so that when their ringing at a door had evoked answer it had startled them with a vague sad surprise in the distance on either hand they could see cars and carts and wagons toiling up and down the avenues and on the next intersecting pavement sometimes a laborer with his jacket slung across his shoulder or a dog that had plainly made up his mind to go mad up to the time of their getting into one of those phantasmal cars for the return downtownwards they had kept up a show of talk in their wretched dream they had spoken of other hot days that they had known elsewhere and they had wondered that the tragical character of heat had been so little recognized they said that the daily new york murder might even at that moment be somewhere taking place and that no murder of the whole homicidal year could have such proper circumstance they morbidly wondered what that days murder would be and in what swarming tenementhouse or den of the assassin streets by the riversidesif indeed it did not befall in some such high closeshuttered handsome dwelling as those they passed in whose twilight it would be so easy to strike down the master and leave him undiscovered and unmourned by the family ignorantly absent at the mountains or the seaside they conjectured of the horror of midsummer battles and pictured the anguish of shipwrecked men upon a tropical coast and the grimy misery of stevedores unloading shiny cargoes of anthracite coal at city docks but now at last as they took seats opposite one another in the crowded car they seemed to have drifted infinite distances and long epochs asunder they looked hopelessly across the intervening gulf and mutely questioned when it was and from what far city they or some remote ancestors of theirs had set forth upon a wedding journey they bade each other a tacit farewell and with patient pathetic faces awaited the end of the world  when they alighted they took their way up through one of the streets of the great wholesale businesses to broadway on this street was a throng of trucks and wagons lading and unlading bales and boxes rose and sank by pulleys overhead the footway was a labyrinth of packages of every shape and size there was no flagging of the pitiless energy that moved all forward no sign of how heavy a weight lay on it save in the reeking faces of its helpless instruments but when the weddingjourneyers emerged upon broadway the other passages and incidents of their dream faded before the superior fantasticality of the spectacle it was four oclock the deadliest hour of the deadly summer day the spiritless air seemed to have a quality of blackness in it as if filled with the gloom of lowhovering wings one half the street lay in shadow and one half in sun but the sunshine itself was dim as if a heat greater than its own had smitten it with languor little gusts of sick warm wind blew across the great avenue at the corners of the intersecting streets in the upward distance at which the journeyers looked the loftier roofs and steeples lifted themselves dim out of the livid atmosphere and far up and down the length of the street swept a stream of tormented life all sorts of wheeled things thronged it conspicuous among which rolled and jarred the gaudily painted stages with quivering horses driven each by a man who sat in the shade of a branching white umbrella and suffered with a moody truculence of aspect and as if he harbored the bitterness of death in his heart for the crowding passengers within when one of them pulled the strap about his legs and summoned him to halt most of the footpassengers kept to the shady side and to the unaccustomed eyes of the strangers they were not less in number than at any other time though there were fewer women among them indomitably resolute of soul they held their course with the swift pace of custom and only here and there they showed the effect of the heat one man collarless with waistcoat unbuttoned and hat set far back from his forehead waved a fan before his deathwhite flabby face and set down one foot after the other with the heaviness of a somnambulist another as they passed him was saying huskily to the friend at his side i cant stand this much longer my hands tingle as if they had gone to sleep my heart but still the multitude hurried on passing repassing encountering evading vanishing into shopdoors and emerging from them dispersing down the side streets and swarming out of them it was a scene that possessed the beholder with singular fascination and in its effect of universal lunacy it might well have seemed the last phase of a world presently to be destroyed they who were in it but not of it as they fancied though there was no reason for thislooked on it amazed and at last their own errands being accomplished and themselves so far cured of the madness of purpose they cried with one voice that it was a hideous sight and strove to take refuge from it in the nearest place where the sodafountain sparkled  it was a vain desire at the front door of the apothecarys hung a thermometer and as they entered they heard the next comer cry out with a maniacal pride in the affliction laid upon mankind ninetyseven degrees behind them at the door there poured in a ceaseless stream of people each pausing at the shrine of heat before he tossed off the hissing draught that two pale closeclipped boys served them from either side of the fountain then in the order of their coming they issued through another door upon the side street each as he disappeared turning his face half round and casting a casual glance upon a little group near another counter the group was of a very patient halffrightened halfpuzzled looking gentleman who sat perfectly still on a stool and of a lady who stood beside him rubbing all over his head a handkerchief full of pounded ice and easing one hand with the other when the first became tired basil drank his soda and paused to look upon this group which he felt would commend itself to realistic sculpture as eminently characteristic of the local life and as the sunstroke would sell enormously in the hot season better take a little more of that the apothecary said looking up from his prescription and as the organized sympathy of the seemingly indifferent crowd smiling very kindly at his patient who thereupon tasted something in the glass he held do you still feel like fainting asked the humane authority slightly now and then answered the other but im hanging on hard to the bottom curve of that icicled s on your sodafountain and i feel that im all right as long as i can see that the people get rather hazy occasionally and have no features to speak of but i dont know that i look very impressive myself he added in the jesting mood which seems the natural condition of americans in the face of all embarrassments  o youll do the apothecary answered with a laugh but he said in answer to an anxious question from the lady he mustnt be moved for an hour yet and gayly pestled away at a prescription while she resumed her office of grinding the pounded ice round and round upon her husbands skull isabel offered her the commiseration of friendly words and of looks kinder yet and then seeing that they could do nothing she and basil fell into the endless procession and passed out of the side door what a shocking thing she whispered did you see how all the people looked one after another so indifferently at that couple and evidently forgot them the next instant it was dreadful i shouldnt like to have you sunstruck in new york  thats very considerate of you but place for place if any accident must happen to me among strangers i think i should prefer to have it in new york the biggest place is always the kindest as well as the cruelest place amongst the thousands of spectators the good samaritan as well as the levite would be sure to be as for a sunstroke it requires peculiar gifts but if you compel me to a choice in the matter then i say give me the busiest part of broadway for a sunstroke there is such experience of calamity there that you could hardly fall the first victim to any misfortune probably the gentleman at the apothecarys was merely exhausted by the heat and ran in there for revival the apothecary has a case of the kind on his hands every blazing afternoon and knows just what to do the crowd may be a little ennuye of sunstrokes and to that degree indifferent but they most likely know that they can only do harm by an expression of sympathy and so they delegate their pity as they have delegated their helpfulness to the proper authority and go about their business if a man was overcome in the middle of a village street the blundering country druggist wouldnt know what to do and the tenderhearted people would crowd about so that no breath of air could reach the victim  may be so dear said the wife pensively but if anything did happen to you in new york i should like to have the spectators look as if they saw a human being in trouble perhaps im a little exacting  i think you are nothing is so hard as to understand that there are human beings in this world besides ones self and ones set but let us be selfishly thankful that it isnt you and i there in the apothecarys shop as it might very well be and let us get to the boat as soon as we can and end this horrible midsummerdays dream we must have a carriage he added with tardy wisdom hailing an empty hack as we ought to have had all day though im not sorry now the worsts over to have seen the worst     iii the night boat  there is little proportion about either pain or pleasure a headache darkens the universe while it lasts a cup of tea really lightens the spirit bereft of all reasonable consolations therefore i do not think it trivial or untrue to say that there is for the moment nothing more satisfactory in life than to have bought your ticket on the night boat up the hudson and secured your stateroom key an hour or two before departure and some time even before the pressure at the clerks office has begun in the transaction with this castellated baron you have of course been treated with haughtiness but not with ferocity and your selfrespect swells with a sense of having escaped positive insult your key clicks cheerfully in your pocket against its guttapercha number and you walk up and down the gorgeously carpeted singlecolumned twostory cabin amid a multitude of plush sofas and chairs a glitter of glass and a tinkle of prismatic chandeliers overhead unawed even by the aristocratic gloom of the yellow waiters your own stateroom as you enter it from time to time is an evernew surprise of splendors a magnificent effect of amplitude of mahogany bedstead of lace curtains and of marble topped washstand in the mere wantonness of an unalloyed prosperity you say to the saffron nobleman nearest your door bring me a pitcher of icewater quick please and you do not find the halfhour that he is gone very long  if the ordinary wayfarer experiences so much pleasure from these things then imagine the infinite comfort of our weddingjourneyers transported from broadway on that pitiless afternoon to the shelter and the quiet of that absurdly palatial steamboat it was not yet crowded and by the riverside there was almost a freshness in the air they disposed of their troubling bags and packages they complimented the ridiculous princeliness of their stateroom and then they betook themselves to the sheltered space aft of the saloon where they sat down for the tranquiller observance of the wharf and whatever should come to be seen by them like all people who have just escaped with their lives from some menacing calamity they were very philosophical in spirit and having got aboard of their own motion and being neither of them apparently the worse for the ordeal they had passed through were of a light conversational temper  what an amusingly superb affair basil cried as they glanced through an open window down the long vista of the saloon good heavens isabel does it take all this to get us plain republicans to albany in comfort and safety or are we really a nation of princes in disguise well i shall never be satisfied with less hereafter he added i am spoilt for ordinary paint and upholstery from this hour i am a ruinous spendthrift and a humble threestory swellfront up at the south end is no longer the place for me dearest       let us swear an oath and keep it with an equal mind  never to leave this aladdinspalacelike steamboat but spend our lives in perpetual trips up and down the hudson  to which not very costly banter isabel responded in kind and rapidly sketched the life they could lead aboard since they could not help it they mocked the public provision which leaving no interval between disgraceful squalor and ludicrous splendor accommodates our democratic menage to the taste of the richest and most extravagant plebeian amongst us he unhappily minds danger and oppression as little as he minds money so long as he has a spectacle and a sensation and it is this ruthless imbecile who will have lace curtains to the steamboat berth into which he gets with his pantaloons on and out of which he may be blown by an exploding boiler at any moment it is he who will have for supper that overgrown and shapeless dinner in the lower saloon and will not let any one else buy tea or toast for a less sum than he pays for his surfeit it is he who perpetuates the insolence of the clerk and the reluctance of the waiters it is he in fact who now comes out of the saloon with his womenkind and takes chairs under the awning where basil and isabel sit personally he is not so bad he is goodlooking like all of us he is better dressed than most of us he behaves himself quietly if not easily and no lord so loathes a scene next year he is going to europe where he will not show to so much advantage as here but for the present it would be hard to say in what way he is vulgar and perhaps vulgarity is not so common a thing after all  it was something besides the river that made the air so much more sufferable than it had been over the city since our friends had come aboard the boat a black cloud had gathered and now hung low upon it while the wind from the face of the water took the dust in the neighboring streets and frolicked it about the housetops and in the faces of the arriving passengers who as the moment of departure drew near appeared in constantly increasing numbers and in greater variety with not only the trepidation of going upon them but also with the electrical excitement people feel before a tempest  the breast of the black cloud was now zigzagged from moment to moment by lightning and claps of deafening thunder broke from it at last the long endurance of the day was spent and out of its convulsion burst floods of rain again and again sweeping the promenadedeck where the people sat and driving them disconsolate into the saloon the air was darkened as by night and with many regrets for the vanishing prospect mingled with a sense of relief from the heat our friends felt the boat tremble away from her moorings and set forth upon her trip  ah if we had only taken the day boat moaned isabel now we shall see nothing of the river landscape and we shall never be able to put ourselves down when we long for europe by declaring that the scenery of the hudson is much finer than that of the rhine  yet they resolved this indomitably goodnatured couple that they would be just even to the elements which had by no means been generous to them and they owned that if so noble a storm had celebrated their departure upon some storied river from some more romantic port than new york they would have thought it an admirable thing even whilst they contented themselves the storm passed and left a veiled and humid sky overhead that gave a charming softness to the scene on which their eyes fell when they came out of the saloon again and took their places with a largely increased companionship on the deck  they had already reached that part of the river where the uplands begin and their course was between stately walls of rocky steepness or wooded slopes or grassy hollows the scene forever losing and taking grand and lovely shape wreaths of mist hung about the tops of the loftier headlands and long shadows draped their sides as the night grew lights twinkled from a lonely house here and there in the valleys a swarm of lamps showed a town where it lay upon the lap or at the foot of the hills behind them stretched the great gray river haunted with many sails now a group of canalboats grappled together and having an air of coziness in their adventure upon this strange current out of their own sluggish waters drifted out of sight and now a smaller and slower steamer making a laborious show of keeping up was passed and reluctantly fell behind along the waters edge rattled and hooted the frequent trains they could not tell at any time what part of the river they were on and they could not if they would have made its beauty a matter of conscientious observation but all the more therefore they deeply enjoyed it without reference to time or place they felt some natural pain when they thought that they might unwittingly pass the scenes that irving has made part of the common dreamland and they would fair have seen the lighted windows of the house out of which a cheerful ray has penetrated to so many hearts but being sure of nothing as they were they had the comfort of finding the tappan zee in every expanse of the river and of discovering sunnyside on every pleasant slope by virtue of this helplessness the hudson without ceasing to be the hudson became from moment to moment all fair and stately streams upon which they had voyaged or read of voyaging from the nile to the mississippi there is no other travel like river travel it is the perfection of movement and one might well desire never to arrive at ones destination the abundance of room the free pure air the constant delight of the eyes in the changing landscape the soft tremor of the boat so steady upon her keel the variety of the little world on boardall form a charm which no good heart in a sound body can resist so whilst the twilight held well content in contiguous chairs they purred in flattery of their kindly fate imagining different pleasures certainly but none greater and tasting to its subtlest flavor the happiness conscious of itself  their own satisfaction indeed was so interesting to them in this objective light that they had little desire to turn from its contemplation to the people around them and when at last they did so it was still with lingering glances of selfrecognition and enjoyment they divined rightly that one of the main conditions of their present felicity was the fact that they had seen so much of time and of the world that they had no longer any desire to take beholding eyes or to make any sort of impressive figure and they understood that their prosperous love accounted as much as years and travel for this result if they had had a loftier opinion of themselves their indifference to others might have made them offensive but with their modest estimate of their own value in the world they could have all the comfort of selfsufficiency without its vulgarity  o yes said basil in answer to some apostrophe to their bliss from isabel its the greatest imaginable satisfaction to have lived past certain things i always knew that i was not a very handsome or otherwise captivating person but i can remember yearsnow blessedly remotewhen i never could see a young girl without hoping she would mistake me for something of that sort i couldnt help desiring that some fascination of mine which had escaped my own analysis would have an effect upon her i dare say all young men are so i used to live for the possible interest i might inspire in your sex isabel they controlled my movements my attitudes they forbade me repose and yet i believe i was no ass but a tolerably sensible fellow blessed be marriage i am free at last all the loveliness that exists outside of you dearestand it s mighty littleis mere pageant to me and i thank heaven that i can meet the most stylish girl now upon the broad level of our common humanity besides it seems to me that our experience of life has quieted us in many other ways what a luxury it is to sit here and reflect that we do not want any of these people to suppose us rich or distinguished or beautiful or well dressed and do not care to show off in any sort of way before them  this content was heightened no doubt by a just sense of their contrast to the group of people nearest therea young man of the second or third qualityand two young girls the eldest of these was carrying on a vivacious flirtation with the young man who was apparently an acquaintance of brief standing the other was scarcely more than a child and sat somewhat abashed at the sparkle of the colloquy they were conjecturally sisters going home from some visit and not skilled in the world but of a certain repute in their country neighborhood for beauty and wit the young man presently gave himself out as one who in pursuit of trade for the drygoods house he represented had travelled many thousands of miles in all parts of the country the encounter was visibly that kind of adventure which both would treasure up for future celebration to their different friends and it had a brilliancy and interest which they could not even now consent to keep to themselves they talked to each other and at all the company within hearing and exchanged curt speeches which had for them all the sensation of repartee  young man they say that beauty unadorned is adorned the most  young woman bridling and twitching her head from side to side in the high excitement of the dialogue flattery is out of place  young man well never mind if you dont believe me you ask your mother when you get home  titter from the younger sister  young woman scornfully umph my mother has no control over me  young man nobody else has either i should gay admiringly  young woman yes youve told the truth for once for a wonder im able to take care of myselfperfectly almost hoarse with a sense of sarcastic performance  young man whole team and big dog under the wagon as they say out west  young woman better a big dog than a puppy any day  giggles and horror from the younger sister sensation in the young man and so much rapture in the young woman that she drops the key of her stateroom from her hand they both stoop and a jocose scuffle for it ensues after which the talk takes an autobiographical turn on the part of the young man and drops into an unintelligible murmur ah poor real life which i love can i make others share the delight i find in thy foolish and insipid face  not far from this group sat two hebrews one young and the other old talking of some business out of which the latter had retired the younger had been asked his opinion upon some point and he was expanding with a flattered consciousness of the elders perception of his importance and toadying to him with the pleasure which all young men feel in winning the favor of seniors in their vocation well as i was asayn isaac dont seem to haf no natcheral pent for the glothing business man gomes in and wands a goathe seemed to be speaking of a garment and not a domestic animalisaacll zell him the goat he wands him to puy and hell make him believe it a the goat he was a lookin for well now thats well enough as far as it goes but you know and i know mr rosenthal that that s no way to do business

when he dont wand no goat at all youve asked me what i thought and ive dold you isaacll never zugzeed in the redail glothingbusiness in the world  well sighed the elder who filled his armchair quite full and quivered with a comfortable jellylike tremor in it at every pulsation of the engine i was afraid of something of the kind as you say benjamin he dont seem to have no pent for it and yet i proughd him up to the business i drained him to it myself  besides these talkers there were scattered singly or grouped about in twos and threes and fours the various people one encounters on a hudson river boat who are on the whole different from the passengers on other rivers though they all have features in common there was that man of the sudden gains who has already been typified and there was also the smoother rich man of inherited wealth from whom you can somehow know the former so readily they were each attended by their several retinues of womankind the daughters all much alike but the mothers somewhat different they were going to saratoga where perhaps the exigencies of fashion would bring them acquainted and where the blue blood of a quarter of a century would be kind to the yesterdays fluid of warmer hue there was something pleasanter in the face of the hereditary aristocrat but not so strong nor altogether so admirable particularly if you reflected that he really represented nothing in the world no great culture no political influence no civic aspiration not even a pecuniary force nothing but a social set an alien clublife a tradition of dining we live in a true fairy land after all where the hoarded treasure turns to a heap of dry leaves the almighty dollar defeats itself and finally buys nothing that a man cares to have the very highest pleasure that such an americans money can purchase is exile and to this rich man doubtless europe is a twicetold tale let us clap our empty pockets dearest reader and be glad  we can be as glad apparently and with the same reason as the poorly dressed young man standing near beside the guard whose face basil and isabel chose to fancy that of a poet and concerning whom they romanced that he was going home wherever his home was with the manuscript of a rejected book in his pocket they imagined him no great things of a poet to be sure but his pensive face claimed delicate feeling for him and a graceful sombre fancy and they conjectured unconsciously caught flavors of tennyson and browning in his verse with a moderner tint from morris for was it not a story out of mythology with gods and heroes of the nineteenth century that he was now carrying back from new york with him basil sketched from the colors of his own longaccepted disappointments a moving little picture of this poor imagined poets adventures with what kindness and unkindness he had been put to shame by publishers and how descending from his high hopes of a book he had tried to sell to the magazines some of the shorter pieces out of the and other poems which were to have filled up the volume hes going back rather stunned and bewildered but its something to have tasted the city and its bitter may turn to sweet on his palate at last till he finds himself longing for the tumult that he abhors now poor fellow one compassionate cutthroat of a publisher even asked him to lunch being struck as we are with something fine in his face i hope hes got somebody who believes in him at home otherwise hed be more comfortable for the present if he went over the railing there  so the play of which they were both actors and spectators went on about them like all passages of life it seemed now a grotesque mystery with a bluntly enforced moral now a farce of the broadest now a latent tragedy folded in the disguises of comedy all the elements indeed of either were at work there and this was but one brief scene of the immense complex drama which was to proceed so variously in such different times and places and to have its denouement only in eternity the contrasts were sharp each group had its travesty in some other the talk of one seemed the rude burlesque the bitter satire of the next but of all these parodies none was so terribly effective as the two women who sat in the midst of the company yet were somehow distinct from the rest one wore the deepest black of widowhood the other was dressed in bridal white and they were both alike awful in their mockery of guiltless sorrow and guiltless joy they were not old but the soul of youth was dead in their pretty lamentable faces and ruin ancient as sin looked from their eyes their talk and laughter seemed the echo of an innumerable multitude of the lost haunting the world in every land and time each solitary forever yet all bound together in the unity of an imperishable slavery and shame  what a stale effect what hackneyed characters let us be glad the night drops her curtain upon the cheap spectacle and shuts these with the other actors from our view  within the cabin through which basil and isabel now slowly moved there were numbers of people lounging about on the sofas in various attitudes of talk or vacancy and at the tables there were others reading lothair a new book in the remote epoch of which i write and a very fashionable book indeed there was in the air that odor of paint and carpet which prevails on steamboats the glass drops of the chandeliers ticked softly against each other as the vessel shook with her respiration like a comfortable sleeper and imparted a delicious feeling of coziness and security to our travellers  a few hours later they struggled awake at the sharp sound of the pilots bell signaling the engineer to slow the boat there was a moment of perfect silence then all the drops of the chandeliers in the saloon clashed musically together then fell another silence and at last came wild cries for help strongly qualified with blasphemies and curses send out a boat there was a woman aboard that steamboat lower your boats run a craft right down with your big boat send out a boat and pick up the crew the cries rose and sank and finally ceased through the lattice of the stateroom window some lights shone faintly on the water at a distance  wait here isabel said her husband weve run down a boat we dont seem hurt but ill go see ill be back in a minute  isabel had emerged into a world of dishabille a world wildly unbuttoned and unlaced where it was the fashion for ladies to wear their hair down their backs and to walk about in their stockings and to speak to each other without introduction the place with which she had felt so familiar a little while before was now utterly estranged there was no motion of the boat and in the momentary suspense a quiet prevailed in which those grotesque shapes of disarray crept noiselessly round whispering panicstricken conjectures there was no rushing to and fro nor tumult of any kind and there was not a man to be seen for apparently they had all gone like basil to learn the extent of the calamity a mist of sleep involved the whole and it was such a topsyturvy world that it would have seemed only another dreamland but that it was marked for reality by one signal fact with the rest appeared the woman in bridal white and the woman in widows black and there amidst the fright that made all others friends and for aught that most knew in the presence of death itself these two moved together shunned and friendless  somehow even before basil returned it had become known to isabel and the rest that their own steamer had suffered no harm but that she had struck and sunk another convoying a flotilla of canal boats from which those alarming cries and curses had come the steamer was now lying by for the small boats she had sent out to pick up the crew of the sunken vessel  why i only heard a little tinkling of the chandeliers said one of the ladies is it such a very alight matter to run down another boat and sink it  she appealed indirectly to basil who answered lightly i dont think you ladies ought to have been disturbed at all in running over a common towboat on a perfectly clear night like this there should have been no noise and no perceptible jar they manage better on the mississippi and both boats often go down without waking the lightest sleeper on board  the ladies perhaps from a deficient sense of humor listened with undisguised displeasure to this speech it dispersed them in fact some turned away to bivouac for the rest of the night upon the armchairs and sofas while others returned to their rooms with the latter went isabel lock me in basil she said with a bold meekness and if anything more happens dont wake me till the last moment it was hard to part from him but she felt that his vigil would somehow be useful to the boat and she confidingly fell into a sleep that lasted till daylight  meantime her husband on whom she had tacitly devolved so great a responsibility went forward to the promenade in front of the saloon in hopes of learning something more of the catastrophe from the people whom he had already found gathered there  a large part of the passengers were still there seated or standing about in earnest colloquy they were in that mood which follows great excitement and in which the feeblestminded are sure to lead the talk at such times one feels that a sensible frame of mind is unsympathetic and if expressed unpopular or perhaps not quite safe and basil warned by his fate with the ladies listened gravely to the voice of the common imbecility and incoherence  the principal speaker was a tall person wearing a silk travellingcap he had a face of stupid benignity and a selfsatisfied smirk and he was formally trying to put at his ease and hopelessly confusing the loutish youth before him you say you saw the whole accident and youre probably the only passenger that did see it youll be the most important witness at the trial he added as if there would ever be any trial about it now how did the towboat hit us  well she came bows on  ah bows on repeated the other with great satisfaction and a little murmur of bows on ran round the listening circle  that is added the witness it seemed as if we struck her amidships and cut her in two and sunk her  just so continued the examiner accepting the explanation bows on now i want to ask if you saw our captain or any of the crew about  not a soul said the witness with the solemnity of a man already on oath  thatll do exclaimed the other this gentlemans experience coincides exactly with my own i didnt see the collision but i did see the cloud of steam from the sinking boat and i saw her go down there wasnt an officer to be found anywhere on board our boat i looked about for the captain and the mate myself and couldnt find either of them high or low  the officers ought all to have been sitting here on the promenade deck suggested one ironical spirit in the crowd but no one noticed him  the gentleman in the silk travellingcap now took a chair and a number of sympathetic listeners drew their chairs about him and then began an interchange of experience in which each related to the last particular all that he felt thought and said and if married what his wife felt thought and said at the moment of the calamity they turned the disaster over and over in their talk and rolled it under their tongues then they reverted to former accidents in which they had been concerned and the silkcapped gentleman told to the common admiration of a fearful escape of his on the erie road from being thrown down a steep embankment fifty feet high by a piece of rock that had fallen on the track now just see gentlemen what a little thing humanly speaking life depends upon if that old woman had been able to sleep and hadnt sent that boy down to warn the train we should have run into the rock and been dashed to pieces the passengers made up a purse for the boy and i wrote a full account of it to the papers  well said one of the group a man in a hard hat i never lie down on a steamboat or a railroad train i want to be ready for whatever happens  the others looked at this speaker with interest as one who had invented a safe method of travel  i happened to be up tonight but i almost always undress and go to bed just as if i were in my own house said the gentleman of the silk cap  i dont say your way isnt the best but thats my way  the champions of the rival systems debated their merits with suavity and mutual respect but they met with scornful silence a compromising spirit who held that it was better to throw off your coat and boots but keep your pantaloons on meanwhile the steamer was hanging idle upon the current against which it now and then stirred a careless wheel still waiting for the return of the small boats thin gray clouds through rifts of which a star sparkled keenly here and there veiled the heavens shadowy bluffs loomed up on either hand in a hollow on the left twinkled a drowsy little town a beautiful stillness lay on all  after an hours interval a shout was heard from far down the river then later the plash of oars then a cry hailing the approaching boats and the answer all safe presently the boats had come alongside and the passengers crowded down to the guard to learn the details of the search basil heard a hollow moaning gurgling sound regular as that of the machinery for some note of which he mistook it clear the gangway there shouted a gruff voice man scalded here and a burden was carried by from which fluttered with its terrible regularity that utterance of mortal anguish  basil went again to the forward promenade and sat down to see the morning come  the boat swiftly ascended the current and presently the steeper shores were left behind and the banks fell away in long upward sloping fields with farmhouses and with stacks of harvest dimly visible in the generous expanses by and by they passed a fisherman drawing his nets and bending from his boat there near albany n y in the picturesque immortal attitudes of raphaels galilean fisherman and now a flush mounted the pale face of the east and through the dewy coolness of the dawn there came more to the sight than any other sense a vague menace of heat but as yet the air was deliciously fresh and sweet and basil bathed his weariness in it thinking with a certain luxurious compassion of the scalded man and how he was to fare that day this poor wretch seemed of another order of beings as the calamitous always seem to the happy and basils pity was quite an abstraction which again amused and shocked him and he asked his heart of bliss to consider of sorrow a little more earnestly as the lot of all men and not merely of an alien creature here and there he dutifully tried to imagine another issue to the disaster of the night and to realize himself suddenly bereft of her who so filled his life he bade his soul remember that in the security of sleep death had passed them both so close that his presence might well have chilled their dreams as the iceberg that grazes the ship in the night freezes all the air about it but it was quite idle where love was life only was and sense and spirit alike put aside the burden that he would have laid upon them his revery reflected with delicious caprice the looks the tones the movements that he loved and bore him far away from the sad images that he had invited to mirror themselves in it     iv a days railroading  happiness has commonly a good appetite and the thought of the fortunately ended adventures of the night the fresh morning air and the content of their own hearts gifted our friends by the time the boat reached albany with a wholesome hunger so that they debated with spirit the question of breakfast and the best place of breakfasting in a city which neither of them knew save in the most fugitive and sketchy way  they decided at last in view of the early departure of the train and the probability that they would be more hurried at a hotel to breakfast at the station and thither they went and took places at one of the many tables within where they seemed to have been expected only by the flies the waitress plainly had not looked for them and for a time found their presence so incredible that she would not acknowledge the rattling that basil was obliged to make on his glass then it appeared that the cook would not believe in them and he did not send them till they were quite faint the peppery and muddy draught which impudently affected to be coffee the oily slices of fugacious potatoes slipping about in their shallow dish and skillfully evading pursuit the pieces of beef that simulated steak the hot greasy biscuit steaming evilly up into the face when opened and then soddening into masses of condensed dyspepsia  the weddingjourneyers looked at each other with eyes of sad amaze they bowed themselves for a moment to the viands and then by an equal impulse refrained they were sufficiently young they were happy they were hungry nature is great and strong but art is greater and before these triumphs of the cook at the albany depot appetite succumbed by a terrible tour de force they swallowed the fierce and turbid liquor in their cups and then speculated fantastically upon the character and history of the materials of that breakfast  presently isabel paused played a little with her knife and after a moment looked up at her husband with an arch regard and said i was just thinking of a small station somewhere in the south of france where our train once stopped for breakfast i remember the freshness and brightness of everything on the little tablesthe plates the napkins the gleaming halfbottles of wine they seemed to have been preparing that breakfast for us from the beginning of time and we were hardly seated before they served us with great cups of cafeaulait and the sweetest rolls and butter then a delicate cutlet with an unspeakable gravy and potatoessuch potatoes dear me how little i ate of it i wish for once id had your appetite basil i do indeed  she ended with a heartless laugh in which despite the tragical contrast her words had suggested basil finally joined so much amazement had probably never been got before out of the misery inflicted in that place but their lightness did not at all commend them the waitress had not liked it from the first and had served them with reluctance and the proprietor did not like it and kept his eye upon them as if he believed them about to escape without payment here then they had enforced a great fact of travellingthat people who serve the public are kindly and pleasant in proportion as they serve it well the unjust and the inefficient have always that consciousness of evil which will not let a man forgive his victim or like him to be cheerful  our friends however did not heat themselves over the fact there was already such heat from without even at eight oclock in the morning that they chose to be as cool as possible in mind and they placidly took their places in the train which had been made up for departure they had deliberately rejected the notion of a drawingroom car as affording a less varied prospect of humanity and as being less in the spirit of ordinary american travel now in reward they found themselves quite comfortable in the common passengercar and disposed to view the scenery into which they struck an hour after leaving the city with much complacency there was sufficient draught through the open window to make the heat tolerable and the great brooding warmth gave to the landscape the charm which it alone can impart it is a landscape that i greatly love for its mild beauty and tranquil picturesqueness and it is in honor of our friends that i say they enjoyed it there are nowhere any considerable hills but everywhere generous slopes and pleasant hollows and the wide meadows of a grazing country with the pretty brown mohawk river rippling down through all and at frequent intervals the life of the canal now near now far away with the lazy boats that seem not to stir and the horses that the train passes with a whirl and leaves slowly stepping forward and swiftly slipping backward there are farms that had once or still have the romance to them of being dutch farmsif there is any romance in thatand one conjectures a dutch thrift in their waving grass and grain spaces of woodland here and there dapple the slopes and the cozy red farmhouses repose by the side of their capacious red barns truly there is no ground on which to defend the idleness and yet as the train strives furiously onward amid these scenes of fertility and abundance i like in fancy to loiter behind it and to saunter at will up and down the landscape i stop at the farmyard gates and sit upon the porches or thresholds and am served with cups of buttermilk by old dutch ladies who have done their mornings work and have leisure to be knitting or sewing or if there are no old ladies with decent caps upon their gray hair then i do not complain if the drink is brought me by some redcheeked comely young girl out of washington irvings pages with no cap on her golden braids who mirrors my diffidence and takes an attitude of pretty awkwardness while she waits till i have done drinking in the same easily contented spirit as i lounge through the barnyard if i find the old hens gone about their family affairs i do not mind a meadowlarks singing in the top of the elmtree beside the pump in these excursions the watchdogs know me for a harmless person and will not open their eyes as they lie coiled up in the sun before the gate at all the places i have the people keep bees and in the garden full of worthy potherbs such idlers in the vegetable world as hollyhocks and larkspurs and fouroclocks near a great bed in which the asparagus has gone to sleep for the season with a dream of delicate spray hanging over it i walk unmolested through the farmers tall grass and ride with him upon the perilous seat of his voluble mowingmachine and learn to my hearts content that his name begins with van and that his family has owned that farm ever since the days of the patroon which i dare say is not true then i fall asleep in a corner of the hayfield and wake up on the towpath of the canal beside that wonderfully lean horse whose bones you cannot count only because they are so many he never wakes up but with a faltering underlip and halfshut eyes hobbles stiffly on unconscious of his anatomical interest the captain hospitably asks me on board with a twist of the rudder swinging the stern of the boat up to the path so that i can step on she is laden with flour from the valley of the genesee and may have started on her voyage shortly after the canal was made she is succinctly manned by the captain the driver and the cook a fieryhaired lady of imperfect temper and the cabin which i explore is plainly furnished with a cookstove and a flask of whiskey nothing but profane language is allowed on board and so in a life of wicked jollity and ease we glide imperceptibly down the canal unvexed by the faroff future of arrival  such i say are my own unambitious mental pastimes but i am aware that less superficial spirits could not be satisfied with them and i can not pretend that my weddingjourneyers were so  they cast an absurd poetry over the landscape they invited themselves to be reminded of passages of european travel by it and they placed villas and castles and palaces upon all the eligible buildingsites ashamed of these devices presently basil patriotically tried to reconstruct the dutch and indian past of the mohawk valley but here he was foiled by the immense ignorance of his wife who as a true american woman knew nothing of the history of her own country and less than nothing of the barbarous regions beyond the borders of her native province she proved a bewildering labyrinth of error concerning the events which basil mentioned and she had never even heard of the massacres by the french and indians at schenectady which he in his boyhood had known so vividly that he was scalped every night in his dreams and woke up in the morning expecting to see marks of the tomahawk on the headboard so failing at last to extract any sentiment from the scenes without they turned their faces from the window and looked about them for amusement within the car  it was in all respects an ordinary carful of human beings and it was perhaps the more worthy to be studied on that account as in literature the true artist will shun the use even of real events if they are of an improbable character so the sincere observer of man will not desire to look upon the heroic or occasional phases but will seek him in his habitual moods of vacancy and tiresomeness to me at any rate he is at such times very precious and i never perceive him to be so much a man and a brother as when i feel the pressure of his vast natural unaffected dullness then i am able to enter confidently into his life and inhabit there to think his shallow and feeble thoughts to be moved by his dumb stupid desires to be dimly illumined by his stinted inspirations to share his foolish prejudices to practice his obtuse selfishness yes it is a very amusing world if you do not refuse to be amused and our friends were very willing to be entertained they delighted in the precise thickfingered old ladies who bought sweet apples of the boys come aboard with baskets and who were so long in finding the right change that our travellers leaping in thought with the boys from the moving train felt that they did so at the peril of their lives then they were interested in people who went out and found their friends waiting for them or else did not find them and wandered disconsolately up and down before the country stations carpetbag in hand in women who came aboard and were awkwardly shaken hands with or sheepishly kissed by those who hastily got seats for them and placed their bags or their babies in their laps and turned for a nod at the door in young ladies who were seen to places by young men the latter seemed not to care if the train did go off with them and then threw up their windows and talked with girlfriends on the platform without till the train began to move and at last turned with gleaming eyes and moist red lips and panted hard in the excitement of thinking about it and could not calm themselves to the dull level of the travel around them in the conductor coldly and inaccessibly vigilant as he went his rounds reaching blindly for the tickets with one hand while he bent his head from time to time and listened with a faint sarcastic smile to the questions of passengers who supposed they were going to get some information out of him in the trainboy who passed through on his many errands with prize candies gumdrops popcorn papers and magazines and distributed books and the police journals with a blind impartiality or a prodigious ignorance or a supernatural perception of character in those who received them  a through train from east to west presents some peculiar features as well as the traits common to all railway travel and our friends decided that this was not a very welldressed company and would contrast with the people on an expresstrain between boston and new york to no better advantage than these would show beside the average passengers between london and paris and it seems true that on a westering line the blacking fades gradually from the boots the hat softens and sinks the coat loses its rigor of cut and the whole person lounges into increasing informality of costume i speak of the undressful sex alone woman wherever she is appears in the last attainable effects of fashion which are now all but telegraphic and universal but most of the passengers here were men and they mere plainly of the freeand easy west rather than the dapper east they wore faces thoughtful with the problem of buying cheap and selling dear and they could be known by their silence from the loquacious acquaintancemaking waytravellers in these the mere coming aboard seemed to beget an aggressively confidential mood perhaps they clutched recklessly at any means of relieving their ennui or they felt that they might here indulge safely in the pleasures of autobiography so dear to all of us or else in view of the many possible catastrophes they desired to leave some little memory of themselves behind at any rate whenever the train stopped the weddingjourneyers caught fragments of the personal histories of their fellowpassengers which had been rehearsing to those that sat next the narrators it was no more than fair that these should somewhat magnify themselves and put the best complexion on their actions and the worst upon their sufferings that they should all appear the luckiest or the unluckiest the healthiest or the sickest people that ever were and should all have made or lost the most money there was a prevailing desire among them to make out that they came from or were going to same very large place and our friends fancied an actual mortification in the face of a modest gentleman who got out at penelope or some other insignificant classical station in the ancient greek and roman part of new york state after having listened to the life of a somewhat rusticlooking person who had described himself as belonging near new york city  basil also found diversion in the tender couples who publicly comported themselves as if in a sylvan solitude and as it had been on the bank of some umbrageous stream far from the ken of envious or unsympathetic eyes reclined upon each others shoulders and slept but isabel declared that this behavior was perfectly indecent she granted of course that they were foolish innocent people who meant no offense and did not feel guilty of an impropriety but she said that this sort of thing was a national reproach if it were merely rustic lovers she should not care so much but you saw people who ought to know better welldressed stylish people flaunting their devotion in the face of the world and going to sleep on each others shoulders on every railroad train it was outrageous it was scandalous it was really infamous before she would allow herself to do such a thing she wouldwell she hardly knew what she would not do she would have a divorce at any rate she wondered that basil could laugh at it and he would make her hate him if he kept on  from the seat behind their own they were now made listeners to the history of a ten weeks typhoid fever from the moment when the narrator noticed that he had not felt very well for a day or two back and all at once a kind of shiver took him till he lay fourteen days perfectly insensible and could eat nothing but a little pounded iceand his wifea small woman tooused to lift him back and forth between the bed and sofa like a feather and the neighbors did not know half the time whether he was dead or alive this history from which not the smallest particular or the least significant symptom of the case was omitted occupied an hour in recital and was told as it seemed for the entertainment of one who had been five minutes before it began a stranger to the historian  at last the train came to a stand and isabel wailed forth in accents of desperation the words o disgusting the monotony of the narrative in the seat behind fatally combining with the heat of the day had lulled her into slumbers from which she awoke at the stopping of the train to find her head resting tenderly upon her husbands shoulder  she confronted his merriment with eyes of mournful rebuke but as she could not find him or the harshest construction in the least to blame she was silent  never mind dear never mind he coaxed you were really not responsible it was fatigue destiny the spite of fortunewhatever you like in the case of the others whom you despise so justly i dare say it is sheer disgraceful affection but see that ravishing placard swinging from the roof this train stops twenty minutes for dinner at utica in a few minutes more we shall be at utica if they have anything edible there it shall never contract my powers i could dine at the albany station even  in a little while they found themselves in an airy comfortable diningroom eating a dinner which it seemed to them france in the flush of her prosperity need not have blushed to serve for if it wanted a little in the last graces of art it redeemed itself in abundance variety and wholesomeness at the elbow of every famishing passenger stood a beneficent coalblack glossy fairy in a white linen apron and jacket serving him with that alacrity and kindliness and grace which make the negro waiter the master not the slave of his calling which disenthrall it of servility and constitute him your eager host not your menial for the moment from table to table passed a calming influence in the person of the proprietor who as he took his richly earned money checked the rising fears of the guests by repeated proclamations that there was plenty of time and that he would give them due warning before the train started those who had flocked out of the cars to prey with beak and claw as the vulturelike fashion is upon everything in reach remained to eat like christians and even a poor scantilyenglished frenchman who wasted half his time in trying to ask how long the cars stopped and in looking at his watch made a good dinner in spite of himself  o basil basil cried isabel when the train was again in motion have we really dined once more it seems too good to be true cleanliness plenty wholesomeness civility yes as you say they cannot be civil where they are not just honesty and courtesy go together and wherever they give you outrageous things to eat they add indigestible insults basil dear dont be jealous i shall never meet him again but im in love with that black waiter at our table i never saw such perfect manners such a winning and affectionate politeness he made me feel that every mouthful i ate was a personal favor to him what a complete gentleman there ought never to be a white waiter none but negroes are able to render their service a pleasure and distinction to you  so they prattled on doing in their eagerness to be satisfied a homage perhaps beyond its desert to the good dinner and the decent service of it but here they erred in the right direction and i find nothing more admirable in their behavior throughout a wedding journey which certainly had its trials than their willingness to make the very heat of whatever would suffer itself to be made anything at all of they celebrated its pleasures with magnanimous excess they passed over its griefs with a wise forbearance that which they found the most difficult of management was the want of incident for the most part of the time and i who write their history might also sink under it but that i am supported by the fact that it is so typical in this respect i even imagine that ideal reader for whom one writes as yawning over these barren details with the lifelike weariness of an actual travelling companion of theirs their own silence often sufficed my wedded lovers or then when there was absolutely nothing to engage them they fell back upon the story of their love which they were never tired of hearing as they severally knew it let it not be a reproach to human nature or to me if i say that there was something in the comfort of having well dined which now touched the springs of sentiment with magical effect and that they had never so rejoiced in these tender reminiscences  they had planned to stop over at rochester till the morrow that they might arrive at niagara by daylight and at utica they had suddenly resolved to make the rest of the days journey in a drawingroom car the change gave them an added reason for content and they realized how much they had previously sacrificed to the idea of travelling in the most american manner without achieving it after all for this seemed a touch of americanism beyond the oldfashioned car they reclined in luxury upon the easycushioned revolving chairs they surveyed with infinite satisfaction the elegance of the flyingparlor in which they sat or turned their contented regard through the broad plateglass windows upon the landscape without they said that none but americans or enchanted princes in the arabian nights ever travelled in such state and when the stewards of the car came round successively with tropical fruits icecreams and claretpunches they felt a heightened assurance that they were either enchanted princesor americans there were more ladies and more fashion than in the other cars and prettily dressed children played about on the carpet but the general appearance of the passengers hardly suggested greater wealth than elsewhere and they were plainly in that car because they were of the american race which finds nothing too good for it that its money can buy     v the enchanted city and beyond  they knew none of the hotels in rochester and they had chosen a certain one in reliance upon their handbook when they named it there stepped forth a porter of an incredibly cordial and pleasant countenance who took their travellingbags and led them to the omnibus as they were his only passengers the porter got inside with them and seeing their interest in the streets through which they rode he descanted in a strain of cheerful pride upon the citys prosperity and character and gave the names of the people who lived in the finer houses just as if it had been an oldworld town and he some eager historian expecting reward for his comment upon it he cast quite a glamour over rochester so that in passing a body of water bordered by houses and overlooked by odd balconies and galleries and crossed in the distance by a bridge upon which other houses were built they boldly declared being at their wits end for a comparison and taken with the unhopedfor picturesqueness that it put them in mind of verona thus they reached their hotel in almost a spirit of foreign travel and very willing to verify the pleasant porters assurance that they would like it for everybody liked it and it was with a sudden sinking of the heart that basil beheld presiding over the register the conventional american hotel clerk he was young he had a neat mustache and wellbrushed hair jeweled studs sparkled in his shirtfront and rings on his white hands a gentle disdain of the travelling public breathed from his person in the mystical odors of ihlang ihlang he did not lift his haughty head to look at the wayfarer who meekly wrote his name in the register he did not answer him when he begged for a cool room he turned to the board on which the keys hung and plucking one from it slid it towards basil on the marble counter touched a bell for a callboy whistled a bar of offenbach and as he wrote the number of the room against basils name said to a friend lounging near him as if resuming a conversation well shes a mighty pooty gul any way chawley  when i reflect that this was a type of the hotel clerk throughout the united states that behind unnumbered registers at this moment he is snubbing travellers into the dust and that they are suffering and perpetuating him i am lost in wonder at the national meekness not that i am one to refuse the humble pie his jeweled fingers offer me abjectly i take my key and creep off up stairs after the callboy and try to give myself the genteel air of one who has not been stepped upon but i think homicidal things all the same and i rejoice that in the safety of print i can cry out against the despot whom i have not the presence to defy you vulgar and cruel little soul i say and i imagine myself breathing the words to his teeth why do you treat a weary stranger with this ignominy i am to pay well for what i get and i shall not complain of that but look at me and own my humanity confess by some civil action by some decent phrase that i have rights and that they shall be respected answer my proper questions respond to my fair demands do not slide my key at me do not deny me the poor politeness of a nod as you give it in my hand i am not your equal few men are but i shall not presume upon your clemency come i also am human  basil found that for his sin in asking for a cool room the clerk had given them a chamber into which the sun had been shining the whole afternoon but when his luggage had been put in it seemed useless to protest and like a true american like you like me he shrank from asserting himself when the sun went down it would be cool enough and they turned their thoughts to supper not venturing to hope that as it proved the handsome clerk was the sole blemish of the house  isabel viewed with innocent surprise the evidences of luxury afforded by all the appointments of a hotel so far west of boston and they both began to feel that natural ease and superiority which an inn always inspires in its guests and which our great hotels far from impairing enhance in flattering degree in fact the clerk once forgotten i protest for my own part i am never more conscious of my merits and riches in any other place one has there the romance of being a stranger and a mystery to every one else and lives in the alluring possibility of not being found out a most ordinary person  they were so late in coming to the supperroom that they found themselves alone in it at the door they had a bow from the headwaiter who ran before them and drew out chairs for them at a table and signaled waiters to serve them first laying before them with a gracious flourish the bill of fare  a force of servants flocked about them as if to contest the honor of ordering their supper one set upon the table a heaping vase of strawberries another flanked it with flagons of cream a third accompanied it with gates of varied flavor and device a fourth obsequiously smoothed the tablecloth a fifth the youngest of the five with folded arms stood by and admired the satisfaction the rest were giving when these had been dispatched for steak for broiled whitefish of the lakesnoblest and delicatest of the fish that swimfor broiled chicken for fried potatoes for mums for whatever the lawless fancy and ravening appetites of the wayfarers could suggest this fifth waiter remained to tempt them to further excess and vainly proposed some kind of eggsfried eggs poached eggs scrambled eggs boiled eggs or omelette  o youre sure dearest that this isnt a vision of fairyland which will vanish presently and leave us empty and forlorn plaintively murmured isabel as the menial train reappeared bearing the supper they had ordered and set it smoking down  suddenly a look of apprehension dawned upon her face and she let fall her knife and fork you dont think basil she faltered that they could have found out were a bridal party and that theyre serving us so magnificently becausebecauseo i shall be miserable every moment were here she concluded desperately  she looked indeed extremely wretched for a woman with so much broiled whitefish on her plate and such a banquet array about her and her husband made haste to reassure her youre still demoralized isabel by our sufferings at the albany depot and you exaggerate the blessings we enjoy though i should be sorry to undervalue them i suspect its the custom to use people well at this hotel or if we are singled out for uncommon favor i think i can explain the cause it has been discovered by the register that we are from boston and we are merely meeting the reverence affection and homage which the name everywhere commands  it s our fortune to represent for the time being the intellectual and moral virtue of boston this supper is not a tribute to you as a bride but as a bostonian  it was a cheap kind of raillery to be sure but it served it kindled the local pride of isabel to selfdefense and in the distraction of the effort she forgot her fears she returned with renewed appetite to the supper and in its excellence they both let fall their disputewhich ended of course in basils abject confession that boston was the best place in the world and nothing but banishment could make him live elsewhereand gave themselves up as usual to the delight of being just what and where they were at last the natural course brought them to the strawberries and when the fifth waiter approached from the corner of the table at which he stood to place the vase near them he did not retire at once but presently asked if they were from the west  isabel smiled and basil answered that they were from the east  he faltered at this as if doubtful of the result if he went further but took heart then and asked dont you think this is a pretty nice hotelhastily adding as a concession of the probable existence of much finer things at the eastfor a small hotel  they imagined this waiter as new to his station in life as perhaps just risen to it from some country tavern and unable to repress his exultation in what seemed their sympathetic presence they were charmed to have invited his guileless confidence to have evoked possibly all the simple poetry of his soul it was what might have happened in italy only there so much naivete would have meant money they looked at each other with rapture and basil answered warmly while the waiter flushed as at a personal compliment yes it s a nice hotel one of the best i ever saw east or west in europe or america  they rose and left the room and were bowed out by the headwaiter  how perfectly idyllic cried isabel is this rochester new york or is it some vale of arcady lets go out and see  they walked out into the moonlit city up and down streets that seemed very stately and fine amidst a glitter of shopwindow lights and then less of their own motion than of mere error they quitted the business quarter and found themselves in a quiet avenue of handsome residencesthe beacon street of rochester whatever it was called they said it was a night and a place for lovers for none but lovers for lovers newly plighted and they made believe to bemoan themselves that hold each other dear as they would the exaltation the thrill the glory of their younger love was gone some of the houses had gardened spaces about them from which stole like breaths of sweetest and saddest regret the perfume of midsummer flowersthe despair of the rose for the bud as they passed a certain house a song fluttered out of the open window and ceased the piano warbled at the final rush of fingers over its chords and they saw her with her fingers resting lightly on the keys and her graceful head lifted to look into his they saw him with his arm yet stretched across to the leaves of music he had been turning and his face lowered to meet her gaze  ah basil i wish it was we there  and if they knew that we on our wedding journey stood outside would not they wish it was they here  i suppose so dearest and yet onceuponatime was sweet pass on and let us see what charm we shall find next in this enchanted city  yes it is an enchanted city to us mused basil aloud as they wandered on and all strange cities are enchanted what is rochester to the rochesterese a place of a hundred thousand people as we read in our guide an immense flour interest a great railroad entrepot an unrivaled nursery trade a university two commercial colleges three collegiate institutes eight or ten newspapers and a free library i dare say any respectable resident would laugh at us sentimentalizing over his city but rochester is for us who dont know it at all a city of any time or country moonlit filled with lovers hovering over pianofortes of a palatial hotel with pastoral waiters and portera city of handsome streets wrapt in beautiful quiet and dreaming of the golden age the only definite association with it in our minds is the tragically romantic thought that here sam patch met his fate  and who in the world was sam patch  isabel your ignorance of all that an american woman should be proud of distresses me have you really then never heard of the man who invented the saying some things can be done as well as others and proved it by jumping over niagara falls twice spurred on by this belief he attempted the leap of the genesee falls the leap was easy enough but the coming up again was another matter he failed in that it was the one thing that could not be done as well as others  dreadful said isabel with the cheerfullest satisfaction but what has all that to do with rochester  now my dear you dont mean to say you didnt know that the genesee falls were at rochester upon my word im ashamed why were within ten minutes walk of them now  then walk to them at once cried isabel wholly unabashed and in fact unable to see what he had to be ashamed of actually i believe you would have allowed me to leave rochester without telling me the falls were here if you hadnt happened to think of sam patch  saying this she persuaded herself that a chief object of their journey had been to visit the scene of sam patchs fatal exploit and she drew basil with a nervous swiftness in the direction of the railroad station beyond which he said were the falls presently after threading their way among a multitude of locomotives with and without trains attached that backed and advanced or stood still hissing impatiently on every side they passed through the station to a broad planking above the river on the other side and thence after encounter of more locomotives they found by dint of much asking a street winding up the hillside to the left and leading to the german bierhaus that gives access to the best view of the cataract  the americans have characteristically bordered the river with manufactures making every drop work its passage to the brink while the germans have as characteristically made use of the beauty left over and have built a bierhaus where they may regale both soul and sense in the presence of the cataract our travellers might in another mood and place have thought it droll to arrive at that sublime spectacle through a bierhaus but in this enchanted city it seemed to have a peculiar fitness  a narrow corridor gave into a wide festival space occupied by many tables each of which was surrounded by a group of clamorous germans of either sex and every age with tall beakers of beaded lager before them and slim flasks of rhenish overhead flamed the gas in globes of varicolored glass the walls were painted like those of such haunts in the fatherland and the weddingjourneyers were fair to linger on their way to dwell upon that scene of honest enjoyment to inhale the mingling odors of beer and of pipes and of the pungent cheeses in which the children of the fatherland delight amidst the inspiriting clash of plates and glasses the rattle of knives and forks and the hoarse rush of gutturals they could catch the words franzosen kaiser konig and schlacht and they knew that festive company to be exulting in the first german triumphs of the war which were then the days news they saw fists shaken at noses in fierce exchange of joy arms tossed abroad in wild congratulation and healthpouring goblets of beer lifted in air then they stepped into the moonlight again and heard only the solemn organ stops of the cataract through gardenground they were led by the little maid their guide to a small pavilion that stood on the edge of the precipitous shore and commanded a perfect view of the falls as they entered this pavilion a youth and maiden clearly lovers passed out and they were left alone with that sublime presence something of definiteness was to be desired in the spectacle but there was ample compensation in the mystery with which the broad effulgence and the dense unluminous shadows of the moonshine invested it the light touched all the tops of the rapids that seemed to writhe sway from the brink of the cataract and then desperately breaking and perishing to fall the white disembodied ghosts of rapids down to the bottom of the vast and deep ravine through which the river rushed away now the waters seemed to mass themselves a hundred feet high in a wall of snowy compactness now to disperse into their multitudinous particles and hang like some vaporous cloud from the cliff every moment renewed the vision of beauty in some rare and fantastic shape and its loveliness isolated it in spite of the great town on the other shore the station with its bridge and its trains the mills that supplied their feeble little needs from the cataracts strength  at last basil pointed out the tablerock in the middle of the fall from which sam patch had made his fatal leap but isabel refused to admit that tragical figure to the honors of her emotions i dont care for him she said fiercely patch what a name to be linked in our thoughts with this superb cataract  well isabel i think you are very unjust its as good a name as leander to my thinking and it was immortalized in support of a great idea the feasibility of all things while leanders has come down to us as that of the weak victim of a passion we shall never have a poetry of our own till we get over this absurd reluctance from facts till we make the ideal embrace and include the real till we consent to face the music in our simple common names and put smith into a lyric and jones into a tragedy the germans are braver than we and in them you find facts and dreams continually blended and confronted here is a fortunate illustration the people we met coming out of this pavilion were lovers and they had been here sentimentalizing on this superb cataract as you call it with which my heroic patch is not worthy to be named no doubt they had been quoting uhland or some other of their romantic poets perhaps singing some of their tender german lovesongsthe tenderest unearthliest lovesongs in the world at the same time they did not disdain the matteroffact corporeity in which their sentiment was enshrined they fed it heartily and abundantly with the banquet whose relics we see here  on a table before them stood a pair of beerglasses in the bottoms of which lurked scarce the foam of the generous liquor lately brimming them some shreds of sausage some rinds of swiss cheese bits of cold ham crusts of bread and the ashes of a pipe  isabel shuddered at the spectacle but made no comment and basil went on do you suppose they scorned the idea of sam patch as they gazed upon the falls on the contrary ive no doubt that he recalled to her the ballad which a poet of their language made about him it used to go the rounds of the german newspapers and i translated it a long while ago when i thought that i too was in arkadien geboren         in the bierhauagarten i linger         by the falls of the geneses         from the tablerock in the middle         leaps a figure bold and free          aloof in the air it rises         oer the rush the plunge the death         on the thronging banks of the river         there is neither pulse nor breath          forever it hovers and poises         aloof in the moonlit air         as light as mist from the rapids         as heavy as nightmare          in anguish i cry to the people         the longsince vanished hosts         i see them stretch forth in answer         the helpless hands of ghosts  i once met the poet who wrote this he drank too much beer  i dont see that he got in the name of sam patch after all said isabel  o yes he did but i had to yield to our taste and where he said i springt der sam patsch kuhn and frei i made it leaps a figure bold and free  as they passed through the house on their way out they saw the youth and maiden they had met at the pavilion door they were seated at a table two glasses of beer towered before them on their plates were odorous crumbs of limburger cheese they both wore a pensive air  the next morning the illusion that had wrapt the whole earth was gone with the moonlight by nine oclock when the weddingjourneyers resumed their way toward niagara the heat had already set in with the effect of ordinary midsummers heat at high noon the car into which they got had come the past night from albany and had an air of almost conscious shabbiness griminess and overuse the seats were covered with cinders which also crackled under foot dust was on everything especially the persons of the crumpled and weary passengers of overnight those who came aboard at rochester failed to lighten the spiritual gloom and presently they sank into the common bodily wretchedness the train was somewhat belated and as it drew nearer buffalo they knew the conductor to have abandoned himself to that blackest of the arts making time the long irregular jolt of the ordinary progress was reduced to an incessant shudder and a quick lateral motion the air within the cars was deadly if a window was raised a storm of dust and cinders blew in and quick gusts caught away the breath so they sat with closed windows sweltering and stifling and all the faces on which a lively horror was not painted were dull and damp with apathetic misery  the incidents were in harmony with the abject physical tone of the company there was a quarrel between a thin shrillvoiced highly dressed muchbedizened jewess on the one side and a fat greedy old woman half asleep and a boy with large pink transparent ears that stood out from his head like the handles of a jar on the other side about a seat which the hebrew wanted and which the others had kept filled with packages on the pretense that it was engaged it was a loud and fierce quarrel enough but it won no sort of favor and when the jewess had given a final opinion that the greedy old woman was no lady and the boy who disputed in an ironical temper replied highly complimentary i must say there was no sign of relief or other acknowledgment in any of the spectators that there had been a quarrel  there was a little more interest taken in the misfortune of an old purblind german and his son who were found by the conductor to be a few hundred miles out of the direct course to their destination and were with some trouble and the aid of an americanized fellowcountryman made aware of the fact the old man then fell back in the prevailing apathy and the child naturally cared nothing by and by came the unsparing trainboy on his rounds bestrewing the passengers successively with papers magazines finecut tobacco and packages of candy he gave the old man a package of candy and passed on the german took it as the bounty of the american people oddly manifested in a situation where he could otherwise have had little proof of their care he opened it and was sharing it with his son when the trainboy came back and metallically like a part of the machinery demanded ten cents the german stared helplessly and the boy repeated ten cents ten cents with tiresome patience while the other passengers smiled when it had passed through the aliens head that he was to pay for this national gift and he took with his tremulous fingers from the recesses of his pocketbook a tencent note and handed it to his tormentor some of the people laughed among the rest basil and isabel laughed and then looked at each other with eyes of mutual reproach  well upon my word my dear he said i think weve fallen pretty low ive never felt such a poor shabby ruffian before good heavens to think of our immortal souls being moved to mirth by such a thing as thisso stupid so barren of all reason of laughter and then the cruelty of it what ferocious imbeciles we are whom have i married a woman with neither heart nor brain  o basil dear pay him back the moneydo  i cant thats the worst of it he s money enough and might justly take offense what breaks my heart is that we could have the depravity to smile at the mistake of a friendless stranger who supposed he had at last met with an act of pure kindness its a thing to weep over look at these grinning wretches what a fiendish effect their smiles have through their cinders and sweat o its the terrible weather the despotism of the dust and heat the wickedness of the infernal air what a squalid and loathsome company  at buffalo where they arrived late they found themselves with several hours time on their hands before the train started for niagara and in the first moments of tedium isabel forgot herself into saying dont you think wed have done better to go directly from rochester to the falls instead of coming this way  why certainly i didnt propose coming this way  i know it dear i was only asking said isabel meekly but i should think youd have generosity enough to take a little of the blame when i wanted to come out of a romantic feeling for you  this romantic feeling referred to the fact that many years before when basil made his first visit to niagara he had approached from the west by way of buffalo and isabel who tenderly begrudged his having existed before she knew him and longed to ally herself retrospectively with his past was resolved to draw near the great cataract by no other route  she fetched a little sigh which might mean the weather or his hardheartedness the sigh touched him and he suggested a carriageride through the city she assented with eagerness for it was what she had been thinking of she had never seen a lakeside city before and she was taken by surprise if ever we leave boston she said we will not live at rochester as i thought last night well come to buffalo she found that the place had all the picturesqueness of a seaport without the ugliness that attends the rising and falling tides a delicious freshness breathed from the lake which lying so smooth faded into the sky at last with no line between sharper than that which divides drowsing from dreaming but the color was the most charming thing that delicate blue of the lake without the depth of the seablue but infinitely softer and lovelier the nearer expanses rippled with dainty waves silver and lucent the further levels made with the sundimmed summer sky a vague horizon of turquoise and amethyst lit by the white sails of ships and stained by the smoke of steamers  take me away now said isabel when her eyes had feasted upon all this and dont let me see another thing till i get to niagara nothing less sublime is worthy the eyes that have beheld such beauty  however on the way to niagara she consented to glimpses of the river which carries the waters of the lake for their mighty plunge and which shows itself very nobly from time to time as you draw toward the cataract with wooded or cultivated islands and rich farms along its low shores and at last flashes upon the eye the shining white of the rapidsa hint no more of the splendor and awfulness to be revealed     vi niagara  as the train stopped isabels heart beat with a childlike exultation as i believe every ones heart must who is worthy to arrive at niagara she had been trying to fancy from time to time that she heard the roar of the cataract and now when she alighted from the car she was sure she should have heard it but for the vulgar little noises that attend the arrival of trains at niagara as well as everywhere else never mind dearest you shall be stunned with it before you leave promised her husband and not wholly disconsolate she rode through the quaint streets of the village where it remains a question whether the lowliness of the shops and private houses makes the hotels look so vast or the bigness of the hotels dwarfs all the other buildings the immense caravansaries swelling up from among the little bazaars where they sell feather fans and miniature bark canoes and jars and vases and bracelets and brooches carved out of the local rocks made our friends with their trunks very conscious of their disproportion to the accommodations of the smallest they were the sole occupants of the omnibus and they were embarrassed to be received at their hotel with a burst of minstrelsy from a whole band of music isabel felt that a single stringed instrument of some timid note would have been enough and basil was going to express his own modest preference for a jewsharp when the music ceased with a sudden clash of the cymbals but the next moment it burst out with fresh sweetness and in alighting they perceived that another omnibus had turned the corner and was drawing up to the pillared portico of the hotel a small family dismounted and the feet of the last had hardly touched the pavement when the music again ended as abruptly as those flourishes of trumpets that usher playerkings upon the stage isabel could not help laughing at this melodious parsimony i hope they dont let on the cataract and shut it off in this frugal style do they basil she asked and passed jesting through a pomp of unoccupied porters and tallboys apparently there were not many people stopping at this hotel or else they were all out looking at the falls or confined to their rooms however our travellers took in the almost weird emptiness of the place with their usual gratitude to fortune for all queerness in life and followed to the pleasant quarters assigned them there was time before supper for a glance at the cataract and after a brief toilet they sallied out again upon the holiday street with its parade of gay little shops and thence passed into the grove beside the falls enjoying at every instant their feeling of arrival at a sublime destination  in this sense niagara deserves almost to rank with rome the metropolis of history and religion with venice the chief city of sentiment and fantasy in either you are at once made at home by a perception of its greatness in which there is no quality of aggression as there always seems to be in minor places as well as in minor men and you gratefully accept its sublimity as a fact in no way contrasting with your own insignificance  our friends were beset of course by many carriagedrivers whom they repelled with the kindly firmness of experienced travel isabel even felt a compassion for these poor fellows who had seen niagara so much as to have forgotten that the first time one must see it alone or only with the next of friendship she was voluble in her pity of basil that it was not as new to him as to her till between the trees they saw a white cloud of spray shot through and through with sunset rising rising and she felt her voice softly and steadily beaten down by the diapason of the cataract  i am not sure but the first emotion on viewing niagara is that of familiarity ever after its strangeness increases but in that earliest moment when you stand by the side of the american fall and take in so much of the whole as your giants can compass an impression of having seen it often before is certainly very vivid this may be an effect of that grandeur which puts you at your ease in its presence but it also undoubtedly results in part from lifelong acquaintance with every variety of futile picture of the scene you have its outward form clearly in your memory the shores the rapids the islands the curve of the falls and the stout rainbow with one end resting on their top and the other lost in the mists that rise from the gulf beneath on the whole i do not account this sort of familiarity a misfortune the surprise is none the less a surprise because it is kept till the last and the marvel making itself finally felt in every nerve and not at once through a single sense all the more fully possesses you it is as if niagara reserved her magnificence and preferred to win your heart with her beauty and so isabel who was instinctively prepared for the reverse suffered a vague disappointment for a little instant as she looked along the verge from the water that caressed the shore at her feet before it flung itself down to the wooded point that divides the american from the canadian fall beyond which showed dimly through its veil of golden and silver mists the emerald wall of the great horseshoe how still it is she said amidst the roar that shook the ground under their feet and made the leaves tremble overhead and how lonesome amidst the people lounging and sauntering about in every direction among the trees in fact that prodigious presence does make a solitude and silence round every spirit worthy to perceive it and it gives a kind of dignity to all its belongings so that the rocks and pebbles in the waters edge and the weeds and grasses that nod above it have a value far beyond that of such common things elsewhere in all the aspects of niagara there seems a grave simplicity which is perhaps a reflection of the spectators soul for once utterly dismantled of affectation and convention in the vulgar reaction from this you are of course as trivial if you like at niagara as anywhere  slowly isabel became aware that the sacred grove beside the fall was profaned by some very common presences indeed that tossed bits of stone and sticks into the consecrated waters and struggled for handkerchiefs and fans and here and there put their arms about each others waists and made a show of laughing and joking they were a picnic party of rude silly folks of the neighborhood and she stood pondering them in sad wonder if anything could be worse when she heard a voice saying to basil take you next sir plenty of light yet and the winds down the river so the spray wont interfere make a capital picture of you falls in the background it was the local photographer urging them to succeed the young couple he had just posed at the brink the gentleman was sitting down with his legs crossed and his hands elegantly disposed the lady was standing at his side with one arm thrown lightly across his shoulder while with the other hand she thrust his cane into the ground you could see it was going to be a splendid photograph  basil thanked the artist and isabel said trusting as usual to his sympathy for perception of her train of thought well ill never try to be highstrung again but shouldnt you have thought dearest that i might expect to be highstrung with success at niagara if anywhere she passively followed him into the long queer downwardsloping edifice on the border of the grove unflinchingly mounted the car that stood ready and descended the incline emerging into the light again she found herself at the foot of the fall by whose top she had just stood at first she was glad there were other people down there as if she and basil were not enough to bear it alone and she could almost have spoken to the two hopelessly pretty brides with parasols and impertinent little boots whom their attendant husbands were helping over the sharp and slippery rocks so bare beyond the spray so green and mossy within the fall of mist but in another breath she forgot them as she looked on that dizzied sea hurling itself from the high summit in huge white knots and breaks and masses and plunging into the gulf beside her while it sent continually up a strong voice of lamentation and crawled away in vast eddies with somehow a look of human terror bewilderment and pain it was bathed in snowy vapor to its crest but now and then heavy currents of air drew this aside and they saw the outline of the falls almost as far as the canada side they remembered afterwards how they were able to make use of but one sense at a time and how when they strove to take in the forms of the descending flood they ceased to hear it but as soon as they released their eyes from this service every fibre in them vibrated to the sound and the spectacle dissolved away in it they were aware too of a strange capriciousness in their senses and of a tendency of each to palter with the things perceived the eye could no longer take truthful note of quality and now beheld the tumbling deluge as a gothic wall of careen marble white motionless and now as a fall of lightest snow with movement in all its atoms and scarce so much cohesion as would hold them together and again they could not discern if this course were from above or from beneath whether the water rose from the abyss or dropped from the height the ear could give the brain no assurance of the sound that felled it and whether it were great or little the prevailing softness of the cataracts tone seemed so much opposed to ideas of prodigious force or of prodigious volume it was only when the sight so idle in its own behalf came to the aid of the other sense and showed them the mute movement of each others lips that they dimly appreciated the depth of sound that involved them  i think you might have been highstrung there for a second or two said basil when ascending the incline he could make himself heard we will try the bridge next  over the river so still with its oily eddies and delicate wreaths of foam just below the falls they have in late years woven a web of wire high in air and hung a bridge from precipice to precipice of all the bridges made with hands it seems the lightest most ethereal it is ideally graceful and droops from its slight towers like a garland it is worthy to command as it does the whole grandeur of niagara and to show the traveller the vast spectacle from the beginning of the american fall to the farthest limit of the horseshoe with all the awful pomp of the rapids the solemn darkness of the wooded islands the mystery of the vaporous gulf the indomitable wildness of the shores as far as the eye can reach up or down the fatal stream  to this bridge our friends now repaired by a path that led through another of those groves which keep the village back from the shores of the river on the american side and greatly help the sightseers pleasure in the place the exquisite structure which sways so tremulously from its towers and seems to lay so slight a hold on earth where its cables sink into the ground is to other bridges what the blood horse is to the common breed of roadsters ant now they felt its sensitive nerves quiver under them and sympathetically through them as they advanced farther and farther toward the centre perhaps their sympathy with the bridges trepidation was too great for unalloyed delight and yet the thrill was a glorious one to be known only there and afterwards at least they would not have had their airy path seem more secure  the last hues of sunset lingered in the mists that sprung from the base of the falls with a mournful tremulous grace and a movement weird as the play of the northern lights they were touched with the most delicate purples and crimsons that darkened to deep red and then faded from them at a second look and they flew upward swiftly upward like troops of pale transparent ghosts while a perfectly clear radiance better than any other for local color dwelt upon the scene far under the bridge the river smoothly swam the undercurrents forever unfolding themselves upon the surface with a vast roselike evolution edged all round with faint lines of white where the air that filled the water freed itself in foam what had been clear green on the face of the cataract was here more like rich verdantique and had a look of firmness almost like that of the stone itself so it showed beneath the bridge and down the river till the curving shores hid it these springing abruptly prom the waters brink and shagged with pine and cedar displayed the tender verdure of grass and bushes intermingled with the dark evergreens that comb from ledge to ledge till they point their speary tops above the crest of bluffs in front where tumbled rocks and expanses of caked clay varied the gloomier and gayer green sprung those spectral mists and through them loomed out in its manifold majesty niagara with the seemingly immovable white gothic screen of the american fall and the green massive curve of the horseshoe solid and simple and calm as an egyptian wall while behind this with their white and black expanses broken by dark foliaged little isles the steep canadian rapids billowed down between their heavily wooded shores  the weddingjourneyers hung they knew not how long in rapture on the sight and then looking back from the shore to the spot where they had stood they felt relieved that unreality should possess itself of all and that the bridge should swing there in midair like a filmy web scarce more passable than the rainbow that flings its arch above the mists  on the portico of the hotel they found half a score of gentlemen smoking and creating together that collective silence which passes for sociality on our continent some carriages stood before the door and within around the base of a pillar sat a circle of idle callboys there were a few trunks heaped together in one place with a porter standing guard over them a solitary guest was buying a cigar at the newspaper stand in one corner another friendless creature was writing a letter in the readingroom the clerk in a seersucker coat and a lavish shirtbosom tried to give the whole an effect of wateringplace gayety and bustle as he provided a newly arrived guest with a room  our pair took in these traits of solitude and repose with indifference if the hotel had been thronged with brilliant company they would have been no more and no less pleased and when after supper they came into the grand parlor and found nothing there but a marbletopped centre table with a silverplated icepitcher and a small company of goblets they sat down perfectly content in a secluded windowseat they were not seen by the three people who entered soon after and halted in the centre of the room  why kitty said one of the two ladies who must be in any travellingparty of three this is more inappropriate to your gorgeous array than the supperroom even  she who was called kitty was armed as for social conquest in some kind of airy eveningdress and was looking round with bewilderment upon that forlorn waste of carpeting and upholstery she owned with a smile that she had not seen so much of the world yet as she had been promised but she liked niagara very much and perhaps they should find the world at breakfast  no said the other lady who was as unquiet as kitty was calm and who seemed resolved to make the most of the worst it isnt probable that the hotel will fill up overnight and i feel personally responsible for this state of things who would ever have supposed that niagara would be so empty i thought the place was thronged the whole summer long how do you account for it richard  the gentleman looked fatigued as from a longcontinued discussion elsewhere of the matter in hand and he said that he had not been trying to account for it  then you dont care for kittys pleasure at all and you dont want her to enjoy herself why dont you take some interest in the matter  why if i accounted for the emptiness of niagara in the most satisfactory way it wouldnt add a soul to the floating population under the circumstances i prefer to leave it unexplained  do you think its because its such a hot summer do you suppose its not exactly the season didnt you expect thered be more people perhaps niagara isnt as fashionable as it used to be  it looks something like that  well what under the sun do you think is the reason  i dont know  perhaps interposed kitty placidly most of the visitors go to the other hotel now  it s altogether likely said the other lady eagerly there are just such caprices  well said richard i wanted you to go there  but you said that you always heard this was the a most fashionable  i know it i didnt want to come here for that reason but fortune favors the brave  well its too bad here weve asked kitty to come to niagara with us just to give her a little peep into the world and youve brought us to a hotel where were  monarchs of all we survey suggested kitty  yes and start at the sound of our own added the other lady helplessly  come now fanny said the gentleman who was but too clearly the husband of the last speaker you know you insisted against all i could say or do upon coming to this house i implored you to go to the other and now you blame me for bringing you here  so i do if youd let me have my own way without opposition about coming here i dare my i should have gone to the other place but never mind kitty knows whom to blame i hope she s your cousin  kitty was sitting with her hands quiescently folded in her lap she now rose and said that she did not know anything about the other hotel and perhaps it was just as empty as this  it cant be there cant be two hotels so empty said fanny it dont stand to reason  if you wish kitty to see the world so much said the gentleman why dont you take her on to quebec with us  kitty had left her seat beside fanny and was moving with a listless content about the parlor  i wonder you ask richard when you know shes only come for the night and has nothing with her but a few cuffs and collars i certainly never heard of anything so absurd before  the absurdity of the idea then seemed to cast its charm upon her for after a silence i could lend her some things she said musingly but dont speak of it tonight please its too ridiculous kitty she called out and as the young lady drew near she continued how would you like to go to quebec with us  o fanny cried kitty with rapture and then with dismay how can i  why very well i think youve got this dress and your travellingsuit and i can lend you whatever you want come she added joyously lets go up to your room and talk it over  the two ladies vanished upon this impulse and the gentleman followed to their own relief the guiltless eavesdroppers who found no moment favorable for revealing themselves after the comedy began issued from their retiracy  what a remarkable little lady said basil eagerly turning to isabel for sympathy in his enjoyment of her inconsequence  yes poor thing returned his wife its no light matter to invite a young lady to take a journey with you and promise her all sorts of gayety and perhaps beaux and flirtations and then find her on your hands in a desolation like this its dreadful i think  basil stared o certainly he said but what an amusingly illogical little body  i dont understand what you mean basil it was the only thing that she could do to invite the young lady to go on with them i wonder her husband had the sense to think of it first of course shell have to lend her things  and you didnt observe anything peculiar in her way of reaching her conclusions  peculiar what do you mean  why her blaming her husband for letting her have her own way about the hotel and her telling him not to mention his proposal to kitty and then doing it herself justafter shed pronounced it absurd and impossible he spoke with heat at being forced to make what he thought a needless explanation  o said isabel after a moments reflection that did you think it so very odd  her husband looked at her with the gravity a man must feel when he begins to perceive that he has married the whole mystifying world of womankind in the woman of his choice and made no answer but to his own soul he said i supposed i had the pleasure of my wifes acquaintance it seems i have been flattering myself  the next morning they went out as they had planned for an exploration of goat island after an early breakfast as they sauntered through the villages contrasts of pigmy and colossal in architecture they praisefully took in the unalloyed holiday character of the place enjoying equally the lounging tourists at the hotel doors the drivers and their carriages to let and the little shops with nothing but mementos of niagara and indian beadwork and other trumpery to sell shops so useless they agreed could not be found outside the palms royale or the square of st mark or anywhere else in the world but here they felt themselves once more a part of the tide of mere sightseeing pleasuretravel on which they had drifted in other days and in an eddy of which their love itself had opened its white blossom and lilylike dreamed upon the wave  they were now also part of the great circle of newly wedded bliss which involving the whole land during the season of bridaltours may be said to show richest and fairest at niagara like the costly jewel of a precious ring the place is in fact almost abandoned to bridal couples and any one out of his honeymoon is in some degree an alien there and must discern a certain immodesty in him intrusion is it for his profane eyes to look upon all that blushing and trembling joy a man of any sensibility must desire to veil his face and bowing his excuses to the collective rapture take the first train for the wicked outside world to which he belongs everywhere he sees brides and brides three or four with the benediction still on them come down in the same car with him he hands her travellingshawl after one as she springs from the omnibus into her husbands arms there are two or three walking back and forth with their new lords upon the porch of the hotel at supper they are on every side of him and he feels himself suffused as it were by a roseate atmosphere of youth and love and hope at breakfast it is the same and then in his wanderings about the place he constantly meets them they are of all manners of beauty fair and dark slender and plump tall and short but they are all beautiful with the radiance of loving and being loved now if ever in their lives they are charmingly dressed and ravishing toilets take the willing eye from the objects of interest how high the heels of the pretty boots how small the tender tinted gloves how electrical the flutter of the snowy skirts what is niagara to these things  isabel was not willing to own her bridal sisterhood to these blessed souls but she secretly rejoiced in it even while she joined basil in noting their number and smiling at their innocent abandon she dropped his arm at encounter of the first couple and walked carelessly at his side she made a solemn vow never to take hold of his watchchain in speaking to him she trusted that she might be preserved from putting her face very close to his at dinner in studying the bill of fare getting out of carriages she forbade him ever to take her by the waist all ascetic resolutions are modified by experiment but if isabel did not rigorously keep these she is not the less to be praised for having formed them  just before they reached the bridge to goat island they passed a little group of the indians still lingering about niagara who make the barbaric wares in which the shops abound and like the woods and the wild faces of the cliffs and precipices help to keep the cataract remote and to invest it with the charm of primeval loneliness this group were women and they sat motionless on the ground smiling sphinxlike over their laps full of beadwork and turning their dark liquid eyes of invitation upon the passers they wore bright kirtles and red shawls fell from their heads over their plump brown cheeks and down their comfortable persons a little girl with them was attired in like gayety of color what is her name asked isabel paying for a bead pincushion daisy smith said her mother in distressingly good english but her indian name she has none answered the woman who told basil that her village numbered five hundred people and that they were protestants while they talked they were joined by an indian whom the women saluted musically in their native tongue this was somewhat consoling but he wore trousers and a waistcoat and it could have been wished that he had not a silk hat on  still said isabel as they turned away im glad he hasnt lislethread gloves like that chieftain we saw putting his forest queen on board the train at oneida but how shocking that they should be christians and protestants it would have been bad enough to have them catholics and that woman said that they were increasing they ought to be fading away  on the bridge they paused and looked up and down the rapids rushing down the slope in all their wild variety with the white crests of breaking surf the dark massiveness of heavyclimbing waves the fleet smooth sweep of currents over broad shelves of sunken rock the dizzy swirl and suck of whirlpools  spellbound the journeyers pored upon the deathful course beneath their feet gave a shudder to the horror of being cast upon it and then hurried over the bridge to the island in the shadow of whose wildness they sought refuge from the sight and sound  there had been rain in the night the air war full of forest fragrance and the low sweet voice of twittering birds presently they came to a bench set in a corner of the path and commanding a pleasant vista of sunlit foliage with a mere gleam of the foaming river beyond as they sat down here loverwise basil as in the early days of their courtship began to recite a poem it was one which had been haunting him since his first sight of the rapids one of many that he used to learn by heart in his youththe rhyme of some poor newspaper poet whom the third or fourth editor copying his verses consigned to oblivion by carelessly clipping his name from the bottom it had always lingered in basils memory rather from the interest of the awful fact it recorded than from any merit of its own and now he recalled it with a distinctness that surprised him                   avery                    i all night long they heard in the houses beside the shore heard or seemed to hear through the multitudinous roar out of the hell of the rapids as twere a lost souls cries heard and could not believe and the morning mocked their eyes showing where wildest and fiercest the waters leaped up and ran raving round him and past the visage of a man clinging or seeming to cling to the trunk of a tree that caught fast in the rocks below scarce out of the surges raught was it a life could it be to yon slender hope that clung shrill above all the tumult the answering terror rang                    ii under the weltering rapids a boat from the bridge is drowned over the rocks the lines of another are tangled and wound and the long fateful hours of the morning have wasted soon as it had been in some blessed trance and now it is noon hurry now with the raft but o build it strong and stanch and to the lines and the treacherous rocks look well as you launch over the foamy tops of the waves and their foamsprent sides over the hidden reefs and through the embattled tides onward rushes the raft with many a lurch and leap lord if it strike him loose from the hold he scarce can keep no through all peril unharmed it reaches him harmless at least and to its proven strength he lashes his weakness fast now for the shore but steady steady my men and slow taut now the quivering lines now slack and so let her go thronging the shores around stands the pitying multitude wan as his own are their looks and a nightmare seems to brood heavy upon them and heavy the silence hangs on all save for the rapids plunge and the thunder of the fall but on a sudden thrills from the people still and pale chorussing his unheard despair a desperate wail caught on a lurking point of rock it sways and swings sport of the pitiless waters the raft to which he clings                    iii all the long afternoon it idly swings and sways and on the shore the crowd lifts up its hands and prays lifts to heaven and wrings the hands so helpless to save prays for the mercy of god on him whom the rock and the ways battle for fettered betwixt them and who amidst their strife straggles to help his helpers and fights so hard for his life tugging at rope and at reef while men weep and women swoon priceless second by second so wastes the afternoon and it is sunset now and another boat and the last down to him from the bridge through the rapids has safely passed                    iv wild through the crowd comes flying a man that nothing can stay maddening against the gate that is locked athwart his way no we keep the bridge for them that can help him you tell us who are you his brother god help you both pass through wild with wide arms of imploring he calls aloud to him unto the face of his brother scarce seen in the distance dim but in the roar of the rapids his fluttering words are lost as in a wind of autumn the leaves of autumn are tossed and from the bridge he sees his brother sever the rope holding him to the raft and rise secure in his hope sees all as in a dream the terrible pageantry populous shores the woods the sky the birds flying free sees then the formthat spent with effort and fasting and fear flings itself feebly and fails of the boat that is lying so near caught in the longbaffled clutch of the rapids and rolled and hurled headlong on to the cataracts brink and out of the world   o basil said isabel with a long sigh breaking the hush that best praised the unknown poets skill it isnt true is it  every word almost even to the brothers coming at the last moment its a very wellknown incident he added and i am sure the reader whose memory runs back twenty years cannot have forgotten it  niagara indeed is an awful homicide nearly every point of interest about the place has killed its man and there might well be a deeper stain of crimson than it ever wears in that pretty bow overarching the falls its beauty is relieved against an historical background as gloomy as the lightesthearted tourist could desire the abominable savages revering the cataract as a kind of august devil and leading a life of demoniacal misery and wickedness whom the first jesuits found here two hundred years ago the ferocious iroquois bloodily driving out these squalid devilworshippers the french planting the fort that yet guards the mouth of the river and therewith the seeds of war that fruited afterwards in murderous strifes throughout the whole niagara country the struggle for the military posts on the river during the wars of france and england the awful scene in the conspiracy of pontiac where a detachment of english troops was driven by the indians over the precipice near the great whirlpool the sorrow and havoc visited upon the american settlements in the revolution by the savages who prepared their attacks in the shadow of fort niagara the battles of chippewa and of lundys lane that mixed the roar of their cannon with that of the fall the savage forays with tomahawk and scalpingknife and the blazing villages on either shore in the war of 1812these are the memories of the place the links in a chain of tragical interest scarcely broken before our time since the white man first beheld the mistveiled face of niagara the facts lost nothing of their due effect as basil in the ramble across goat island touched them with the reflected light of mr parkmans historiesthose precious books that make our meagre past wear something of the rich romance of old european days and illumine its savage solitudes with the splendor of mediaeval chivalry and the glory of mediaeval martyrdomand then lacking this light turned upon them the feeble glimmer of the guidebooks he and isabel enjoyed the lurid picture with all the zest of sentimentalists dwelling upon the troubles of other times from the shelter of the safe and peaceful present they were both poets in their quality of bridal couple and so long as their own nerves were unshaken they could transmute all facts to entertaining fables they pleasantly exercised their sympathies upon those who every year perish at niagara in the tradition of its awful power only they refused their cheap and selfish compassion to the hermit of goat island who dwelt so many years in its conspicuous seclusion and was finally carried over the cataract this public character they suspected of design in his death as in his life and they would not be moved by his memory though they gave a sigh to that dream half pathetic half ludicrous yet not ignoble of mordecai noah who thought to assemble all the jews of the world and all the indians as remnants of the lost tribes upon grand island there to rebuild jerusalem and who actually laid the cornerstone of the new temple there  goat island is marvelously wild for a place visited by so many thousands every year the shrubbery and undergrowth remain unravaged and form a deceitful privacy in which even at that early hour of the day they met many other pairs it seemed incredible that the village and the hotels should be so full and that the wilderness should also abound in them yet on every embowered seat and going to and from all points of interest and danger were these newwedded lovers with their interlacing arms and their fond attitudes in which each seemed to support and lean upon the other such a pair stood prominent before them when basil and isabel emerged at last from the cover of the woods at the head of the island and glanced up the broad swift stream to the point where it ran smooth before breaking into the rapids and as a soft pastoral feature in the foreground of that magnificent landscape they found them far from unpleasing some such pair is in the foreground of every famous american landscape and when i think of the amount of public lovemaking in the season of pleasuretravel from mount desert to the yosemite and from the parks of colorado to the keys of florida i feel that our continent is but a larger arcady that the middle of the nineteenth century is the golden age and that we want very little of being a nation of shepherds and shepherdesses  our friends returned by the shore of the canadian rapids having traversed the island by a path through the heart of the woods and now drew slowly near the falls again all parts of the prodigious pageant have an eternal novelty and they beheld the evervarying effect of that constant sublimity with the sense of discoverers or rather of people whose great fortune it is to see the marvel in its beginning and new from the creating hand the morning hour lent its sunny charm to this illusion while in the cavernous precipices of the shores dark with evergreens a mystery as of primeval night seemed to linger there was a wild fluttering of their nerves a rapture with an underconsciousness of pain the exaltation of peril and escape when they came to the three little isles that extend from goat island one beyond another far out into the furious channel three pretty suspensionbridges connect them now with the larger island and under each of these flounders a huge rapid and hurls itself away to mingle with the ruin of the fall the three sisters are mere fragments of wilderness clumps of vinetangled woods planted upon masses of rock but they are part of the fascination of niagara which no one resists nor could isabel have been persuaded from exploring them it wants no courage to do this but merely submission to the local sorcery and the adventurer has no other reward than the consciousness of having been where but a few years before no human being had perhaps set foot she grossed from bridge to bridge with a quaking heart and at last stood upon the outermost isle whence through the screen of vines and boughs she gave fearful glances at the heaving and tossing flood beyond from every wave of which at every instant she rescued herself with a desperate struggle the exertion told heavily upon her strength unawares and she suddenly made basil another revelation of character without the slightest warning she sank down at the root of a tree and said with serious composure that she could never go back on those bridges they were not safe he stared at her cowering form in blank amaze and put his hands in his pockets then it occurred to his dull masculine sense that it must be a joke and he said well ill have you taken off in a boat  o do basil do have me taken off in a boat implored isabel you see yourself the midges are not safe do get a boat  or a balloon he suggested humoring the pleasantry  isabel burst into tears and now he went on his knees at her side and took her hands in his isabel isabel are you crazy he cried as if he meant to go mad himself she moaned and shuddered in reply he said to mend matters that it was a jest about the boat and he was driven to despair when isabel repeated i never can go back by the bridges never  but what do you propose to do  i dont know i dont know  he would try sarcasm do you intend to set up a hermitage here and have your meals sent out from the hotel its a charming spot and visited pretty constantly but its small even for a hermitage  isabel moaned again with her hands still on her eyes and wondered that he was not ashamed to make fun of her  he would try kindness perhaps darling youll let me carry you ashore  no that will bring double the weight on the bridge at once  couldnt you shut your eyes and let me lead you  why it isnt the sight of the rapids she said looking up fiercely the bridges are not safe im not a child basil o what shall we do  i dont know said basil gloomily its an exigency for which i wasnt prepared then he silently gave himself to the evil one for having probably overwrought isabels nerves by repeating that poem about avery and by the ensuing talk about niagara which she had seemed to enjoy so much he asked her if that was it and she answered o no its nothing but the bridges he proved to her that the bridges upon all known principles were perfectly safe and that they could not give way she shook her head but made no answer and he lost his patience  isabel he cried im ashamed of you  dont say anything youll be sorry for afterwards basil she replied with the forbearance of those who have reason and justice on their side  the rapids beat and shouted round their little prisonisle each billow leaping as if possessed by a separate demon the absurd horror of the situation overwhelmed him he dared not attempt to carry her ashore for she might spring from his grasp into the flood he could not leave her to call for help and what if nobody came till she lost her mind from terror or what if somebody should come and find them in that ridiculous affliction  somebody was coming  isabel he shouted in her ear here come those people we saw in the parlor last night  isabel dashed her veil over her face clutched basils with her icy hand rose drew her arm convulsively through his and walked ashore without a word  in a sheltered nook they sat down and she quickly repaired her drooping head and tricked her beams again he could see her tearfully smiling through her veil my dear he said i dont ask an explanation of your fright for i dont suppose you could give it but should you mind telling me why those people were so sovereign against it  why dearest dont you understand that mrs richardwhoever she isis so much like me  she looked at him as if she had made the most satisfying statement and he thought he had better not ask further then but wait in hope that the meaning would come to him they walked on in silence till they came to the biddle stairs at the head of which is a notice that persons have been killed by pieces of rock from the precipice overhanging the shore below and warning people that they descend at their peril isabel declined to visit the cave of the winds to which these stairs lead but was willing to risk the ascent of terrapin tower thanks no said her husband you might find it unsafe to come back the way you went up we cant count certainly upon the appearance of the lady who is so much like you and ive no fancy for spending my life on terrapin tower so he found her a seat and went alone to the top of the audacious little structure standing on the verge of the cataract between the smooth curve of the horseshoe and the sculptured front of the central fall with the stormy sea of the rapids behind and the river dim seen through the mists crawling away between its lofty bluffs before he knew again the awful delight with which so long ago he had watched the changes in the beauty of the canadian fall as it hung a mass of translucent green from the brink and a pearly white seemed to crawl up from the abyss and penetrate all its substance to the very crest and then suddenly vanished from it and perpetually renewed the same effect the mystery of the rising vapors veiled the gulf into which the cataract swooped the sun shone and a rainbow dreamed upon them  near the foot of the tower some loose rocks extend quite to the verge and here basil saw an elderly gentleman skipping from one slippery stone to another and looking down from time to time into the abyss who when he had amused himself long enough in this way clambered up on the plank bridge basil who had descended by this time made bold to say that he thought the diversion an odd one and rather dangerous the gentleman took this in good part and owned it might seem so but added that a distinguished phrenologist had examined his head and told him he had equilibrium so large that he could go anywhere  on your bridal tour i presume he continued as they approached the bench where basil had left isabel she had now the company of a plain middleaged woman whose attire hesitatingly expressed some inward festivity and had a certain reluctant fashionableness well this is my third bridal tour to niagara and my wife s been here once before on the same business we see a good many changes i used to stand on table rock with the others now thats all gone well old lady shall we move on he asked and this bridal pair passed up the path attended haply by the guardian spirits of those who gave the place so many sad yet pleasing associations  at dinner mr richards party sat at the table next basils and they were all now talking cheerfully over the emptiness of the spacious dininghall  well kitty the married lady was saying you can tell the girls what you please about the gayeties of niagara when you get home theyll believe anything sooner than the truth  o yes indeed said kitty ive got a good deal of it made up already ill describe a grand hop at the hotel with fashionable people from all parts of the country and the gentlemen i danced with the most im going to have had quite a flirtation with the gentleman of the long blond mustache whom we met on the bridge this morning and hes got to do duty in accounting for my missing glove itll never do to tell the girls i dropped it from the top of terrapin tower then you know fanny i really can say something about dining with aristocratic southerners waited upon by their black servants  this referred to the sadfaced patrician whom basil and isabel had noted in the cars from buffalo as a southerner probably coming north for the first time since the war he had an air at once fierce and sad and a halfbarbaric homicidal gentility of manner fascinating enough in its way he sat with his wife at a table farther down the room and their child was served in part by a little tancolored nursemaid the fact did not quite answer to the young ladys description of it and get it certainly afforded her a groundwork basil fancied a sort of bewilderment in the southerner and explained it upon the theory that he used to come every year to niagara before the war and was now puzzled to find it so changed  yes he said i cant account for him except as the ghost of southern travel and i cant help feeling a little sorry for him i suppose that almost any evil commends itself by its ruin the wrecks of slavery are fast growing a fungus crop of sentiment and they may yet outflourish the remains of the feudal system in the kind of poetry they produce the impoverished slaveholder is a pathetic figure in spite of all justice and reason the beaten rebel does move us to compassion and it is of no use to think of andersonville in his presence this gentleman and others like him used to be the lords of our summer resorts they spent the money they did not earn like princes they held their heads high they trampled upon the abolitionist in his lair they received the homage of the doughface in his home they came up here from their riceswamps and cottonfields and bullied the whole busy civilization of the north everybody who had merchandise or principles to sell truckled to them and travel amongst us was a triumphal progress now theyre moneyless and subjugated as they call it theres none so poor to do them reverence and its left for me an abolitionist from the cradle to sigh over their fate after all they had noble traits and it was no great wonder they got to despise us seeing what most of us were it seems to me i should like to know our friend i cant help feeling towards him as towards a fallen prince heaven help my craven spirit i wonder how our colored waiter feels towards him i dare say he admires him immensely  there were not above a dozen other people in the room and basil contrasted the scene with that which the same place formerly presented in the old time he said every table was full and we dined to the music of a brass band i cant say i liked the band but i miss it i wonder if our southern friend misses it they gave us a very small allowance of brass band when we arrived isabel upon my word i wonder whats come over the place he said as the southern party rising from the table walked out of the diningroom attended by many treacherous echoes in spite of an ostentatious clatter of dishes that the waiters made  after dinner they drove on the canada shore up past the clifton house towards the burning spring which is not the least wonder of niagara as each bubble breaks upon the troubled surface and yields its flash of infernal flame and its whiff of sulphurous stench it seems hardly strange that the neutral nation should have revered the cataract as a demon and another subtle spell not to be broken even by the businesslike composure of the man who shows off the hellbroth is added to those successive sorceries by which niagara gradually changes from a thing of beauty to a thing of terror by all odds too the most tremendous view of the falls is afforded by the point on the drive whence you look down upon the horseshoe and behold its three massive walls of sea rounding and sweeping into the gulf together the color gone and the smooth brink showing black and ridgy  would they not go to the battlefield of lundys lane asked the driver at a certain point on their return but isabel did not care for battlefields and basil preferred to keep intact the reminiscence of his former visit they have a sort of tower of observation built on the battleground he said as they drove on down by the river and it was in charge of an old canadian militiaman who had helped his countrymen to be beaten in the fight this hero gave me a simple and unintelligible account of the battle asking me first if i had ever heard of general scott and adding without flinching that here he got his earliest laurels he seemed to go just so long to every listener and nothing could stop him short so i fell into a revery until he came to an end it was hard to remember that sweet summer morning when the sun shone and the birds sang and the music of a piano and a girls voice rose from a bowery cottage near that all the pure air had once been tainted with battlesmoke that the peaceful fields had been planted with cannon instead of potatoes and corn and that where the cows came down the farmers lane with tinkling bells the shock of armed men had befallen the blue and tranquil ontario gleamed far away and far away rolled the beautiful land with farmhouses fields and woods and at the foot of the tower lay the pretty village the battle of the past seemed only a vagary of mine yet how could i doubt the warrior at my elbowgrieved though i was to find that a habit of strong drink had the better of his utterance that morning my driver explained afterwards that persons visiting the field were commonly so much pleased with the captains eloquence that they kept the noble old soldier in a brandy andwater rapture throughout the season thereby greatly refreshing his memory and making the battle bloodier and bloodier as the season advanced and the number of visitors increased there my dear he suddenly broke off as they came in sight of a slender stream of water that escaped from the brow of a cliff on the american side below the falls and spun itself into a gauze of silvery mist thats the bridal veil and i suppose you think the stream which is making such a fine display yonder is some idle brooklet ending a long course of error and worthlessness by that spectacular plunge its nothing of the kind its an honest hydraulio canal of the most straightforward character a poor but respectable millrace which has devoted itself strictly to business and has turned millwheels instead of fooling round waterlilies it can afford that ultimate finery what you behold in the bridal veil my love is the apotheosis of industry  what i cant help thinking of said isabel who had not paid the smallest attention to the bridal veil or anything about it is the awfulness of stepping off these places in the nighttime she referred to the road which next the precipice is unguarded by any sort of parapet in europe a strong wall would secure it but we manage things differently on our continent and carriages go running over the brink from time to time  if your thoughts have that direction answered her husband we had better go back to the hotel and leave the whirlpool for tomorrow morning its late for it today at any rate he had treated isabel since the adventure on the three sisters with a superiority which he felt himself to be very odious but which he could not disuse  im not afraid she sighed but in the words of the retreating soldier iim awfully demoralized and added you know we must reserve some of the vital forces for shopping this evening     part of their business also was to buy the tickets for their return to  boston by way of montreal and quebec and it was part of their pleasure to get these of the heartiest imaginable ticketagent he was a colonel or at least a major and he made a polite feint of calling basil by some military title he commended the trip they were about to make as the most magnificent and beautiful on the whole continent and he commended them for intending to make it he said that was mrs general bowdur of philadelphia who just went out did they know her somehow the titles affected basil as of older date than the late war and as belonging to the militia period and he imagined for the agent the romance of a life spent at a wateringplace in contact with rich moneyspending pleasuretaking people who formed his whole jovial world the colonel who included them in this world and thereby brevetted them rich and fashionable could not secure a stateroom for them on the boata perfectly splendid lake steamer which would take them down the rapids of the st lawrence and on to montreal without changebut he would give them a letter to the captain who was a very particular friend of his and would be happy to show them as his friends every attention and so he wrote a note ascribing peculiar merits to basil and in spite of all reason making him feel for the moment that he was privileged by a document which was no doubt part of every such transaction he spoke in a loud cheerful voice he laughed jollily at no apparent joke he bowed very low and said goodevening at parting and they went away as if he had blessed them  the rest of the evening they spent in wandering through the village charmed with its bizarre mixture of quaintness and commonplaceness in hanging about the shopwindows with their monotonous variety of feather fanseach with a violently red or yellow bird painfully sacrificed in its centremoccasons beadwrought workbags tobaccopouches bows and arrows and whatever else the savage art of the neighboring squaws can invent in sauntering through these gay booths pricing many things and in hanging long and undecidedly over cases full of feldspar crosses quartz bracelets and necklaces and every manner of vase inoperative pitcher and other vessel that can be fashioned out of the geological formations at niagara tormented meantime by the heat of the gaslights and the persistence of the mosquitoes there were very few people besides themselves in the shops and isabels purchases were not lavish her husband had made up his mind to get her some little keepsake and when he had taken her to the hotel he ran back to one of the shops and hastily bought her a feather fana magnificent thing of deep magenta dye shading into blue with a whole yellowbird transfixed in the centre when he triumphantly displayed it in their room whos that for basil demanded his wife the cook but seeing his ghastly look at this she fell upon his neck crying o you poor old tasteless darling youve got it for me and seemed about to die of laughter  didnt you start and throw up your hands he stammered when you came to that case of fans  yesin horror did you think i liked the cruel things with their dead birds and their hideous colors o basil dearest you are incorrigible cant you learn that magenta is the vilest of all the hues that the perverseness of man has invented in defiance of nature now my love just promise me one thing she said pathetically were going to do a little shopping in montreal you know and perhaps youll be wanting to surprise me with something there dont do it or if you must do tell me all about it beforehand and what the color of its to be and i can say whether to get it or not and then therell be some taste about it and i shall be truly surprised and pleased  she turned to put the fan into her trunk and he murmured something about exchanging it no she said well keep it as aamonument and she deposed him with another peal of laughter from the proud height to which he had climbed in pity of her nervous fears of the day so completely were their places changed that he doubted if it were not he who had made that scene on the third sister and when isabel said o why wont men use their reasoning faculties he could not for himself have claimed any and he could not urge the truth that he had bought the fan more for its barbaric brightness than for its beauty she would not let him get angry and he could say nothing against the halfironical petting with which she soothed his mortification  but all troubles passed with the night and the next morning they spent a charming hour about prospect point and in sauntering over goat island somewhat daintily tasting the flavors of the place on whose wonders they had so hungrily and indiscriminately feasted at first they had already the feeling of veteran visitors and they loftily marveled at the greed with which newercomers plunged at the sensations they could not conceive why people should want to descend the inclined railway to the foot of the american fall they smiled at the idea of going up terrapin tower they derided the vulgar daring of those who went out upon the three weird sisters for some whom they saw about to go down the biddle stairs to the cave of the winds they had no words to express their contempt  then they made their excursion to the whirlpool mistakenly going down on the american side for it is much better seen from the other though seen from any point it is the most impressive feature of the whole prodigious spectacle of niagara  here within the compass of a mile those inland seas of the north superior huron michigan erie and the multitude of smaller lakes all pour their floods where they swirl in dreadful vortices with resistless undercurrents boiling beneath the surface of that mighty eddy abruptly from this scene of secret power so different from the thunderous splendors of the cataract itself rise lofty cliffs on every side to a height of two hundred feet clothed from the waters edge almost to their create with dark cedars noiselessly so far as your senses perceive the lakes steal out of the whirlpool then drunk and wild with brawling rapids roar away to ontario through the narrow channel of the river awful as the scene is you stand so far above it that you do not know the half of its terribleness for those waters that look so smooth are great ridges and rings forced by the impulse of the currents twelve feet higher in the centre than at the margin nothing can live there and with what is caught in its hold the maelstrom plays for days and whirls and tosses round and round in its toils with a sad maniacal patience the guides tell ghastly stories which even their telling does not wholly rob of ghastliness about the bodies of drowned men carried into the whirlpool and made to enact upon its dizzy surges a travesty of life apparently floating there at their pleasure diving and frolicking amid the waves or frantically struggling to escape from the death that has long since befallen them  on the american side not far below the railway suspension bridge is an elevator more than a hundred and eighty feet high which is meant to let people down to the shore below and to give a view of the rapids on their own level from the cliff opposite it looks a terribly frail structure of pine sticks but is doubtless stronger than it looks and at any rate as it has never yet fallen to pieces it may be pronounced perfectly safe  in the waitingroom at the top basil and isabel found mr richard and his ladies again who got into the movable chamber with them and they all silently descended together it was not a time for talk of any kind either when they were slowly and not quite smoothly dropping through the lugubrious upper part of the structure where it was darkened by a rough weatherboarding or lower down where the unobstructed light showed the grim tearful face of the cliff bedrabbled with oozy springs and the audacious slightness of the elevator  an abiding distrust of the machinery overhead mingled in isabels heart with a doubt of the value of the scene below and she could not look forward to escape from her present perils by the conveyance which had brought her into them with any satisfaction she wanly smiled and shrank closer to basil while the other matron made nothing of seizing her husband violently by the arm and imploring him to stop it whenever they experienced a rougher jolt than usual  at the bottom of the cliff they were helped out of their prison by a humid young englishman with much clay on him whose face was red and bathed in perspiration for it was very hot down there in his little inclosure of baking pine boards and it was not much cooler out on the rocks upon which the party issued descending and descending by repeated and desultory flights of steps till at last they stood upon a huge fragment of stone right abreast of the rapids yet it was a magnificent sight and for a moment none of them were sorry to have come the surges did not look like the gigantic ripples on a rivers course as they were but like a procession of ocean billows they arose far aloft in vast bulks of clear green and broke heavily into foam at the crest great blocks and shapeless fragments of rock strewed the margin of the awful torrent gloomy walls of dark stone rose naked from these bearded here and there with cedar and everywhere frowning with shaggy brows of evergreen the place is inexpressibly lonely and dreadful and one feels like an alien presence there or as if he had intruded upon some mood or haunt of nature in which she had a right to be forever alone the slight impudent structure of the elevator rises through the solitude like a thing that merits ruin yet it is better than something more elaborate for it looks temporary and since there must be an elevator it is well to have it of the most transitory aspect some such quality of rude impermanence consoles you for the presence of most improvements by which you enjoy niagara the suspension bridges for their part being saved from offensiveness by their beauty and unreality  ascending none of the party spoke isabel and the other matron blanched in each others faces their husbands maintained a stolid resignation when they stepped out of their trap into the waiting room at the top what i like about these little adventures said mr richard to basil abruptly is getting safely out of them goodmorning sir he bowed slightly to isabel who returned his politeness and exchanged faint nods or glances with the ladies they got into their separate carriages and at that safe distance made each other more decided obeisances  well observed basil i suppose were introduced now we shall be meeting them from time to time throughout our journey you know how the same faces and the same trunks used to keep turning up in our travels on the other side once meet people in travelling and you cant get rid of them  yes said isabel as if continuing his train of thought im glad were going today  o dearest  truly when we first arrived i felt only the loveliness of the place it seemed more familiar too then but ever since its been growing stranger and dreadfuller somehow its begun to pervade me and possess me in a very uncomfortable way im tossed upon rapids and flung from cataract brinks and dizzied in whirlpools im no longer yours basil im most unhappily married to niagara fly with me save me from my awful lord  she lightly burlesqued the woes of a prima donna with clasped hands and uplifted eyes  thatll do very well basil commented and it implies a reality that cant be quite definitely spoken we come to niagara in the patronizing spirit in which we approach everything nowadays and for a few hours we have it our own way and pay our little tributes of admiration with as much complacency as we feel in acknowledging the existence of the supreme being but after a while we are aware of some potent influence undermining our selfsatisfaction we begin to conjecture that the great cataract does not exist by virtue of our approval and to feel that it will not cease when we go away the second day makes us its abject slaves and on the third we want to fly from it in terror i believe some people stay for weeks however and hordes of them have written odes to niagara  i cant understand it at all said isabel i dont wonder now that the town should be so empty this season but that it should ever be full i wish wed gone after our first look at the falls from the suspension bridge how beautiful that was i rejoice in everything that i havent done im so glad i havent been in the cave of the winds im so happy that table rock fell twenty years ago basil i couldnt stand another rainbow today im sorry we went out on the three weird sisters o i shall dream about it and the rush and the whirl and the dampness in ones face and the everlasting chirrrrr of everything  she dipped suddenly upon his shoulder for a moments oblivion and then rose radiant with a question why in the world if niagara is really what it seems to us now do so many bridal parties come here  perhaps theyre the only people whove the strength to bear up against it and are not easily dispersed and subjected by it  but were dispersed and subjected  ah my dear we married a little late who knows how it would be if you were nineteen instead of twentyseven and i twentyfive and not turned of thirty  basil youre very cruel  no no but dont you see how it is weve known too much of life to desire any gloomy background for our happiness were quite contented to have things gay and bright about us once we couldnt have made the circle dark enough well my dear thats the effect of age were superannuated  i used to think i was before we were married answered isabel simply but now she added triumphantly im rescued from all that i shall never be old again dearest never as long as you love me  they were about to enter the village and he could not make any open acknowledgment of her tenderness but her silken mantle or whatever slipped from her shoulder and he embracingly replaced it flattering himself that he had delicately seized this chance of an unavowed caress and not allowing o such is the blindness of our sex that the opportunity had been yet more subtly afforded him with the art which women never disuse in this world and which i hope they will not forget in the next  they had an early dinner and looked their last upon the nuptial gayety of the otherwise forlorn hotel three brides sat down with them in travellingdress two occupied the parlor as they passed out half a dozen happy pairs arrived to the music of the band in the omnibus that was to carry our friends back to the station they caught sight of several about the shop windows as that drove through the streets thus the place perpetually renews itself in the glow of love as long as the summer lasts the moon which is elsewhere so often of wormwood or of the ordinary green cheese at the best is of lucent honey there from the first of june to the last of october and this is a great charm in niagara i think with tenderness of all the lives that have opened so fairly there the hopes that have reigned in the glad young hearts the measureless tide of joy that ebbs and flows with the arriving and departing trains elsewhere there are carking cares of business and of fashion there are age and sorrow and heartbreak but here only youth faith rapture i kiss my hand to niagara for that reason and would i were a poet for a quarter of an hour  isabel departed in almost a forgiving mood towards the weak sisterhood of evident brides and both our friends felt a lurking fondness for niagara at the last moment i do not know how much of their content was due to the fact that they had suffered no sort of wrong there from those who are apt to prey upon travellers in the hotel a placard warned them to have nothing to do with the miscreant hackmen on the streets but always to order their carriage at the office on the street the hackmen whispered to them not to trust the exorbitant drivers in league with the landlords yet their actual experience was great reasonableness and facile contentment with the sum agreed upon  this may have been because the hackmen so far outnumbered the visitors that the latter could dictate terms but they chose to believe it a triumph of civilization and i will never be the cynic to sneer at their faith only at the station was the virtue of the niagarans put in doubt by the hotel porter who professed to find basils trunk enfeebled by travel and advised a strap for it which a friend of his would sell for a dollar and a half yet even he may have been a benevolent nature unjustly suspected     down the st lawrence  they were to take the canadian steamer at charlotte the port of rochester and they rattled uneventfully down from niagara by rail at the broad lowbanked rivermouth the steamer lay beside the railroad station and while isabel disposed of herself on board basil looked to the transfer of the baggage novelly comforted in the business by the respectfulness of the young canadian who took charge of the trunks for the boat he was slow and his system was not goodhe did not give checks for the pieces but marked them with the name of their destination and there was that indefinable something in his manner which hinted his hope that you would remember the porter but he was so civil that he did not snub the meekest and most vexatious of the passengers and basil mutely blessed his servile soul few white americans he said to himself would behave so decently in his place and he could not conceive of the american steamboat clerk who would use the politeness towards a waiting crowd that the canadian purser showed when they all wedged themselves in about his window to receive their stateroom keys he was somewhat awkward like the porter but he was patient and he did not lose his temper even when some of the crowd finding he would not bully them made bold to bully him he was three times as long in serving them as an american would have been but their time was of no value there and he served them well basil made a point of speaking him fair when his turn came and the purser did not trample on him for a base truckler as an american jackinoffice would have done  our tourists felt at home directly on this steamer which was very comfortable and in every way sufficient for its purpose with a visible captain who answered two or three questions very pleasantly and bore himself towards his passengers in some sort like a host  in the saloon isabel had found among the passengers her semiacquaintances of the hotel parlor and the rapidselevator and had glanced tentatively towards them whereupon the matron of the party had made advances that ended in their all sitting down together and wondering when the boat would start and what time they would get to montreal next evening with other matters that strangers going upon the same journey may properly marvel over in company the introduction having thus accomplished itself they exchanged addresses and it appeared that richard was colonel ellison of milwaukee and that fanny was his wife miss kitty ellison was of western new york not far from erie there was a diversion presently towards the different staterooms but the new acquaintances sat visavis at the table and after supper the ladies drew their chairs together on the promenade deck and enjoyed the fresh evening breeze the sun set magnificent upon the low western shore which they had now left an hour away and a broad stripe of color stretched behind the steamer a few thin luminous clouds darkened momently along the horizon and then mixed with the land the stars came out in a clear sky and a light wind softly buffeted the cheeks and breathed life into nerves that the days heat had wasted it scarcely wrinkled the tranquil expanse of the lake on which loomed far or near a fullsailed schooner and presently melted into the twilight and left the steamer solitary upon the waters the company was small and not remarkable enough in any way to take the thoughts of any one off his own comfort a deep sense of the coziness of the situation possessed them all which was if possible intensified by the spectacle of the captain seated on the upper deck and smoking a cigar that flashed and fainted like a stationary firefly in the gathering dusk how very distant in this mood were the most recent events niagara seemed a fable of antiquity the ride from rochester a myth of the middle ages in this pool happy world of quiet lake of starry skies of air that the soul itself seemed to breathe there was such consciousness of repose as if one were steeped in rest and soaked through and through with calm  the points of likeness between isabel and mrs ellison shortly made them mutually uninteresting and leaving her husband to the others isabel frankly sought the companionship of miss kitty in whom she found a charm of manner which puzzled at first but which she presently fancied must be perfect trust of others mingling with a peculiar selfreliance  cant you see basil what a very flattering way it is she asked of her husband when after parting with their friends for the night she tried to explain the character to him of course no art could equal such a natural gift for that kind of belief in your goodnature and sympathy makes you feel worthy of it dont you know and so you cant help being goodnatured and sympathetic this miss ellison why i can tell you i shouldnt be ashamed of her anywhere by anywhere isabel meant boston and she went on to praise the young ladys intelligence and refinement with those expressions of surprise at the existence of civilization in a westerner which westerners find it so hard to receive graciously happily miss ellison had not to hear them the reason she happened to come with only two dresses is she lives so near niagara that she could come for one day and go back the next the colonels her cousin and he and his wife go east every year and they asked her this time to see niagara with them she told me all over again what we eavesdropped so shamefully in the hotel parlorand i dont know whether she was better pleased with the prospect of whats before her or with the notion of making the journey in this original way she didnt force her confidence upon me any more than she tried to withhold it we got to talking in the most natural manner and she seemed to tell these things about herself because they amused her and she liked me i had been saying how my trunk got left behind once on the french side of mont cenis and i had to wear aunts things at turin till it could be sent for  well i dont see but miss ellison could describe you to her friends very much as youve described her to me said basil how did these mutual confidences begin whose trustfulness first flattered the others what else did you tell about yourself  i said we were on our wedding journey guiltily admitted isabel  o you did  why dearest i wanted to know for once you see whether we seemed honeymoonstruck  and do we  no came the answer somewhat ruefully perhaps basil she added weve been a little too successful in disguising our bridal character do you know she continued looking him anxiously in the face this miss ellison took me at first foryour sister  basil broke forth in outrageous laughter one more such victory he said and we are undone and he laughed again immoderately how sad is the fruition of human wishes there s nothing after all like a good thorough failure for making people happy  isabel did not listen to him safe in a dim corner of the deserted saloon she seized him in a vindictive embrace then as if it had been he who suggested the idea of such a loathsome relation hissed out the hated words your sister and released him with a disdainful repulse  a little after daybreak the steamer stopped at the canadian city of kingston a handsome place substantial to the waters edge and giving a sense of english solidity by the stone of which it is largely built there was an accession of many passengers here and they and the people on the wharf were as little like americans as possible they were english or irish or scotch with the healthful bloom of the old world still upon their faces or if canadians they looked not less hearty so that one must wonder if the line between the dominion and the united states did not also sharply separate good digestion and dyspepsia these provincials had not our regularity of features nor the best of them our careworn sensibility of expression but neither had they our complexions of adobe and even isabel was forced to allow that the men were on the whole better dressed than the same number of average americans would have been in a city of that size and remoteness the stevedores who were putting the freight aboard were men of leisure they joked in a kindly way with the orangewomen and the old women picking up chips on the pier and our land of hurry seemed beyond the ocean rather than beyond the lake  kingston has romantic memories of being fort frontenac two hundred years ago of count frontenacs splendid advent among the indians of the brave la salle who turned its wooden walls to stone of wars with the savages and then with the new york colonists whom the french and their allies harried from this point of the destruction of la salles fort in the old french war and of final surrender a few years later to the english it is as picturesque as it is historical all about the city the shores are beautifully wooded and there are many lovely islandsthe first indeed of those thousand islands with which the head of the st lawrence is filled and among which the steamer was presently threading her way they are still as charming and still almost as wild as when in 1673 frontenacs flotilla of canoes passed through their labyrinth and issued upon the lake save for a lighthouse upon one of them there is almost nothing to show that the foot of man has ever pressed the thin grass clinging to their rocky surfaces and keeping its green in the eternal shadow of their pines and cedars in the warm morning light they gathered or dispersed before the advancing vessel which some of them almost touched with the plumage of their evergreens and where none of them were large some were so small that it would not have been too bold to figure them as a vaster race of waterbirds assembling and separating in her course it is curiously affecting to find them so unclaimed yet from the solitude of the vanished wilderness and scarcely touched even by tradition but for the interest left them by the french these tiny islands have scarcely any associations and must be enjoyed for their beauty alone there is indeed about them a faint light of legend concerning the canadian rebellion of 1837 for several patriots are said to have taken refuge amidst their lovely multitude but this episode of modern history is difficult for the imagination to manage and somehow one does not take sentimentally even to that daughter of a lurking patriot who long baffled her fathers pursuers by rowing him from one island to another and supplying him with food by night  either the reluctance is from the natural desire that so recent a heroine should be founded on fact or it is mere perverseness perhaps i ought to say in justice to her that it was one of her own sex who refused to be interested in her and forbade basil to care for her when he had read of her exploit from the guidebook isabel asked him if he had noticed that handsome girl in the blue and white striped garibaldi and swiss hat who had come aboard at kingston she pointed her out and courageously made him admire her beauty which was of the most bewitching canadian type the young girl was redeemed by her new world birth from the english heaviness a more delicate bloom lighted her cheeks a softer grace dwelt in her movement yet she was round and full and she was in the perfect flower of youth she was not so ethereal in her loveliness as an american girl but she was not so nervous and had none of the painful fragility of the latter her expression was just a little vacant it must be owned but so far as she went she was faultless she looked like the most tractable of daughters and as if she would be the most obedient of wives she had a blameless taste in dress isabel declared her costume of blue and white striped garibaldi and swiss hat set upon heavy masses of dark brown hair being completed by a black silk skirt and you can see she added that its an old skirt made over and that shes dressed as cheaply as she is prettily this surprised basil who had imputed the young ladys personal sumptuousness to her dress and had thought it enormously rich when she got off with her chaperone at one of the poorestlooking country landings she left them in hopeless conjecture about her was she visiting there or was the interior of canada full of such stylish and exquisite creatures where did she get her taste her fashions her manners as she passed from sight towards the shadow of the woods they felt the poorer for her going yet they were glad to have seen her and on second thoughts they felt that they could not justly ask more of her than to have merely existed for a few hours in their presence they perceived that beauty was not only its own excuse for being but that it flattered and favored and profited the world by consenting to be  at prescott the boat on which they had come from charlotte and on which they had been promised a passage without change to montreal stopped and they were transferred to a smaller steamer with the uncomfortable name of banshee she was very old and very infirm and dirty and in every way bore out the character of a squalid irish goblin besides she was already heavily laden with passengers and with the addition of the other steamers people had now double her complement and our friends doubted if they were not to pass the rapids in as much danger as discomfort their fellowpassengers were in great variety however and thus partly atoned for their numbers among them of course there was a full force of brides from niagara and elsewhere and some curious forms of the prevailing infatuation appeared it is well enough if she likes and it may even be very noble for a passably goodlooking young lady to marry a gentleman of venerable age but to intensify the idea of selfdevotion by furtively caressing his wrinkled front seems too reproachful of the general public while on the other hand if the bride is very young and pretty it enlists in behalf of the whitehaired husband the unwilling sympathies of the spectator to see her the centre of a group of young people and him only acknowledged from time to time by a parthian snub nothing however could have been more satisfactory than the sisterly surrounding of this latter bride they were of a better class of irish people and if it had been any sacrifice for her to marry so old a man they were doing their best to give the affair at least the liveliness of a wake there were five or six of those great handsome girls with their generous curves and wholesome colors and they were every one attended by a goodlooking colonial lover with whom they joked in slightly brogued voices and laughed with careless celtic laughter one of the young fellows presently lost his hat overboard and had to wear the handkerchief of his lady about his head and this appeared to be really one of the best things in the world and led to endless banter they were well dressed and it could be imagined that the ancient bridegroom had come in for the support of the whole goodlooking healthy lighthearted family in some degree he looked it and wore but a rueful countenance for a bridegroom so that a very young newly married couple who sat next the jolly sisterandloverhood could not keep their pitying eyes off his downcast face what if he too were young at heart the kind little wifes regard seemed to say  for the sake of the slight air that was stirring and to have the best view of the rapids the banshees whole company was gathered upon the forward promenade and the throng was almost as dense as in a sixoclock horsecar out from boston the standing and sitting groups were closely packed together and the expanded parasols and umbrellas formed a nearly unbroken roof under this isabel chatted at intervals with the ellisons who sat near but it was not an atmosphere that provoked social feeling and she was secretly glad when after a while they shifted their position  it was deadly hot and most of the people saddened and silenced in the heat from time to time the clouds idling about overhead met and sprinkled down a cruel little shower of rain that seemed to make the air less breathable than before the lonely shores were yellow with drought the islands grew wilder and barrener the course of the river was for miles at a stretch through country which gave no signs of human life the st lawrence has none of the bold picturesqueness of the hudson and is far more like its faroff cousin the mississippi its banks are low like the mississippis its current swift its way through solitary lands the same sentiment of early adventure hangs about each both are haunted by visions of the jesuit in his priestly robe and the soldier in his mediaeval steel the same gay devout and dauntless race has touched them both with immortal romance if the water were of a dusky golden color instead of translucent green and the shores and islands were covered with cottonwoods and willows instead of dark cedars one could with no great effort believe ones self on the mississippi between cairo and st louis so much do the great rivers strike one as kindred in the chief features of their landscape only in tracing this resemblance you do not know just what to do with the purple mountains of vermont seen vague against the horizon from the st lawrence or with the quaint little french villages that begin to show themselves as you penetrate farther down into lower canada these look so peaceful with their dormerwindowed cottages clustering about their churchspires that it seems impossible they could once have been the homes of the savages and the cruel peasants who with firebrand and scalpingknife and tomahawk harassed the borders of new england for a hundred years but just after you descend the long sault you pass the hamlet of st regis in which was kindled the torch that wrapt deerfield in flames waking her people from their sleep to meet instant death or taste the bitterness of a captivity the bell which was sent out from france for the indian converts of the jesuits and was captured by an english ship and carried into salem and thence sold to deerfield where it called the puritans to prayer till at last it also summoned the priestled indians and habitans across hundreds of miles of winter and of wilderness to reclaim it from that desecrationthis fateful bell still hangs in the churchtower of st regis and has invited to matins and vespers for nearly two centuries the children of those who fought so pitilessly and dared and endured so much for it our friends would fair have heard it as they passed hoping for some mournful note of history in its sound but it hung silent over the silent hamlet which as it lay in the hot afternoon sun by the rivers side seemed as lifeless as the deerfield burnt long ago  they turned from it to look at a gentleman who had just appeared in a mustardcolored linen duster and basil asked shouldnt you like to know the origin personal history and secret feelings of a gentleman who goes about in a duster of that particular tint or that gentleman yonder with his eye tied up in a wet handkerchief do you suppose hes travelling for pleasure look at those young people from omaha they havent ceased flirting or cackling since we left kingston do you think everybody has such spirits out at omaha but behold a yet more surprising figure than any we have yet seen among this boatload of nondescripts  this was a tall handsome young man with a face of somewhat foreign cast and well dressed with a certain impressive difference from the rest in the cut of his clothes but what most drew the eye to him was a large cross set with brilliants and surmounted by a heavy doubleheaded eagle in gold this ornament dazzled from a conspicuous place on the left lappet of his coat on his hand shone a magnificent diamond ring and he bore a stately operaglass with which from time to time he imperiously as one may say surveyed the landscape as the imposing apparition grew upon isabel o here she thought is something truly distinguished of course dear she added aloud to basil hes some foreign nobleman travelling here and she ran over in her mind the newspaper announcements of patrician visitors from abroad and tried to identify him with some one of them the cross must be the decoration of a foreign order and basil suggested that he was perhaps a member of some legation at washington who had ran up there for his summer vacation the cross puzzled him but the doubleheaded eagle he said meant either austria or russia probably austria for the wearer looked a trifle too civilized for a russian  yes indeed what an air he has never tell me basil that theres nothing in blood cried isabel who was a bitter aristocrat at heart like all her sex though in principle she was democratic enough as she spoke the object of her regard looked about him on the different groups not with pride not with hauteur but with a glance of unconscious unmistakable superiority o that stare she added nothing but high birth and long descent can give it dearest hes becoming a great affliction to me i want to know who he is couldnt you invent some pretext for speaking to him  no i couldnt do it decently and no doubt hed snub me as i deserved if i intruded upon him lets wait for fortune to reveal him  well i suppose i must but its dreadful its really dreadful you can easily see thats distinction she continued as her hero moved about the promenade and gently but loftily made a way for himself among the other passengers and favored the scenery through his operaglass from one point and another he spoke to no one and she reasonably supposed that he did not know english  in the mean time it was drawing near the hour of dinner but no dinner appeared twelve one two came and went and then at last came the dinner which had been delayed it seemed till the cook could recruit his energies sufficiently to meet the wants of double the number he had expected to provide for it was observable of the officers and crew of the banshee that while they did not hold themselves aloof from the passengers in the disdainful american manner they were of feeble mind and not only did everything very slowly in the usual canadian fashion but with an inefficiency that among us would have justified them in being insolent the people sat down at several successive tables to the worst dinner that ever was cooked the ladies first and the gentlemen afterwards as they made conquest of places at the second table to basils great satisfaction he found a seat and on his right hand the distinguished foreigner  naturally i was somewhat abashed he said in the account he was presently called to give isabel of the interview but i remembered that i was an american citizen and tried to maintain a decent composure for several minutes we sat silent behind a dish of flabby cucumbers expecting the dinner and i was wondering whether i should address him in french or germanfor i knew youd never forgive me if i let slip such a chancewhen he turned and spoke himself  o what did he say dearest  he said pretty tejious waitin aint it in she best new york state accent  you dont mean it gasped isabel  but i do after that i took courage to ask what his cross and doubleheaded eagle meant he showed the condescension of a true nobleman o says he i m glad you like it and it s not the least offense to ask and he told me can you imagine what it is it s the emblem of the fiftyfourth degree in the secret society he belongs to  i dont believe it  well ask him yourself then returned basil he s a very good fellow o that stare nothing but high birth and long descent could give it he repeated abominably implying that he had himself had no share in their common error  what retort isabel might have made cannot now be known for she was arrested at this moment by a rumor amongst the passengers that they were coming to the long sault rapids looking forward she saw the tossing and flashing of surges that to the eye are certainly as threatening as the rapids above niagara the steamer had already passed the deplau and the galopes and they had thus had a foretaste of whatever pleasure or terror there is in the descent of these nine miles of stormy sea it is purely a matter of taste about shooting the rapids of the st lawrence the passengers like it better than the captain and the pilot to guesses by their looks and the women and children like it better than the men it is no doubt very thrilling and picturesque and wildly beautiful the children crow and laugh the women shout forth their delight as the boat enters the seething current great foaming waves strike her bows and brawl away to the stern while she dips and rolls and shoots onward light as a bird blown by the wind the wild shores and islands whirl out of sight you feel in every fibre the career of the vessel but the captain sits in front of the pilothouse smoking with a grave face the pilots tug hard at the wheel the hoarse roar of the waters fills the air beneath the smoother sweeps of the current you can see the brown rocks as you sink from ledge to ledge in the writhing and twisting steamer you have a vague sense that all this is perhaps an achievement rather than an enjoyment when descending the long sault you look back up hill and behold those billows leaping down the steep slope after you no doubt you confide to your soul it is magnificent but it is not pleasure you greet with silent satisfaction the level river stretching between the long sault and the coteau and you admire the delightful tranquillity of that beautiful lake st francis into which it expands then the boat shudders into the coteau rapids and down through the cedars and cascades on the rocks of the last lies the skeleton of a steamer wrecked upon them and gnawed at still by the whitetusked wolfish rapids no one they say was lost from her but how basil thought would it fare with all these people packed here upon her bow if the banshee should swing round upon a ledge as to isabel she looked upon the wrecked steamer with indifference as did all the women but then they could not swim and would not have to save themselves the la chines to come yet they exulted and that s the awfullest of all  they passed the lake st louis the la chin rapids flashed into sight the captain rose up from his seat took his pipe from his mouth and waved a silence with it ladies and gentlemen said he its very important in passing these rapids to keep the boat perfectly trim please to remain just as you are  it was twilight for the boat was late from the indian village on the shore they signaled to know if he wanted the local pilot the captain refused and then the steamer plunged into the leaping waves from rock to rock she swerved and sank on the last ledge she scraped with a deadly touch that went to the heart  then the danger was passed and the noble city of montreal was in full sight lying at the foot of her dark green mountain and lifting her many spires into the rosy twilight air massive and grand showed the sister towers of the french cathedral  basil had hoped to approach this famous city with just associations he had meant to conjure up for isabels sake some reflex however faint of that beautiful picture mr parkman has painted of maisonneuve founding and consecrating montreal he flushed with the recollection of the historians phrase but in that moment there came forth from the cabin a pretty young person who gave every token of being a pretty young actress even to the duennalike elderly female companion to be detected in the remote background of every young actress she had flirted audaciously during the day with some young englishmen and canadians of her acquaintance and after passing the la chine rapids she had taken the hearts of all the men by springing suddenly to her feet apostrophizing the tumult with a charming attitude and warbling a delicious bit of song now as they drew near the city the victoria bridge stretched its long tube athwart the river and looked so low because of its great length that it seemed to bar the steamers passage  i wonder said one of the actresss adorers a canadian whose face was exactly that of the beaver on the escutcheon of his native province and whose heavy gallantries she had constantly received with a gay impertinent nonchalancei wonder if we can be going right under that bridge  no sir answered the pretty young actress with shocking promptness were going right over it           three groans and a guggle           and an awful struggle           and over we go  at this witless sweet impudence the canadian looked very sheepishfor a beaver and all the other people laughed but the noble historical shades of basils thought vanished in wounded dignity beyond recall and left him feeling rather ashamedfor he had laughed too     the sentiment of montreal  the feeling of foreign travel for which our tourists had striven throughout their journey and which they had known in some degree at kingston and all the way down the river was intensified from the first moment in montreal and it was so welcome that they were almost glad to lose money on their greenbacks which the conductor of the omnibus would take only at a discount of twenty cents at breakfast next morning they could hardly tell on what country they had fallen the waiters had but a thin varnish of english speech upon their native french and they spoke their own tongue with each other but most of the meats were cooked to the english taste and the whole was a poor imitation of an american hotel during their stay the same commingling of usages and races bewildered them the shops were english and the clerks were commonly french the carriagedrivers were often irish and up and down the streets with their pious oldfashioned names tinkled american horsecars everywhere were churches and convents that recalled the ecclesiastical and feudal origin of the city the great tubular bridge the superb waterfront with its long array of docks only surpassed by those of liverpool the solid blocks of business houses and the substantial mansions on the quieter streets proclaimed the succession of protestant thrift and energy  our friends cared far less for the modern splendor of montreal than for the remnants of its past and for the features that identified it with another faith and another people than their own isabel would almost have confessed to any one of the blackrobed priests upon the street basil could easily have gone down upon his knees to the whitehooded palefaced nuns gliding among the crowd it was rapture to take a carriage and drive not to the cemetery not to the public library not to the rooms of the young mens christian association or the grain elevators or the new park just tricked out with rockwork and sprigs of evergreennot to any of the charming resorts of our own cities but as in europe to the churches the churches of a pitiless superstition the churches with their atrocious pictures and statues their lingering smell of the mornings incense their confessionals their feetaking sacristans their worshippers dropped here and there upon their knees about the aisles and saying their prayers with shut or wandering eyes according as they were old women or young i do not defend the feeble sentimentalitycall it wickedness if you likebut i understand it and i forgive it from my soul  they went first of course to the french cathedral pausing on their way to alight and walk through the bonsecours market where the habitans have all come in their carts with their various stores of poultry fruit and vegetables and where every cart is a study here is a simplefaced young peasantcouple with butter and eggs and chickens ravishingly displayed here is a smoothchecked blackeyed blackhaired young girl looking as if an infusion of indian blood had darkened the red of her cheeks presiding over a stock of onions potatoes beets and turnips there an old woman with a face carven like a walnut behind a flattering array of cherries and pears yonder a whole family trafficking in loaves of brownbread and maplesugar in many shapes of pious and grotesque device there are gay shows of bright scarfs and kerchiefs and varicolored yarns and sad shows of old clothes and secondhand merchandise of other sorts but above all prevails the abundance of orchard and garden while within the fine edifice are the stalls of the butchers and in the basement below a world of household utensils glassware hardware and woodenware as in other latin countries each peasant has given a personal interest to his wares but the bargains are not clamored over as in latin lands abroad whatever protest and concession and invocation of the saints attend the transacting of business at bonsecours market are in a subdued tone the fat hucksterwomen drowsing beside their wares scarce send their voices beyond the borders of their broadbrimmed straw hats as they softly haggle with purchasers or tranquilly gossip together  at the cathedral there are perhaps the worst paintings in the world and the massive pineboard pillars are unscrupulously smoked to look like marble but our tourists enjoyed it as if it had been st peters in fact it has something of the barnlike immensity and impressiveness of st peters they did not ask it to be beautiful or grand they desired it only to recall the beloved ugliness the fondly cherished hideousness and incongruity of the average catholic churches of their remembrance and it did this and more it added an effect of its own it offered the spectacle of a swarthy old indian kneeling before the high altar telling his beads and saying with many sighs and tears the prayers which it cost so much martyrdom and heroism to teach his race o it is only a savage man said the little french boy who was showing them the place impatient of their interest in a thing so unworthy as this groaning barbarian he ran swiftly about from object to object rapidly lecturing their inattention it is now time to go up into the tower said he and they gladly made that toilsome ascent though it is doubtful if the ascent of towers is not too much like the ascent of mountains ever to be compensatory from the top of notre dame is certainly to be had a prospect upon which but for his fluttered nerves and trembling muscles and troubled respiration the traveller might well look with delight and as it is must behold with wonder so far as the eye reaches it dwells only upon what is magnificent all the features of that landscape are grand below you spreads the city which has less that is merely mean in it than any other city of our continent and which is everywhere ennobled by stately civic edifices adorned by tasteful churches and skirted by full foliaged avenues of mansions and villas behind it rises the beautiful mountain green with woods and gardens to its crest and flanked on the east by an endless fertile plain and on the west by another expanse through which the ottawa rushes turbid and dark to its confluence with the st lawrence then these two mighty streams commingled flow past the city lighting up the vast champaign country to the south while upon the utmost southern verge as on the northern rise the cloudy summits of faroff mountains  as our travellers gazed upon all this grandeur their hearts were humbled to the tacit admission that the colonial metropolis was not only worthy of its seat but had traits of a solid prosperity not excelled by any of the abounding and boastful cities of the republic long before they quitted montreal they had rallied from this weakness but they delighted still to honor her superb beauty  the tower is naturally bescribbled to its top with the names of those who have climbed it and most of these are americans who flock in great numbers to canada in summer they modify its hotel life and the objects of interest thrive upon their bounty our friends met them at every turn and knew them at a glance from the native populations who are also easily distinguishable from each other the french canadians are nearly always of a peasantlike commonness or where they rise above this have a bourgeois commonness of face and manner and the english canadians are to be known from the many english sojourners by the effort to look much more english than the latter the social heart of the colony clings fast to the mothercountry that is plain whatever the political tendency may be and the public monuments and inscriptions celebrate this affectionate union  at the english cathedral the effect is deepened by the epitaphs of those whose lives were passed in the joint service of england and her loyal child and our travellers whatever their want of sympathy with the sentiment had to own to a certain beauty in that attitude of proud reverence here at least was a people not cut off from its past but holding unbroken in life and death the ties which exist for us only in history it gave a glamour of olden time to the new land it touched the prosaic democratic present with the waning poetic light of the aristocratic and monarchical tradition there was here and there a title on the tablets and there was everywhere the formal language of loyalty and of veneration for things we have tumbled into the dust it is a beautiful church of admirable english gothic if you are so happy you are rather curtly told you may enter by a burly english figure in some kind of sombre ecclesiastical drapery and within its quiet precincts you may feel yourself in england if you likewhich for my part i do not neither did our friends enjoy it so much as the church of the jesuits with its more than tolerable painting its coldly frescoed ceiling its architectural taste of subdued renaissance and its blackeyed peasantgirl telling her beads before a side altar just as in the enviably deplorable countries we all love nor so much even as the irish cathedral which they next visited that is a very gorgeous cathedral indeed painted and gilded a merveille and everywhere stuck about with big and little saints and crucifixes and pictures incredibly badbut for those in the french cathedral there is of course a series representing christs progress to calvary and there was a very tattered old manan old man whose voice had been long ago drowned in whiskey and who now spoke in a ghostly whisperwho when he saw basils eye fall upon the series made him go the round of them and tediously explained them  why did you let that old wretch bore you and then pay him for it isabel asked  o it reminded me so sweetly of the swindles of other lands and days that i couldnt help it he answered and straightway in the eyes of both that poor whiskeyfied irish tatterdemalion stood transfigured to the glorious likeness of an italian beggar  they were always doing something of this kind those absurdly sentimental people whom yet i cannot find it in my heart to blame for their folly though i could name ever so many reasons for rebuking it why in fact should we wish to find america like europe are the ruins and impostures and miseries and superstitions which beset the traveller abroad so precious that he should desire to imagine them at every step in his own hemisphere or have we then of our own no effective shapes of ignorance and want and incredibility that we must forever seek an alien contrast to our native intelligence and comfort some such questions this guilty couple put to each other and then drove off to visit the convent of the gray nuns with a joyful expectation which i suppose the prospect of the finest publicschool exhibition in boston could never have inspired but indeed since there must be gray nuns is it not well that there are sentimentalists to take a mournful pleasure in their sad pallid existence  the convent is at a good distance from the irish cathedral and in going to it the tourists made their driver carry them through one of the few old french streets which still remain in montreal fires and improvements had made havoc among the quaint horses since basils first visit but at last they came upon a narrow ancient rue saint antoineor whatever other saint it was called afterin which there was no english face or house to be seen the doors of the little onestory dwellings opened from the pavement and within you saw fat madame the mother moving about her domestic affairs and spare monsieur the elderly husband smoking beside the open window french babies crawled about the tidy floors french martyrs let us believe lalement or brebeuf who gave up their heroic lives for the conversion of canada sifted their eyes in highcolored lithographs on the wall among the flowerpots in the dormerwindow looking from every tin roof sat and sewed a smooth haired young girl i hopethe romance of each little mansion the antique and foreign character of the place was accented by the inscription upon a wall of sirop adoucissant de madame winslow  ever since 1692 the gray nuns have made refuge within the ample borders of their convent for infirm old people and for foundling children and it is now in the regular course of sightseeing for the traveller to visit their hospital at noonday when he beholds the sisters at their devotions in the chapel it is a bare whitewalled coldlooking chapel with the usual paraphernalia of pictures and crucifixes seated upon low benches on either side of the aisle were the curious or the devout the former in greater number and chiefly americans who were now and then whispered silent by an old pauper zealous for the sanctity of the place at the stroke of twelve the sisters entered two by two followed by the ladysuperior with a prayerbook in her hand she clapped the leaves of this together in signal for them to kneel to rise to kneel again and rise while they repeated in rather harsh voices their prayers and then clattered out of the chapel as they had clattered in with resounding shoes the two young girls at the head were very pretty and all the pale faces had a corpselike peace as basil looked at their pensive sameness it seemed to him that those prettiest girls might very well be the twain that he had seen here so many years ago stricken forever young in their joyless beauty the ungraceful gowns of coarse gray the blue checked aprons the black crape caps were the same they came and went with the same quick tread touching their brows with holy water and kneeling and rising now as then with the same constrained and ordered movements would it be too cruel if they were really the same persons or would it be yet more cruel if every year two girls so young and fair were selfdoomed to renew the likeness of that youthful death  the visitors went about the hospital and saw the old men and the little children to whom these good pure lives were given and they could only blame the system not the instruments or their work perhaps they did not judge wisely of the amount of selfsacrifice involved for they judged from hearts to which love was the whole of earth and heaven but nevertheless they pitied the gray nuns amidst the unhomelike comfort of their convent the unnatural care of those alien little ones poor soeurs grises in their narrow cells at the bedside of sickness and age and sorrow kneeling with clasped hands and yearning eyes before the bloody spectacle of the crossthe power of your church is shown far more subtly and mightily in such as you than in her grandest fanes or the sight of her most august ceremonies with praying priests swinging censers tapers and pictures and images under a gloomy heaven of cathedral arches there indeed the faithful have given their substance but here the nun has given up the most precious part of her womans nature and all the tenderness that clings about the thought of wife and mother  there are some things that always greatly afflict me in the idea of a new country said basil as they loitered slowly through the grounds of the convent toward the gate of course its absurd to think of men as other than men as having changed their natures with their skies but a new land always does seem at first thoughts like a new chance afforded the race for goodness and happiness for health and life so i grieve for the earliest dead at plymouth more than for the multitude that the plague swept away in london i shudder over the crime of the first guilty man the sin of the first wicked woman in a new country the trouble of the first youth or maiden crossed in love there is intolerable all should be hope and freedom and prosperous life upon that virgin soil it never was so since eden but none the less i feel it ought to be and i am oppressed by the thought that among the earliest walls which rose upon this broad meadow of montreal were those built to immure the innocence of such young girls as these and shut them from the life we find so fair wouldnt you like to know who was the first that took the veil in this wild new country who was she poor soul and what was her deep sorrow or lofty rapture you can fancy her some indian maiden lured to the renunciation by the splendor of symbols and promises seen vaguely through the lingering mists of her native superstitions or some weary soul sick from the vanities and vices the bloodshed and the tears of the old world and eager for a silence profounder than that of the wilderness into which she had fled well the church knows and god she was dust long ago  from time to time there had fallen little fitful showers during the morning now as the weddingjourneyers passed out of the convent gate the rain dropped soft and thin and the gray clouds that floated through the sky so swiftly were as farseen gray sisters in flight for heaven  we shall have time for the drive round the mountain before dinner said basil as they got into their carriage again and he was giving the order to the driver when isabel asked how far it was  nine miles  o then we cant think of going with one horse you know she added that we always intended to have two horses for going round the mountain  no said basil not yet used to having his decisions reached without his knowledge and i dont see why we should everybody goes with one you dont suppose were too heavy do you  i had a party from the states maam yesterday interposed the driver two ladies real heavy apes two gentlemen weighin two hundred apiece and a stout young man on the box with me youd a thought the horse was drawin an empty carriage the way she darted along  then his horse must be perfectly worn out today said isabel refusing to admit the pool fellow directly even to the honors of a defeat he had proved too much and was put out of court with no hope of repairing his error  why it seems a pity whispered basil dispassionately to turn this man adrift when he had a reasonable hope of being with us all day and has been so civil and obliging  o yes basil sentimentalize him do why dont you sentimentalize his helpless overworked horseall in a reek of perspiration  perspiration why my dear it s the rain  well rain or shine darling i dont want to go round the mountain with one horse and it s very unkind of you to insist now when youve tacitly promised me all along to take two  now this is a little too much isabel you know we never mentioned the matter till this moment  it s the same as a promise your not saying you wouldnt but i dont ask you to keep your word i dont want to go round the mountain id much rather go to the hotel im tired  very well then isabel ill leave you at the hotel  in a moment it had come the first serious dispute of their wedded life it had come as all such calamities come from nothing and it was on them in full disaster ere they knew such a very little while ago there in the convent garden their lives had been drawn closer in sympathy than ever before and now that blessed time seemed ages since and they were further asunder than those who have never been friends i thought bitterly mused isabel that he would have done anything for me who could have dreamed that a woman of her sense would be so unreasonable he wondered both had tempers as i know my dearest reader has if a lady and neither would yield and so presently they could hardly tell how for they were aghast at it all isabel was alone in her room amidst the ruins of her life and basil alone in the onehorse carriage trying to drive away from the wreck of his happiness all was over the dream was past the charm was broken the sweetness of their love was turned to gall whatever had pleased them in their loving moods was loathsome now and the things they had praised a moment before were hateful in that baleful light which seemed to dwell upon all they ever said or did in mutual enjoyment how poor and stupid and empty looked their weddingjourney basil spent five minutes in arraigning his wife and convicting her of every folly and fault his soul was in a whirl       for to be wroth with one we love      doth work like madness in the brain  in the midst of his bitter and furious upbraidings he found himself suddenly become her ardent advocate and ready to denounce her judge as a heartless monster on our wedding journey too good heavens what an incredible brute i am then he said what an ass i am and the pathos of the case having yielded to its absurdity he was helpless in five minutes more he was at isabels side the onehorse carriage driver dismissed with a handsome pourboire and a pair of lusty bays with a glittering barouche waiting at the door below he swiftly accounted for his presence which she seemed to find the most natural thing that could be and she met his surrender with the openness of a heart that forgives but does not forget if indeed the most gracious art is the only one unknown to the sex  she rose with a smile from the ruins of her life amidst which she had heartbrokenly sat down with all her things on i knew youd come back she said  so did i he answered i am much too good and noble to sacrifice my preference to my duty  i didnt care particularly for the two horses basil she said as they descended to the barouche it was your refusing them that hurt me  and i didnt want the onehorse carriage it was your insisting so that provoked me  do you think people ever quarreled before on a wedding journey asked isabel as they drove gayly out of the city  never i cant conceive of it i suppose if this were written down nobody would believe it  no nobody could said isabel musingly and she added after a pause i wish you would tell me just what you thought of me dearest did you feel as you did when our little affair was broken off long ago did you hate me  i did most cordially but not half so much as i despised myself the next moment as to its being like a lovers quarrel it wasnt it was more bitter so much more love than lovers ever give had to be taken back besides it had no dignity and a lovers quarrel always has a lovers quarrel always springs from a more serious cause and has an air of romantic tragedy this had no grace of the kind it was a poor shabby little squabble  o dont call it so basil i should like you to respect even a quarrel of ours more than that it was tragical enough with me for i didnt see how it could ever be made up i knew i couldnt make the advances i dont think it is quite feminine to be the first to forgive is it  im sure i cant say perhaps it would be rather unladylike  well you see dearest what i am trying to get at is this whether we shall love each other the more or the less for it i think we shall get on all the better for a while on account of it but i should have said it was totally out of character its something you might have expected of a very young bridal couple but after what weve been through it seems too improbable  very well said basil who having made all the concessions could not enjoy the quarrel as she did simply because it was theirs let s behave as if it had never been  o no we cant to me its as if we had just won each other  in fact it gave a wonderful zest and freshness to that ride round the mountain and shed a beneficent glow upon the rest of their journey the sun came out through the thin clouds and lighted up the vast plain that swept away north and east with the purple heights against the eastern sky the royal mountain lifted its graceful mass beside them and hid the city wholly from sight peasantvillages in the shade of beautiful elms dotted the plain in every direction and at intervals crept up to the side of the road along which they drove but these had been corrupted by a more ambitious architecture since basil saw them last and were no longer purely french in appearance then nearly every house was a tannery in a modest way and poetically published the fact by the display of a sheeps tail over the front door like a bush at a wineshop now if the tanneries still existed the poetry of the cheeps tails had vanished from the portals but our friends were consoled by meeting numbers of the peasants jolting home from market in the painted carts which are doubtless of the pattern of the carts first built there two hundred years ago they were grateful for the immortal old wooden crooked and brown with the labor of the fields who abounded in these vehicles when a huge girl jumped from the tail of her cart and showed the thick clumsy ankles of a true peasantmaid they could only sigh out their unspeakable satisfaction  gardens embowered and perfumed the low cottages through the open doors of which they could see the exquisite neatness of the life within one of the doors opened into a schoolhouse where they beheld with rapture the schoolmistress book in hand and with a quaint cap on her gray head and encircled by her flock of little boys and girls  by and by it began to rain again and now while their driver stopped to put up the top of the barouche they entered a country church which had taken their fancy and walked up the aisle with the steps that blend with silence rather than break it while they heard only the soft whisper of the shower without there was no one there but themselves the urn of holy water seemed not to have been troubled that day and no penitent knelt at the shrine before which twinkled so faintly one lighted lamp the white roof swelled into dim arches over their heads the pale day like a visible hush stole through the painted windows they heard themselves breathe as they crept from picture to picture  a narrow door opened at the side of the high altar and a slender young priest appeared in a long black robe and with shaven head he too as he moved with noiseless feet seemed a part of the silence and when he approached with dreamy black eyes fixed upon them and bowed courteously it seemed impossible he should speak but he spoke the pale young priest the darkrobed tradition the tonsured vision of an age and a church that are passing  do you understand french monsieur  a very little monsieur  a very little is more than my english he said yet he politely went the round of the pictures with them and gave them the names of the painters between his crossings at the different altars at the high altar there was a very fair crucifixion before this the priest bent one knee fine picture fine altar fine church he said in english at last they stopped next the poorbox as their coins clinked against those within he smiled serenely upon the good heretics then he bowed and as if he had relapsed into the past he vanished through the narrow door by which he had entered  basil and isabel stood speechless a moment on the church steps then she cried  o why didnt something happen  ah my dear what could have keen half so good as the nothing that did happen suppose we knew him to have taken orders because of a disappointment in love how common it would have made him everybody has been crossed in love once or twice he bade the driver take them back to the hotel this is the very bouquet of adventure why should we care for the grosser body i dare say if we knew all about yonder pale young priest we should not think him half so interesting as we do now  at dinner they spent the intervals of the courses in guessing the nationality of the different persons and in wondering if the canadians did not make it a matter of conscientious loyalty to outenglish the english even in the matter of paleale and sherry and in rotundity of person and freshness of face just as they emulated them in the cut of their clothes and whiskers must they found even their health upon the health of the mothercountry  our friends began to detect something servile in it all and but that they were such amiable persons the loyally perfect digestion of montreal would have gone far to impair their own  the loyalty which had already appeared to them in the cathedral suggested itself in many ways upon the street when they went out after dinner to do that little shopping which isabel had planned to do in montreal the booksellers windows were full of canadian editions of our authors and english copies of english works instead of our pirated editions the drygoods stores were gay with fabrics in the london taste and garments of the london shape here was the sign of a photographer to the queen there of a hatter to h r h the prince of wales a barber was under the patronage of h r h the prince of wales h e the duke of cambridge and the gentry of montreal ich dien was the motto of a restaurateur a hosier had gallantly labeled his stock in trade with honi soit qui mal y pense again they noted the english solidity of the civic edifices and already they had observed in the foreign population a difference from that at home they saw no german faces on the streets and the irish faces had not that truculence which they wear sometimes with us they had not lost their native simpleness and kindliness the irishmen who drove the public carriages were as civil as our own boston hackmen and behaved as respectfully under the shadow of england here as they world have done under it in ireland the problem which vexes us seems to have been solved pleasantly enough in canada is it because the celt cannot brook equality and where he has not an established and recognized caste above him longs to trample on those about him and if he cannot be lowest will at least be highest  however our friends did not suffer this or any other advantage of the colonial relation to divert them from the opinion to which their observation was gradually bringing themthat its overweening loyalty placed a great country like canada in s very silly attitude the attitude of an overgrown unmanly boy clinging to the maternal skirts and though spoilt and willful without any character of his own the constant reference of local hopes to that remote centre beyond seas the test of success by the criterions of a necessarily different civilization the social and intellectual dependence implied by traits that meet the most hurried glance in the dominion give an effect of meanness to the whole fabric doubtless it is a life of comfort of peace of irresponsibility they live there but it lacks the grandeur which no sum of material prosperity can give it is ignoble like all voluntarily subordinate things somehow one feels that it has no basis in the new world and that till it is shaken loose from england it cannot have  it would be a pity however if it should be parted from the parent country merely to be joined to an unsympathetic halfbrother like ourselves and nothing fortunately seems to be further from the canadian mind there are some experiments no longer possible to us which could still be tried there to the advantage of civilization and we were better two great nations side by side than a union of discordant traditions and ideas but none the less does the american traveller swelling with forgetfulness of the shabby despots who govern new york and the swindling railroad kings whose word is law to the whole land feel like saying to the hulling young giant beyond st lawrence and the lakes sever the apronstrings of allegiance and try to be yourself whatever you are  something of this sort basil said though of course not in apostrophic phrase nor with isabels entire concurrence when he explained to her that it was to the colonial dependence of canada she owed the ability to buy things so cheaply there  the fact is that the ladies parlor at the hotel had been after dinner no better than a den of smugglers in which the fair contrabandists had debated the best means of evading the laws of their country at heart every man is a smuggler and how much more every woman she would have no scruple in ruining the silk and woolen interest throughout the united states she is a freetrader by intuitive perception of right and is limited in practice by nothing but fear of the statute what could be taken into the states without detection was the subject before that wicked conclave and next what it would pay to buy in canada it seemed that silk umbrellas were most eligible wares and in the display of such purchases the parlor was given the appearance of a violent thunderstorm gloves it was not advisable to get they were better at home as were many kinds of fine woolen goods but laces which you could carry about you were excellent and so was any kind of silk could it be carried if simply cut and not made up there was a difference about this the friend of one lady had taken home half a trunkful of cut silks the friend of another had run up the breadths of one lone little silk skirt and then lost it by the rapacity of the customs officers it was pretty much luck and whether the officers happened to be in goodhumor or not you must not try to take in anything out of season however one had heard of a boston lady going home in july who had the furs taken off her back in that inclement month best get everything seasonable and put it on at once and then you know if they ask you you can say its been worn to this black wisdom came the combined knowledge of those miscreants basil could not repress a shudder at the innate depravity of the female heart here were virgins nurtured in the most spotless purity of life here were virtuous mothers of families here were venerable matrons patterns in society and the churchsmugglers to a woman and eager for any guilty subterfuge he glanced at isabel to see what effect the evil conversation had upon her her eyes sparkled her cheeks glowed all the woman was on fire for smuggling he sighed heavily and went out with her to do the little shopping  shall i follow them upon their excursion shopping in montreal is very much what it is in boston or new york i imagine except that the clerks have a more honeyed sweetness of manners towards the ladies of our nation and are surprisingly generous constructionists of our revenue laws isabel had profited by every word that she had heard in the ladies parlor and she would not venture upon unsafe ground but her tender eyes looked her unutterable longing to believe in the charming possibilities that the clerks suggested she bemoaned herself before the corded silks which there was no time to have made up the piecevelvets and the linens smote her to the heart but they also stimulated her invention and she bought and bought of the madeup wares in real or fancied needs till basil represented that neither their purses nor their trunks could stand any more o dont be troubled about the trunks dearest she cried with that gayety which nothing but shopping can kindle in a womans heart while he faltered on from counter to counter wondering at which he should finally swoon from fatigue at last after she had declared repeatedly there now i am done she briskly led the way back to the hotel to pack up her purchases  basil parted with her at the door he was a man of high principle himself and that scene in the smugglers den and his wifes preparation for transgression were revelations for which nothing could have consoled him but a paragon umbrella for five dollars and an excellent business suit of scotch goods for twenty  when some hours later he sat with isabel on the forward promenade of the steamboat for quebec and summed up the profits of their shopping they were both in the kindliest mood towards the poor canadians who had built the admirable city before them  for miles the water front of montreal is superbly faced with quays and locks of solid stone masonry and thus she is clean and beautiful to the very feet stately piles of architecture instead of the foul old tumbledown warehouses that dishonor the waterside in most cities rise from the broad wharves behind these spring the twin towers of notre dame and the steeples of the other churches above the city roofs  its noble yes its noble after the best that europe can show said isabel with enthusiasm and what a pleasant day weve had here doesnt even our quarrel show couleur de rose in this light  one side of it answered basil dreamily but all the rest is black  what do you mean my dear  why the nelson monument with the sunset on it at the head of the street there  the affect was so fine that isabel could not be angry with him for failing to heed what she had said and she mused a moment with him  it seems rather farfetched she said presently to erect a monument to nelson in montreal doesnt it but then its a very absurd monument when youre near it she added thoughtfully  basil did not answer at once for gazing on this nelson column in jacques cartier square his thoughts wandered away not to the hero of the nile but to the doughty old breton navigator the first white man who ever set foot upon that shore and who more than three hundred years ago explored the st lawrence as far as montreal and in the splendid autumn weather climbed to the top of her green height and named it the scene that jacques cartier then beheld like a mirage of the fast projected upon the present floated before him and he saw at the mountains foot the indian city of hochelaga with its vast and populous lodges of bark its encircling palisades and its wide outlying fields of yellow maize he heard with jacques cartiers sense the blare of his followers trumpets down in the open square of the barbarous city where the soldiers of many an oldworld fight with mustached lip and bearded chin with arquebuse and glittering halberd helmet and cuirass moved among the plumed and painted savages then he lifted jacques cartiers eyes and looked out upon the magnificent landscape east wept and north the mantling forest was over all and the broad blue ribbon of the great river glistened amid a realm of verdure beyond to the bounds of mexico stretched a leafy desert and the vast hive of industry the mighty battleground of late centuries lay sunk in savage torpor wrapped in illimitable woods  a vaguer picture of champlain who seeking a westward route to china and the east some three quarters of a century later had fixed the first tradingpost at montreal and camped upon the spot where the convent of the gray nuns now stands appeared before him and vanished with all its fleets of furtraders boats and hunters birch canoes and the watchfires of both and then in the sweet light of the spring morning he saw maisonneuve leaping ashore upon the green meadows that spread all gay with early flowers where hochelaga once stood and with the blackrobed jesuits the highborn delicately nurtured and devoted nuns and the steelclad soldiers of his train kneeling about the altar raised there in the wilderness and silent amidst the silence of nature at the lifted host  he painted a semblance of all this for isabel using the colors of the historian who has made these scenes the beautiful inheritance of all dream era and sketched the battles the miracles the sufferings and the penances through which the pious colony was preserved and prospered till they both grew impatient of modern montreal and would fain have had the ancient villemarie back in its place  think of maisonneuve dearest climbing in midwinter to the top of the mountain there under a heavy cross set with the bones of saints and planting it on the summit in fulfillment of a vow to do so if villemarie were saved from the freshet and then of madame de la peltrie romantically receiving the sacrament there while all villemarie fell down adoring ah that was a picturesque people when did ever a boston governor climb to the top of beacon hill in fulfillment of a vow to be sure we may yet see a new york governor doing something of the kindif he can find a hill but this ridiculous column to nelson who never had anything to do with montreal he continued it really seems to me the perfect expression of snobbish colonial dependence and sentimentality seeking always to identify itself with the mothercountry and ignoring the local past and its heroic figures a column to nelson in jacques cartier square on the ground that was trodden by champlain and won for its present masters by the death of wolfe  the boat departed on her trip to quebec during supper they were served by french waiters who without apparent english of their own miraculously understood that of the passengers except in the case of the furious gentleman who wanted english breakfast tea to so much english as that their inspiration did not reach and they forced him to compromise on coffee it was a french boat owned by a french company and seemed to be officered by frenchmen throughout certainly as our tourists in the joy of their good appetites affirmed the cook was of that culinarily delightful nation  the boat was almost as large as those of the hudson but it was not so lavishly splendid though it had everything that could minister to the comfort and selfrespect of the passengers these were of all nations but chiefly americans with some french canadians the former gathered on the forward promenade enjoying what little of the landscape the growing night left visible and the latter made society after their manner in the saloon they were plainlooking men and women mostly and provincial it was evident to their inmost hearts provincial in origin provincial by inheritance by all their circumstances social and political their relation with france was not a proud one but it was not like submersion by the slipslop of english colonial loyalty yet they seem to be troubled by no memories of their hundred years dominion of the land that they rescued from the wilderness and that was wrested from them by war it is a strange fate for any people thus to have been cut off from the parentcountry and abandoned to whatever destiny their conquerors chose to reserve for them and if each of the race wore the sadness and strangeness of that fate in his countenance it would not be wonderful perhaps it is wonderful that none of them shows anything of the kind in their desertion they have multiplied and prospered they may have a national grief but they hide it well and probably they have none  later one of them appeared to isabel in the person of the pale slender young ecclesiastic who had shown her and basil the pictures in the country church she was confessing to the priest and she was not at all surprised to find that he was basil in a suit of medieval armor he had an immense cross on his shoulder  to get this cross to the top of the mountain thought isabel we must have two horses basil she added aloud we must have two horses  ten if you like my dear answered his voice cheerfully though i think wed better ride up in the omnibus  she opened her eyes and saw him smiling  were in sight of quebec he said come out as soon as you cancome out into the seventeenth century     ix quebec  isabel hurried out upon the forward promenade where all the other passengers seemed to be assembled and beheld a vast bulk of gray and purple rock swelling two hundred feet up from the mists of the river and taking the early morning light warm upon its face and crown blackhulked redillumined liverpool steamers gay rivercraft and ships of every sail and flag filled the stream athwart which the ferries sped their swift trafficladen shuttles a lower town hung to the foot of the rock and crept populous and picturesque up its sides from the massive citadel on its crest flew the red banner of saint george and along its brow swept the gray wall of the famous heroic beautiful city overtopped by many a gleaming spire and antique roof  slowly out of our workday businesssuited modern world the vessel steamed up to this city of an olden time and another idealto her who was a lady from the first devout and proud and strong and who still after two hundred and fifty years keeps perfect the image and memory of the feudal past from which she sprung upon her height she sits unique and when you say quebec having once beheld her you invoke a sense of medieval strangeness and of beauty which the name of no other city could intensify  as they drew near the steamboat wharf they saw swarming over a broad square a market beside which the bonsecours market would have shown as common as the quincy and up the odd woodensidewalked street stretched an aisle of carriages and those high swung calashes which are to quebec what the gondolas are to venice but the hand of destiny was upon our tourists and they rode up town in an omnibus they were going to the dear old hotel musty in street wanting which quebec is not to be thought of without a pang it is now closed and prescott gate through which they drove into the upper town has been demolished since the summer of last year swiftly whirled along the steep winding road by those quebec horses which expect to gallop up hill whatever they do going down they turned a corner of the towering weedgrown rock and shot in under the low arch of the gate pierced with smaller doorways for the footpassengers the gloomy masonry dripped with damp the doors were thickly studded with heavy iron spikes old cannon thrust endwise into the ground at the sides of the gate protected it against passing wheels why did not some semiforbidding commissary of police struggling hard to overcome his native politeness appear and demand their passports the illusion was otherwise perfect and it needed but this touch how often in the adored old world which we so love and disapprove had they driven in through such gates at that morning hour on what perverse pretext then was it not some ancient town of normandy  put a few enterprising americans in here and theyd soon rattle this old wall down and let in a little fresh air said a patriotic voice at isabels elbow and continued to find fault with the narrow irregular streets the huddling gables the quaint roofs through which and under which they drove on to the hotel  as they dashed into a broad open square here is the french cathedral there is the upper town market yonder are the jesuit barracks cried basil and they had a passing glimpse of gray stone towers at one side of the square and a low massive yellow building at the other and between the two long ranks of carts and fruit and vegetable stands protected by canvas awnings and broad umbrellas then they dashed round the corner of a street and drew up before the hotel door the low ceilings the thick walls the clumsy woodwork the wandering corridors gave the hotel all the desired character of age and its slovenly state bestowed an additional charm in another place they might have demanded neatness but in quebec they would almost have resented it by a chance they had the best room in the house but they held it only till certain people who had engaged it by telegraph should arrive in the hourly expected steamer from liverpool and moreover the best room at hotel musty was consolingly bad the house was very full and the ellisons who had come on with them from montreal were bestowed in less state only on like conditions  the travellers all met at breakfast which was admirably cooked and well served with the attendance of those swarms of flies which infest quebec and especially infested the old musty house in summer it had of course the attraction of broiled salmon upon which the traveller breakfasts every day as long as he remains in lower canada and it represented the abundance of wild berries in the quebec market and it was otherwise a breakfast worthy of the appetites that honored it  there were not many other americans besides themselves at this hotel which seemed indeed to be kept open to oblige such travellers as had been there before and could not persuade themselves to try the new hotel st louis whither the vastly greater number resorted most of the faces our tourists saw were english or englishcanadian and the young people from omaha who had got here by some chance were scarcely in harmony with the place they appeared to be a bridal party but which of the two sisters in buff linen clad from head to foot was the bride never became known both were equally free with the husband and he was impartially fond of both it was quite a family affair  for a moment isabel harbored the desire to see the city in company with miss ellison but it was only a passing weakness she remembered directly the coolness between friends which she had seen caused by objects of interest in europe and she wisely deferred a more intimate acquaintance till it could have a purely social basis after all nothing is so tiresome as continual exchange of sympathy or so apt to end in mutual dislikeexcept gratitude so the ladies parted friends till dinner and drove off in separate carriages  as in other show cities there is a routine at quebec for travellers who come on saturday and go on monday and few depart from it our friends necessarily therefore drove first to the citadel it was raining one of those cold rains by which the scarcebanished winter reminds the canadian fields of his nearness even in midsummer though between the bitter showers the air was sultry and close and it was just the light in which to see the grim strength of the fortress next strongest to gibraltar in the world they passed a heavy iron gateway and up through a winding lane of masonry to the gate of the citadel where they were delivered into the care of private joseph drakes who was to show them such parts of the place as are open to curiosity but a citadel which has never stood a siege or been threatened by any danger more serious than fenianism soon becomes however strong but a dull piece of masonry to the civilian and our tourists more rejoiced in the crumbling fragment of the old french wall which the english destroyed than in all they had built and they valued the latter work chiefly for the glorious prospects of the st lawrence and its mighty valleys which it commanded advanced into the centre of an amphitheatre inconceivably vast that enormous beak of rock overlooks the narrow angle of the river and then in every direction immeasurable stretches of gardened vale and wooded upland till all melts into the purple of the encircling mountains far and near are lovely white villages nestling under elms in the heart of fields and meadows and everywhere the long narrow accurately divided farms stretch downward to the rivershores the best roads on the continent make this beauty and richness accessible each little village boasts some natural wonder in stream or lake or cataract and this landscape magnificent beyond any in eastern america is historical and interesting beyond all others hither came jacques cartier three hundred and fifty years ago and wintered on the low point there by the st charles here nearly a century after but still fourteen years before the landing at plymouth champlain founded the missionary city of quebec round this rocky beak came sailing the halfpiratical armament of the calvinist kirks in 1629 and seized quebec in the interest of the english holding it three years in the lower town yonder first landed the coldly welcomed jesuits who came with the returning french and made quebec forever eloquent of their zeal their guile their heroism at the foot of this rock lay the fleet of sir william phipps governor of massachusetts and vainly assailed it in 1698 in 1759 came wolfe and embattled all the region on river and land till at last the bravely defended city fell into his dying hand on the plains of abraham here montgomery laid down his life at the head of the boldest and most hopeless effort of our war of independence  private joseph drakes with the generosity of an enemy expecting drinkmoney pointed out the sign board on the face of the crag commemorating montgomerys death and then showed them the officers quarters and those of the common soldiers not far from which was a line of hangdog fellows drawn up to receive sentence for divers small misdemeanors from an officer whose blond whiskers drooped dundrearily from his fresh english cheeks there was that immense difference between him and the men in physical grandeur and beauty which is so notable in the aristocratically ordered military services of europe and which makes the rank seem of another race from the file private drakes saluted his superior and visibly deteriorated in his presence though his breast was covered with medals and he had fought englands battles in every part of the world it was a gross injustice the triumph of a thousand years of wrong and it was touching to have private drakes say that he expected in three months to begin life for himself after twenty years service of the queen and did they think he could get anything to do in the states he scarcely knew what he was fit for but he thoughtto so little in him came the victories he had helped to win in the crimea in china and in indiathat he coald take care of a gentlemans horse and work about his place he looked inquiringly at basil as if he might be a gentleman with a horse to be taken care of and a place to be worked about and made him regret that he was not a man of substance enough to provide for private drakes and mrs drakes and the brood of ducklings who had been shown to him stowed away in one of those cavernous rooms in the earthworks where the married soldiers have their quarters his regret enriched the reward of private drakes servicewhich perhaps answered one of private drakes purposes if not his chief aim he promised to come to the states upon the pressing advice of isabel who speaking from her own large experience declared that everybody got on thereand he bade our friends an affectionate farewell as they drove away to the plains of abraham  the fashionable suburban cottages and places of quebec are on the st louis road leading northward to the old battleground and beyond it but these face chiefly towards the rivers st lawrence and st charles and lofty hedges and shrubbery hide them in an english seclusion from the highway so that the visitor may uninterruptedly meditate whatever emotion he will for the scene of wolfes death as he rides along his loftiest emotion will want the noble height of that heroic soul who must always stand forth in history a figure of beautiful and singular distinction admirable alike for the sensibility and daring the poetic pensiveness and the martial ardor that mingled in him and taxed his feeble frame with tasks greater than it could bear the whole story of the capture of quebec is full of romantic splendor and pathos her fall was a triumph for all the englishspeaking race and to us americans long scourged by the cruel indian wars plotted within her walls or sustained by her strength such a blessing as was hailed with ringing bells and blazing bonfires throughout the colonies yet now we cannot think without pity of the hopes extinguished and the labors brought to naught in her overthrow that strange colony of priests and soldiers of martyrs and heroes of which she was the capital willing to perish for an allegiance to which the mothercountry was indifferent and fighting against the armies with which england was prepared to outnumber the whole canadian population is a magnificent spectacle and montcalm laying down his life to lose quebec is not less affecting than wolfe dying to win her the heart opens towards the soldier who recited on the eve of his costly victory the elegy in a country churchyard which he would rather have written than beat the french tomorrow but it aches for the defeated general who hurt to death answered when told how brief his time was so much the better then i shall not live to see the surrender of quebec  in the city for which they perished their fame has never been divided the english have shown themselves very generous victors perhaps nothing could be alleged against them but that they were victors a shaft common to wolfe and montcalm celebrates them both in the governors garden and in the chapel of the ursuline convent a tablet is placed where montcalm died by the same conquerors who raised to wolfes memory the column on the battlefield  a dismal prison covers the ground where the hero fell and the monument stands on the spot where wolfe breathed his last on ground lower than the rest of the field the friendly hollow that sheltered him from the fire of the french dwarfs his monument yet it is sufficient and the simple inscription here died wolfe victorious gives it a dignity which many cubits of added stature could not bestow another of those bitter showers which had interspersed the mornings sunshine drove suddenly across the open plain and our tourists comfortably sentimentalized the scene behind the closedrawn curtains of their carriage here a whole empire had been lost and won basil reminded isabel and she said only think of it and looked to a wandering fold of her skirt upon which the rain beat through a rent of the curtain  do i pitch the pipe too low we poor honest men are at a sad disadvantage and now and then i am minded to give a loose to fancy and attribute something really grand and fine to my people in order to make them worthier the readers respected acquaintance but again i forbid myself in a higher interest and i am afraid that even if i were less virtuous i could not exalt their mood upon a battlefield for of all things of the past a battle is the least conceivable i have heard men who fought in many battles say that the recollection was like a dream to them and what can the merely civilian imagination do on the plains of abraham with the fact that there more than a century ago certain thousands of frenchmen marched out on a bright september morning to kill and maim as many englishmen this ground so green and oft with grass beneath the feet was it once torn with shot and soaked with the blood of men did they lie here in ranks and heaps the miserable slain for whom tender hearts away yonder over the sea were to ache and break did the wretches that fell wounded stretch themselves here and writhe beneath the feet of friend and foe or crawl array for shelter into little hollows and behind gushes and fallen trees did he whose soul was so full of noble and sublime impulses die here shot through like some ravening beast the loathsome carnage the shrieks the hellish din of arms the cries of victoryi vainly strive to conjure up some image of it all now and god be thanked horrible spectre that fill the world with sorrow as thou wilt thou still remainest incredible in its moments of sanity and peace least credible art thou on the old battlefields where the mother of the race denies thee with breeze and sun and leaf and bird and every blade of grass the red stain in basils thought yielded to the rain sweeping across the pastureland from which it had long since faded and the words on the monument here died wolfe victorious did not proclaim his bloody triumph over the french but his selfconquest his victory over fear and pain and love of life alas when shall the poor blind stupid world honor those who renounce self in the joy of their kind equally with those who devote themselves through the anguish and loss of thousands so old a world and groping still  the tourists were better fitted for the next occasion of sentiment which was at the hotel dieu whither they went after returning from the battlefield it took all the maladdress of which travellers are masters to secure admittance and it was not till they had rung various wrong bells and misunderstood many soft nunvoices speaking french through grated doors and set divers sympathetic spectators doing ineffectual services that they at last found the proper entrance and were answered in english that the porter would ask if they might see the chapel they hoped to find there the skull of brebeuf one of those jesuit martyrs who perished long ago for the conversion of a race that has perished and whose relics they had come fresh from their reading of parkman with some vague and patronizing intention to revere an elderly sister with a pale kind face led them through a ward of the hospital into the chapel which they found in the expected taste and exquisitely neat and cool but lacking the martyrs skull they asked if it were not to be seen ah yes poor pere brebeuf sighed the gentle sister with the tone and manner of having lost him yesterday we had it down only last week showing it to some jesuit fathers but its in the convent now and isnt to be seen and there mingled apparently in her regret for pere brebeuf a confusing sense of his actual state as a portable piece of furniture she would not let them praise the chapel it was very clean yes but there was nothing to see in it she deprecated their compliments with many shrugs but she was pleased for when we renounce the pomps and vanities of this world we are pretty sure to find them in some otherif we are women she good and pure soul whose whole life was given to selfdenying toil had yet something angelically coquettish in her manner a spiritualworldliness which was the clarified likeness of thisworldliness o had they seen the hotel dieu at montreal then with a vivacious wave of the hands they would not care to look at this which by comparison was nothing yet she invited them to go through the wards if they would and was clearly proud to have them see the wonderful cleanness and comfort of the place there were not many patients but here and there a wan or fevered face looked at them from its pillow or a weak form drooped beside a bed or a group of convalescents softly talked together they came presently to the last hall at the end of which sat another nun beside a window that gave a view of the busy port and beyond it the landscape of villagelit plain and forestdarkened height on a table at her elbow stood a rosetree on which hung two only pale tearoses so fair so perfect that isabel cried out in wonder and praise ere she could prevent it the nun to whom there had been some sort of presentation gathered one of the roses and with a shy grace offered it to isabel who shrank back a little as from too costly a gift take it said the first nun with her pretty french accent while the other who spoke no english at all beamed a placid smile and isabel took it the flower lying light in her palm exhaled a delicate odor and a thrill of exquisite compassion for it trembled through her heart as if it had been the white cloistered life of the silent nun with its pallid loveliness it was as a flower that had taken the veil it could never have uttered the burning passion of a lover for his mistress the nightingale could have found no thorn on it to press his aching poets heart against but sick and weary eyes had dwelt gratefully upon it at most it might have expressed like a prayer the nuns stainless love of some favorite saint in paradise cold and pale and sweetwas it indeed only a flower this cloistered rose of the hotel dieu  breathe it said the gentle gray sister sometimes the air of the hospital offends not us no we are used but you come from the outside and she gave her rose for this humble use as lovingly as she devoted herself to her lowly taxes  it is very little to see she said at the end but if you are pleased i am very glad goodby goodby she stood with her arms folded and watched them out of sight with her kind coquettish little smile and then the mute blank life of the nun resumed her  from hotel dieu to hotel musty it was but a step both were in the same street but our friends fancied themselves to have come an immense distance when they sat down at an early dinner amidst the clash of crockery and cutlery and looked round upon all the profane travelling world assembled their regard presently fixed upon one company which monopolized a whole table and were defined from the other diners by peculiarities as marked as those of the soeurs grises themselves there were only two men among some eight or ten women one of the former had a bad amiable face with eyes full of a merry deviltry the other clean shaven and dark was demure and silent as a priest the ladies were of various types but of one effect with large rolling eyes and faces that somehow regarded the beholder as from a distance and with an impartial feeling for him as for an element of publicity one of them who caressed a lapdog with one hand while she served herself with the other was as she seemed to believe a blonde she had pale blue eyes and her hair was cut in front so as to cover her forehead with a straggling sandycolored fringe she had an english look and three or four others with dark complexion and black unsteady eyes and various abandon of backhair looked like cockney houris of jewish blood while two of the lovely company were clearly of our own nation as was the young man with the reckless laughing face the ladies were dressed and jeweled with a kind of broad effectiveness which was to the ordinary style of society what scenepainting is to painting and might have borne close inspection no better they seemed the besthumored people in the world and on the kindliest terms with each other the waiters shared their pleasant mood and served them affectionately and were now and then invited to join in the gay talk which babbled on over dislocated aspirates and filled the air with a sentiment of vagabond enjoyment of the romantic freedom of violated convention of something gil blaslike almost picaresque  if they had needed explanation it would have been given by the announcement in the office of the hotel that a troupe of british blondes was then appearing in quebec for one week only  after dinner they took possession of the parlor and while one strummed fitfully upon the ailing hotel piano the rest talked and talked shop of course as all of us do when several of a trade are got together  wat said the eldest of the darkfaced black haired british blondes of jewish racewat are we going to give at montrehal  were going to give pygmalion at montrehal answered the british blonde of american birth goodhumoredly burlesquing the erring h of her sister  but we cahnt you know said the lady with the fringed forehead hagnes is gone on to new york and theres nobody to do wenus  yes you know demanded the first speaker oos to do wenus  bellas to do wenus said a third  there was an outcry at this and ow ever would she get herself up for venus and wat a guy shell look and nonsense bellas too eavy for venus came from different lively critics and the debate threatened to become too intimate for the public ear when one of their gentlemen came in and said charley dont seem so well this afternoon on this the chorus changed its note and at the proposal poor charley let s go and cheer im hop a bit the whole goodtempered company trooped out of the parlor together  our tourists meant to give the rest of the afternoon to that sort of aimless wandering to and fro about the streets which seizes a foreign city unawares and best develops its charm of strangeness so they went out and took their fill of quebec with appetites keen through long fasting from the quaint and old and only sharpened by montreal and impartially rejoiced in the crooked upanddown hill streets the thoroughly french domestic architecture of a place that thus denied having been english for a hundred years the portecocheres beside every house the french names upon the doors and the oddity of the bellpulls the roughpaved rattling streets the shining roofs of tin and the universal dormerwindows the littleness of the private houses and the greatness of the highwalled and gardengirdled convents the breadths of weatherstained city wall and the shaggy cliff beneath the batteries with their guns peacefully staring through loopholes of masonry and the redcoated sergeants flirting with nurserymaids upon the carriages while the children tumbled about over the pyramids of shot and shell the sloping marketplace before the cathedral where yet some remnant of the mornings traffic lingered under canvas canopies and where isabel bought a bouquet of marigolds and asters of an old woman peasant enough to have sold it in any marketplace of europe the small dark shops beyond the quarter invaded by english retail trade the movement of all the strange figures of cleric and lay and military life the sound of a foreign speech prevailing over the english the encounter of other tourists the passage back and forth through the different city gates the public wooden stairways dropping flight after flight from the upper to the lower town the bustle of the port with its commerce and shipping and seafaring life huddled close in under the hill the many desolate streets of the lower town as black and ruinous as the last great fire left them and the marshy meadows beyond memorable of recollets and jesuits of cartier and montcalm  they went to the chapel of the seminary at laval university and admired the le brun and the other paintings of less merit but equal interest through their suggestion of a whole dim religious world of paintings and then they spent half an hour in the cathedral not so much in looking at the crucifixion by vandyck which is there as in reveling amid the familiar rococo splendors of the temple every swaggering statue of a saint every ropedancing angel every cherub of those that on the carven and gilded clouds above the high altar float       like little wanton boys that swim on bladders  was precious to them the sacristan dusting the sacred properties with a feather brush and giving each shrine a businesslike nod as he passed was as a longlost brother they had hearts of aggressive tenderness for the young girls and old women who stepped in for a halfhours devotion and for the men with bourgeois or peasant faces who stole a moment from affairs and crops and gave it to the saints there was nothing in the place that need remind them of america and its taste was exactly that of a thousand other churches of the eighteenth century they could easily have believed themselves in the farthest catholic south but for the two great porcelain stoves that stood on either side of the nave near the entrance and that too vividly reminded them of the possibility of cold  in fact quebec is a little painful in this and other confusions of the south and north and one never quite reconciles himself to them the frenchmen who expected to find there the climate of their native land and ripen her wines in as kindly a sun have perpetuated the image of home in so many things that it goes to the heart with a painful emotion to find the sad oblique light of the north upon them as you ponder some characteristic aspect of quebeca bit of street with heavy stone houses opening upon a stretch of the city wall with a lombardy poplar rising slim against ityou say to your satisfied soul yes it is the real thing and then all at once a sense of that northern sky strikes in upon you and makes the reality a mere picture the sky is blue the sun is often fiercely hot you could not perhaps prove that the pathetic radiance is not an efflux of your own consciousness that summer is but hanging over the land briefly poising on wings which flit at the first dash of rain and will soon vanish in long retreat before the snow but somehow from without or from within that light of the north is there  it lay saddest our travellers thought upon the little circular garden near durham terrace where every brightness of fall flowers aboundedmarigold coxcomb snapdragon dahlia hollyhock and sunflower it was a substantial and hardy efflorescence and they fancied that fainterhearted plants would have pined away in that garden where the little fountain leaping up into the joyless light fell back again with a musical shiver the consciousness of this latent cold of winter only held in abeyance by the bright sun was not deeper even in the once magnificent now neglected governors garden where there was actually a rawness in the late afternoon air and whither they were strolling for the view from its height and to pay their duty to the obelisk raised there to the common fame of wolfe and montcalm the sounding latin inscription celebrates the royal governorgeneral who erected it almost as much as the heroes to whom it was raised but these spectators did not begrudge the space given to his praise for so fine a thought merited praise it enforced again the idea of a kind posthumous friendship between wolfe and montcalm which gives their memory its rare distinction and unites them who fell in fight against each other as closely as if they had both died for the same cause  some lasting dignity seems to linger about the city that has once been a capital and this odor of fallen nobility belongs to quebec which was a capital in the european sense with all the advantages of a small viceregal court and its social and political intrigues in the french times under the english for a hundred years it was the centre of colonial civilization and refinement with a governorgenerals residence and a brilliant easy and delightful society to which the large garrison of former days gave gayety and romance the honors of a capital first shared with montreal and toronto now rest with halfsavage ottawa and the garrison has dwindled to a regiment of rifles whose presence would hardly be known but for the natty sergeants lounging stick in hand about the streets and courting the nursemaids but in the days of old there were scenes of carnival pleasure in the governors garden and there the garrison band still plays once a week when it is filled by the fashion and beauty of quebec and some semblance of the past is recalled it is otherwise a lonesome indifferently tended place and on this afternoon there was no one there but a few loafing young fellows of low degree french and english and children that played screaming from seat to seat and path to path and over the tooheavily shaded grass in spite of a conspicuous warning that any dog entering the garden would be destroyed the place was thronged with dogs unmolested and apparently in no danger of the threatened doom the seal of a disagreeable desolation was given in the legend rudely carved upon one of the benches success to the irish republic  the morning of the next day our tourists gave to hearing mass at the french cathedral which was not different to their heretical senses from any other mass except that the ceremony was performed with a very full clerical force and was attended by an uncommonly devout congregation with europe constantly in their minds they were bewildered to find the worshippers not chiefly old and young women but men also of all ages and of every degree from the neat peasant in his sabbathday best to the modish young quebecker who spread his handkerchief on the floor to save his pantaloons during supplication there was fashion and education in large degree among the men and there was in all a pious attention to the function in poetical keeping with the origin and history of a city which the zeal of the church had founded  a magnificent beadle clothed in a goldlaced coat aid bearing a silver staff bowed to them when they entered and leading them to a pew punched up a kneeling peasant who mutely resumed his prayers in the aisle outside while they took his place it appeared to isabel very unjust that their curiosity should displace his religion but she consoled herself by making basil give a shilling to the man who preceded by the shining beadle came round to take up a collection the peasant could have given nothing but copper and she felt that this restored the lost balance of righteousness in their favor there was a sermon very sweetly and gracefully delivered by a young priest of singular beauty even among clergy whose good looks are so notable as those of quebec and then they followed the orderly crowd of worshippers out and left the cathedral to the sacristan and the odor of incense  they thought the type of frenchcanadian better here than at montreal and they particularly noticed the greater number of pretty young girls all classes were well dressed for though the best dressed could not be called stylish according to the american standard as isabel decided and had only a provincial gentility the poorest wore garments that were clean and whole everybody too was going to have a hot sunday dinner if there was any truth in the odors that steamed out of every door and window and this dinner was to be abundantly garnished with onions for the dullest nose could not err concerning that savor  numbers of tourists of a nationality that showed itself superior to every distinction of race were strolling vaguely and not always quite happily about but they made no impression on the proper local character and the air throughout the morning was full of the sentiment of sunday in a catholic city there was the apparently meaningless jangling of bells with profound hushes between and then more jubilant jangling and then deeper silence there was the devout trooping of the crowds to the churches and there was the beginning of the long afternoons lounging and amusement with which the people of that faith reward their mornings devotion little stands for the sale of knotty apples and chokecherries and cakes and cider sprang magically into existence after service and people were already eating and drinking at them the carriagedrivers resumed their chase of the tourists and the unvoiceful stir of the new week had begun again quebec in fact is but a pantomimic reproduction of france it is as if two centuries in a new land amidst the primeval silences of nature and the long hush of the northern winters had stilled the tongues of the lively folk and made them taciturn as we of a graver race they have kept the ancestral vivacity of manner the elegance of the shrug is intact the talking hands take part in dialogue the agitated person will have its share of expression but the loud and eager tone is wanting and their dumb show mystifies the beholder almost as much as the southern architecture under the slanting northern sun it is not america if it is not france what is it  of the many beautiful things to see in the neighborhood of quebec our weddingjourneyers were in doubt on which to bestow their one precious afternoon should it be lorette with its cataract and its remnant of bleached and fading hurons or the isle of orleans with its fertile farms and its primitive peasant life or montmorenci with the unrivaled fall and the long drive through the beautiful village of beauport isabel chose the last because basil had been there before and it had to it the poetry of the wasted years in which she did not know him she had possessed herself of the journal of his early travels among the other portions and parcels recoverable from the dreadful past and from time to time on this journey she had read him passages out of it with mingled sentiment and irony and whether she was mocking or admiring equally to his confusion now as they smoothly bowled away from the city she made him listen to what he had written of the same excursion long ago  it was to be sure a sad farrago of sentiment about the village and the rural sights and especially a girl tossing hay in the field yet it had touches of nature and reality and basil could not utterly despise himself for having written it yes he said life was then a thing to be put into pretty periods now its something that has risks and averages and may be insured  there was regret fancied or expressed in his tone that made her sigh ah if id only had a little more money you might have devoted yourself to literature for she was a true bostonian in her honor of our poor craft  o youre not greatly to blame answered her husband and i forgive you the little wrong youve done me i was quits with the muse at any rate you know before we were married and im very well satisfied to be going back to my applications and policies tomorrow  tomorrow the word struck cold upon her then their wedding journey would begin to end tomorrow so it would she owned with another sigh and yet it seemed impossible  there maam said the driver rising from his seat and facing round while he pointed with his whip towards quebec thats what we call the silver city  they looked back with him at the city whose thousands of tinned roofs rising one above the other from the waters edge to the citadel were all a splendor of argent light in the afternoon sun it was indeed as if some magic had clothed that huge rock base and steepy flank and crest with a silver city they gazed upon the marvel with cries of joy that satisfied the drivers utmost pride in it and isabel said to live there there in that silver city in perpetual sojourn to be always going to go on a morrow that never came to be forever within one day of the end of a wedding journey that never ended  from far down the river by which they rode came the sound of a cannon breaking the sabbath repose of the air thats the gun of the liverpool steamer just coming in said the driver  o cried isabel im thankful were only to stay one night more for now we shall be turned out of our nice room by those people who telegraphed for it  there is a continuous village along the st lawrence from quebec almost to montmorenci and they met crowds of villagers coming from the church as they passed through beauport but basil was dismayed at the change that had befallen them they had their sundays best on and the women instead of wearing the peasant costume in which he had first seen them were now dressed as if out of harpers bazar of the year before he anxiously asked the driver if the broad straw hats and the bright sacks and kirtles were no more o youd see them on weekdays sir was the answer but theyre not so plenty any time as they used to be he opened his store of facts about the habitans whom he praised for every virtuefor thrift for sobriety for neatness for amiability and his words ought to have had the greater weight because he was of the irish race between which and the canadians there is no kindness lost but the looks of the passersby corroborated him and as for the little houses opendoored beside the way with the pleasant faces at window and portal they were miracles of picturesqueness and cleanliness from each the owners slim domain narrowing at every successive division among the abundant generations runs back to hill or river in welldefined lines and beside the cottage is a garden of potherbs bordered with a flame of bright autumn flowers somewhere in decent seclusion grunts the fattening pig which is to enrich all those peas and onions for the winters broth there is a cheerfulness of poultry about the barns i dare be sworn there is always a small girl driving a flock of decorous ducks down the middle of the street and of the priest with a book under his arm passing a wayside shrine what possible doubt the houses which are of one model are built by the peasants themselves with the stone which their land yields more abundantly than any other crop and are furnished with galleries and balconies to catch every ray of the fleeting summer and perhaps to remember the longlost ancestral summers of normandy at every moment in passing through this ideally neat and pretty village our tourists must think of the lovely poem of which all french canada seems but a reminiscence and illustration it was grand pre not beauport and they paid an eager homage to the beautiful genius which has touched those simple village aspects with an undying charm and which whatever the lands political allegiance is there perpetual seigneur  the village stretching along the broad interval of the st lawrence grows sparser as you draw near the falls of montmorenci and presently you drive past the grove shutting from the road the countryhouse in which the duke of kent spent some merry days of his jovial youth and come in sight of two lofty towers of stonemonuments and witnesses of the tragedy of montmorenci  once a suspensionbridge built sorely against the will of the neighboring habitans hung from these towers high over the long plunge of the cataract but one morning of the fatal spring after the first winters frost had tried the hold of the cable on the rocks an old peasant and his wife with their little grandson set out in their cart to pass the bridge as they drew near the middle the anchoring wires suddenly lost their grip upon the shore and whirled into the air the bridge crashed under the hapless passengers and they were launched from its height upon the verge of the fall and thence plunged two hundred and fifty feet into the ruin of the abyss  the habitans rebuilt their bridge of wood upon low stone piers so far up the river from the cataract that whoever fell from it would yet have many a chance for life and it would have been perilous to offer to replace the fallen structure which in the belief of faithful christians clearly belonged to the numerous bridges built by the devil in times when the devil did not call himself a civil engineer  the driver with just unction recounted the sad tale as he halted his horses on the bridge and as his passengers looked down the rockfretted brown torrent towards the fall isabel seized the occasion to shudder that ever she had set foot on that suspensionbridge below niagara and to prove to basils confusion that her doubt of the bridges between the three sisters was not a case of nerves but an instinctive wisdom concerning the unsafety of all bridges of that design  from the gate opening into the grounds about the fall two or three little french boys whom they had not the heart to forbid ran noisily before them with cries in their sole english this way sir and led toward a weatherbeaten summerhouse that tottered upon a projecting rock above the verge of the cataract but our tourists shook their heads and turned away for a more distant and less dizzy enjoyment of the spectacle though any commanding point was sufficiently chasmal and precipitous the lofty bluff was scooped inward from the st lawrence in a vast irregular semicircle with cavernous hollows one within another sinking far into its sides and naked from foot to crest or meagrely wooded here and there with evergreen from the central brink of these gloomy purple chasms the foamy cataract launched itself and like a cloud       along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem  i say a cloud because i find it already said to my hand as it were in a pretty verse and because i must needs liken montmorenci to something that is soft and light yet a cloud does not represent the glinting of the water in its downward swoop it is like some broad slope of sunsmitten snow but snow is coldly white and opaque and this has a creamy warmth in its luminous mass and so there hangs the cataract unsaid as before it is a mystery that anything so grand should be so lovely that anything so tenderly fair in whatever aspect should yet be so large that one glance fails to comprehend it all the rugged wildness of the cliffs and hollows about it is softened by its gracious beauty which half redeems the vulgarity of the timbermerchants uses in setting the river at work in his sawmills and choking its outlet into the st lawrence with rafts of lumber and rubbish of slabs and shingles nay rather it is alone amidst these things and the eye takes note of them by a separate effort  our tourists sank down upon the turf that crept with its white clover to the edge of the precipice and gazed dreamily upon the fall filling their vision with its exquisite color and form being wiser than i they did not try to utter its loveliness they were content to feel it and the perfection of the afternoon whose low sun slanting over the landscape gave under that pale greenishblue sky a pensive sentiment of autumn to the world the crickets cried amongst the grass the hesitating chirp of birds came from the tree overhead a shaggy colt left off grazing in the field and stalked up to stare at them their little guides having found that these people had no pleasure in the sight of small boys scuffling on the verge of a precipice threw themselves also down upon the grass and crooned a long long ballad in a mournful minor key about some maiden whose name was la belle adeline it was a moment of unmixed enjoyment for every sense and through all their being they were glad which considering they ceased to be so with a deep sigh as one reasoning that he dreams must presently awake they never could have an emotion without desiring to analyze it but perhaps their rapture would have ceased as swiftly even if they had not tried to make it a fact of consciousness  if there were not dinner after such experiences as these said isabel as they sat at table that evening i dont know what would become of one but dinner unites the idea of pleasure and duty and brings you gently back to earth you must eat dont you see and theres nothing disgraceful about what youre obliged to do and soits all right  isabel isabel cried her husband you have a wonderful mind and its workings always amaze me but be careful my dear be careful dont work it too hard the human brain you know delicate organ  well you understand what i mean and i think its one of the great charms of a husband that youre not forced to express yourself to him a husband continued isabel sententiously poising a bit of meringue between her thumb and fingerfor they had reached that point in the repast a husband is almost as good as another woman  in the parlor they found the ellisons and exchanged the history of the day with them  certainly said mrs ellison at the end its been a pleasant day enough but what of the night youve been turned out too by those people who came on the steamer and who might as well have stayed on board tonight have you got another room  not precisely said isabel we have a coop in the fifth story right under the roof  mrs ellison turned energetically upon her husband and cried in tones of reproach richard mrs march has a room  a coop she said retorted that amiable colonel and were too good for that the clerk is keeping us in suspense about a room because he means to surprise us with something palatial at the end it s his joking way  nonsense said mrs ellison have you seen him since dinner  i have made life a burden to him for the last halfhour returned the colonel with the kindliest smile  o richard cried his wife in despair of his amendment you wouldnt make life a burden to a mouse and having nothing else for it she laughed half in sorrow half in fondness  well fanny the colonel irrelevantly answered put on your hat and things and lets all go up to durham terrace for a promenade i know our friends want to go its something worth seeing and by the time we get back the clerk will have us a perfectly sumptuous apartment  nothing i think more enforces the illusion of southern europe in quebec than the sundaynight promenading on durham terrace this is the ample space on the brow of the cliff to the left of the citadel the noblest and most commanding position in the whole city which was formerly occupied by the old castle of saint louis where dwelt the brave count frontenac and his splendid successors of the french regime the castle went the way of quebec by fire some forty years ago and lord durham leveled the site and made it a public promenade a stately arcade of solid masonry supports it on the brink of the rock and an iron parapet incloses it there are a few seats to lounge upon and some idle old guns for the children to clamber over and play with a soft twilight had followed the day and there was just enough obscurity to hide from a willing eye the northern and new world facts of the scene and to bring into more romantic relief the citadel dark against the mellow evening and the people gossiping from window to window across the narrow streets of the lower town the terrace itself was densely thronged and there was a constant coming and going of the promenaders who each formally paced back and forth upon the planking for a certain time and then went quietly home giving place to the new arrivals they were nearly all french and they were not generally it seemed of the first fashion but rather of middling condition in life the english being represented only by a few young fellows and now and then a redfaced old gentleman with an indian scarf trailing from his hat there were some fair american costumes and faces in the crowd but it was essentially quebecian the young girls walking in pairs or with their lovers had the true touch of provincial unstylishness the young men the ineffectual excess of the secondrate latin dandy their elders the rich inelegance of a bourgeoisie in their best a few betterfigured avocats or notaires their profession was as unmistakable as if they had carried their wellpolished brass doorplates upon their breasts walked and gravely talked with each other the nonamerican character of the scene was not less vividly marked in the fact that each person dressed according to his own taste and frankly indulged private preferences in shapes and colors one of the promenaders was in white even to his canvas shoes another with yet bolder individuality appeared in perfect purple it had a strange almost portentous effect when these two startling figures met as friends and joined each other in the promenade with linked arms but the evening was already beginning to darken round them and presently the purple comrade was merely a sombre shadow beside the glimmering white  the valleys and the heights now vanished but the river defined itself by the varicolored lights of the ships and steamers that lay dark motionless bulks upon its broad breast the lights of point lewis swarmed upon the other shore the lower town two hundred feet below them stretched an alluring mystery of clustering roofs and lamplit windows and dark and shining streets around the mighty rock muralcrowned suddenly a spectacle peculiarly northern and characteristic of quebec revealed itself a long arch brightened over the northern horizon the tremulous flames of the aurora pallid violet or faintly tinged with crimson shot upward from it and played with a weird apparition and evanescence to the zenith while the strangers looked a gun boomed from the citadel and the wild sweet notes of the bugle sprang out upon the silence  then they all said how perfectly in keeping everything has been and sauntered back to the hotel  the colonel went into the office to give the clerk another turn on the rack and make him confess to a hidden apartment somewhere while isabel left her husband to mrs ellison in the parlor and invited miss kitty to look at her coop in the fifth story as they approached light and music and laughter stole out of an open door next hers and isabel distinguishing the voices of the theatrical party divined that this was the sickchamber and that they were again cheering up the afflicted member of the troupe some one was heard to say well ow do you feel now charley and a sound of subdued swearing responded followed by more laughter and the twanging of a guitar and a snatch of song and a stir of feet and dresses as for departure  the two listeners shrank together as women they could not enjoy these proofs of the jolly camaraderie existing among the people of the troupe they trembled as before the merriment of as many lighthearted careless goodnatured young men it was no harm but it was dismaying and dear cried isabel what shall we do  go back said miss ellison boldly and back they ran to the parlor where they found basil and the colonel and his wife in earnest conclave the colonel like a shrewd strategist was making show of a desperation more violent than his wifes who was thus naturally forced into the attitude of moderating his fury  well fanny thats all he can do for us and i do think it s the most outrageous thing in the world it s real mean  fanny perceived a bold parody of her own denunciatory manner but just then she was obliged to answer isabels eager inquiry whether they had got a room yet yes a room she said with two beds but what are we to do with one room that clerki dont know what to call himcall him a hotelclerk my dear you cant say anything worse interrupted her husbandseems to think the matter perfectly settled  you see mrs march added the colonel hes able to bully us in this way because he has the architecture on his side there isnt another room in the house  let me think a moment said isabel not thinking an instant she had taken a fancy to at least two of these people from the first and in the last hour they had all become very well acquainted now she said ill tell you there are two beds in our room also we ladies will take one room and you gentlemen the other  mrs march i bow to the superiority of the boston mind said the colonel while his females civilly protested and consented and i might almost hail you as our preserver if ever you come to milwaukeewhich is the centre of the world as boston isweishall be happy to have you call at my place of businessi didnt commit myself did i fannyi am sometimes hospitable to excess mrs march he said to explain his aside and now let us reconnoitre lead on madam and the gratitude of the houseless stranger will follow you  the whole party explored both rooms and the ladies decided to keep isabels the colonel was dispatched to see that the wraps and traps of his party were sent to this number and basil went with him the things came long before the gentlemen returned but the ladies happily employed the interval in talking over the excitements of the day and in saying from time to time so very kind of you mrs march and i dont know what we should have done and dont speak of it please and im sure it s a great pleasure to me  in the room adjoining theirs where the invalid actor lay and where lately there had been minstrelsy and apparently dancing for his solace there was now comparative silence two womens voices talked together and now and then a guitar was touched by a wandering hand isabel had just put up her handkerchief to conceal her first yawn when the gentlemen odorous of cigars returned to say goodnight  its the second door from this isnt it isabel asked her husband  yes the second door goodnight goodnight  the two men walked off together but in a minute afterwards they had returned and were knocking tremulously at the closed door  o what has happened chorused the ladies in woeful tune seeing a certain wildness in the face that confronted them  we dont know answered the others in as fearful a key and related how they had found the door of their room ajar and a bright light streaming into the corridor they did not stop to ponder this fact but with the heedlessness of their sex pushed the door wide open when they saw seated before the mirror a bewildering figure with disheveled locks wandering down the back and in dishabille expressive of being quite at home there which turned upon them a pair of pale blue eyes under a forehead remarkable for the straggling fringe of hair that covered it they professed to have remained transfixed at the sight and to have noted a like dismay on the visage before the glass ere they summoned strength to fly these facts colonel ellison gave at the command of his wife with many protests and insincere delays amidst which the curiosity of his hearers alone prevented them from rending him in pieces  and what do you suppose it was demanded his wife with forced calmness when he had at last made an end of the story and his abominable hypoocisies  well i think it was a mermaid  a mermaid said his wife scornfully how do you know  it had a comb in its hand for one thing and besides my dear i hope i know a mermaid when i see it  well said mrs ellison it was no mermaid it was a mistake and im going to see about it will you go with me richard  no money could induce me if its a mistake it isnt proper for me to go if its a mermaid its dangerous  o you coward said the intrepid little woman to a hero of all the fights on shermans march to the sea and presently they heard her attack the mysterious enemy with a ladylike courage claiming the invaded chamber the foe replied with like civility saying the clerk had given her that room with the understanding that another lady was to be put there with her and she had left the door unlocked to admit her the watchers with the sick man next door appeared and confirmed this speech a feeble voice from the bedclothes swore to it  of course added the invader if id known ow it really was i never would lave listened to such a thing never and there isnt another ole in the louse to lay me ead she concluded  then its the clerks fault said mrs ellison glad to retreat unharmed and she made her husband ring for the guilty wretch a pale quiet young frenchman whom the united party sallying into the corridor began to upbraid in one breath the lady in dishabille vanishing as often as she remembered it and reappearing whenever some strong point of argument or denunciation occurred to her  the clerk who was the benjamin of his wicked tribe threw himself upon their mercy and confessed everything the house was so crowded and he had been so crazed by the demands upon him that he had understood colonel ellisons application to be for a bed for the young lady in his party and he had done the very best he could if the lady thereshe vanished againwould give up the room to the two gentlemen he would find her a place with the housekeeper to this the lady consented without difficulty and the rest dispersing she kissed one of the sick mans watchers with isnt it a shame bella and flitted down the darkness of the corridor the rooms upon it seemed all save the two assigned our travellers to be occupied by ladies of the troupe their doors successively opened and she was heard explaining to each as she passed the momentary displeasure which she had shown at her banishment was over she detailed the facts with perfect goodnature and though the others appeared no more than herself to find any humorous cast in the affair they received her narration with the same amiability they uttered their sympathy seriously and each parted from her with some friendly word then all was still  richard said mrs ellison when in isabels room the travellers had briefly celebrated these events i should think youd hate to leave us alone up here  i do but you cant think how i hate to go off alone i wish youd come part of the way with us ladies i do indeed leave your door unlocked at any rate  this prayer uttered at parting outside the room was answered from within by a sound of turning keys and sliding bolts and a low thunder as of bureaus and washstands rolled against the door the ladies are fortifying their position said the colonel to basil and the two returned to their own chamber i dont wish any intrusions he said instantly shutting himself in my nerves are too much shaken now what an awfully mysterious old place this quebec is mr march ill tell you what its my opinion that this is an enchanted castle and if my ribs are not walked over by a muleteer in the course of the night its all i ask  in this and other discourse recalling the famous adventure of don quixote the colonel beguiled the labor of disrobing and had got as far as his boots when there came a startling knock at the door with one boot in his hand and the other on his foot the colonel limped forward i suppose its that clerk has sent to say hes made some other mistake and he flung wide the door and then stood motionless before it dumbly staring at a figure on the thresholda figure with the fringed forehead and pale blue eyes of her whom they had so lately turned out of that room  shrinking behind the side of the doorway excuse me gentlemen she said with a dignity that recalled their scattered senses but will you ave the goodness to look if my beads are on your tableo thanks thanks thanks she continued showing her face and one hand as basil blushingly advanced with a string of heavy black beads piously adorned with a large cross im sure im greatly obliged to you gentlemen and i hask a thousand pardons for troublin you she concluded in a somewhat severe tone that left them abashed and culpable and vanished as mysteriously as she had appeared  now see here said the colonel with a huge sigh as he closed the door again and this time locked it i should like to know how long this sort of thing is to be kept up because if its to be regularly repeated during the night im going to dress again nevertheless he finished undressing and got into bed where he remained for some time silent basil put out the light o im sorry you did that my dear fellow said the colonel but never mind it was an idle curiosity no doubt its my belief that in the landlords extremity of bedlinen ive been put to sleep between a pair of tablecloths and i thought id like to look it seems to me that i make out a checkered pattern on top and a flowered or arabesque pattern underneath i wish they had given me mates it s pretty hard having to sleep between odd tablecloths i shall complain to the landlord of this in the morning ive never had to sleep between odd tablecloths at any hotel before  the colonels voice seemed scarcely to have died away upon basils drowsy ear when suddenly the sounds of music and laughter from the invalids room startled him wide awake the sick mans watchers were coquetting with some one who stood in the little courtyard five stories below a certain breadth of repartee was naturally allowable at that distance the lover avowed his passion in ardent terms and the ladies mocked him with the same freedom now and then totally neglecting him while they sang a snatch of song to the twanging of the guitar or talked professional gossip and then returning to him with some tormenting expression of tenderness  all this abstractly speaking was nothing to basil yet he could recollect few things intended for his pleasure that had given him more satisfaction he thought as he glanced out into the moonlight on the highgabled silvery roofs around and on the gardens of the convents and the towers of the quaint city that the scene wanted nothing of the proper charm of spanish humor and romance and he was as grateful to those poor souls as if they had meant him a favor to us of the hither side of the footlights there is always something fascinating in the life of the strange beings who dwell beyond them and who are never so unreal as in their own characters in their shabby bestowal in those mean upper rooms their tawdry poverty their merry submission to the errors and caprices of destiny their mutual kindliness and careless friendship these unprofitable devotees of the twinklingfooted burlesque seemed to be playing rather than living the life of strolling players and their lovemaking was the last touch of a comedy that basil could hardly accept as reality it was so much more like something seen upon the stage he would not have detracted anything from the commonness and cheapness of the mise en scene for that he reflected drowsily and confusedly helped to give it an air of fact and make it like an episode of fiction but above all he was pleased with the natural eventlessness of the whole adventure which was in perfect agreement with his taste and just as his reveries began to lose shape in dreams he was aware of an absurd pride in the fact that all this could have happened to him in our commonplace time and hemisphere why he thought if i were a student in alcala what better could i have asked and as at last his soul swung out from its moorings and lapsed down the broad slowly circling tides out in the sea of sleep he was conscious of one subtle touch of compassion for those poor strollersa pity so delicate and fine and tender that it hardly seemed his own but rather a sense of the compassion that pities the whole world     x homeward and home  the travellers all met at breakfast and duly discussed the adventures of the night and for the rest the forenoon passed rapidly and slowly with basil and isabel as regret to leave quebec or the natural impatience of travellers to be off overcame them isabel spent part of it in shopping for she had found some small sums of money and certain odd corners in her trunks still unappropriated and the handsome stores on the rue fabrique were very tempting she said she would just go in and look and the wise reader imagines the result as she knelt over her boxes trying so to distribute her purchases as to make them look as if they were oldold things of hers which she had brought all the way round from boston with hera fleeting touch of conscience stayed her hand  basil she said perhaps wed better declare some of these things whats the duty on those she asked pointing to certain articles  i dont know about a hundred per cent ad valorem  cest a dire  as much as they cost  o then dearest responded isabel indignantly it cant be wrong to smuggle i wont declare a thread  thats very well for you whom they wont ask but what if they ask me whether theres anything to declare  isabel looked at her husband and hesitated then she replied in terms that i am proud to record in honor of american womanhood you mustnt fib aboutit basil heroically i couldnt respect you if you did tenderly but with decision you must slip out of it some way  the ladies of the ellison party to whom she put the case in the parlor agreed with her perfectly they also had done a little shopping in quebec and they meant to do more at montreal before they returned to the states mrs ellison was disposed to look upon isabels compunctions as a kind of treason to the sex to be forgiven only because so quickly repented  the ellisons were going up the saguenay before coming on to boston and urged our friends hard to go with them no that must be for another time said isabel mr march has to be home by a certain day and we shall just get back in season then she made them promise to spend a day with her in boston and the colonel coming to say that he had a carriage at the door for their excursion to lorette the two parties bade goodby with affection and many explicit hopes of meeting soon again  what do you think of them dearest demanded isabel as she sallied out with basil for a final look at quebec  the young lady is the nicest and the other is well enough too she is a good deal like you but with the sense of humor left out youve only enough to save you  well her husband is jolly enough for both of them hes funnier than you basil and he hasnt any of your little languid airs and affectations i dont know but im a bit disappointed in my choice darling but i dare say i shall work out of it in fact i dont know but the colonel is a little too jolly this drolling everything is rather fatiguing and having begun they did not stop till they had taken their friends to pieces dismayed then they hastily reconstructed them and said that they were among the pleasantest people they ever knew and they were really very sorry to part with them and they should do everything to make them have a good time in boston  they were sauntering towards durham terrace where they leaned long upon the iron parapet and blest themselves with the beauty of the prospect a tender haze hung upon the landscape and subdued it till the scene was as a dream before them as in a dream the river lay and dreamlike the shipping moved or rested on its deep broad bosom far off stretched the happy fields with their dim white villages farther still the mellow heights melted into the low hovering heaven the tinned roofs of the lower town twinkled in the morning sun around them on every hand on that monday forenoon when the states were stirring from ocean to ocean in feverish industry drowsed the gray city within her walls from the flagstaff of the citadel hung the red banner of saint george in sleep  their hearts were strangely and deeply moved it seemed to them that they looked upon the last stronghold of the past and that afar off to the southward they could hear the marching hosts of the invading present and as no young and loving soul can relinquish old things without a pang they sighed a long mute farewell to quebec  next summer they would come again yes but ah me every one knows what next summer is     part of the burlesque troupe rode down in the omnibus to the grand trunk  ferry with them and were goodnatured to the last having shaken hands all round with the waiters chambermaids and porters of the hotel the young fellow with the bad amiable face came in a calash and refused to overpay the driver with a gay decision that made him basils envy till he saw his tribulation in getting the troupes luggage checked there were forty pieces and it always remained a mystery considering the small amount of clothing necessary to those people on the stage what could have filled their trunks the young man and the two english blondes of american birth found places in the same car with our tourists and enlivened the journey with their frolics when the young man pretended to fall asleep they wrapped his golden curly head in a shawl and vexed him with many thumps and thrusts till he bought a brief truce with a handful of almonds and the ladies having no other way to eat them one of them saucily snatched off her shoe and cracked them hammerwise with the heel it was all so pleasant that it ought to have been all right and in their merry world of outlawry perhaps things are not so bad as we like to think them  the country into which the train plunges as soon as quebec is out of sight is very stupidly savage and our friends had little else to do but to watch the gambols of the players till they came to the river st francis whose wandering loveliness the road follows through an infinite series of soft and beautiful landscapes and finds everywhere glassing in its smooth current the elms and willows of its gentle shores at one place where its calm broke into foamy rapids there was a huge saw mill covering the stream with logs and refuse and the banks with whole cities of lumber which also they accepted as no mean elements of the picturesque they clung the most tenderly to traces of the peasant life they were leaving when some french boys came aboard with wild raspberries to sell in little birchbark canoes they thrilled with pleasure and bought them but sighed then and said what thing characteristic of the local life will they sell us in maine when we get there a section of pie poetically wrapt in a broad leaf of the squashvine or popcorn in its native tissuepaper and advertising the new dollar store in portland they saw the quaintness vanish from the farmhouses first the dormerwindows then the curve of the steep roof then the steep roof itself by and by they came to a store with a grecian portico and four square pine pillars they shuddered and looked no more  the guiltily dreaded examination of baggage at island pond took place at nine oclock without costing them a cent of duty or a pang of conscience at that charming station the trunks are piled higgledypiggledy into a room beside the track where a few inspectors with stifling lamps of smoky kerosene await the passengers there are no porters to arrange the baggage and each lady and gentleman digs out his box and opens it before the lordly inspector who stirs up its contents with an unpleasant hand and passes it he makes you feel that you are once more in the land of official insolence and that whatever you are collectively you are nothing personally isabel who had sent her husband upon this business with quaking meekness of heart experienced the bold indignation of virtue at his account of the way people were made their own baggagesmashers and would not be amused when he painted the vile terrors of each husband as he tremblingly unlocked his wifes store of contraband  the morning light showed them the broad elmy meadows of westernlooking maine and the grand trunk brought them of course an hour behind time into portland all breakfastless they hurried aboard the boston train on the eastern road and all along that line which is built to show how uninteresting the earth can be when she is ennuyee of both sea and land basils life became a struggle to construct a meal from the fragmentary opportunities of twenty different stations where they stopped five minutes for refreshments at one place he achieved two cups of shameless chickory at another three sardines at a third a dessert of elderly bananas       home again home again from a foreign shore  they softly sang as the successive courses of this feast were disposed of  the drouth and heat which they had briefly escaped during their sojourn in canada brooded sovereign upon the tiresome landscape the red granite rocks were as if redhot the banks of the deep cuts were like ash heaps over the fields danced the sultry atmosphere they fancied that they almost heard the grasshoppers sing above the rattle of the train when they reached boston at last they were dustier than most of us would like to be a hundred years hence the whole city was equally dusty and they found the trees in the square before their own door gray with dust the bit of virginiacreeper planted under the window hung shriveled upon its trellis  but isabels aunt met them with a refreshing shower of tears and kisses in the hall throwing a solid arm about each of them o you dears the good soul cried you dont know how anxious ive been about you so many accidents happening all the time ive never read the evening transcript till the next morning for fear i should find your names among the killed and wounded  o aunty youre too good always whimpered isabel and neither of the women took note of basil who said yes it s probably the only thing that preserved our lives  the little tinge of discontent which had colored their sentiment of return faded now in the kindly light of home their holiday was over to be sure but their bliss had but began they had entered upon that long life of holidays which is happy marriage by the time dinner was ended they were both enthusiastic at having got back and taking their aunt between them walked up and down the parlor with their arms round her massive waist and talked out the gladness of their souls  then basil said he really must run down to the office that afternoon and he issued all aglow upon the street he was so full of having been long away and of having just returned that he unconsciously tried to impart his mood to boston and the dusty composure of the street and houses as he strode along bewildered him he longed for some familiar face to welcome him and in the horsecar into which he stepped he was charmed to see an acquaintance this was a man for whom ordinarily he cared nothing and whom he would perhaps rather have gone out upon the platform to avoid than have spoken to but now he plunged at him with effusion and wrung his hand smiling from ear to ear  the other remained coldly unaffected after a first start of surprise at his cordiality and then reviled the dust and heat but im going to take a little run down to newport tomorrow for a week he said by the way you look as if you needed a little change arent you going anywhere this summer  so you see my dear observed basil when he had recounted the fact to isabel at tea our travels are incommunicably our own we had best say nothing about our little jaunt to other people and they wont know weve been gone even if we tried we couldnt make our weddingjourney theirs  she gave him a great kiss of recompense and consolation who wants it she demanded to be their wedding journey     niagara revisited twelve years after their wedding journey  life had not used them ill in this time and the fairish treatment they had received was not wholly unmerited the twelve years past had made them older as the years must in passing basil was now fortytwo and his moustache was well sprinkled with gray isabel was thirtynine and the parting of her hair had thinned and retreated but she managed to give it an effect of youthful abundance by combing it low down upon her forehead and roughing it there with a wet brush by gaslight she was still very pretty she believed that she looked more interesting and she thought basils gray moustache distinguished he had grown stouter he filled his doublebreasted frock coat compactly and from time to time he had the buttons set forward his hands were rounded up on the backs and he no longer wore his old number of gloves by two sizes no amount of powder or manipulation from the young lady in the shop would induce them to go on but this did not matter much now for he seldom wore gloves at all he was glad that the fashion suffered him to spare in that direction for he was obliged to look somewhat carefully after the outgoes the insurance business was not what it had been and though basil had comfortably established himself in it he had not made money he sometimes thought that he might have done quite as well if he had gone into literature but it was now too late they had not a very large family they had a boy of eleven who took after his father and a girl of nine who took after the boy but with the american feeling that their children must have the best of everything they made it an expensive family and they spent nearly all basil earned  the narrowness of their means as well as their household cares had kept them from taking many long journeys they passed their winters in boston and their summers on the south shore cheaper than the north shore and near enough for basil to go up and down every day for business but they promised themselves that some day they would revisit certain points on their wedding journey and perhaps somewhere find their lost secondyouth on the track it was not that they cared to be young but they wished the children to see them as they used to be when they thought themselves very old and one lovely afternoon in june they started for niagara  it had been very hot for several days but that morning the east wind came in and crisped the air till it seemed to rustle like tinsel and the sky was as sincerely and solidly blue as if it had been chromoed they felt that they were really looking up into the roof of the world when they glanced at it but when an old gentleman hastily kissed a young woman and commended her to the conductor as being one who was going all the way to san francisco alone and then risked his life by stepping off the moving train the vastness of the great american fact began to affect isabel disagreeably is nt it too big basil she pleaded peering timidly out of the little municipal consciousness in which she had been so long housedin that seclusion she had suffered certain original tendencies to increase upon her her nerves were more sensitive and electrical her apprehensions had multiplied quite beyond the ratio of the dangers that beset her and basil had counted upon a tonic effect of the change the journey would make in their daily lives she looked ruefully out of the window at the familiar suburbs whisking out of sight and the continental immensity that advanced devouringly upon her but they had the best section in the very centre of the sleepingcarshe drew what consolation she could from the factand the childrens premature demand for lunch helped her to forget her anxieties they began to be hungry as soon as the train started she found that she had not put up sandwiches enough and when she told basil that he would have to get out somewhere and buy some cold chicken he asked her what in the world had become of that whole ham she had had boiled it seemed to him he said that there was enough of it to subsist them to niagara and back and he went on as some men do while somerville vanished and even tufts college which assails the bostonian vision from every point of the compass was shut out by the curve at the foot of the belmont hills  they had chosen the hoosac tunnel route to niagara because as basil said their experience of travel had never yet included a very long tunnel and it would be a signal fact by which the children would always remember the journey if nothing else remarkable happened to impress it upon them indeed they were so much concerned in it that they began to ask when they should come to this tunnel even before they began to ask for lunch and the long time before they reached it was not perceptibly shortened by toms quarterhourly consultations of his fathers watch  it scarcely seemed to basil and isabel that their fellowpassengers were so interesting as their fellow passengers used to be in their former days of travel they were soberly dressed and were all of a middleaged sobriety of deportment from which nothing salient offered itself for conjecture or speculation and there was little within the car to take their minds from the brilliant young world that flashed and sang by them outside the belated spring had ripened with its frequent rains into the perfection of early summer the grass was thicker and the foliage denser than they had ever seen it before and when they had run out into the hills beyond fitchburg they saw the laurel in bloom it was everywhere in the woods lurking like drifts among the underbrush and overflowing the tops and stealing down the hollows of the railroad embankments a snow of blossom flushed with a mist of pink its shy wild beauty ceased whenever the train stopped but the orioles made up for its absence with their singing in the village trees about the stations and though fitchburg and ayers junction and athol are not names that invoke historical or romantic associations the hearts of basil and isabel began to stir with the joy of travel before they had passed these points at the first basil got out to buy the cold chicken which had been commanded and he recognized in the keeper of the railroad restaurant their former conductor who had been warned by the spirits never to travel without a flower of some sort carried between his lips and who had preserved his own life and the lives of his passengers for many years by this simple device his presence lent the sponge cake and rhubarb pie and baked beans a supernatural interest and reconciled basil to the toughness of the athletic bird which the mystical expartner of fate had sold him he justly reflected that if he had heard the story of the restaurateurs superstition in a foreign land or another time he would have found in it a certain poetry it was this willingness to find poetry in things around them that kept his life and isabels fresh and they taught their children the secret of their elixir to be sure it was only a genre poetry but it was such as has always inspired english art and song and now the whole family enjoyed as if it had been a passage from goldsmith or wordsworth the flying sentiment of the railroad side there was a simple interior at one placea small shanty showing through the open door a cook stove surmounted by the evening coffeepot with a lazy cat outstretched upon the floor in the middle distance and an old woman standing just outside the threshold to see the train go bywhich had an unrivaled value till they came to a superannuated car on a siding in the woods in which the railroad workmen boardedsome were lounging on the platform and at the open windows while others were washing up for supper and the whole scene was full of holiday ease and sylvan comradery that went to the hearts of the sympathetic spectators basil had lately been reading aloud the delightful history of rudder grange and the children who had made their secret vows never to live in anything but an old canalboat when they grew up owned that there were fascinating possibilities in a wornout railroad car  the lovely deerfield valley began to open on either hand with smooth stretches of the quiet river and breadths of grassy intervale and tableland the elms grouped themselves like the trees of a park here and there the nearer hills broke away and revealed long deep chasmed hollows full of golden light and delicious shadow there were people rowing on the water and every pretty town had some touch of picturesqueness or pastoral charm to offer at greenfield there were children playing in the newmown hay along the railroad embankment at shelburne falls there was a game of cricket going on among the english operatives of the cutlery works as basil boldly asserted they looked down from their carwindow on a young lady swinging in a hammock in her dooryard and on an old gentleman hoeing his potatoes a group of girls waved their handkerchiefs to the passing train and a boy paused in weeding a gardenbedand probably denied that he had paused later in the mean time the golden haze along the mountain side changed to a clear pearly lustre and the quiet evening possessed the quiet landscape they confessed to each other that it was all as sweet and beautiful as it used to be and in fact they had seen palaces in other days which did not give them the pleasure they found in a woodcutters shanty losing itself among the shadows in a solitude of the hills the tunnel after this was a gross and material sensation but they joined the children in trying to hold and keep it and basil let the boy time it by his watch now said tom when five minutes were gone we are under the very centre of the mountain but the tunnel was like all accomplished facts all hopes fulfilled valueless to the soul and scarcely appreciable to the sense and the children emerged at north adams with but a mean opinion of that great feat of engineering basil drew a pretty moral from their experience if you rode upon a comet you would be disappointed take my advice and never ride upon a comet i shouldnt object to your riding on a little meteoryou would nt expect much of that but i warn you against comets they are as bad as tunnels  the children thought this moral was a joke at their expense and as they were a little sleepy they permitted themselves the luxury of feeling trifled with but they woke refreshed and encouraged from slumbers that had evidently been unbroken though they both protested that they had not slept a wink the whole night and gave themselves up to wonder at the interminable levels of western new york over which the train was running the longing to come to an edge somewhere that the new england traveler experiences on this plain was inarticulate with the children but it breathed in the sigh with which isabel welcomed even the architectural inequalities of a city into which they drew in the early morning this city showed to their weary eyes a noble stretch of river from the waters of which lofty piles of buildings rose abruptly and isabel being left to guess where they were could think of no other place so picturesque as rochester  yes said her husband it is our own enchanted city i wonder if that unstinted hospitality is still dispensed by the good head waiter at the hotel where we stopped to bridal parties who have passed the ordeal of the haughty hotel clerk i wonder what has become of that hotel clerk has he fallen through pride to some lower level or has he bowed his arrogant spirit to the demands of advancing civilization and realized that he is the servant and not the master of the public i think ive noticed since his time a growing kindness in hotel clerks or perhaps i have become of a more impressive presence they certainly unbend to me a little more i should like to go up to our hotel and try myself on our old enemy if he is still there i can fancy how his shirt front has expanded in these twelve years past he has grown a little bald after the fashion of middleaged hotel clerks but he parts his hair very much on one side and brushes it squarely across his forehead to hide his loss the forefinger that he touches that little snapbell with when he doesnt look at you must be very pudgy now come let us get out and breakfast at rochester they will give us broiled whitefish and we can show the children where sam patch jumped over genesee falls and  no no basil cried his wife it would be sacrilege all that is sacred to those dear young days of ours and i wouldnt think of trying to repeat it our own ghosts would rise up in that diningroom to reproach us for our intrusion oh perhaps we have done a wicked thing in coming this journey we ought to have left the past alone we shall only mar our memories of all these beautiful places do you suppose buffalo can be as poetical as it was then buffalo the name does nt invite the muse very much perhaps it never was very poetical oh basil dear im afraid we have only come to find out that we were mistaken about everything lets leave rochester alone at any rate  im not troubled we wont disturb our dream of rochester but i dont despair of buffalo im sure that buffalo will be all that our fancy ever painted it i believe in buffalo  well well murmured isabel i hope youre right and she put some things together for leaving their car at buffalo while they were still two hours away  when they reached a place where the land mated its level with the level of the lake they ran into a wilderness of railroad cars in a world where life seemed to be operated solely by locomotives and their helpless minions the bellowing and bleating trains were arriving in every direction not only along the ground floor of the plain but stately stretches of trestlework which curved and extended across the plain carried them to and fro overhead the travelers owned that this railroad suburb had its own impressiveness and they said that the trestlework was as noble in effect as the lines of aqueduct that stalk across the roman campagna perhaps this was because they had not seen the campagna or its aqueducts for a great while but they were so glad to find themselves in the spirit of their former journey again that they were amiable to everything when the children first caught sight of the lakes delicious blue and cried out that it was lovelier than the sea they felt quite a local pride in their preference it was what isabel had said twelve years before on first beholding the lake  but they did not really see the lake till they had taken the train for niagara falls after breakfasting in the depot where the children used to the severe native or the patronizing irish ministrations of boston restaurants and hotels reveled for the first time in the affectionate devotion of a black waiter there was already a ridiculous abundance and variety on the table but this waiter brought them strawberries and again strawberries and repeated plates of griddle cakes with maple syrup and he hung over the back of first one chair and then another with an unselfish joy in the appetites of the breakfasters which gave basil renewed hopes of his race such rapture in serving argues a largeness of nature which will be recognized hereafter he said feeling about in his waistcoat pocket for a quarter it seemed a pity to render the waiters zeal retroactively interested but in view of the fact that he possibly expected the quarter there was nothing else to do and by a mysterious stroke of gratitude the waiter delivered them into the hands of a friend who took another quarter from them for carrying their bags and wraps to the train this second retainer approved their admiration of the aesthetic forms and colors of the depot colonnade and being asked if that were the depot whose roof had fallen in some years before proudly replied that it was  there were a great many killed were nt there asked basil with sympathetic satisfaction in the disaster the porter seemed humiliated he confessed the mortifying truth that the loss of life was small but he recovered a just selfrespect in adding if the roof had fallen in five minutes sooner it would have killed about three hundred people  basil had promised the children a sight of the rapids before they reached the falls and they held him rigidly accountable from the moment they entered the train and began to run out of the city between the river and the canal he attempted a diversion with the canal boats and tried to bring forward the subject of rudder grange in that connection they said that the canal boats were splendid but they were looking for the rapids now and they declined to be interested in a window in one of the boats which basil said was just like the window that the rudder granger and the boarder had popped pomona out of when they took her for a burglar  you spoil those children basil said his wife as they clambered over him and clamored for the rapids  at present im giving them an objectlesson in patience and selfdenial they are experiencing the fact that they cant have the rapids till they get to them and probably theyll be disappointed in them when they arrive  in fact they valued the rapids very little more than the hoosac tunnel when they came in sight of them at last and basil had some question in his own mind whether the rapids had not dwindled since his former visit he did not breathe this doubt to isabel however and she arrived at the falls with unabated expectations they were going to spend only half a day there and they turned into the station away from the phalanx of omnibuses when they dismounted from their train they seemed as before to be the only passengers who had arrived and they found an abundant choice of carriages waiting in the street outside the station the niagara hackman may once have been a predatory and very rampant animal but public opinion long expressed through the public prints has reduced him to silence and meekness apparently he may not so much as beckon with his whip to the arriving wayfarer it is certain that he cannot cross the pavement to the station door and basil inviting one of them to negotiation was himself required by the attendant policeman to step out to the curbstone and complete his transaction there it was an impressive illustration of the power of a free press but upon the whole basil found the effect melancholy it had the saddening quality which inheres in every sort of perfection the hackman reduced to entire order appealed to his compassion and he had not the heart to beat him down from his moderate first demand as perhaps he ought to have done they drove directly to the cataract and found themselves in the pretty grove beside the american fall and in the air whose dampness was as familiar as if they had breathed it all their childhood it was full now of the fragrance of some sort of wild blossom and again they had that old entrancing sense of the mingled awfulness and loveliness of the great spectacle this sylvan perfume the gayety of the sunshine the mildness of the breeze that stirred the leaves overhead and the birdsinging that made itself heard amid the roar of the rapids and the solemn incessant plunge of the cataract moved their hearts and made them children with the boy and girl who stood rapt for a moment and then broke into joyful wonder they could sympathize with the ardor with which tom longed to tempt fate at the brink of the river and over the tops of the parapets which have been built along the edge of the precipice and they equally entered into the terror with which bella screamed at his suicidal zeal they joined her in restraining him they reduced him to a beggarly account of half a dozen stones flung into the rapids at not less than ten paces from the brink and they would not let him toss the smallest pebble over the parapet though he laughed to scorn the notion that anybody should be hurt by them below  it seemed to them that the triviality of man in the surroundings of the falls had increased with the lapse of time there were more booths and bazaars and more colored feather fans with whole birds spitted in the centres and there was an offensive array of blue and green and yellow glasses on the shore through which you were expected to look at the falls gratis they missed the simple dignity of the blanching indian maids who used to squat about on the grass with their laps full of moccasins and pincushions but as of old the photographer came out of his saloon and invited them to pose for a family group representing that the light and the spray were singularly propitious and that everything in nature invited them to be taken basil put him off gently for the sake of the time when he had refused to be photographed in a bridal group and took refuge from him in the long low building from which you descend to the foot of the cataract  the grove beside the american fall has been inclosed and named prospect park by a company which exacts half a dollar for admittance and then makes you free of all its wonders and conveniences for which you once had to pay severally this is well enough but formerly you could refuse to go down the inclined tramway and now you cannot without feeling that you have failed to get your moneys worth it was in this illogical spirit of economy that basil invited his family to the descent but isabel shook her head no you go with the children she said and i will stay here till you get back her agonized countenance added and pray for you and basil took his children on either side of him and rumbled down the terrible descent with much of the excitement that attends travel in an open horsecar when he stepped out of the car he felt that increase of courage which comes to every man after safely passing through danger he resolved to brave the mists and slipperystones at the foot of the fall and he would have plunged at once into this fresh peril if he had not been prevented by the prospect park company this ingenious association has built a large tunnellike shed quite to the waters edge so that you cannot view the cataract as you once could at a reasonable remoteness but must emerge from the building into a storm of spray the roof of the tunnel is painted with a lively effect in partycolored stripes and is lettered the shadow of the rock so that you take it at first to be an appeal to your aesthetic sense but the real object of the company is not apparent till you put your head out into the tempest when you agree with the nearest guideand one is always very nearthat you had better have an oilskin dress as basil did he told the guide that he did not wish to go under the fall and the guide confidentially admitted that there was no fun in that any way and in the mean time he equipped him and his children for their foray into the mist when they issued forth under their friends leadership basil felt that with his children clinging to each hand he looked like some sort of animal with its young and though not unsocial by nature he was glad to be among strangers for the time they climbed hither and thither over the rocks and lifted their streaming faces for the views which the guide pointed out and in a rift of the spray they really caught one glorious glimpse of the whole sweep of the fall the next instant the spray swirled back and they were glad to turn for a sight of the rainbow lying in a circle on the rocks as quietly and naturally as if that had been the habit of rainbows ever since the flood this was all there was to be done and they streamed back into the tunnel where they disrobed in the face of a menacing placard which announced that the hire of a guide and a dress for going under the fall was one dollar  will they make you pay a dollar for each of us papa asked tom fearfully  oh pooh no returned basil we have nt been under the fall but he sought out the proprietor with a trembling heart the proprietor was a man of severely logical mind he said that the charge would be three dollars for they had had the use of the dresses and the guide just the same as if they had gone under the fall and he refused to recognize anything misleading in the dressingroom placard in fine he left basil without a leg to stand upon it was not so much the three dollars as the sense of having been swindled that vexed him and he instantly resolved not to share his annoyance with isabel why indeed should he put that burden upon her if she were none the wiser she would be none the poorer and he ought to be willing to deny himself her sympathy for the sake of sparing her needless pain  he met her at the top of the inclined tramway with a face of exemplary unconsciousness and he listened with her to the tale their coachman told as they sat in a pretty arbor looking out on the rapids of a frenchman and his wife this frenchman had returned one morning from a stroll on goat island and reported with much apparent concern that his wife had fallen into the water and been carried over the fall it was so natural for a man to grieve for the loss of his wife under the peculiar circumstances that every one condoled with the widower but when a few days later her body was found and the distracted husband refused to come back from new york to her funeral there was a general regret that he had not been arrested a flash of conviction illumed the whole fact to basils guilty consciousness this unhappy frenchman had paid a dollar for the use of an oilskin suit at the foot of the fall and had been ashamed to confess the swindle to his wife till in a moment of remorse and madness he shouted the fact into her ear and then basil looked at the mother of his children and registered a vow that if he got away from niagara without being forced to a similar excess he would confess his guilt to isabel at the very first act of spendthrift profusion she committed the guide pointed out the rock in the rapids to which avery had clung for twentyfour hours before he was carried over the falls and to the morbid fancy of the deceitful husband isabels bonnet ribbons seemed to flutter from the pointed reef he could endure the pretty arbor no longer come children he cried with a wild unnatural gayety let us go to goat island and see the bridge to the three sisters that your mother was afraid to walk back on after she had crossed it  for shame basil retorted isabel you know it was you who were afraid of that bridge  the children who knew the story by heart laughed with their father at the monstrous pretension and his simulated hilarity only increased upon paying a toll of two dollars at the goat island bridge  what extortion cried isabel with an indignation that secretly unnerved him he trembled upon the verge of confession but he had finally the moral force to resist he suffered her to compute the cost of their stay at niagara without allowing those three dollars to enter into her calculation he even began to think what justificative extravagance he could tempt her to he suggested the purchase of local bricabrac he asked her if she would not like to dine at the international for old times sake but she answered with disheartening virtue that they must not think of such a thing after what they had spent already nothing perhaps marked the confirmed husband in basil more than these hidden fears and reluctances  in the mean time isabel ignorantly abandoned herself to the charm of the place which she found unimpaired in spite of the reported ravages of improvement about niagara goat island was still the sylvan solitude of twelve years ago haunted by even fewer nymphs and dryads than of old the air was full of the perfume that scented it at prospect park the leaves showered them with shade and sun as they drove along if it were not for the children here she said i should think that our first drive on goat island had never ended  she sighed a little and basil leaned forward and took her hand in his it never has ended its the same drive only we are younger now and enjoy it more it always touched him when isabel was sentimental about the past for the years had tended to make her rather more seriously maternal towards him than towards the other children and he recognized that these fond reminiscences were the expression of the girlhood still lurking deep within her heart  she shook her head no but im willing the children should be young in our place its only fair they should have their turn  she remained in the carriage while basil visited the various points of view on luna island with the boy and girl a boy is probably of considerable interest to himself and a man looks back at his own boyhood with some pathos but in his actuality a boy has very little to commend him to the toleration of other human beings tom was very well as boys go but now his contribution to the common enjoyment was to venture as near as possible to all perilous edges to throw stones into the water and to make as if to throw them over precipices on the people below to pepper his father with questions and to collect cumbrous mementos of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms he kept the carriage waiting a good five minutes while he could cut his initials on a bandrail you can come back and see em on your bridal tower said the driver isabel gave a little start as if she had almost thought of something she was trying to think of  they occasionally met ladies driving and sometimes they encountered a couple making a tour of the island on foot but none of these people were young and basil reported that the three sisters were inhabited only by persons of like maturity even a group of people who were eating lunch to the music of the shouting rapids on the outer edge of the last sister were no younger apparently  isabel did not get out of the carriage to verify his report she preferred to refute his story of her former panic on those islands by remaining serenely seated while he visited them she thus lost a superb novelty which nature has lately added to the wonders of this fall in that place at the edge of the great horse shoe where the rock has fallen and left a peculiarly shaped chasm through this the spray leaps up from below and flashes a hundred feet into the air in rocketlike jets and points and then breaks and dissolves away in the pyrotechnic curves of a perpetual fourth of july basil said something like this in celebrating the display with the purpose of rendering her loss more poignant but she replied with tranquil piety that she would rather keep her niagara unchanged and she declared that as she understood him there must be something rather cheap and conscious in the new feature she approved however of the change that had removed that foolish little terrapin tower from the brink on which it stood and she confessed that she could have enjoyed a little variety in the stories the driver told them of the indian burialground on the island they were exactly the stories she and basil had heard twelve years before and the illstarred goats from which the island took its name perished once more in his narrative  under the influence of his romances our travelers began to find the whole scene hackneyed and they were glad to part from him a little sooner than they had bargained to do they strolled about the anomalous village on foot and once more marveled at the paucity of travel and the enormity of the local preparation surely the hotels are nowhere else in the world so large could there ever have been visitors enough at niagara to fill them they were built so big for some good reason no doubt but it is no more apparent than why all these magnificent equipages are waiting about the empty streets for the people who never come to hire them  it seems to me that i dont see so many strangers here as i used basil had suggested to their driver  oh they have nt commenced coming yet he replied with hardy cheerfulness and pretended that they were plenty enough in july and august  they went to dine at the modest restaurant of a colored man who advertised a table dhote dinner on a board at his door and they put their misgivings to him which seemed to grieve him and he contended that niagara was as prosperous and as much resorted to as ever in fact they observed that their regret for the supposed decline of the falls as a summer resort was nowhere popular in the village and they desisted in their offers of sympathy after their rebuff from the restaurateur  basil got his family away to the station after dinner and left them there while he walked down the village street for a closer inspection of the hotels at the door of the largest a pair of children sported in the solitude as fearlessly as the birds on selkirks island looking into the hotel he saw a few porters and callboys seated in statuesque repose against the wall while the clerk pined in dreamless inactivity behind the register some deserted ladies flitted through the door of the parlor at the side he recalled the evening of his former visit when he and isabel had met the ellisons in that parlor and it seemed in the retrospect a scene of the wildest gayety he turned for consolation into the barbers shop where he found himself the only customer and no busy sound of next greeted his ear but the barber like all the rest said that niagara was not unusually empty and he came out feeling bewildered and defrauded surely the agent of the boats which descend the rapids of the st lawrence must be frank if basil went to him and pretended that he was going to buy a ticket but a glance at the agents sign showed basil that the agent with his brave jollity of manner and his impressive goodmorning had passed away from the deceits of travel and that he was now inherited by his widow who in turn was absent and temporarily represented by their son the boy in supplying basil with an advertisement of the line made a specious show of haste as if there were a long queue of tourists waiting behind him to be served with tickets perhaps there was indeed a spectral line there but basil was the only tourist present in the flesh and he shivered in his isolation and fled with the advertisement in his hand isabel met him at the door of the station with a frightened face  basil she cried i have found out what the trouble is where are the brides  he took her outstretched hands in his and passing one of them through his arm walked with her apart from the children who were examining at the newsmans booth the moccasins and the birchbark bricabrac of the irish aborigines and the cups and vases of niagara spar imported from devonshire  my dear he said there are no brides everybody was married twelve years ago and the brides are middleaged mothers of families now and dont come to niagara if they are wise  yes she desolately asserted that is so something has been hanging over me ever since we came and suddenly i realized that it was the absence of the brides butbutdown at the hotelsdidnt you see anything bridal there when the omnibuses arrived was there no burst of minstrelsy was there  she could not go on but sank nervelessly into the nearest seat  perhaps said basil dreamily regarding the contest of tom and bella for a newlypurchased paper of sour cherries and helplessly forecasting in his remoter mind the probable consequences there were both brides and minstrelsy at the hotel if i had only had the eyes to see and the ears to hear in this world my dear we are always of our own time and we live amid contemporary things i daresay there were middleaged people at niagara when we were here before but we did not meet them nor they us i daresay that the place is now swarming with bridal couples and it is because they are invisible and inaudible to us that it seems such a howling wilderness but the hotel clerks and the restaurateurs and the hackmen know them and that is the reason why they receive with surprise and even offense our sympathy for their loneliness do you suppose isabel that if you were to lay your head on my shoulder in a bridal manner it would do anything to bring us en rapport with that lost bridal world again  isabel caught away her hand basil she cried it would be disgusting i wouldnt do it for the worldnot even for that world i saw one middleaged couple on goat island while you were down at the cave of the winds or somewhere with the children they were sitting on some steps he a step below her and he seemed to want to put his head on her knee but i gazed at him sternly and he didnt dare we should look like them if we yielded to any outburst of affection dont you think we should look like them  i dont know said basil you are certainly a little wrinkled my dear  and you are very fat basil  they glanced at each other with a flash of resentment and then they both laughed we couldnt look young if we quarreled a week he said we had better content ourselves with feeling young as i hope we shall do if we live to be ninety it will be the loss of others if they dont see our bloom upon us shall i get you a paper of cherries isabel the children seem to be enjoying them  isabel sprang upon her offspring with a cry of despair oh what shall i do now we shall not have a wink of sleep with them tonight where is that nux she hunted for the medicine in her bag and the children submitted for they had eaten all the cherries and they took their medicine without a murmur i wonder at your letting them eat the sour things basil said their mother when the children bad run off to the newsstand again  i wonder that you left me to see what they were doing promptly retorted their father  it was your nonsense about the brides said isabel and i think this has been a lesson to us dont let them get anything else to eat dearest  they are safe they have no more money they are frugally confining themselves to the admiration of the japanese bows and arrows yonder why have our indians taken to making japanese bows and arrows  isabel despised the small pleasantry then you saw nobody at the hotel she asked  not even the ellisons said basil  ah yes said isabel that was where we met them how long ago it seems and poor little kitty i wonder what has become of them but im glad theyre not here thats what makes you realize your age meeting the same people in the same place a great while after and seeing how oldtheyve grown i dont think i could bear to see kitty ellison again im glad she did nt come to visit us in boston though after what happened she could nt poor thing i wonder if she s ever regretted her breaking with him in the way she did its a very painful thing to think ofsuch an inconclusive conclusion it always seemed as if they ought to meet again somewhere  i dont believe she ever wished it  a man cant tell what a woman wishes  well neither can a woman returned basil lightly  his wife remained serious it was a very fine pointa very little thing to reject a man for i felt that when i first read her letter about it  basil yawned i dont believe i ever knew just what the point was  oh yes you did but you forget everything you know that they met two boston ladies just after they were engaged and she believed that he did nt introduce her because he was ashamed of her countrified appearance before them  it was a pretty fine point said basil and he laughed provokingly  he might not have meant to ignore her answered isabel thoughtfully he might have chosen not to introduce her because he felt too proud of her to subject her to any possible misappreciation from them you might have looked at it in that way  why didnt you look at it in that way you advised her against giving him another chance why did you  why repeated isabel absently oh a woman does nt judge a man by what he does but by what he is i knew that if she dismissed him it was because she never really had trusted or could trust his love and i thought she had better not make another trial  well very possibly you were right at any rate you have the consolation of knowing that its too late to help it now  yes its too late said isabel and her thoughts went back to her meeting with the young girl whom she had liked so much and whose after history had interested her so painfully it seemed to her a hard world that could come to nothing better than that for the girl whom she had seen in her first glimpse of it that night where was she now what had become of her if she had married that man would she have been any happier marriage was not the poetic dream of perfect union that a girl imagines it she herself had found that out it was a state of trial of probation it was an ordeal not an ecstasy if she and basil had broken each others hearts and parted would not the fragments of their lives have been on a much finer much higher plane had not the commonplace everyday experiences of marriage vulgarized them both to be sure there were the children but if they had never had the children she would never have missed them and if basil had for example died just before they were marriedshe started from this wicked reverie and ran towards her husband whose broad honest back with no visible neck or shirtcollar was turned towards her as he stood with his head thrown up studying a timetable on the wall she passed her arm convulsively through his and pulled him away  its time to be getting our bags out to the train basil come bella tom were going  the children reluctantly turned from the newsmans trumpery and they all went out to the track and took seats on the benches under the colonnade while they waited the train for buffalo drew in and they remained watching it till it started in the last car that passed them when it was fairly under way a face looked full at isabel from one of the windows in that moment of astonishment she forgot to observe whether it was sad or glad she only saw or believed she saw the light of recognition dawn into its eyes and then it was gone  basil she cried stop the train that was kitty ellison  oh no it wasnt said basil easily it looked like her but it looked at least ten years older  why of course it was were all ten years older returned his wife in such indignation at his stupidity that she neglected to insist upon his stopping the train which was rapidly diminishing in the perspective  he declared it was only a fancied resemblance she contended that this was in the neighborhood of eriecreek and it must be kitty and thus one of their most inveterate disagreements began  their own train drew into the depot and they disputed upon the fact in question till they entered on the passage of the suspension bridge then basil rose and called the children to his side on the left hand far up the river the great fall shows with its mists at its foot and its rainbow on its brow as silent and still as if it were vastly painted there and below the bridge on the right leap the rapids in the narrow gorge like seas on a rocky shore look on both sides now he said to the children isabel you must see this  isabel had been preparing for the passage of this bridge ever since she left boston never she exclaimed she instantly closed her eyes and hid her face in her handkerchief thanks to this precaution of hers the train crossed the bridge in perfect safety     pg editors bookmarks      all luckiest or the unluckiest the healthiest or the
