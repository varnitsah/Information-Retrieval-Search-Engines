————                                    ————     chapter i     the schooner seamew of london captain wilson master and owner had just finished loading at northfleet with cement for brittlesea every inch of space was packed cement exuded from the cracks imparted to the hairy faces of honest seamen a ghastly appearance sadly out of keeping with their characters and even took its place disguised as thickening among the multiple ingredients of a seapie that was cooking for dinner  it was not until the decks were washed and the little schooner was once more presentable that the mate gave a thought to his own toilet it was a fine warm morning in may and some of the cargo had got into his hair and settled in streaks on his hot goodhumored face the boy had brought aft a wooden bucket filled with fair water and placed upon the hatch by its side a piece of yellow soap and a towel upon these preparations the mate smiled pleasantly and throwing off his shirt and girding his loins with his braces he bent over and with much zestful splashing began his ablutions  twice did the ministering angel who was not of an age to be in any great concern about his own toilet change the water before the mate was satisfied after which the latter his face and neck aglow with friction descended to the cabin for a change of raiment  he did not appear on deck again until after dinner which in the absence of the skipper he ate alone the men who had also dined were lounging forward smoking and the mate having filled his own pipe sat down by himself and smoked in silence  i’m keeping the skipper’s dinner ’ot in a small sorsepan sir said the cook thrusting his head out of the galley  all right said the mate  it’s a funny thing where the skipper gets to these times said the cook addressing nobody in particular but regarding the mate out of the corner of his eye  very rum said the mate who was affably inclined just then  the cook came out of the galley and wiping his wet hands on his dirty canvas trousers drew near and gazed in a troubled fashion ashore  e’s the best cap’n i ever sailed under he said slowly ain’t it struck you sir he’s been worried like these ’ere last few trips i told ’im as ’e was goin’ ashore as there was seapie for dinner and ’e ses ’all right joe’ ’e ses just as if i’d said boiled beef and taters or fine mornin’ sir or anythink like that  the mate shook his head blew out a cloud of smoke and watched it lazily as it disappeared  it strikes me as ’ow ’e’sarter fresh cargo or something said a stout old seaman who had joined the cook look ’ow ’e’s dressing nowadays why the cap’n of a steamer ain’t smarter  not so smart sam said the remaining seaman who encouraged by the peaceful aspect of the mate had also drawn near i don’t think it’s cargo he’s after though—cement pays all right  it ain’t cargo said a small but confident voice  you clear out said old sam a boy o’ your age shovin’ his spoke in when ’is elders is talkin’ what next i wonder  where am i to clear to i’m my own end of the ship anyway said the youth vindictively  the men started to move but it was too late the mate’s latent sense of discipline was roused and he jumped up in a fury  my —— he said if there ain’t the whole blasted ship’s company aft—every man jack of ’em come down in the cabin gentlemen come down and have a drop of hollands and a cigar apiece all the riffraff o’ the foc’sle sitting aft and prattling about the skipper like a parcel o’ washerwomen and smoking by — smoking well when the skipper comes aboard he’ll have to get a fresh crew or a fresh mate i’m sick of it why it might be a barge for all the discipline that’s kept the boy’s the only sailor among you  he strode furiously up and down the deck the cook disappeared into the galley and the two seamen began to bustle about forward the small expert who had raised the storm by no means desirous of being caught in the tail of it put his pipe in his pocket and looked round for a job  come here said the mate sternly  the boy came towards him  what was that you were saying about the skipper demanded the other  i said it wasn’t cargo he was after said henry  oh a lot you know about it said the mate  henry scratched his leg but said nothing  a lot you know about it repeated the mate in rather a disappointed tone  henry scratched the other leg  don’t let me hear you talking about your superior officer’s affairs again said the mate sharply mind that  no sir said the boy humbly it ain’t my business o course  what isn’t your business said the mate carelessly his said henry  the mate turned away seething and hearing a chuckle from the galley went over there and stared at the cook—a wretched being with no control at all over his feelings—for quite five minutes in that short space of time he discovered that the galley was the dirtiest hole under the sun and the cook the uncleanest person that ever handled food he imparted his discoveries to the cook and after reducing him to a state of perspiring imbecility turned round and rated the men again having charged them with insolence when they replied and with sulkiness when they kept silent he went below having secured a complete victory and the incensed seamen after making sure that he had no intention of returning went towards henry to find fault with him  if you was my boy said sam breathing heavily i’d thrash you to within a inch of your life  if i was your boy i should drown myself said henry very positively  henry’s father had frequently had occasion to remark that his son favored his mother and his mother possessed a tongue which was famed throughout wapping and obtained honorable mention in distant limehouse  you can’t expect discipline aboard a ship where the skipper won’t let you ’it the boy said dick moodily it’s bad for ’im too  don’t you worry about me my lads said henry with offensive patronage i can take care of myself all right you ain’t seen me come aboard so drunk that i’ve tried to get down the foc’sle without shoving the scuttle back you never knew me to buy a bundle o’ forged pawntickets you never—  listen to ’im said sam growing purple i’ll be ’ung for ’im yet  if you ain’t i will growled dick with whom the matter of the pawntickets was a sore subject  boy yelled the mate thrusting his head out at the companion  coming sir said henry sorry i can’t stop any longer he said politely but me an’ the mate’s going to have a little chat  i’ll have to get another ship said dick watching the small spindly figure as it backed down the companionladder i never was on a ship afore where the boy could do as he liked  sam shook his head and sighed it’s the best ship i was ever on barrin’ that he said sternly  what’ll ’e be like when he grows up demanded dick as he lost himself in the immensity of the conjecture it ain’t right t’ the boy to let him go on like that one good hidin’ a week would do ’im good and us too  meantime the object of their care had reached the cabin and leaning against the fireplace awaited the mate’s pleasure  where’s the cap’n demanded the latter plunging at once into the subject  henry turned and looked at the small clock  walkin’ up and down a street in gravesend he said deliberately  oh you’ve got the secondsight i s’pose said the mate reddening and what’s he doing that for  to see ’er come out said the boy  the mate restrained himself but with difficulty  and what’ll he do when she does come out he demanded  nothin’ replied the seer with conviction what are you lookin’ for he inquired with a trace of anxiety in his voice as the mate rose from the locker and raising the lid began groping for something in the depths  bit o’ rope was the reply  well what did yer ask me for said henry with hasty tearfulness it’s the truth ’e won’t do nothin’ ’e never does—only stares  d’you mean to say you ain’t been gammoning me demanded the mate seizing him by the collar  come and see for yourself said henry  the mate released him and stood eyeing him with a puzzled expression as a thousandandone little eccentricities on the part of the skipper suddenly occurred to him  go and make yourself tidy he said sharply and mind if i find you’ve been doing me i’ll flay you alive  the boy needed no second bidding he dashed up on deck and heedless of the gibes of the crew began a toilet such as he had never before been known to make within the memory of man  what’s up kiddy inquired the cook whose curiosity became unbearable  wot d’you mean demanded henry with dignity  washin’ and all that said the cook who was a plain creature  don’t you ever wash yourself you dirty pig said henry elegantly i s’pose you think doin’ the cookin’ keeps you clean though  the cook wrung his hands and unconscious of plagiarism told sam he’d be ’ung for ’im  me and the mate are goin’ for a little stroll sam observed the youth as he struggled into his jersey keep your eyes open and don’t get into mischief you can give slushy a ’and with the sorsepans if you’ve got nothin’ better to do don’t stand about idle  the appearance of the mate impeded sam’s utterance and he stood silently by the others watching the couple as they clambered ashore it was noticed that henry carried his head very erect but whether this was due to the company he was keeping or the spickandspan appearance he made they were unable to determine  easy—go easy panted the mate mopping his red face with a handkerchief what are you in such a hurry for  we shall be too late if we don’t hurry said henry then you’ll think i’ve been tellin’ lies  the mate made no further protest and at the same rapid pace they walked on until they reached a quiet road on the outskirts of gravesend  there he is said henry triumphantly as he stopped and pointed up the road at the figure of a man slowly pacing up and down she’s at a little school up at the other end a teacher or somethin’ here they come  as he spoke a small damsel with a satchel and a roll of music issued from a house at the other end of the road the advanced guard of a small company which in twos and threes now swarmed out and went their various ways  nice girls some of ’em said henry glancing approvingly at them as they passed oh here she comes i can’t say i see much in her myself  the mate looked up and regarded the girl as she approached with considerable interest he saw a pretty girl with nice gray eyes and a flush which might be due to the master of the seamew—who was following at a respectful distance behind her—trying to look unconcerned at this unexpected appearance  halloa jack he said carelessly  halloa said the mate with a great attempt at surprise who’d ha’ thought o’ seeing you here  the skipper disdaining to reply to this hypocrisy stared at henry until an intelligent and friendly grin faded slowly from that youth’s face and left it expressionless i’ve just been having a quiet stroll he said slowly turning to the mate  well so long said the latter anxious to escape  the other nodded and turned to resume his quiet stroll at a pace which made the mate hot to look at him he’ll have to look sharp if he’s going to catch her now he said thoughtfully  he won’t catch her said henry he never does—leastways if he does he only passes and looks at her out of the corner of his eye he writes letters to her of a night but he never gives ’em to her  how do you know demanded the other  cos i look at ’im over his shoulder while i’m puttin’ things in the cupboard said henry  the mate stopped and regarded his hopeful young friend fixedly  i s’pose you look over my shoulder too sometimes he suggested  you never write to anybody except your wife said henry carelessly or your mother leastways i’ve never known you to  you’ll come to a bad end my lad said the mate thickly that’s what you’ll do  what ’e does with ’em i can’t think continued henry disregarding his future ’e don’t give ’em to ’er ain’t got the pluck i s’pose phew ain’t it ’ot  they had got down to the river again and he hesitated in front of a small beershop whose half open door and sanded floor offered a standing invitation to passersby  could you do a bottle o’ gingerbeer inquired the mate attracted in his turn  no said henry shortly i couldn’t i don’t mind having what you’re going to have  the mate grinned and leading the way in ordered refreshment for two exchanging a pleasant wink with the proprietor as that humorist drew the lad’s halfpint in a quart pot  ain’t you goin’ to blow the head off sir inquired the landlord as henry after glancing darkly into the depths and nodding to the mate buried his small face in the pewter you’ll get your moustache all mussed up if you don’t  the boy withdrew his face and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand regarded the offender closely so long as it don’t turn it red i don’t mind he said patiently and i don’t think as ’ow your swipes would hurt anythin’  he went out followed by the mate leaving the landlord wiping down the counter with one hand while he mechanically stroked his moustache with the other by the time a suitable retort occurred to him the couple were out of earshot     chapter ii     captain wilson hot with the combined effects of exercise and wrath continued the pursuit but the pause to say sweet nothings to the second in command was fatal to his success he had often before had occasion to comment ruefully upon the pace of the quarry and especially at such times when he felt that he had strung his courage almost up to speaking point today he was just in time to see her vanish into the front garden of a small house upon the door of which she knocked with expressive vigor she disappeared into the house just as he reached the gate  damn the mate he said irritably—and the boy he added anxious to be strictly impartial  he walked on aimlessly at a slow pace until the houses ended and the road became a lane shaded with tall trees and flanked by hawthorn hedges along this he walked a little way and then nervously fingering a note in his jacket pocket retraced his steps  i’ll see her and speak to her anyway he muttered here goes  he walked slowly back to the house and with his heart thumping and a choking sensation in his throat walked up to the door and gave a little whisper of a knock upon it it was so faint that after waiting a considerable time he concluded that it had not been heard and raised the knocker again then the door opened suddenly and the knocker half detained in his grasp slipped from his fingers and fell with a crash that made him tremble at his hardihood an elderly woman with white hair opened the door she repressed a start and looked at him inquiringly  cap’n jackson in inquired the skipper his nerves thoroughly upset by the knocker  who said the other  cap’n jackson repeated the skipper reddening  there is no such man here said the old woman are you sure it is captain jackson you want she added  i’m—i’m not sure said wilson truthfully  the old woman looked at him eagerly will you come in she said slowly and without giving him time to refuse led the way into the small front room the skipper followed her with the conscience of a fox invited into a poultry yard and bringing up in the doorway gazed uncomfortably at the girl who had risen at his entrance  this gentleman is inquiring for a captain jackson said the old woman turning to the girl i thought he—he doesn’t seem quite sure whether it is captain jackson he wants—he may bring news she concluded incoherently  it’s not likely mother said the girl regarding the adventurous mariner by no means favorably there is no captain jackson here sir  have you been looking for him long inquired the mother  years and years said the other forgetting himself  the old woman sighed sympathetically won’t you sit down she said  thank you said the skipper and took the edge of the sofa  you’re not quite certain of the name suggested the girl coldly  it—it sounded like jackson murmured the intruder in a small modest voice it might have been blackson or dackson or even snackson—i won’t swear to it  the old woman put her hand to her brow i thought perhaps you might have brought me some news of my poor husband she said at length i lost him some years ago and when you came here inquiring for a seafaring man i thought you might somehow have brought news  you must see mother that this gentleman is looking for somebody else said the girl you are hindering him from finding captain jackson  if he’s been looking for him for years said the old woman bridling mildly a few minutes will not make much difference  certainly not said wilson in a voice which he tried in vain to make stronger when you say lost ma’am you mean missing  five years said the old woman shaking her head and folding her hands in her lap how long do you say you’ve been looking for captain jackson  seven said the skipper with a calmness which surprised himself  and you haven’t given up hope i suppose  not while life lasts said the other studying the carpet  that’s the way i feel said the old woman energetically what a surprise it’ll be when you meet him  for both of them said the girl  it’s five years last may—the 20th of may said the old woman since i last saw my poor husband he—  it can’t be of any interest to this gentleman mother interposed the girl  i’m very much interested ma’am said the skipper defiantly besides when i’m looking for poor jackson who knows i mightn’t run up against the other  ah who knows but what you might said the old woman there’s one gentleman looking for him now—mr glover my daughter’s husband that is to be  there was a long pause then the skipper by dint of combining his entire stock of christianity and politeness found speech i hope he finds him he said slowly  all that a man can do he’s doing said the old lady he’s a commercial traveller by trade and he gets about a great deal in the way of business  have you tried advertising inquired the skipper striving manfully to keep his interest up to its former pitch  the other shook her head and looked uneasily at her daughter  it wouldn’t be any good she said in a low voice—it wouldn’t be any good  well i don’t want to pry into your business in any way said wilson but i go into a good many ports in the course of the year and if you think it would be any use my looking about i’ll be pleased and proud to do so if you’ll give me some idea of who to look for  the old lady fidgeted with all the manner of one half desiring and half fearing to divulge a secret  you see we lost him in rather peculiar circumstances she said glancing uneasily at her daughter again he—  i don’t want to know anything about that you know ma’am interposed the skipper gently  it would be no good advertising for my father said the girl in her clear voice because he can neither read nor write he is a very passionate hasty man and five years ago he struck a man down and thought he had killed him we have seen nothing and heard nothing of him since  he must have been a strong man commented the skipper  he had something in his hand said the girl bending low over her work but he didn’t hurt him really the man was at work two days after and he bears him no illwill at all  he might be anywhere said the skipper meditating  he would be sure to be where there are ships said the old lady i’m certain of it you see he was captain of a ship himself a good many years and for one thing he couldn’t live away from the water and for another it’s the only way he has of getting a living poor man—unless he’s gone to sea again which isn’t likely  coasting trade i suppose said the skipper glancing at two or three small craft which were floating in oil round the walls  the old lady nodded those were his ships she said following his glance but the painters never could get the clouds to please him i shouldn’t think there was a man in all england harder to please with clouds than he was  what sort of looking man is he inquired wilson  i’ll get you a portrait said the old lady and she rose and left the room  the girl from her seat in the window by the geraniums stitched on steadily the skipper anxious to appear at his ease coughed gently three times and was on the very verge of a remark—about the weather—when she turned her head and became absorbed in something outside the skipper fell to regarding the clouds again with even more disfavor than the missing captain himself could have shown  that was taken just before he disappeared said the old lady entering the room again and handing him a photograph you can keep that  the skipper took it and gazed intently at the likeness of a sturdy fullbearded man of about sixty then he placed it carefully in his breastpocket and rose to his feet  and if i should happen to drop across him he said slowly what might his name be  gething said the old lady captain gething if you should see him and would tell him that he has nothing to fear and that his wife and his daughter annis are dying to see him you will have done what i can never never properly thank you for  i’ll do my best said the other warmly goodafternoon  he shook hands with the old woman and then standing with his hands by his side looked doubtfully at annis  goodafternoon she said cheerfully  mrs gething showed him to the door  any time you are at gravesend captain we shall be pleased to see you and hear how you get on she said as she let him out  the captain thanked her pausing at the gate to glance covertly at the window but the girl was bending over her work again and he walked away rapidly  until he had reached his ship and was sitting down to his belated dinner he had almost forgotten in the joyful excitement of having something to do for miss gething the fact that she was engaged to another man as he remembered this he pushed his plate from him and leaning his head on his hand gave way to a fit of deep melancholy he took the photograph from his pocket and gazing at it intently tried to discover a likeness between the father and daughter there was not sufficient to warrant him in bestowing a chaste salute upon it  what do you think o’ that he inquired handing it over to the mate who had been watching him curiously  any friend o’ yours inquired the mate cautiously  no said the other  well i don’t think much of him said the mate where d’you get it  it was given to me said the skipper he’s missing and i’ve got to find him if i can you might as well keep your eyes open too  where are you going to look for him asked the mate  everywhere said the other i’m told that he’s likely to be in a seaport town and if you’ll be on the lookout i’ll take it as a favor  i’ll do that o’ course said the mate what’s he been doing  nothing that i know of said the skipper but he’s been missing some five years and i promised i’d do my best to find him  friends are anxious i s’pose said the mate  yes said the other  i always find continued the mate that women are more anxious in these sort o’ cases than men  more tenderhearted said the skipper  it ain’t a bad sort o’ face now i come to look at it said the baffled mate regarding it closely seems to me i’ve seen somebody very much like it—a girl i think—but i can’t say where  bearded lady at a fair i should think said the skipper bluffly  conversation was interrupted by the appearance of henry who seeing the photograph in the mate’s hand at once began putting the butter away a glance told him that the mate was holding it upside down and conscience told him that this was for his benefit he therefore rigidly averted his gaze while clearing the table and in a small mental ledger which he kept with scrupulous care for items such as these made a debit entry in the mate’s account  boy said the skipper suddenly  sir said henry  you’re a fairly sharp youngster i think said the skipper take hold o’ that photo there  henry’s face suffused with a great joy he looked derisively at the mate and took the photograph from him listening intently to much the same instructions as had been previously given to the mate and you can take it for’ard concluded the skipper and let the men see it  the men said henry in astonishment  yes the men don’t i speak plain retorted the skipper  very plain sir said the boy but they’ll only make a muddle of it sir fancy fat sam and the cook and dick  do as you’re told said the other irascibly  o’ course sir said henry but they’ll only worry me with a lot o’ questions as to who ’e is an’ wot you want ’im for  you take it for’ard said the skipper and tell them there’s a couple of sovereigns for the first man that finds him  the youth took the photograph and after another careful scrutiny with the object of getting a start in the race for wealth took it forward fat sam it seemed had seen the very man only two days before at poplar the cook knew his features as well as he knew those of his own mother while dick had known him for years as an old and respected inhabitant of plymouth henry went back to the skipper and having furnished him with this information meekly suggested that they should drag gravesend first  it was midnight when they got the anchor up and dropped silently down the river gravesend was silent and the dotted lines of street lamps shone over a sleeping town as the seamew crept softly by  a big steamer in front whistled warningly for the pilot’s boat and slowing up as the small craft shot out from the shore to meet it caused a timely diversion to the skipper’s melancholy by lying across his bows by the time he had fully recovered from the outrage and had drunk a cup of coffee which had been prepared in the galley gravesend had disappeared round the bend and his voluntary search had commenced     chapter iii     they made brittlesea in four days—days in which the skipper a prey to gentle melancholy left things mostly to the mate whereupon melancholia became contagious and sam’s concertina having been impounded by the energetic mate disaffection reared its ugly head in the foc’sle and called him improper names when he was out of earshot  they entered the small river on which stands the ancient town of brittlesea at nightfall business for the day was over a few fishermen pipe in mouth lounged upon the quay while sounds of revelry which in some mysterious way reminded the crew of their mission to find captain gething proceeded from the open doors of a small tavern opposite the most sanguine of them hardly expected to find him the first time but as sam said the sooner they started the better for all they knew he might be sitting in that very publichouse waiting to be found  they went ashore a little later and looked for him there but without success all they did find was a rather hottempered old man who irritated by the searching scrutiny of the cook asked him shortly whether he had lost anything because if so and he the cook thought he was sitting on it perhaps he’d be good enough to say so the cook having replied in fitting terms they moved off down the quay to the next tavern here they fared no better dick declaring that the beer was if anything worse than the other and that nobody who had lived in the place any time would spend his money there they therefore moved on once more and closing time came before their labors were half completed  it’s quite a little romans said sam thickly as he was pushed outside the last house of call and a bolt shot desolately behind him where shall we go now  get back to the ship said dick come along  not ’fore i foun’ ’im said sam solemnly as he drew back from dick’s detaining hand  you won’t find him tonight sam said the cook humorsomely  why not said sam regarding him with glassy eyes we came out fin’ ’im  cos it’s dark for one thing said the cook  sam laughed scornfully  come on said dick catching him by the arm again  i come out fin’ cap’n cap’n—fin’ ’im said sam i’m not goin’ back ’thout ’im  he rolled off down the road and the two men the simple traditions of whose lives forbade them to leave a shipmate when in that condition followed him growling for half an hour they walked with him through the silent streets of the little town dick with difficulty repressing his impatience as the stout seaman bent down at intervals and thoroughly searched doorsteps and other likely places for the missing man finally he stopped in front of a small house walked on a little way came back and then as though he had suddenly made up his mind walked towards it  hold him cook shouted dick throwing his arms around him  the cook flung his arms round sam’s neck and the two men panting fiercely dragged him away  now you come aboard you old fool said dick losing his temper we’ve had enough o’ your games  leg go said sam struggling  you leave that knocker alone then said dick warningly  ’e’s in there said sam nodding wisely at the house  you come back you old fool repeated dick you never ’ort to ’ave nothin’ stronger than milk  ole my coat cookie said sam his manner changing suddenly to an alarming sternness  don’t be a fool sam said the cook entreatingly  ’ole my coat repeated sam eyeing him haughtily  you know you haven’t got a coat on said the cook appealingly can’t you see it’s a jersey you ain’t so far gone as all that  well ’ole me while i take it off said sam sensibly  against his better sense the cook steadied the stout seaman while he proceeded to peel dick waited until the garment—a very tight one—was over his head and then pushing the cook aside took his victim and made him slowly gyrate on the pavement  turn round three times and catch who you can sam he said cruelly well sit down then  he lowered him to the pavement and accompanied by the cook drew off and left him to his fate their last glance showed them a stout ablebodied seaman with his head and arms confined in a jersey going through contortions of an extraordinary nature to free himself and indulging in language which even when filtered by the garment in question was of a singularly comprehensive and powerful description he freed himself at last and after flinging the garment away in his anger picked it up again and carrying it under his arm zigzagged his way back to the ship  his memory when he awoke next morning was not quite clear but a hazy recollection of having been insulted led him to treat dick and the cook with marked coldness which did not wear off until they were all busy on deck working at cement is a dry job and after hardening his heart for some time the stout seaman allowed the cook to call him to the galley and present him with a mug of cold coffee left from the cabin table  the cook washed the mug up and preferring the dusty deck to the heat of the fire sat down to wash a bowl of potatoes it was a task which lent itself to meditation and his thoughts as he looked wistfully at the shore reverted to captain gething and the best means of finding him it was clear that the photograph was an important factor in the search and possessed with a new idea he left the potatoes and went down to the cabin in search of it he found it on a shelf in the skipper’s stateroom and passing up on deck again stepped ashore  from the first three people he spoke to he obtained no information whatever they all inspected the photograph curiously and indulged in comments mostly unfavorable but all agreed that there was nobody like it in brittlesea he had almost given it up as a bad job and was about to return when he saw an aged fisherman reclining against a post  fine day mate said the cook  the old man courteously removed a short clay pipe from his puckered mouth in order to nod and replacing it resumed his glance seaward  ever seen anybody like that inquired the cook producing the portrait  the old man patiently removed the pipe again and taking the portrait scanned it narrowly  it’s wonderful how they get these things up nowadays he said in a quavering voice there was nothing like that when you an’ me was boys  there ’as been improvements admitted the cook indignantly  all oils they was continued the old man meditatively or crains  ’ave you ever seen anybody like that demanded the cook impatiently  why o’ course i have i’m goin’ to tell you in a minute said the old man querulously let me see—what’s his name again  i don’t know ’is name said the cook untruthfully  i should know it if i was to hear it said the old man slowly ah i’ve got it i’ve got it  he tapped his head triumphantly and with a bleared shining old eye winked at the cook  my memory’s as good as ever it was he said complacently sometimes i forget things but they come back my mother used to be the same and she lived to ninetythree  lor interrupted the anxious cook what’s the name  the old man stopped drat it he said with a worried look i’ve lost it again but it’ll come back  the cook waited ten minutes for the prodigal it ain’t gething i s’pose he said at length  no said the old man don’t you be in a hurry it’ll come back  when asked the cook rebelliously  it might be in five minutes’ time and it might be in a month said the old man firmly but it’ll come back  he took the portrait from the hands of the now sulky cook and strove to jog his memory with it  john dunn’s his name he cried suddenly john dunn  where does ’e live inquired the cook eagerly  holebourne said the old man—a little place seven miles off the road  are you sure it’s the same asked the cook in a trembling voice  sartain said the other firmly he come here first about six years ago an’ then he quarrelled with his landlord and went off to holebourne  the cook with a flushed face glanced along the quay to the schooner work was still proceeding amid a cloud of white dust and so far his absence appeared to have passed unnoticed  if they want any dinner he muttered alluding to the powdered figures at work on the schooner they must get it for theirselves that’s all will you come and ’ave a drop old man  the old man nothing loath assented and having tasted of the cook’s bounty crawled beside him through the little town to put him on the road to holebourne and after seeing him safe returned to his beloved post  the cook went along whistling thinking pleasantly of the discomfiture of the other members of the crew when they should discover his luck for three miles he kept on sturdily until a small signboard projecting from between a couple of tall elms attracted his attention to a little inn just off the road at the porch of which a stout landlord sat on a wooden stool waiting for custom  the cook hesitated a moment and then marching slowly up took a stool which stood opposite and ordered a pint  the landlord rose and in a heavy leisurely fashion entered the house to execute the order and returned carefully bearing a foaming mug  take the top off said the cook courteously  the stout man with a nod towards him complied  ’ave a pint with me said the cook after a hasty glance into the interior as the landlord handed him the mug you keep that one he added  the stout man drew another pint and subsiding on to his stool with a little sigh disposed himself for conversation  taking a country walk he inquired  the cook nodded not all pleasure he said importantly i’m on business  ah it’s you fellows what make all the money said the landlord i’ve only drawn these two pints this morning going far  holebourne said the other  know anybody there asked the landlord  well not exactly said the cook i carn’t say as i know ’im i’m after a party o’ the name o’ dunn  you won’t get much out of him said the landlady who had just joined them he’s a close un he is  the cook closed his eyes and smiled knowingly  there’s a mystery about that man said the landlady nobody knows who he is or what he is and he won’t tell ’em when a man’s like that you generally know there’s something wrong—leastways i do  insulting he is said the landlord  ah said the cook ’e won’t insult me  you know something about him said the landlady  a little said the cook  the landlord reached over to his wife who bent her ear readily and dutifully towards him and the cook distinctly caught the whispered word ’tec  the landlady after a curious glance at the cook withdrew to serve a couple of wagoners who had drawn up at the door conversation became general and it was evident that the wagoners shared the sentiments of the landlord and his wife with regard to mr dunn they regarded the cook with awe and after proffering him a pint with respectful timidity offered to give him a lift to holebourne  i’d sooner go on my own said the cook with a glance at the wagons i want to get in the place quiet like and ’ave a look round before i do anythin’  he sat there for some time resting and evading as best he could the skilful questions of the landlady the wagons moved off first jolting and creaking their way to holebourne and the cook after making a modest luncheon of bread and cheese and smoking a pipe got on the road again  look how he walks said the landlord as the couple watched him up the road  ah said his wife  like a bloodhound said the landlord impressively just watch him i knew what he was directly i clapped eyes on him  the cook continued his journey unconscious of the admiration excited by his movements he began to think that he had been a trifle foolish in talking so freely still he had not said much and if people liked to make mistakes why that was their business  in this frame of mind he entered holebourne a small village consisting of a little street an inn and a church at the end of the street in front of a tidy little cottage with a wellkept front garden a small knot of people were talking  somethin’ on said the cook to himself as he returned with interest the stares of the villagers which is mr dunn’s house boy  there it is sir said the boy pointing to the house where the people were standing are you the detective  no said the cook sharply  he walked across to the house and opened the little garden gate quite a little hum of excitement following him as he walked up to the door and knocked upon it with his knuckles  come in growled a deep voice  the cook entered and carefully closed the door behind him he found himself in a small sittingroom the only occupant of which was an old man of forbidding aspect sitting in an easy chair with a newspaper open in his hand  what do you want he demanded looking up  i want to see mr dunn said the cook nervously  i’m mr dunn said the other waiting  the cook’s heart sank for with the exception of a beard mr dunn no more resembled the portrait than he did  i’m mr dunn repeated the old man regarding him ferociously from beneath his shaggy eyebrows  the cook smiled but faintly he tried to think but the old man’s gaze sent all the ideas out of his head  oh are you he said at length  i heard you were looking for me said the old man gradually raising his voice to a roar all the village knows it i think and now you’ve found me what the devil is it you want  i—i think there’s a mistake stammered the cook  oh said the old man ha is there pretty detective you are i’ll bring an action against you i’ll have you imprisoned and dismissed the force  it’s all a mistake said the cook i’m not a detective  come this way said the old man rising  the cook followed him into a smaller room at the back  you’re not a detective said the old man as he motioned him to a seat i suppose you know that impersonating a detective is a serious offence just stay here while i fetch a policeman will you  the cook said he wouldn’t  ah said the old man with a savage grin i think you will then he went to the door and called loudly for roger  before the dazed cook of the seamew could collect his scattered senses a pattering sounded on the stairs and a bulldog came unobtrusively into the room it was a perfectly bred animal with at least a dozen points about it calling for notice and admiration but all that the cook noticed was the excellent preservation of its teeth  watch him roger said the old man taking a hat from a sideboard don’t let him move  the animal growled intelligently and sitting down a yard or two in front of the cook watched him with much interest  i’m sure i’m very sorry muttered the cook don’t go away and leave me with this dog sir  he won’t touch you unless you move said the old man  the cook’s head swam he felt vaguely round for a subtle compliment i’d rather you stayed he quavered i would indeed i don’t know any man i’ve took a greater fancy to at first sight  i don’t want any of your confounded insolence said the other sternly watch him roger  roger growled with all the cheerfulness of a dog who had found a job which suited him and his owner after again warning the cook of what would happen if he moved out of the chair left the room shutting the door as he went the cook heard the front door close behind him and then all was silence except for the strong breathing of roger  for some time the man and dog sat eyeing each other in silence then the former moistening his dry lips with his tongue gave a conciliatory chirrup roger responded with a deep growl and rising to his feet yawned expressively  poor roger said the cook in trembling accents poor old rogywogy good old dog  the good old dog came a little nearer and closely inspected the cook’s legs which were knocking together with fright  cats said the cook pointing to the door as an idea occurred to him scat seize ’em dog seize ’em  gwrr said roger menacingly the quivering limbs had a strange fascination for him and coming closer he sniffed at them loudly  in a perfect panic the cook after glancing helplessly at the poker put his hand gently behind him and drew his sheathknife then with a courage born of fear he struck the dog suddenly in the body and before it could recover from the suddenness of the attack withdrew his knife and plunged it in again the dog gave a choking growl and game to the last made a grab at the cook’s leg and missing it rolled over on the floor giving a faint kick or two as the breath left its body  it had all happened so quickly that the cook mechanically wiping his blade on the tablecloth hardly realized the foulness of the crime of which he had been guilty but felt inclined to congratulate himself upon his desperate bravery then as he realized that in addition to the offence for which the choleric mr dunn was even now seeking the aid of the law there was a dead bulldog and a spoiled carpet to answer for he resolved upon an immediate departure he made his way to the back door and sheathing his knife crept stealthily down the garden and clambered over the fence at the bottom then with his back to the scene of the murder he put up his hands and ran  he crossed two fields and got on to a road his breath coming painfully as he toiled along with an occasional glance behind him it was uphill but he kept on until he had gained the top and then he threw himself down panting by the side of the road with his face turned in the direction of holebourne five minutes later he started up again and resumed his flight as several figures burst into the road from the village in hot pursuit  for a little while he kept to the road then as the idea occurred to him that some of his pursuers might use a vehicle he broke through the hedge and took to the fields his legs gave way beneath him and he stumbled rather than ran but he kept on alternately walking and running until all signs of the pursuit had ceased     chapter iv     safe for the time being but with the memory of his offences pursuing him the cook first washed his face and hands in a trough and next removed the stains of the crime from his knife he then pushed on again rapidly until he struck another road and begging a lift from a passing wagon lay full length on top of a load of straw and nervously scanned the landscape as they travelled half a dozen miles farther on the wagon halted before a comfortable farmhouse and the cook after bestowing on the carter two of the few coins left him went his way losing himself with a view to baffling pursuit among a maze of small lanes turning right or left as the fancy took him until nightfall found him tired and famished on the outskirts of a small village  conscious of the power of the telegraph which he had no doubt was interesting itself in his behalf over the surrounding districts he skulked behind a hedge until the lights went from the ground floor to the first floor of the cottages and then went out altogether he then with the utmost caution looked round in search of shelter he came at last to two cottages standing by themselves about half a mile beyond the village one of which had a wooden shed in the garden which seemed to offer the very shelter he required satisfied that the inmates of the cottage were all abed he entered the garden and treading on tiptoe walked towards the shed fumbled at the hasp and opened the door it was pitch dark within and silent till something rustled uneasily there was a note of alarm and indignation the cook tripped on a stone and only saved himself from falling by clutching at a perch which a dozen fowls instantly vacated with loud and frenzied appeals for assistance immediately the shed was full of flapping wings and agitated hens darting wildly between his legs as he made for the door again only to run into the arms of a man who came from the cottage  i’ve got him poll shouted the latter as he dealt the cook a blow with a stick i’ve got him  he fetched him another blow and was preparing for a third when the cook maddened with the pain struck at him wildly and sent him sprawling he was up again in an instant and aided by his wife who had stopped to make a slight concession to appearances in the shape of a flannel petticoat threw the cook down and knelt on him a man came out from the adjoining cottage and having with great presence of mind first found a vacant spot on the cook and knelt on it asked what was the matter  after my hens said the first man breathlessly i just heard ’em in time  i wasn’t after your hens i didn’t know they was there gasped the cook  lock him up said the second man warmly  i’m goin’ to said the other keep still you thief  get up said the cook faintly you’re killin’ me  take him in the house and tie him up for the night and we’ll take him to winton police station in the morning said the neighbor he’s a desperate character  as they declined to trust the cook to walk he was carried into the kitchen where the woman leaving him for a moment struck a match and hastily lit a candle she then opened a drawer and to the cook’s horror began pulling out about twenty fathoms of clothesline  the best way and the safest is to tie him in a chair said the neighbor i remember my gran’father used to tell a tale of how they served a highwayman that way once  that would be best i think said the woman pondering he’d be more comfortable in a chair though i’m sure he don’t deserve it  they raised the exhausted cook and placing him in a stout oak chair lashed him to it until he could scarcely breathe  after my gran’father had tied the highwayman in the chair he gave him a crack on the head with a stick said the neighbor regarding the cook thoughtfully  they was very brutal in those times said the cook before anybody else could speak  just to keep him quiet like said the neighbor somewhat chilled by the silence of the other two  i think he’ll do as he is said the owner of the fowls carefully feeling the prisoner’s bonds if you’ll come in in the morning pettit we’ll borrow a cart an’ take him over to winton i expect there’s a lot of things against him  i expect there is said pettit as the cook shuddered well goodnight  he returned to his house and the couple after carefully inspecting the cook again and warning him of the consequences if he moved blew out the candle and returned to their interrupted slumbers  for a long time the unfortunate cook sat in a state of dreary apathy wondering vaguely at the ease with which he had passed from crime to crime and trying to estimate how much he should get for each a cricket sang from the hearthstone and a mouse squeaked upon the floor worn out with fatigue and trouble he at length fell asleep  he awoke suddenly and tried to leap out of his bunk on to the floor and hop on one leg as a specific for the cramp then as he realized his position he strove madly to rise and straighten the afflicted limb he was so far successful that he managed to stand and in the fantastic appearance of a human snail to shuffle slowly round the kitchen at first he thought only of the cramp but after that had yielded to treatment a wild idea of escape occurred to him still bowed with the chair he made his way to the door and after two or three attempts got the latch in his mouth and opened it within five minutes he had shuffled his way through the garden gate which was fortunately open and reached the road  the exertion was so laborious that he sat down again upon his portable seat and reckoned up his chances fear lent him wings though of a very elementary type and as soon as he judged he was out of earshot he backed up against a tree and vigorously banged the chair against it  he shed one cracked hind leg in this way and the next time he sat down had to perform feats of balancing not unworthy of blondin himself  until day broke did this persecuted man toil painfully along with the chair and the sun rose and found him sitting carefully in the middle of the road faintly anathematizing captain gething and everything connected with him he was startled by the sound of footsteps rapidly approaching him and being unable to turn his head he rose painfully to his feet and faced about bodily  the newcomer stopped abruptly and gazing in astonishment at the extraordinary combination of man and chair before him retired a few paces in disorder at a little distance he had mistaken the cook for a lover of nature communing with it at his ease now he was undecided whether it was a monstrosity or an apparition  mornin’ mate said the cook in a weary voice  morning said the man backing still more  i ’spose said the cook trying to smile cheerfully you’re surprised to see me like this  i’ve never seen anything like it afore said the man guardedly  i don’t s’pose you ’ave said the cook i’m the only man in england that can do it  the man said he could quite believe it  i’m doin’ it for a bet said the cook  ohh said the man his countenance clearing a bet i thought you were mad how much is it  fifty pounds said the cook i’ve come all the way from london like this  well i’m blest said the man what won’t they think of next got much farther to go  oakville said the cook mentioning a place he had heard of in his wanderings at least i was but i find it’s too much for me would you mind doing me the favor of cutting this line  no no said the other reproachfully don’t give up now why it’s only another seventeen miles  i must give it up said the cook with a sad smile  don’t be beat said the man warmly keep your ’art up and you’ll be as pleased as punch presently to think how near you was losing  cut it off said the cook trembling with impatience i’ve earned forty pounds of it by coming so far if you cut it off i’ll send you ten of it  the man hesitated while an inborn love of sport struggled with his greed  i’ve got a wife and family he said at last in extenuation and taking out a claspknife steadied the cook with one hand while he severed his bonds with the other  god bless you mate said the cook trying to straighten his bowed back as the chair fell to the ground  my name’s jack thompson said his benefactor jack thompson winchgate ’ll find me  i’ll make it twelve pounds said the grateful cook and you can have the chair  he shook him by the hand and freed from his burden stepped out on his return journey while his innocent accomplice shouldering the chair went back to learn from the rightful owner a few hard truths about his mental capacity  not knowing how much start he would have the cook despite his hunger and fatigue pushed on with all the speed of which he was capable after an hour’s journey he ventured to ask the direction of an embryo ploughman and wheedled out of him a small a very small portion of his breakfast from the top of the next hill he caught a glimpse of the sea and taking care to keep this friend of his youth in sight felt his way along by it to brittlesea at midday he begged some broken victuals from a gamekeeper’s cottage and with renewed vigor resumed his journey and at ten o’clock that night staggered on to brittlesea quay and made his way cautiously to the ship there was nobody on deck but a light burned in the foc’sle and after a careful peep below he descended henry who was playing a losing game of draughts with sam looked up with a start and overturned the board  lord love us cookie said sam where ’ave you been  the cook straightened up smiling faintly and gave a wave of his hand which took in all the points of the compass everywhere he said wearily  you’ve been on the spree said sam regarding him severely  spree said the cook with expression spree  his feelings choked him and after a feeble attempt to translate them into words he abandoned the attempt and turning a deaf ear to sam’s appeal for information rolled into his bunk and fell fast asleep     chapter v     they got under way at four o’clock next morning and woke the cook up to assist at 330 at 345 they woke him again and at 350 dragged him from his bunk and tried to arouse him to a sense of his duties the cook with his eyes still closed crawled back again the moment they left him and though they had him out twice after that he went back in the same somnambulistic state and resumed his slumbers  brittlesea was thirty miles astern when he at length awoke and went on deck and the schooner was scudding along under a stiff breeze it was a breeze such as the mate loved and his face was serene and peaceful until his gaze fell upon the shrinking figure of the cook as it glided softly into the galley  cook he roared come here you skulking rascal where’ve you been all this time  i’ve been in trouble sir said the cook humbly you’ll ’ardly believe the trouble i’ve been in through trying to do the skipper a kindness  don’t you come none of that with me roared the mate warningly where’ve you been come out with it  the cook still somewhat weak from his adventures leaned against the companion and with much dramatic gesture began his story as it proceeded the mate’s breath came thick and fast his color rose and he became erratic in his steering flattered by these symptoms of concern the cook continued  that’ll do said the mate at last  i ain’t got to the worst of it yet sir said the cook  if you stand there lying to me for another moment i’ll break your neck said the mate violently you’ve had two days on the drink that’s what you’ve had  it’s gawspel truth sir said the cook solemnly  you wait till the skipper turns out said the other shaking his fist at him if it wasn’t for leaving the wheel i’d set about you myself my lad  to the cook’s indignation the skipper shared the opinions of the mate concerning his story and in a most abrupt and unfeeling fashion stopped two days’ pay down in the foc’sle he fared no better the crew’s honest tribute of amazement to his powers of untruthful narrative passing all bounds of decorum  their incredulity was a source of great grief to him he had pictured himself posing as a daredevil and he went about his duties with a chastened mien mistaken by the men experts in such matters for the reaction after a drinking bout  they passed northfleet on their way up to rotherhithe where they went to discharge a small general cargo the cook’s behavior every time a policeboat passed them coming in for much scornful censure it was some hours before he would go ashore and when at last he did venture it was with the reckless air of a robert macaire and a dick turpin rolled into one  it was a damp cheerless morning when they got to northfleet again it had been raining heavily in the night and black clouds still hung low over the river they were not to load until the next day and after dinner henry and the mate exchanged a sympathetic smile as the skipper took up his cap and went ashore  he walked into gravesend and taking no notice of the rain which was falling steadily strolled idly about looking into the shop windows he had a romantic idea that he might meet annis gething there it was halfholiday at the school and it was the most natural thing in the world that she should be sauntering about gravesend in the pouring rain at about four o’clock being fairly wet through he saw the fallacy of the idea strongly and in a disconsolate fashion after one glass at a convenient tavern turned to go back to the ship a little way along the road he stepped aside to allow a girl to pass glancing—by mere force of habit—beneath her umbrella as he did so then he started back guiltily as his eyes met those of miss gething she half stopped  goodafternoon said the skipper awkwardly  goodafternoon said she  nasty weather said the skipper standing respectfully three yards off  wretched said miss gething ugh  i don’t mind it much myself said the skipper  you must be very wet said miss gething you are going to see mother i suppose  i did think of doing so said the skipper with joyous untruthfulness  i’m going to do a little shopping said she goodbye  she nodded brightly and the skipper raising his cap turned on his heel and set off to pay the call he turned his head several times as he went but miss gething who knew more of men than the skipper knew of women did not turn hers  a quarter of an hour’s brisk walk brought him to the house and he shook the rain from his cap as he knocked gently at the door it was opened by a man who standing with his hand on the lock regarded him inquiringly  mrs gething in asked the skipper  no she’s not just at present said the other  i’ll come in and wait for her if you don’t mind said the skipper speaking on the spur of the moment  the other hesitated and then standing aside to allow him to pass closed the door and they entered the small parlor together the skipper with a courage which surprised himself took a chair uninvited and began to wipe his trousers with his handkerchief  i’m afraid mrs gething will be a long time said the other man at last  i’ll give her a few minutes said the skipper who would have sat there a week with pleasure  he rubbed his moustache and beard with his handkerchief and put them into shape with his fingers the other man regarded these operations with an unfavorable eye and watched him uneasily  no message you could leave for mrs gething he suggested after a quarter of an hour  the skipper shook his head and in his turn took stock of the other man—a goodlooking fellow with a waxed black moustache a light silk tie and a massive scarfpin a frockcoat hung about his knees and shoes of the lightest brown called attention to his small feet  another quarter of an hour passed wet day said the skipper by way of starting the conversation again  the other assented and remarked that he thought it very probable that the wet would prevent mrs gething from returning whereupon conversation languished until the sound of hurried footsteps outside and the turning of a key in the latch made them both look up  here she is said the skipper softly  the other man said nothing feeling possibly that the entrance of miss gething was sufficient refutation of the statement he was also in anything but a talkative mood  mother not in said miss gething in surprise as she entered the room how good of you to wait captain  oh it’s no trouble said the skipper who really thought that there was no credit due to him for his action  she shook hands with the other man and smiled at the skipper i’ve seen you before she said and it is good of you to wait i’m sure you’re very wet this is mr glover captain wilson  the two gentlemen glared their acknowledgments and the skipper with a sinking at his heart began to feel in the way miss gething after going outside to remove her hat and jacket came in smiling pleasantly and conversation became general the two men using her as a sort of human telephone through which to transmit scanty ideas  halfpast five said miss gething suddenly have you got to catch the 630 train mr glover  must said mr glover dismally business you know he added resignedly  you’ll take a cup of tea before you go said annis  she was standing before mr glover as she spoke and the skipper who had been feeling more and more in the way rose and murmured that he must go his amazement when miss gething twisted her pretty face into a warning scowl and shook her head at him was so great that mr glover turned suddenly to see the cause of it  you’ll take a cup too captain said miss gething with a polite smile  thank you said the skipper resuming his seat his ideas were in a whirl and he sat silent as the girl deftly set the teatable and took her seat before the tray  quite a teaparty she said brightly one piece of sugar mr glover  two said the gentleman in an injured voice  she looked inquiringly at the skipper with the sugartongs poised  i’ll leave it to you said he confusedly mr glover smiled contemptuously and raised his eyebrows a little miss gething dropped in one piece and handed him the cup  sometimes i take one piece sometimes two or three said the skipper trying to explain away his foolishness i’m not particular  you must be of an easygoing nature said miss gething indulgently  don’t know his own mind i should think said mr glover rudely  i know it about other things said the skipper  the tone in which this remark was made set mr glover wondering darkly what the other things were neither man was disposed to be talkative and tea would have proceeded in sombre silence but for the hostess at ten minutes past six mr glover rose and with great unwillingness said he must go  it isn’t raining much now said miss gething encouragingly mr glover went to the hall and taking his hat and umbrella shook hands with her then he came to the door again and looked at the skipper going my way he inquired with great affability considering  er—no said the other  mr glover put on his hat with a bang and with a curt nod followed miss gething to the door and departed  i think he’ll catch the train all right said the skipper as miss gething watched his feverish haste from the window  i hope so said she  i’m sorry your mother wasn’t in said the skipper breaking a long pause  yes it has been dull for you i’m afraid said the girl  the skipper sighed wearily and wondered whether mr glover was such an adept at silly remarks as he appeared to be  has he got far to go he inquired referring to mr glover  london said annis briefly  she stood at the window for some time gazing up the road with what appeared to be an expression of anxious solicitude  well i suppose i must be going said the skipper who thought he ought not to stay any longer  annis stood aside as he rose and followed him slowly to the hall  i wish we had an umbrella to lend you she said looking round  oh that’ll be all right said the skipper i’m nearly dry now  dry said annis she put her little hand on his coatsleeve  oh you’re soaking she said in dismay the idea of me letting you sit about in that state  that sleeve is the worst said the skipper whom circumstances had made artful it’s all right here  he brushed his hand down his coat  that’s a good thing said annis politely  um but not here said the skipper squeezing the lapel of his coat  annis touched his coat lightly  you’re very wet she said severely you ought not to sit about in such things wait a moment i’ll get you a greatcoat of my father’s  she sped lightly up the stairs and returning with a long heavy coat held it out to him  that’ll keep you dry she remarked as the skipper after a few slight remonstrances began to put it on she held the other sleeve up for him and watched with the satisfaction of a philanthropist as he buttoned it up then she opened the door  you’ll give my respects to mrs gething said the skipper  certainly she’ll be sorry she wasn’t in are you staying here long  about three days  annis pondered  she’s going out tomorrow she said tentatively  i shall be in the town the day after on business said the skipper if it wouldn’t be troubling you i might look in goodbye  he shook hands confusedly wondering whether he had gone too far and as the door closed behind him put his hands in captain gething’s pockets and went off in a brown study slowly and distinctly as he went along the various things grouped themselves together in his mind and he began to think aloud  she knew her mother was out when she met me he said slowly she knew that other fellow was here but one would have thought—lovers’ tiff he said suddenly and bitterly and doing the pleasant to me to make him smart a bit he’ll be round tomorrow when the mother’s out  he went back dejectedly to his ship and countermanding the tea with which the zealous henry was about to indulge him changed his clothes and sat down to smoke  you’ve got a bit wet said the mate where’d you get the coat  friend said the other had it lent to me you know that captain gething i told you to look out for  i do said the other eagerly  let the crew know that the reward is raised to five pounds said the skipper drawing strongly at his pipe  if the reward is riz to five pounds the cook’ll be ’ung for murder or som’think said henry it’s no use lookin’ to the crew for ’elp sir—not a bit  the skipper deigned no reply and his message having been conveyed to the foc’sle a scene of intense animation prevailed there  i’m goin’ to have a go now said dick emphatically five pounds is worth picking up  i only ’ope as you won’t ’ave the treat i ’ad said the cook feelingly  wot we want said fat sam is one o’ them things people ’ave in the city—one o’ the ’er what d’yer call ’ems  ’ansom keb suggested the cook  ’ansom keb be damned said sam scornfully  one of them things wot ’as a lot o’ people in i mean  tramcars said the cook who was all at sea but you couldn’t take a tramcar all over the country sam  if anybody was to ask me i should say you was a silly fool said sam impatiently i mean one o’ them things people puts their money in  the wondering cook had got as far as automatic mach— when henry jostled him into silence  wot are you gettin’ at said dick why don’t you talk plain  ’cos i can’t remember the word said sam angrily but a lot o’ people gets together and goes shares  you mean a syndikit said dick  that’s the word said sam with relief  well wot’s the good of it said dick  this way said sam we make up a syndikit and divide the money when ’e’s found it ’ud be a cruel thing dick if just as you’d spotted your man i wos to come along and snap ’im up under your werry nose for instance—  you’d better try it said dick grimly  it’s a very good idea o’ yours sam said the cook i’ll join it  you’d better come in dick said sam  not me said dick it’s five pounds i’m after  we shall beworkin’ agin you you know me an’ the cook an’ the boy said sam anxiously  ho said henry don’t think i’m takin’ a ’and cos i’m not  werry good then said sam the—the——what d’ye call it dick  syndikit said dick  the syndikit is me and the cook then said sam give us your ’and cook  in this informal way the captain gething search company was founded and the syndicate thinking that they had a good thing began to hold aloof from their fellows and to confer darkly in remote corners they expended a shilling on a popular detective story entitled on the trail and an element of adventure was imported into their lives which brightened them considerably  the following day the skipper spent hard at work with the cargo bustling about with feverish energy as the afternoon wore on and left him to imagine his rival têteàtête with annis after tea a reaction set in and bit by bit the mate by means of timely sympathy learnt all that there was to know henry without a display of anything except perhaps silence learnt it too  it’s in your favor that it’s your own craft said the mate you can go where you like if you find the father she might chuck the other feller  that isn’t my object in finding him said the skipper i just want to find him to oblige her  he set off the following afternoon followed by the stealthy glances of the crew who had heard something from henry and first getting his beard trimmed at a barber’s walked along to call on mrs gething she was in and pleased to see him and hearing that his crew were also searching supplied him with another photograph of the missing captain  miss gething well inquired the skipper as after accepting an invitation to a cup of tea he noticed that she only laid for two  oh yes she’s gone to london said mrs gething she’s got friends there you know  mr glover said the skipper to himself with dismal intuition i met a friend here the day before yesterday he said aloud  oh yes—mr glover said the old lady a man in a very good position he’s very nice isn’t he  splendid murmured the skipper vaguely  he would do anything for her said the fond mother i’m sure it’s quite touching the way he looks after her  going to be married soon queried the skipper  he knew it was a rude question for a comparative stranger to ask but he couldn’t help it  when my husband is found said the old lady shaking her head sadly she won’t marry till then  the skipper sat back in his chair and pushing his plate from him pondered over this latest piece of information it seemed at first an excellent reason for not finding captain gething but the idea had hardly occurred to him before he dismissed it as unworthy and manfully resolved to do his best for an hour he sat listening to the somewhat prosy talk of the old lady and then—there being no sign of annis’s return—he silently departed and made his way back to the seamew     chapter vi     to the cook’s relief he found that the seamew’s next voyage was to a little port on the west coast named cocklemouth calling at the garrison town of bymouth on the way he told sam that it was a load off his mind and showed clearly by his manner that he expected the syndicate at least to accept his story they spent most of their time in the galley where secure from moneygrubbing eavesdroppers they matured their plans over the washing of potatoes and the scouring of saucepans on the trail was remarkably clever and they obtained many helpful suggestions from it though the discovery that henry had got hold of it and had marked all the most valuable passages in lead pencil caused them much anxiety  the syndicate were the first to get ashore the evening they arrived at bymouth they had come to the conclusion in their deliberations that the only possible place in which a retired mariner would spend his evenings was a publichouse and they resolved to do them thoroughly  the worst of it said sam as they walked slowly together to the town is the drinkin’ arter i’ve ’ad five or six pints everybody looks to me like cap’n gething  we won’t ’ave no drinkin’ said the cook we’ll do wot the feller did in that story ’ave you got sixpence about you  wot for inquired sam carefully  workin’ expenses replied the cook dwelling fondly on the phrase  that’ll be thruppence each then said sam eyeing him suspiciously  sixpence each said the cook now do you know what we’re goin’ to do  chuck money away hazarded sam as he reluctantly drew a sixpence from his pocket and handed it to the cook where’s your sixpence  the cook showed it to him and sam whose faith in human nature had been largely shaken by a perusal of the detective story referred to bit it critically  we can’t go into pubs without drinkin’ in the ordinary way said the cook so we’re goin’ in to sell bootlaces like the chap in the book did now do you see  why not try something cheaper first growled sam—measurin’ footmarks or over’earing fellers talking it’s just like you cookie doin’ expensive things  under the cook’s glance of silent scorn he became first restive and then abusive winding up finally by demanding his money back  don’t you be a fool said the cook coarsely you leave it to me  and get tied up in a chair with my own bootlaces p’raps said the irritated seaman  the cook affecting not to hear him looked out for a bootshop and having found one walked in followed by the discontented sam and purchased a shilling’sworth of laces  wot am i to say demanded sam surlily as they stood outside and the cook hung half a dozen laces over his arm  you needn’t say anything replied the cook just walk in an’ ’old ’em up in the people’s faces an’ if anybody offers you a drink you may ’ave it  thank you for nothin’ said sam with prophetic insight  you take all the pubs this side of the ’igh street an’ i’ll take the other said the cook and if you look as cheerful as you look now you ought to take a lot o’ money  he turned away and with a farewell caution against drinking set off the stout seaman with a strong distaste for his job took the laces in his hand and bent his steps in the direction of a small but noisy tavern in the next street the public bar was full and sam’s heart failed him as he entered it and bearing the cook’s instructions in mind held up his wares to the customers most of them took no notice and the only man who said anything to him was a rednosed sergeant of marines who setting his glass with great deliberation on the counter gazed fixedly at a dozen laces crawling over his red sleeve his remarks when he discovered their connection with sam were of a severe and sweeping character and contained not the slightest reference to a drink  in the next bar he met a philanthropist who bought up his whole stockintrade the stout seaman was utterly unprepared for such kindness and stood looking at him dumbly his lips all atremble with naughty words  there there said his benefactor kindly never mind about thanking me  sam obeyed him easily and departing in silence went off raving to the nearest bootshop to buy more laces taught by experience he put some of his new stock in his pocket and with a couple of pairs in his hand entered the next tavern on his beat  the bar was pretty full but he pushed his way in and offering his wares in a perfunctory fashion looked round carefully for any signs of captain gething  outside said a smart barmaid with a toss of her head as she caught sight of him  i’m goin’ miss said sam blushing with shame hitherto most barmaids had treated him with kindness and in taverns where his powers were known usually addressed him as sir  down on your luck mate said a voice as he turned to go  starvin’ sir said sam who was never one to trouble about appearances  sit down said his new friend with a nod at the barmaid who was still regarding the seaman in a hostile fashion  sam sat down and mentally blessed the reservation regarding free drinks as his benefactor turned to the bar and gave his order his eyes beamed softly with a mixture of gratitude and amusement as his new friend came back with a pint of ale and half a loaf of bread  get through that old chap said the man as he handed him the bread and there’s some more where that came from  he sat down opposite and taking a long pull at the pewter watched with a kind smile to see the famished seaman eat he noted as a strange fact that starving men nibble gently at the outside crust first and then start on small very small mouthfuls of crumb instinct rather than reason probably warning them of the dangers of a surfeit  for a few minutes sam with one eye on the pewter and the other on the door struggled to perform his part then he rose and murmuring broken thanks said he would take some home to his wife and children  never mind your wife and children said his benefactor putting down the empty pewter you eat that up and i’ll give you a couple of loaves to take home to them  my ’art’s too full to eat said sam getting a little nearer the door  he means his stomach said a stern but youthful voice which the unhappy seaman knew only too well he turned smartly and saw the face of henry peering over the partition and beside it the grinning countenance of dick  he was on our ship this afternoon continued his youthful tormentor as he scrambled still higher up the partition and getting one arm over pointed an accusing finger at sam who had been pushed back into his seat we gave him a lovely dinner an’ arter he’d eat it he went off on the quiet in one of our chaps’ clothes  that’s right mates said the delighted dick nodding at the audience  one of our chaps named sam went on henry—one of the best an’ kindest ’earted chaps that ever breathed  regular brick he is assented dick  fine big ’ansome man he is said henry and this chap’s got his clothes on  the customers gazed sternly at sam as he sat openmouthed listening to these fulsome but untimely praises in every gathering there is sure to be one or two whose selfimposed mission it is to right wrongs and one of this type present at once suggested returning the clothes to the rightful owner his suggestion was adopted with enthusiasm and a dozen men closed round the hapless sam  outside gentlemen please said the barmaid hastily  they went out in a cluster the stout seaman in the centre fighting like a madman and nearly overturning three soldiers who were passing two of them were named murphy and one o’sullivan and the riot that ensued took three policemen and a picket to subdue sam glad of a chance to get away only saw the beginning of it and consumed by violent indignation did not pause until he had placed half a dozen streets between himself and the scene of his discomfiture  he had no intention of breaking faith with the cook but he had a pint and thought that circumstances justified it then he walked slowly up and down the street a little while debating whether he should continue the search or return to the schooner for a time he strolled on aimlessly and then resolving not to be defeated by the impertinences of dick and the boy paused before a highclass tavern and went in two or three welldressed men whose behavior contrasted favorably with that of the vulgar crew he had just left shook their heads but not unkindly and he was about to leave when a big blackbearded man entered  that’s a poor game said the big man glancing at the laces  yes sir said sam humbly  you look as if you thrive on it said the man somewhat sternly  it’s only looks sir said sam shaking his head as he walked to the door  drink i s’pose said the other  no sir said sam  when did you taste food last continued the other  yesterday morning said sam clearing a soft piece of bread from his teeth with his tongue  could you take something inquired the other  sam smiled expectantly and took a seat he heard his new friend order a pot and wiping his mouth on the back of his hand tried to think of something nice to say as he drank it then his blood froze in his veins and his jaw dropped as the other came from the counter and held out half a loaf  there my man he said kindly put that inside you  sam took it and tried to put it into his pocket and repeating his old tale about taking it home to the children rose to depart  you eat that and i’ll give you a couple of loaves to take home to them said the other  the bread fell from sam’s nerveless fingers and rolled on to the floor a bystander picked it up and wiping it on his coat returned it to him  go on said the big man taking a deep draught of his beer—eat away  i must see my children eat first said sam in a broken voice  you eat that bread or i’ll call a policeman and give you in charge said the other raising his voice i believe you’re an impostor where’s your hawker’s license  in a state bordering upon frenzy sam bit off a piece of the bread and tried to swallow it he took up a waterbottle and drank some of the contents and within five minutes had swallowed as many mouthfuls  go on said the donor sternly  i won’t said sam fiercely damned if i will  the other rose and went to the door just step this way a minute constable he said quietly  he stood aside and as sam paused with the bread in his hand the door opened and dick and henry entered and shaking their heads gazed sorrowfully upon him the big man sat down and laughed until he cried as sam realizing the plot of which he had been the victim flung the bread at henry and made for the door he went down the road mad with indignation and with a firm resolve to have no more to do with bootlaces pitched them away  hallo sam cried a figure from the other side of the road any luck  sam shook his head speechlessly  you’ve been drinkin said the cook as he came over  i ain’t said sam then a base idea occurred to him and he took the other by the arm  there’s a pub down here cook he said in a trembling voice an’ there’s an old chap there i can’t be certain of s’pose you go an’ have a look at ’im  which one inquired his innocent friend  full of a great joy sam led him to the place of his mortification and waiting until he was fairly in stood listening behind the door  why don’t they speak up he said crossly as a low indistinct murmuring reached him he strained his ears intently but could not catch anything and losing all patience was just about to push the door open and peep in when he heard a roar of laughter peal upon peal sounded until the bar shook with it and an expression of peace and rest came over his face as he pictured the scene inside  don’t said the cook’s voice feebly  there was another roar of laughter to which sam grinned a silent accompaniment  you’ll kill me said the cook again in a choking voice  no worse for you than for me my lad said sam with great content  there was another roar in which sam to his amazement fancied that the cook joined he was still listening in a state of maddening perplexity when he heard the cook’s voice again  poor old sam it said distinctly poor old sam i’d ’ave given anythin’ to ’ave seen him  the listener stiffened up suddenly and holding his breath went off on tiptoe down the street the sounds of the foolish mirth in the bar ringing in his ears as he went his brain was in a whirl but two definite objects shaped themselves in his mind as he walked fiercely on—to smash first the syndicate and then the cook with these ideas firmly fixed he went aboard again and going into the lonely foc’sle climbed into his bunk and forgot his sorrows in sleep—in a sleep so sound that the others upon their return an hour later failed to wake him until henry as a last expedient threw a slice of bread at him after which everybody had to keep awake all night to mount guard over their lives     chapter vii     the search at bymouth obtained no further assistance from sam for the remainder of their stay there he hardly moved from the ship preferring to smoke his pipe in peace on board to meeting certain jocular spirits ashore who wanted to buy bootlaces conversation with dick and the boy he declined altogether and it was not until they had reached cocklemouth that he deigned to accept a pipe of tobacco from the cook’s box  cocklemouth is a small lone place on the welsh coast when a large ship gets into the tiny harbor the inhabitants come down to see it and the skippers of small craft pop up from their cabins and yell out to know where it’s coming to even when they see it bound and guided by many hawsers they are not satisfied but dangling fenders in an obtrusive fashion over the sides of their ships prepare for the worst  we won’t find ’im ’ere cookie said sam as the syndicate sat on deck on the evening of their arrival gazing contemplatively at the few scattered lights which appeared as twilight deepened into night lonesome little place  i ain’t got much ’ope of finding ’im anywhere assented the cook  if it wasn’t for fear of dick finding ’im said sam viciously or the boy i’d just give it up cookie  if anybody finds ’im it’ll be the skipper hisself said the cook lowering his voice as the person alluded to passed them on his way ashore he goes to the police station with the portrait and arsts them there what chance ’ave we got after that  the seaman shook his head and after sitting for some time in silence went ashore with the cook and drank himself into a state of hopeless pessimism in this condition he forgave everybody and feeling very low made his will by the simple process of giving his knife to dick and two and sevenpence to henry the trouble he had in revoking it next morning furnished a striking illustration of the depths to which poor humanity can descend  it was bright and fine next day and after breakfast his spirits rose the persistent tinkle of a cracked bell from a small brick church in the town and the appearance of two girls walking along the quay with hymnbooks followed by two young men without reminded him that it was sunday  the skipper who was endeavoring to form new habits obeyed the summons of the bell the mate took a healthful walk of three miles while the crew sat about the deck watching the cook’s preparations for dinner and occasionally lending him some slight assistance it was not until the meal was despatched that they arrayed themselves in their sunday clothes and went ashore  dick went first having thoughtfully provided himself with the photograph which had been lent for the use of all of them he walked at first into the town but the bare shuttered shops and deserted streets worked upon his feelings and with his hands in his pockets he walked back in the direction of the harbor here he got into conversation with an elderly man of sedate aspect and after a little general talk beginning with the weather and ending with tobacco he produced the photograph and broached the subject of captain gething  well i’ve seen a man very much like it said his new friend after a prolonged study  where asked dick eagerly  i won’t say it’s the same man said the other slowly as he handed the portrait back but if it ain’t him it’s his brother  where repeated dick impatiently  well i don’t know that i ought to interfere said the man it ain’t my business  if a bob would— began dick  it would said the man smiling as he pocketed it he lives at piggott’s bay he said impressively  and where might that be inquired the seaman  the man turned and pointed across a piece of untidy waste ground to a coastguard’s path which wound its way along the top of the cliffs  follow that path as straight as you can go said he  how far said dick  well some people make a long journey of it and some a short one said the other oracularly shall we say six miles  dick said he would sooner say three  an easy six then said the man smiling indulgently well goodday to you  goodday mate said dick and plunging into the débris before him started on his walk  it was unfortunate for him in the sequel that sam and the cook who had started out for a quiet stroll without any intention of looking for captain gething or any nonsense of that kind had witnessed the interview from a distance by dint of hurrying they overtook the elderly man of sedate aspect and by dint of crossquestioning elicited the cause of dick’s sudden departure  which way is it inquired sam  you follow him said the man indicating the figure in front as it slowly ascended the cliff and you’ll be there as soon as he will  the comfortable stroll was abandoned and the couple keeping at a respectful distance followed their unconscious comrade the day was hot and the path which sometimes ran along the top of the cliff and sometimes along the side of it had apparently escaped the attention of the local county council no other person was in sight and the only things that moved were a few sheep nibbling the short grass which scampered off at their approach and a gull or two poised overhead  we want to get there afore ’e does said sam treading gingerly along a difficult piece of path  he’d see us if we ran along the beach said the cook  we can’t run on shingle said sam and it don’t seem much good just gettin’ there to see ’im find the cap’n does it  we must wait for an hoppertunity said the cook  sam grunted  an’ when it comes seize it at once continued the cook who disapproved of the grunt  they kept on for some time steadily though sam complained bitterly about the heat as he mopped his streaming brow  he’s going down on to the beach said the cook suddenly make a spurt for it sam and we’ll pass him  the stout seaman responded to the best of his ability and arriving at the place where dick had disappeared flung himself down on the grass and lay there panting he was startled by a cry of surprise from the cook  come on sam he said eagerly he’s going in for a swim  his friend moved to the edge of the cliff and looked over a little heap of clothing lay just below him and dick was striding over the sands to the sea  come on repeated the cook impatiently we’ve got the start  i should laugh if somebody was to steal his clothes said sam vindictively as he gazed at the garments  be all right for us if they did said the cook we’d have plenty o’ time to look around this ’ere piggott’s bay then he glanced at sam as he spoke and read his horrible purpose in his eyes no no he said hastily  not steal ’em cookie said sam seductively only bury ’em under the shingle i’ll toss you who does it  for sixty seconds the cook struggled gamely with the tempter  it’s just a bit of a joke cook said sam jovially dick ’ud be the first to laugh at it hisself if it was somebody else’s clothes he spun a penny in the air and covering it deftly held it out to the cook  heads said the latter softly  tails said sam cheerfully hurry up cook  the cook descended without a word and hastily interring the clothes not without an uneasy glance seaward scrambled up the cliff again and rejoined his exultant accomplice they set off in silence keeping at some distance from the edge of the cliff  business is business said the cook after a time and he wouldn’t join the syndikit  he was greedy and wanted it all said sam with severity  p’raps it’ll be a lesson to ’im said the cook unctuously i took the bearings of the place in case ’e don’t find ’em some people wouldn’t ha’ done that  they kept on steadily for another hour until at last they came quite suddenly upon a little fishing village situated on a tiny bay two or three small craft were anchored inside the stone pier along which two or three small children in all the restriction of sunday clothes were soberly pacing up and down  this must be it said sam keep your eyes open cook  what’s the name o’ this place mate said sam expectantly to an old salt who was passing  stonepen quay said the old man  sam’s face fell how far is it to piggott’s bay then he inquired  to where said the old man taking his pipe out of his mouth and staring hard  piggott’s bay said sam  you don’t tell me you’re looking for piggott’s bay said the old man  why not said sam shortly  instead of replying the old man slapped his leg and with his pipe cocked at one side of his mouth laughed a thin senile laugh with the other  when you’ve done laughin’ said the cook with dignity  but i ain’t said the old man removing his pipe and laughing with greater freedom they’re looking for piggott’s bay joe he said turning to a couple of fishermen who had just come up  what a lark said joe beaming with pleasure come far he inquired  cocklemouth said sam with a blank look when you’ve done laughin’ what’s the joke  why there ain’t no such place said the man it’s just a saying in these parts that’s all  just a wot said the bewildered sam faintly  it’s just a saying like said the other exchanging glances with his friends  i don’t take you said the cook how can a place be a sayin’  well it come through a chap about here named captain piggott said the fisherman speaking slowly he was a wonderful queer old chap and he got out of his reckoning once and made—ah south amerikey warn’t it dan  i believe so said the old man  he thought he’d found a new island continued the fisherman an’ he went ashore an’ hoisted the union jack and named it arter hisself piggott’s bay leastways that’s the tale his chaps gave out when they come ’ome now when anybody’s a bit out o’ their reckoning we say they’re looking for piggott’s bay it’s just a joke about here  he began to laugh again and sam noting with regret that he was a big fellow and strong turned away and followed in the footsteps of the cook who had already commenced the ascent of the cliff they paused at the top and looked back stonepen quay was still laughing  moved by a common idea of their personal safety they struck inland preferring an additional mile or two to encountering dick conversation was at a discount and they plodded on sulkily along the dusty road their lips parched and their legs aching  they got back to the seamew at seven o’clock and greeting henry who was in sole charge with fair words and soothing compliments persuaded him to make them some tea  where’s dick inquired sam casually as he sat drinking it  ain’t seen ’im since dinner said the boy i thought he was with you p’raps  sam shook his head and finishing his tea went on deck with the cook and gave himself up to all the delights of a quiet sprawl fatigued with their exertions neither of them moved until nine o’clock and then with a farewell glance in the direction in which dick might be expected to come went below and turned in  they left the lamp burning to the great satisfaction of henry who was reading and as ten o’clock struck somewhere in the town exchanged anxious glances across the foc’sle concerning dick’s safety safe and warm in their bunks it struck both of them that they had been perhaps a little bit selfish half an hour later henry looked up suddenly as something soft leaped on to the deck above and came pattering towards the foc’sle the next moment his surprise gave way to indignation and he raised his voice in tones of expostulation which mrs grundy herself would have envied  dick he cried shrilly dick  shut up said dick fiercely as he flung himself panting on a locker o my lord i have had a time  i’m surprised at you said henry severely as he dragged some blankets from the bunks and threw them over the exhausted seaman where’s your modesty dick  if you say another word i’ll knock yer ugly little head off said dick wrathfully if i hadn’t been modest i should have come home by daylight oh i have had a time i have had a time  where’s your clothes inquired henry  how the devil should i know snapped the other i left ’em on the beach while i went for a swim and when i comeback they’d gone i’ve been sittin’ on that damned cold shingle since three o’clock this arternoon and not a soul come near me it’s the first time i’ve been lookin’ for cap’n gething and it’ll be the last  oh you’ve been at it ’ave yer said henry i told you you chaps would get in a mess over that  you know a damned sight too much for your age growled dick there’s no call to say anything to sam and the cook about it mind  why not said henry  cos i say you’re not to said dick ferociously that’s why  p’raps they know said henry quietly seems to me sam’s listenin’ in his sleep  dick got up and going to their bunks inspected the sleep of both his comrades cautiously then with a repetition of his caution strengthened by fearful penalties for disobedience went to his own bunk and forgot his troubles in sleep he kept his secret all next day but his bewilderment when he awoke on tuesday morning and found the clothes in an untidy brown paper parcel lying on the deck led to its divulgence he told both sam and the cook about it and his opinion of both men went up when he found that they did not treat the matter in the light of a joke as he had feared neither of them even smiled neither did they extend much sympathy they listened apathetically and so soon as he had finished went straight off to sleep where they sat—a performance which they repeated at every opportunity throughout the whole of the day     chapter viii     the seamew lay at cocklemouth another three days in which time dick after a twelvemile walk learnt all there was to learn about piggott’s bay the second outrage was likely to have seriously injured his constitution but the silver lining of the cloud caught his eye just as he was closing it in sleep and the tension was removed  i’ve been thinkin’ sam he said next morning that i’ve been rather selfish over that syndikit business i ought to ’ave joined it  you can please yourself said sam  but it’s better late than never said dick turning to the cook who had joined them i’m goin’ to put you in the way of findin’ cap’n gething  the cook portrayed gratified surprise  i know for certain that he’s livin’ at a place called piggott’s bay a little place just up the coast here continued dick if you two chaps like to walk out this evening and find him you can have two quid apiece and just give me one for myself  oh said sam and stood thunderstruck at his hardihood  but it wouldn’t be fair to you dick urged the cook we won’t take no advantage of you the five pounds is yours  i don’t want it said dick earnestly i want to punish myself for being greedy if you two ’ll just go there and find him i’ll take it as a favor  oh well we’ll go then said the cook with deceitful joy  dick’s ’art’s in the right place cook observed sam we’d better get away directly arter tea  i’d like to shake you by the ’and dick said the cook warmly  me too said sam taking it as the cook relinquished it you’re a fair brick dick an’ no error  true blue said the complimentary cook  we’ll start directly arter tea if you’ll get us the flag dick said sam  flag said dick—flag  why yes the union jack said sam looking at him in simple surprise it’s no use going to piggott’s bay without a union jack didn’t you know that dick arter goin’ there last night too  he stood in an easy attitude waiting for an answer and gazed in clumsy surprise at dick as that archdeceiver stamped his way down below in a fury he even went so far as to pretend that dick had gone down for the flag in question and gingerly putting his head down the scuttle said that a pair of bathing drawers would do if it was not forthcoming—a piece of pleasantry which he would willingly have withdrawn when the time came for him to meet dick at dinner  by the time they reached northfleet again all interest in the search had practically ceased for one thing it was an unpleasant thing for grown men to be exposed to the gibes of henry and for another looking at it in the cold clear light of reason they could but see that there was very little prospect of success in the cabin pessimism was also to the front with the mate as its mouthpiece  it’s against all reason he said after arguing the matter a little you can’t expect to find him now take my advice you’re doing better with a safe trade between here and brittlesea—stick to that  i won’t said the other doggedly  it’s hard on ’em said the mate—the old men i mean—chevying ’em and hunting ’em about just because they’ve got gray whiskers and are getting into years besides which some of the crew ’ll get into a mess sooner or later  talk as much as you like you won’t affect me retorted the other who was carrying on the conversation as he was down below washing  there you go again said the mate making yourself look nice what for another fellow’s girl turn it and twist it as much as you please that’s what it comes to  when i want your advice said the skipper covering his confusion by a vigorous use of the towel i’ll ask for it  he finished dressing in silence and went ashore and after looking about him in a perfunctory fashion strolled off in the direction of gravesend the one gleam of light in his present condition was the regular habits of schools and as he went along he blessed the strong sense of punctuality which possessed the teaching body at four o’clock  today however his congratulations were somewhat premature for long after the children had come and gone there was no sign of annis gething he walked up and down the road wondering halfpast four five he waited until six o’clock—an object of much interest to sundry ladies who were eyeing him stealthily from their front parlor windows—and was just going at a quarterpast when he saw her coming towards him  back again she said as she shook hands  just back said he  no news of my father i suppose said annis none i’m sorry to say said the skipper you’re late tonight aren’t you  rather  you look tired said the skipper with tenderness  well i’m not said annis i just stayed and had a cup of tea with miss grattan mother has gone out so i didn’t hurry  out now inquired he  miss gething nodded brightly and having by this time reached the corner of a road came to a stop  i’m not going in just yet she said glancing up the road towards her house i’m going for a walk  i hope it will be a pleasant one said wilson after a pause devoted to wondering whether he might venture to offer to accompany her goodbye he held out his hand  goodbye said annis if you like to call in and wait to see mother she will be pleased to see you i’m sure  is there anybody to let me in inquired wilson  mr glover is there i expect said annis looking steadily across the road  i—i’ll call another time said the perplexed wilson but i should have thought—  thought what said she  nothin’ said he i—are you going for a long walk  not very far said she why  i suppose you prefer going alone  i don’t mind it said annis gothing but you can come if you like  they turned down the road together and for some time walked on in silence  what was that you were going to say just now said annis when the silence threatened to become awkward  when said wilson  when i told you that mr glover was at our house you said you should have thought— she turned and regarded him with an expression in her eyes which he tried in vain to decipher  well i should have thought he said desperately that you would have wanted to go there  i don’t understand you said annis coldly i think you are rather rude  i beg your pardon said wilson humbly i’m very sorry very  there was another long silence during which they left the road and entered a footpath it was very narrow and annis walked in front  i would give anything to find your father said wilson earnestly  oh i wish you could i wish you could said annis looking at him over her shoulder  i suppose mr glover is trying all he can said wilson  i want my father said annis with sudden passion—i want him badly but i would sooner anybody than mr glover found him  but you are to be married when he is found said the puzzled wilson  if mr glover finds him said annis in a low voice  do you mean to say said the skipper in his excitement he caught her by the arm and she did not release it—do you mean to say that you are not going to marry this glover unless he finds your father  yes said annis that is the arrangement mother fretted so and i thought nothing mattered much if we could only find my father so i promised  and i suppose if anybody else finds him faltered wilson as with a ruthless disregard of growing crops he walked beside her  in that case said annis looking at him pleasantly i sha’n’t marry is that what you mean  i didn’t mean quite that said wilson i was going to say—  there said annis stopping suddenly and pointing isn’t there a fine view of the river from here  splendid said wilson  it is my favorite walk said annis  wilson made a mental note of it especially when mr glover is at your house he said foolishly  mr glover has been very kind said annis gravely he has been very good to my mother and he has gone to a great deal of trouble in his search for my father  well i hope he doesn’t find him said wilson annis turned and regarded him fixedly that is very kind of you she said with severity  i want to find him myself said wilson closely watching the river and you know why  i must get back said annis without contesting the statement  wilson felt his courage oozing and tried to hint at what he dared not say i should like you to treat me the same as you do mr glover he said nervously  i’ll do that with pleasure said annis promptly in spite of herself her lips quivered and her eyes danced  i’ve loved you ever since the first time i saw you said wilson with sudden vehemence  utterly unprepared for this direct attack miss gething had no weapon to meet it the tables were turned and reddening with confusion she looked away and made no reply  i’ve spent days walking up and down the road the school is in because you were there continued wilson i’ve wondered sometimes that the school children didn’t notice it  miss gething turned to him a cheek which was of the richest carmine if it’s any pleasure to you to know it they did she said viciously i taught one small infant the blessing of silence by keeping her in three afternoons  i can’t help it said wilson you’ll have to keep the whole school in before i get over my fondness for that road what did she say  suppose we get back said annis coldly and turning walked silently beside him neither spoke until they reached the lane again and then wilson stopped and met her gaze full and fair miss gething after a brave trial abandoned the contest and lowered her eyes  will you serve us both alike said wilson in a low voice  no said annis she looked up at him shyly and smiled a light broke in upon him and seizing her hand he drew her towards him  no said annis drawing back sharply it wouldn’t be right  afraid he had gone too far wilson’s cowardice got the better hand again what wouldn’t he asked with an awkward attempt at innocence a tiny but ominous sparkle in miss gething’s eye showed her opinion of this unfairness  i beg your pardon he said humbly  what for asked miss gething innocently in her turn  soon tired of devious paths in which he lost himself wilson tried a direct one again for trying to kiss you and then pretending i didn’t know what you meant when you refused he said bluntly  captain wilson said miss gething breathlessly i—i don’t know what you mean  yes you do said wilson calmly  the sparkle came in miss gething’s eye again then she bit her lip and turned her head away miserably realizing her inability to treat this transgressor with the severity that he deserved  this is the first time you have ever said things of this sort to a girl i should think she said at last  yes said wilson simply  you want practice said miss gething scornfully  that’s just what i do want said wilson eagerly  he was moving towards her again but she checked him with a look  but not with a girl who is half engaged to another man she said regarding him with soft eyes it isn’t right  does he know how it is inquired wilson referring of course to the absent glover  miss gething nodded  i think it’s quite right and proper then said wilson  i don’t said annis holding out her hand i’ll say goodbye she said steadily i won’t see you again until my father is found if mr glover finds him i won’t see you at all goodbye  the skipper took her hand and marvelling at his pluck drew her resisting slightly towards him again then he bent his head and with the assistance of miss gething kissed the brim of her hat then she broke from him and ran lightly up the lane pausing at the end to stop and wave her hand ere she disappeared the skipper waved his in return and glancing boldly at a horse which had witnessed all the proceedings from over the hedge walked back to northfleet to urge his dispirited crew to still further efforts     chapter ix     to the skipper’s surprise and disapproval annis kept her word to be sure she could not prevent him meeting her in the road when the schooner was at northfleet his attitude when she tried to being one of wilful and deliberate defiance she met this disobedience adeptly by taking a pupil home with her and when even this was not sufficient added to the number the day on which she appeared in the road with four small damsels was the last day the skipper accompanied her he could only walk in front or behind the conversation was severely technical and the expression on the small girls’ faces precocious in the extreme  the search went on all the summer the crew of the seamew causing much comment at the various ports by walking about as though they had lost something they all got to wear a bereaved appearance after a time which in the case of the cook—who had risked some capital in the affair—was gradually converted to one of resignation  at the beginning of september they found themselves at ironbridge a small town on the east coast situated on the river lebben as usual the skipper’s inquiries revealed nothing ironbridge was a small place with absolutely nothing to conceal but it was a fine day and henry who disliked extremely the task of assisting to work out the cargo obtained permission to go ashore to purchase a few small things for the cook and look round  he strolled along blithely casting a glance over his shoulders at the dusty cloud which hung over the seamew as he went it was virgin soil to him and he thirsted for adventure  the town contained but few objects of interest before the advent of railways it had been a thriving port with a considerable trade now its streets were sleepy and its wharves deserted besides the seamew the only other craft in the river was a tiny sloop the cargo of which two men were unloading by means of a basket and pulley and a hand truck  the quietude told upon henry who after a modest halfpint lit his pipe and sauntered along the narrow high street with his hands in his pockets a short walk brought him to the white hurdles of the desolate marketplace here the town as a town ended and gave place to a few large houses standing in their own grounds  well give me london said henry to himself as he paused at a high brick wall and looked at the fruit trees beyond why the place seems dead  he scrambled up on to the wall and perched on the top whistled softly the grownup flavor of halfpints had not entirely eradicated a youthful partiality for apples he was hidden from the house by the trees and almost involuntarily he dropped down on the other side of the wall and began to fill his pockets with the fruit  things were so quiet that he became venturesome and imitating the stealthy movement of the red indian whom he loved so far as six or seven pounds of apples would allow him made his way to a large summerhouse and peeped in it was empty except for a table and a couple of rough benches and after another careful look round he entered and seating himself on the bench tried an apple  he was roused to a sense of the danger of his position by footsteps on the path outside which coming nearer and nearer were evidently aimed at the summerhouse with a silence and celerity of which any brave would have been proud he got under the table  there you are you naughty little girl said a woman’s voice you will not come out until you know your rivers perfectly  somebody was pushed into the summerhouse the door slammed behind and a key turned in the lock the footsteps retreated again and the embarrassed brave realized that he was in a cruelly false position his very life so to speak depending on the strength a small girl’s scream  i don’t care said a dogged voice bother your rivers bother your rivers bother your rivers  the owner of the voice sat on the table and hummed fiercely in the stress of mental anguish caused by his position henry made a miscalculation and in turning bumped the table heavily with his head  ough said the small girl breathlessly  don’t be frightened said henry popping up humbly i won’t hurt you  hoo said the small girl in a flutter a boy  henry rose and seated himself respectfully coughing confusedly as he saw the small girl’s gaze riveted on his pockets  what have you got in your pockets she asked  apples said henry softly i bought ’em in the town  the small girl extended her hand and accepting a couple inspected them carefully  you’re a bad wicked boy she said seriously as she bit into one you’ll get it when miss dimchurch comes  who’s miss dimchurch inquired henry with pardonable curiosity  schoolmistress said the small girl  is this a school said henry  the small girl her mouth full of apple nodded  any men here inquired henry with an assumed carelessness  the small girl shook her head  you’re the only boy i’ve ever seen here she said gleefully you’ll get it when miss dimchurch comes  his mind relieved of a great fear henry leaned back and smiled confidently  i’m not afraid of the old girl he said quietly as he pulled out his pipe and filled it  the small girl’s eyes glistened with admiration  i wish i was a boy she said plaintively then i shouldn’t mind her are you a sailorboy  sailor corrected henry yes  i like sailors said the small girl amicably you may have a bite of my apple if you like  never mind thanks said henry hastily i’ve got a clean one here  the small girl drew herself up and eyed him haughtily but finding that he was not looking at her resumed her apple  what’s your name she asked  ’enery hatkins replied the youth as he remembered sundry cautions about the letter h he had received at school what’s yours  gertrude ursula florence harcourt said the small girl sitting up straighter to say it i don’t like the name of atkins  don’t you said henry trying not to show resentment i don’t like gertrude or ursula or florence and harcourt’s the worst of all  miss harcourt drew off three or four inches and drummed with the tips of her fingers on the table i don’t care what you like she said humming  i like gerty said henry with the air of a connoisseur as he looked at the small flushed face i think gerty’s very pretty  that’s what they always call me said miss harcourt carelessly does your ship go right out to sea  yes said the boy they had been blown out to sea once and he salved his conscience with that  and how many times said gertrude ursula florence harcourt getting nearer to him again have you had fights with pirates  she left absolutely no loophole if she had asked him whether he had ever fought pirates he would have said no though that would have been hard with her little excitable face turned towards his and the dark blue eyes dancing with interest  i forget whether it was six or seven said henry atkins i think it was only six  tell us all about them said miss harcourt shifting with excitement  henry took a bite of his apple and started thankful that a taste for reading of a thrilling description had furnished him with material he fought ships in a way which even admirals had never thought of and certainly not the pirates who were invariably discomfited by the ingenious means by which he enabled virtue to triumph over sin miss harcourt held her breath with pleasurable terror and tightened or relaxed the grip of her small and not too clean fingers on his arm as the narrative proceeded  but you never killed a man yourself said she when he had finished there was an inflection just a slight inflection of voice which henry thought undeserved after the trouble he had taken  i can’t exactly say he replied shortly you see in the heat—he got it right that time—in the heat of an engagement you can’t be sure  of course you can’t said miss harcourt repenting of her unreasonableness you are brave henry blushed  are you an officer inquired miss harcourt  not quite said henry wishing somehow that he was  if you make haste and become an officer i’ll marry you when i grow up said miss harcourt smiling on him kindly that is if you like of course  i should like it very much said henry wistfully i didn’t mean it when i said i didn’t like your names just now  you shouldn’t have told stories then said miss harcourt severely but not unkindly i can’t bear storytellers  the consciencestricken henry groaned inwardly but reflecting there was plenty of time to confess before the marriage brightened up again the rivers of europe had fallen beneath the table and were entirely forgotten until the sounds of many feet and many voices in the garden recalled them to a sense of their position  playtime said the small girl picking up her book and skipping to the farthest seat possible from henry thames seine danube rhine  a strong firm step stopped outside the door and a key turned in the lock the door was thrown open and miss dimchurch peeping in drew back with a cry of surprise behind her some thirty small girls who saw her surprise but not the reason for it waited eagerly for light  miss harcourt said the principal in an awful voice  yes ma’am said miss harcourt looking up with her finger in the book to keep the place  how dare you stay in here with this person demanded the principal  it wasn’t my fault said miss harcourt working up a whimper you locked me in he was here when i came  why didn’t you call after me demanded miss dimchurch  i didn’t know he was here he was under the table said miss harcourt  miss dimchurch turned and bestowed a terrible glance upon henry who with his forgotten pipe in his hand looked uneasily up to see whether he could push past her miss harcourt holding her breath gazed at the destroyer of pirates and waited confidently for something extraordinary to happen  he’s been stealing my apples said miss dimchurch tragically where’s the gymnasium mistress  the gymnasium mistress a tall pretty girl was just behind her  remove that horrid boy miss o’brien said the principal  don’t worry said henry trying to speak calmly i’ll go stand away here i don’t want to be hard on wimmin  take him out commanded the mistress  miss o’brien pleased at this opportunity of displaying her powers entered and squaring her shoulders stood over the intruder in much the same way that henry had seen barmen stand over sam  look here now he said turning pale you drop it i don’t want to hurt you  he placed his pipe in his pocket and rose to his feet as the gymnasium mistress caught him in her strong slender arms and raised him from the ground her grip was like steel and a babel of admiring young voices broke upon his horrified ears as his captor marched easily with him down the garden their progress marked by apples which rolled out of his pockets and bounded along the ground  i shall kick you whispered henry fiercely—ignoring the fact that both legs were jammed together—as he caught sight of the pale bewildered little face of gertrude u f harcourt  kick away said miss o’brien sweetly and using him as a dumbbell threw in a gratuitous gymnastic display for the edification of her pupils  if you come here again you naughty little boy said miss dimchurch who was heading the procession behind i shall give you to a policeman open the gate girls  the gate was open and henry half dead with shame was thrust into the road in full view of the cook who had been sent out in search of him  wot ’enery said the cook in unbelieving accents as he staggered back aghast at the spectacle—wotever ’ave you been adoin’ of  he’s been stealing my apples said miss dimchurch sternly if i catch him here again i shall cane him  quite right ma’am i hope he hasn’t hurt anybody said the cook unable to realize fully the discomfiture of the youth  miss dimchurch slammed the gate and left the couple standing in the road the cook turned and led the way down to the town again accompanied by the crestfallen henry  ’ave a apple cook said the latter proffering one i saved a beauty apurpose for you  no thanks said the cook  it won’t bite you said henry shortly  no and i won’t bite it either replied the cook  they continued their way in silence until at the marketplace henry paused in front of the farmer’s arms  come in and ’ave a pint old chap he said cordially  no thankee said the cook again it’s no use enery you don’t git over me in that way  wot d’ye mean blustered the youth  you know said the other darkly  no i don’t said henry  well i wouldn’t miss tellin’ the other chaps no not for six pints said the cook cheerfully you’re a deep un ’enery but so am i  glad you told me said the outgeneralled youth nobody’d think so to look at your silly fat face  the cook smiled indulgently and going aboard left his youthful charge to give the best explanation he could of his absence to the skipper—an explanation which was marred for him by the childish behavior of the cook at the other end of the ship who taking the part of miss o’brien for himself gave that of henry to a cork fender which when it became obstreperous—as it frequently did on the slightest provocation—he slapped vigorously giving sundry falsetto howls which he fondly imagined were in good imitation of henry after three encores the skipper stepped forward for enlightenment returning to the mate with a grin so aggravating that the sensitive henry was near to receiving a thrashing for insubordination of the most impertinent nature     chapter x     from ironbridge two days later they sailed with a general cargo for stourwich the seamew picking her way carefully down the river by moonlight followed at an everincreasing distance by a cork fender of abandoned aspect  a great change had come over henry and an attitude of proud reserve had taken the place of the careless banter with which he usually regaled the crew he married miss o’brien in imagination to a strong man of villainous temper and despotic ideas while the explanations he made to miss harcourt were too ingenious and involved to be confined in the space of a single chapter to these daydreams idle though he knew they were he turned as a welcome relief from the coarse vulgarity of the crew  sympathy had widened his ideas and he now felt a tender but mournful interest in the skipper’s affairs he read aloud to himself at every opportunity and aspirated his h’s until he made his throat ache his aspirations also extended to his conversation until at last the mate told him plainly that if he blew in his face again he’d get his ears boxed  they passed the breakwater and dropped anchor in the harbor of stourwich just as the rising sun was glowing red on the steeple of the town church the narrow fishy little streets leading from the quay were deserted except for one lane down which sleepy passengers were coming in twos and threes to catch the boat which was chafing and grinding against the timbers of the jetty and pouring from its twinfunnels dense volumes of smoke to take the sting out of the morning air  little by little as the seamew who was not quite certain as to her berth rode at anchor the town came to life again men of marine appearance in baggy trousers and tight jerseys came slowly on to the quay and stared meditatively at the water or shouted vehemently at other men who had got into small boats to bale them out with rusty cans from some of these loungers after much shouting and contradictory information the seamew discovered her destination and was soon fast alongside  the cargo—a very small one—was out by three o’clock that afternoon and the crew having replaced the hatches and cleaned up went ashore together after extending an invitation to henry—which was coldly declined—to go with them  the skipper was already ashore and the boy after enduring for some time the witticisms of the mate on the subject of apples went too  for some time he wandered aimlessly about the town with his hands in his pockets the season was drawing to an end but a few holidaymakers were lounging about on the parade or venturing carefully along the dreary breakwater to get the full benefit of the sea air idly watching these and other objects of interest on the seashore the boy drifted on until he found himself at the adjoining wateringplace of overcourt  the parade ended in two flights of steps one of which led to the sands and the other to the road and the cliffs above for people who cared for neither thoughtful local authorities had placed a long seat and on this henry placed himself and sat for some time regarding with the lenity of age the erratic sports of the children below he had sat there for some time when he became idly interested in the movements of an old man walking along the sands to the steps arrived at the foot he disappeared from sight then a huge hand gripped the handrail and a peaked cloth cap was revealed to the suddenly interested henry for the face of the old man was the face of the wellthumbed photograph in the foc’sle  unconscious of the wild excitement in the breast of the small boy on the seat the old man paused to take breath for the next flight  have you—got such a thing as a—as a match—about you said henry trying to speak calmly but failing  you’re overyoung to smoke said the old man turning round and regarding him  at any other time with any other person henry’s retort to this would have been rude but the momentous events which depended on his civility restrained him  i find it soothing he said with much gravity if i get overworked or worried  the old man regarded him with unfeigned astonishment a grim smile lurking at the corners of his wellhidden mouth  if you were my boy he said shortly as he put his forefinger and thumb into his waistcoat pocket and extracted a timestained lucifer do you know what i’d do to you  stop me smoking hazarded henry cheerfully  i would that said the other turning to go  how old were you when you started smoking asked the boy  about your age i expect said the old man slowly but i was a much bigger chap than you are a stunted little chap like you ought not to smoke  henry smiled wanly and began to think that the five pounds would be well earned  will you have a pipe he said proffering a gaudy pouch  confound you said the old man flashing into sudden weak anger when i want your tobacco i’ll ask you for it  no offence said the boy hastily no offence it’s some i bought cheap and our chaps said i’d been ’ad i only wanted to see what you thought of it  the old man hesitated a moment and then taking the seat beside him accepted the proffered pouch and smelt the contents critically then he drew a small black clay from his pocket and slowly filled it  smokes all right he said after a few puffs he leaned back and half closing his eyes smoked with the enjoyment of an old smoker to whom a pipe is a somewhat rare luxury while henry regarded his shabby clothes and muchpatched boots with great interest  stranger here inquired the old man amiably  schooner seamew down in the harbor said henry indicating the distant town of stourwich with a wave of his hand  ay ay said the old man and smoked in silence  got to stay here for a few days said henry watching him out of the tail of his eye then back  london suggested the other  northfleet said henry carelessly that’s where we came from  the old man’s face twitched ever so slightly and he blew out a cloud of smoke  do you live there he inquired  wapping said henry but i know northfleet very well—gravesend too ever been there  never said the old man emphatically never  rather a nice place i think said henry i like it better than wapping we’ve sailed from there a year now our skipper is fond of it too he’s rather sweet on a girl who’s teacher in a school there  what school asked the old man  the boy gave a slight laugh well it’s no good telling you if you don’t know the place he said easily it’s a girls’ school  i used to know a man that lived there said the other speaking slowly and carefully what’s her name  i forget said the boy yawning  conversation flagged and the two sat idly watching the last of the children as they toiled slowly towards home from the sands the sun had set and the air was getting chilly  i’ll be getting home said the old man goodnight my lad  goodnight to you said the wellmannered henry  he watched the old man’s still strong figure as it passed slowly up the steps and allowing him to get some little distance start cautiously followed he followed him up the steps and along the cliff the figure in front never halting until it reached a small court at the back of a livery stable then heedless of the small shadow now very close behind it pushed open the door of a dirty little house and entered the shadow crept up and paused irresolute and then after a careful survey of the place stole silently and swiftly away  the shadow choosing the road because it was quicker now danced back to stourwich and jumping lightly on to the schooner came behind the cook and thumped him heavily on the back before the cook could seize him he had passed on to sam and embracing as much of that gentleman’s waist as possible vainly besought him to dance  ’e’s off ’is ’ead said sam shaking himself free and regarding him unfavorably what’s wrong kiddy  nothing said henry jubilantly everything’s right  more happles said the cook with a nasty sneer  no it ain’t apples said henry hotly you never get more than one idea at a time into that ’ead of yours where’s the skipper i’ve got something important to tell ’im—something that’ll make ’im dance  wot is it said the cook and sam together turning pale  now don’t get excited said henry holding up his hand warningly it’s bad for you sam because you’re too fat and it’s bad for cookie because ’is ’ead’s weak you’ll know all in good time  he walked aft leaving them to confer uneasily as to the cause of his jubilant condition and hastily descending the companion ladder burst noisily into the cabin and surveyed the skipper and mate with a smile which he intended should be full of information both looked up in surprise and the skipper who was in a very bad temper half rose from his seat  where’ve you been you young rascal he asked eyeing him sternly  looking around said henry still smiling as he thought of the change in the skipper’s manner when he should disclose his information  this is the second time you’ve taken yourself off roared the other angrily i’ve half a mind to give you the soundest thrashing you ever had in your life  all right said henry somewhat taken aback when—  don’t answer me you idle young rascal said the skipper sternly get to bed  i want to—— began henry chilled by this order  get to bed repeated the skipper rising  bed said henry as his face hardened bed at seven o’clock  i’ll punish you somehow said the skipper looking from him to the cook who had just descended cook  yes sir said the cook briskly  put that boy to bed said the other and see he goes now  a’ right sir said the grinning cook come along ’enery  with a pale face and a haughty mien which under other circumstances might have been extremely impressive henry after an entreating glance at the skipper followed him up the steps  ’e’s got to go to bed said the cook to sam and dick who were standing together ’e’s been naughty  who said so asked sam eagerly  skipper replied the cook ’e told me we wos to put him to bed ourselves  you needn’t trouble said henry stiffly i’ll go all right  it’s no trouble said sam oilily  it’s a pleasure said dick truthfully  arrived at the scuttle henry halted and with an assumption of ease he was far from feeling yawned and looked round at the night  go to bed said sam reprovingly and seizing him in his stout arms passed him below to the cook feet first as the cook discovered to his cost  ’e ought to be bathed first said sam assuming the direction of affairs and it’s monday night and ’e ought to have a clean nightgown on  is ’is little bed made inquired the cook anxiously  ’is little bed’s just proper said dick patting it  we won’t bathe him tonight said sam as he tied a towel apronwise round his waist it ’ud be too long a job now ’enery come on to my lap  aided by willing arms he took the youth on to his knee and despite his frantic struggles began to prepare him for his slumbers at the pressing request of the cook he removed the victim’s boots first and as dick said it was surprising what a difference it made then having washed the boy’s face with soap and flannel he lifted him into his berth grinning respectfully up at the face of the mate as it peered down from the scuttle with keen enjoyment of the scene  is the boy asleep he inquired aggravatingly as henry’s arms and legs shot out of the berth in mad attempts to reach his tormentors  sleeping like a little hangel sir said sam respectfully would you like to come down and see he’s all right sir  bless him said the grinning mate  he went off and henry making the best of a bad job closed his eyes and refused to be drawn into replying to the jests of the men ever since he had been on the schooner he had been free from punishment of all kinds by the strict order of the skipper—a situation of which he had taken the fullest advantage now his power was shaken and he lay grinding his teeth as he thought of the indignity to which he had been subjected     chapter xi     he resolved that he would keep his discovery to himself it was an expensive luxury but he determined to indulge in it and months or years later perhaps he would allow the skipper to learn what he had lost by his overbearing brutality somewhat soothed by this idea he fell asleep  his determination which was strong when he arose weakened somewhat as the morning wore on the skipper who had thought no more of the matter after giving his hasty instructions to the cook was in a soft and amiable mood and as henry said to himself fifty times in the course of the morning five pounds was five pounds by the time ten o’clock came he could hold out no longer and with a full sense of the favor he was about to confer he approached the unconscious skipper  before he could speak he was startled by a commotion on the quay and looking up saw the cook who had gone ashore for vegetables coming full tilt towards the ship he appeared to be laboring under strong excitement and bumped passersby and dropped cabbages with equal unconcern  what on earth’s the matter with the cook said the skipper as the men suspended work to gaze on the approaching figure what’s wrong he demanded sharply as the cook giving a tremendous leap on board rushed up and spluttered in his ear  what he repeated  the cook with his hand on his distressed chest gasped for breath  captain gething panted the cook at last recovering his breath with an effort round the—corner  almost as excited as the cook the skipper sprang ashore and hurried along the quay with him violently shaking off certain respectable citizens who sought to detain the cook and ask him what he meant by it  i expect you’ve made a mistake said the skipper as they rapidly reached the small street don’t run—we shall have a crowd  if it wasn’t ’im it was his twin brother said the cook ah there he is that’s the man  he pointed to henry’s acquaintance of the previous day who with his hands in his pockets was walking listlessly along on the other side of the road  you get back said the skipper hurriedly you’d better run a little then these staring idiots ’ll follow you  the cook complied and the curious seeing that he appeared to be the more irrational of the two and far more likely to get into mischief set off in pursuit the skipper crossed the road and began gently to overtake his quarry  he passed him and looking back regarded him unobserved the likeness was unmistakable and for a few seconds he kept on his way in doubt how to proceed then he stopped and turning round waited till the old man should come up to him  goodmorning he said pleasantly  morning said the old man half stopping  i’m in a bit of a difficulty said the skipper laughing i’ve got a message to deliver to a man in this place and i can’t find him i wonder whether you could help me  what’s his name asked the other  captain gething said the skipper  the old man started and his face changed to an unwholesome white i never heard of him he muttered thickly trying to pass on  nobody else seems to have heard of him either said the skipper turning with him that’s the difficulty  he waited for a reply but none came the old man with set face walked on rapidly  he’s supposed to be in hiding continued the skipper if you should ever run across him you might tell him that his wife and daughter annis have been wanting news of him for five years and that he’s making all this trouble and fuss about a man who is as well and hearty as i am goodmorning  the old man stopped abruptly and taking his outstretched hand drew a deep breath  tell him—the—man—is alive he said in a trembling voice  just that said the skipper gently and seeing the working of the other’s face looked away for a little while they both stood silent then the skipper spoke again  if i take you back he said i am to marry your daughter annis he put his hand on the old man’s and without a word the old man turned and went with him  they walked back slowly towards the harbor the young man talking the old man listening outside the post office the skipper came to a sudden stop  how would it be to send a wire he asked  i think said the old man eagerly as he followed him in it would be the very thing  he stood watching attentively as the skipper tore up form after form meditatively sucking the chained lead pencil with a view to inspiration between whiles captain gething as an illiterate had every sympathy with one involved in the throes of writing and for some time watched his efforts in respectful silence after the fifth form had rolled a little crumpled ball on to the floor however he interposed  i can’t think how to put it said the skipper apologetically i don’t want to be too sudden you know  just so said the other and stood watching him until with a smile of triumph twitching the corners of his mouth the skipper bent down and hastily scrawled off a message  you’ve done it he said with relief  how does this strike you asked the skipper reading your father sends love to you both  beautiful murmured captain gething  not too sudden said the skipper it doesn’t say i’ve found you or anything of that sort only hints at it i’m proud of it  you ought to be said captain gething who was in the mood to be pleased with anything lord how pleased they’ll be poor dears i’m ashamed to face ’em  stuff said the skipper who was in high spirits as he clapped him on the back what you want is a good stiff drink  he led him into a neighboring bar and a little later the crew of the schooner who had been casting anxious and curious glances up the quay saw the couple approaching them both captains were smoking big cigars in honor of the occasion and captain gething before going on board halted and in warm terms noticed the appearance of the seamew  the crew pausing in their labors looked on expectantly as they reached the deck on the cook’s face was a benevolent and proprietary smile while henry concealed his anguish of soul under an appearance of stoic calm  this is the man said the skipper putting his hand on the cook’s shoulder this is the man that found you cap’n smartest and best chap i ever had sail with me  flushed with these praises but feeling that he fully deserved them the cook took the hand which captain gething after a short struggle with the traditions of ship masters extended and shook it vigorously having once started he shook hands all round winding up with the reluctant henry  why i’ve seen this boy before he said starting had a chat with him yesterday that’s what brought me down here today to see whether i couldn’t find him again  well i’m hanged said the astonished skipper he’s as sharp as needles as a rule what were you doing with your eyes henry  in an agony of mortification and rage as he saw the joy depicted on the faces of the crew the boy let the question pass the cook at the skipper’s invitation followed him below his reappearance being the signal for anxious inquiries on the part of his friends he answered them by slapping his pocket and then thrusting his hand in produced five gold pieces at first it was all congratulations then sam after a short hard cough struck a jarring note  don’t you wish now as you’d joined the syndikit dick he asked boldly  wot said the cook hastily replacing the coins  i arst ’im whether he was sorry ’e ’adn’t joined us said sam trying to speak calmly  the cook threw out his hand and looked round appealingly to the landscape to bear witness to this appalling attempt at brigandage  you needn’t look like that said sam two pun ten’s wot i want of you an’ i’ll take it afore you lose it  then the cook found words and with dick and henry for audience made an impassioned speech in defence of vested interests and the sacred rights of property never in his life had he been so fluent or so inventive and when he wound up a noble passage on the rights of the individual in which he alluded to sam as a fat sharper he felt that his case was won  two pun ten said sam glowering at him  the cook moistening his lips with his tongue resumed his discourse  two pun ten said sam again an’ i don’t know what you’re goin’ to do with your half but i’m goin’ to give ten bob to dick  why don’t you give the man his money said dick warmly  becos the syndikit ’ad all fell through said the cook the syndikit was only a syndikit when we was both looking for ’im together if the syndikit—  that’s enough about ’em said dick impatiently give the man ’is money everybody knows you was goin’ shares i’m ashamed of you cook i wouldn’t have thought it of you  it ended in simple division dick taking what was over on sam’s side and more than hinting that he was ready to do the cook a similar service the cook turned a deaf ear however and declining in emphatic language to step ashore and take something went and sulked in the galley  at dinnertime a telegram came from annis and the next morning brought a letter from her which the skipper read aloud to the proud father he read it somewhat jerkily omitting sentences and halves of sentences which he thought might not interest the old man or perhaps what was more likely would interest him a great deal after that they were all busy taking in the cargo captain gething in shirt and trousers insisting upon lending a hand  the cargo was all in by five o’clock and the hatches down below in the cabin the two captains and the mate sat over a substantial tea  get away about three i s’pose said the mate  the skipper nodded  get away about three he repeated and then for northfleet i’ll have all the hands to the wedding and you shall be best man jim  and henry ’ll be a little page in white satin knickers holding up the bride’s train said the mate spluttering at the picture he had conjured up  they all laughed—all except henry who having come down with some hot water from the galley surveyed the ribald scene with a scarcely concealed sneer  half an hour later the skipper and mate went ashore to transact a little business leaving the old man smoking peacefully in the cabin the crew having adjusted their differences had already gone ashore to treat each other to beer leaving henry in sole charge  you’ll stay by the ship boy said the skipper looking down on him from the quay  ay ay sir said henry sulkily  the two men walked along the quay and into the high street the skipper shrugging his shoulders goodnaturedly as he caught through a halfopen door a glimpse of his crew settling down to business it was an example that in the circumstances seemed to be worth following and at the next publichouse the mate sacrificing his inclinations to the occasion drank port wine instead of his favorite whisky for the same reason he put his pipe back in his pocket and accepted a cigar and then followed his superior into the street  where’s a likely tailor’s asked the skipper looking round  what for asked the mate  i’m going to get some things for cap’n gething said the other he’s hardly the figure to meet his family as he is  why didn’t you bring him with us asked the mate how about a fit  he wouldn’t hear of it said the skipper pausing in deep contemplation of three wax boys in a tailor’s window he’s an independent sort of man but if i buy the clothes and take ’em aboard he can hardly refuse to wear ’em  he led the way into the shop and asked to see some serge suits at the mate’s instigation he asked to see some more at the mate’s further instigation he asked whether that was all they had got and being told that it was looked at them all over again it is ever a difficult thing to fit an absent man but he and the mate tried on every jacket in the hope of finding a golden mean until the mate dropping his lighted cigar in the coatsleeve of one and not finding it as soon as the tailor could have desired the latter lost all patience and insisted upon their taking that one  it’s all right said the mate as they left the shop with the parcel it’s only the lining i’d fixed my mind on that one too from the first  well why didn’t you say so then said the skipper  got it cheaper said the mate with a wink i’d bet you if it could only be known if we’d been suited at first he’d ha’ wanted ten bob more for it  it was quite dark by now and after buying a cap and one or two other small articles the mate led the way into a tavern for another drink  there’s no hurry he said putting his share of bundles on the table with some relief what’s your poison this time cap’n     chapter xii     in less rapid times before the invention of the electric telegraph and other scientific luxuries captain gething would have remained quietly on board the seamew and been delivered to his expectant family without any further trouble as it was the message in which captain wilson took such pride reached mrs gething just as mr glover—who had been sitting in her parlor all the afternoon listening as patiently as he could to her somewhat uninteresting conversation—was on the point of departure the effect on him was hardly less marked than on his hostess and he went on his way to the railway station in a condition in which rage and jealousy strove for the mastery all the way to town he pondered over ways and means to wrest from his rival the prize which he had won and by the time the train had reached fenchurch street he had hatched as pleasant a little plot as ever occurred to a man most of whose existence had been spent amid the blameless surroundings of ladies’ hosiery half an hour later he was sitting in the dingy furnished apartments of a friend of his who lived in a small house off the walworth road  i want you to do me a favor tillotson he said to the unkemptlooking tenant  i shall be delighted said mr tillotson sticking his hands in his pockets and warming himself comfortably at a firestove ornament trimmed with red paper roses—if i can you know  it is a great favor said glover  mr tillotson looking very despondent said of course that would please him more  i wouldn’t ask anybody but you to do it said the wily glover if it comes off all right i will get you that berth you asked me for at leatham and roberts’  it’s coming off then said mr tillotson brightening visibly if you will wait a minute—if the girl is in i will ask her if she will go and get us something to drink  i had better begin at the beginning said mr glover as all the ’ifs’ having been triumphantly surmounted he helped himself from a small flat bottle of whiskey it won’t take long  he lit his pipe and plunging into his story finished it without interruption  you are a deep one glover said his admiring friend when he had finished i thought you had been very smart lately—not but what you were always a dressy man he added thoughtfully  i believe in keeping my own things to myself said glover  and this bargee has got the old un said tillotson using the terms glover had employed in his narrative i don’t see what is to be done glover  i want to get him away said the other if i can’t find him nobody else shall and i want you to help me  go down to stourwich tie him up in a sack and drown him i suppose said tillotson trying to live up to a reputation several lady friends had bestowed upon him of being sarcastic  can you get away tomorrow demanded glover impatiently  i am as free as the birds of the air responded tillotson gloomily the only difference is nobody puts out crumbs for me  i can reckon on you then said glover i thought i could we have known each other a long time tillotson there is nothing like an old friend when one is in trouble  mr tillotson assented modestly you won’t forget about leatham and roberts he said  of course not said glover you see it won’t do to be seen in this thing myself what i want you to do is to come down with me to stourwich and bring the old man to london then i can find him at my own time in the street or anywhere quite haphazard like  i don’t quite see how it is to be done said tillotson  meet me tomorrow morning at waterloo at ten minutes past eight said glover finishing his glass and rising and we will have a try at any rate  he shook hands with his friend and following him down the uncarpeted stairs said a few words at the door in favor of early rising and departed to his place of business to make his own arrangements about the morrow  he was at the station and in the train first in the morning mr tillotson turning up with that extreme punctuality which enables a man to catch his train before it has got up full speed  i was half afraid at one time that i shouldn’t have done it said mr tillotson in selfcongratulation as he fell on to the seat smoker too couldn’t have done better if i had been here at seven o’clock  his friend grunted and there being nobody else in the carriage began at once to discuss the practical part of the business  if he could only read we might send a letter aboard to him said mr tillotson pushing his hat back the idea of a man his age not being able to  he’s one of the old school said glover  funny sort of school said tillotson flippantly well we must take our chance of him going for a walk i suppose  they reached stourwich soon after midday and glover keeping a wary look out for wilson proceeded slowly to the quay with his friend leaving the latter to walk down and discover the schooner while he went and hired a firstfloor room at the royal porpoise a little bowwindowed tavern facing the harbor  that’s the one said mr tillotson as he joined his friend upstairs and led him to the window that little craft there see that old chap working with the rest  mr glover who was focussing a pair of cheap fieldglasses on to the schooner gave a little exclamation of surprise  that’s him sure enough he said putting down the glasses now what are we to do  at tillotson’s suggestion they had some dinner and glover fumed the afternoon away while his friend hung about the quay after tea his impatience got the better of his caution and pulling his hat over his eyes he went on the quay too fifty yards beyond the seamew he found a post and leaning against it with his friend anxiously watched the deck of the schooner  there’s three of ’em going ashore said tillotson suddenly look  they watched breathlessly as the crew walked slowly off and dusk coming on approached a little closer  there’s that fellow wilson said glover in a whisper don’t look  well what’s the use of telling me said tillotson reasonably  he’s going ashore with another chap continued glover excitedly— the mate i expect now’s your chance get him away and i’ll stand you something handsome—upon my soul i will  what do you call something handsome inquired tillotson whose pulse was not so feverish as his friend’s  get him safe to london and i’ll stand a fiver said glover now go i’ll stay here  mr tillotson having got matters on a business footing went and carelessly twisting his small moustache slowly approached the schooner on the deck of which was a small boy  is captain gething aboard old man inquired mr tillotson in a friendly voice  down the cabin i b’lieve said henry jerking his thumb  i should like to see him said mr tillotson  i’ve got no objection said henry  charmed with his success mr tillotson stepped aboard and looked carelessly round  he’s an old friend of mine he said confidentially what’s that you’re smoking  shag was the reply  try a cigar said mr tillotson producing three in an envelope you’ll find them rather good  the gratified henry took one and first crackling it against his ear smelt it knowingly while mr tillotson in a leisurely fashion descended to the cabin  a teatray and an untidy litter of cups and saucers stood on the table at the end of which sat an old man with his folded hands resting on the table  goodevening said mr tillotson pausing at the doorway and peering through the gloom to make sure that there was nobody else present all alone  all alone repeated captain gething looking up and wondering who this might be  it’s too dark to see you far said tillotson in a mysterious whisper but it’s captain gething ain’t it  that’s me said the captain uneasily  going to northfleet inquired mr tillotson in another whisper  what do you mean inquired the captain quickly as he gripped the edges of the table  are you sure it’ll be all right continued tillotson  what do you mean repeated the captain from his seat speak plain  i mean that you had better bolt said tillotson in a hurried whisper there’s a heavy reward out for you which captain wilson wants you can’t do what you did for nothing you know  captain gething sat down in his seat again and shaded his face with his hand  i’ll go back he said brokenly wilson told me he was alive and that it was all a mistake if he’s lying to me for the price of my old neck let him have it  what about your wife and daughter said tillotson who was beginning to have a strong disrelish for his task i saw in the paper last night that wilson had got you he’s gone ashore now to make arrangements at the station  he had a letter from my daughter this morning said the old man brokenly  he told you it was from her said tillotson get your things and come quick  excited by the part he was playing he bent forward and clutched at the old man’s arm captain gething obedient to the touch rose and taking his battered cap from a nail followed him in silence above  we’re going for a drink said tillotson to the boy we’ll be back in ten minutes  all right said henry cheerfully wish i was going with you  the other laughed airily and gaining the quay set off with the silent old man by his side at first the captain went listlessly enough but as he got farther and farther from the ship all the feelings of the hunted animal awoke within him and he was as eager to escape as tillotson could have wished  where are we going he inquired as they came in sight of the railway station i’m not going by train  london said tillotson that’s the most likely place to get lost in  i’m not going in the train said the other doggedly  why not said tillotson in surprise  when they come back to the ship and find me gone they’ll telegraph to london said the old man i won’t be caught like a rat in a trap  what are you going to do then inquired the perplexed tillotson  i don’t know said the old man walk i think it’s dark and we might get twenty miles away before daybreak  yes we might said tillotson who had no fancy for a nocturnal pilgrimage of the kind but we’re not going to  let me go alone said the old man  tillotson shook his head  they’d be bound to spot you tramping about the country he said confidently now do let me know what’s best for you and go by train  i won’t said gething obstinately you’ve been very kind more than kind in giving me warning let me go off by myself  tillotson shook his head and glanced carelessly in the direction of glover who was some few yards behind  i wish you’d trust me he said earnestly you’ll be safer in london than anywhere  captain gething pondered there’s a schooner about half a mile up the river which is getting away about one o’clock this morning he said slowly i’ve worked on her once or twice and the skipper might take us if you can pay him well he knows me as stroud  if you’ll wait here a minute or two i’ll go to the railway station and get my bag said tillotson who wanted to confer with his chief  i’ll wait up the road under the arch said captain gething  now don’t run away said tillotson impressively if you won’t go by train perhaps the schooner is the best thing we can do  he set off to the station and after a hurried consultation with glover returned anxiously to the arch gething standing in the shadow with his hands in his pockets was patiently waiting  it’s all right said tillotson cheerfully and now for a sea voyage you know the way to the schooner i suppose  they made their way back cautiously captain gething turning off to the left before they reached the harbor and leading the way through dingy little streets of private houses and chandlers’ shops it was not a part usually frequented by people taking an evening stroll and henry who had begun to get uneasy at their absence and starting in search of them had picked them up at the corner followed wondering  his wonder increased as they left the houses and met the cool air blowing from the river the road was dark and uneven and he followed cautiously just keeping them in sight until at a tumbledown little wharf they halted and after a low consultation boarded a small schooner lying alongside there was nobody on the deck but a light showed in the cabin and after a minute’s hesitation they went below  an hour or two passed and the small watcher ensconced behind a pile of empties shivered with the cold unconscious of the amicable overtures in the cabin which had resulted in the master of the frolic taking a couple of cabin passengers who were quite willing to rough it in the matter of food and accommodation and willing to pay for it he was afraid to desert his post another hour passed a couple of seamen came by his place of concealment and stepping aboard went down the foc’sle a clock struck eleven and a few minutes later the light in the cabin was extinguished  the boy watched another quarter of an hour and then the ship being dark and still crept noiselessly on board the sound of deep snoring came from the cabin and gaining the wharf again he set off as hard as he could run to the seamew     chapter xiii     wilson and the mate returned to the ship laden with their spoils and pitching them on board first descended themselves by a slower but pleasanter method  i expect our chaps are all ashore still said the mate looking round pretty state they’ll be in for a start i suppose the boy’s down with the cap’n  just go down and send him up said the skipper it’s rather a delicate thing to do to give a man a suit of clothes i don’t want anybody standing round  there’s no light said the mate looking towards the skylight he went below and felt his way into the cabin  all in the dark he said cheerfully  there was no reply he fumbled about in the darkness for the matches and having obtained them struck a light and looked round the cabin was empty he opened the door of the stateroom and peered in that too was empty  he must have gone for a walk with the boy said the skipper uneasily when he returned with the news  he took up the parcel again and went below followed by the mate and for some time sat silently smoking  nine o’clock said the mate at last in consternation as the little clock tinkled the hour that confounded boy’s not up to any mischief i s’pose he’s been in a devil of a temper the last day or two  i don’t see what mischief he could do pondered the other knitting his brows  look’s to me as if he’s spirited him away continued the mate i’ll go ashore and have a look round and see whether i can see anything of them  he took his cap from the locker and went an hour elapsed and the skipper a prey to great anxiety went up on deck  the shops had closed and with the exception of the street lamps the town was in darkness and the streets silent except for a chance wayfarer two or three seamen came up the quay and went aboard the steamer in the next berth a woman came slowly along peering in an uncertain fashion at the various craft and shrinking back as a seaman passed her abreast of the seamew she stopped and in the same doubtful manner looked down on the deck the skipper crossed to the side and straining his eyes through the gloom looked up at her  is this the seamew inquired a fresh girlish voice  annis shouted the astounded skipper annis  he ran up the rigging and stepping on to the quay seized her hand then he drew her unresistingly towards him and was in the act of passing his arm round her waist when he remembered his position and drew back awkwardly  come on board he said gently  he straddled from the quay to the rigging and extending his hand in the midst of a perfect silence helped her to the deck  where is my father she said eagerly  wilson made no reply  where is he she repeated  wilson shook his head i don’t know he said gloomily i don’t know he was here an hour or two ago he was here yesterday  she caught his arm breathlessly  where is he now what have you done with him  wilson told her all he knew and having finished watched her anxiously as she drew back a little and tapped on the deck with her foot  a badlyblended chorus making up in strength what it lacked in harmony sounded on the quay and gradually coming nearer stopped at the seamew for a final shout the finale was rendered by the cook and dick with much vehemence while sam excited by his potations danced madly before them  silence up there shouted the skipper sternly as annis shrank away  a’ right sir hiccupped dick solemnly i’m lookin’ after them mind how you break your neck sam  thus adjured sam balanced himself on the edge of the quay and executing a double shuffle on the very brink of it by way of showing his complete mastery over his feet fell into the rigging and descended he was followed by dick and the cook both drunk and both preternaturally solemn  get below said the skipper sharply  ay ay sir said dick with a lurch come on sam we—ain’t wanted—here  it’s all your damned dancing sam said the cook—who had ever an eye for beauty—plaintively  will you get below roared the maddened skipper giving him a push  i’m very sorry he said turning to annis as they disappeared everything seems to be going wrong tonight  it doesn’t matter she said coldly goodnight  where are you going asked wilson  going to find a hotel said annis there’s no train back tonight  take the cabin he said entreatingly i and the mate’ll sleep for’ard  no thank you said annis  she stepped to the side and assisted by the skipper clambered up on to the quay again the mate came up at the moment and stood eyeing her curiously  this is miss gething said the skipper slowly any news  none said the mate solemnly they’ve vanished like smoke  is it certain asked annis addressing him that it was my father  the mate looked at the skipper and pushed his cap back we had no reason to think otherwise he said shortly it’s a mystery to me altogether he can’t have gone home by train because he had no money  it couldn’t have been my father said annis slowly somebody has been deceiving you goodnight i will come round in the morning it is getting late  where are you going inquired the mate  she’s going to look for a hotel said the skipper answering for her  it’s late said the mate dubiously and this isn’t much of a place for hotels why not take her to the woman where her father has been staying you said she seemed a decent sort  it’s a poor place began the other  that’ll do said annis decidedly if it was good enough for my father it is good enough for me if it wasn’t my father i may learn something about him is it far  two miles said the mate  we’d better start at once then said the skipper moving a step or two by way of example  and perhaps you’ll walk down too said annis to the mate  it went to the mate’s heart to do it but he was a staunch friend no i think i’ll turn in he said blushing at his rudeness i’m tired  he lifted his cap awkwardly and descended annis with her head at an uncomfortable altitude set off with the skipper  i’m sorry the mate wouldn’t come said the latter stiffly  after this they went on in silence along the quiet road miss gething realizing instinctively that the man by her side had got a temper equal to at least a dozen of her own this made her walk a little closer to him and once ever so lightly her hand brushed against his the skipper put his hands in his jacket pockets  they reached the late habitation of the mysterious captain gething without another word having been spoken on the journey the mews was uninviting enough by daylight by night it was worse the body of a defunct fourwheeler blocked up half the entrance and a retriever came out of his kennel at the other end and barked savagely  that’s the house said wilson indicating it—number five what’s the matter  for miss gething after making little dabs with her handkerchief at lips which did not require the attention was furtively applying it to eyes which did  i’m tired she said softly—tired and disappointed  she hesitated a moment and then before wilson had quite made up his mind what to do moved proudly away and knocked at the door of number five it was opened after some delay by an untidy woman in crackers and a few other things who having listened to the skipper’s explanation admitted miss gething to her father’s room she then saw the skipper to the door again and having wished him a somewhat grim goodnight closed the door  he walked back as sharply as he could to the schooner his mind in a whirl with the events of the evening and as he neared the quay broke into a run in awkward imitation of a small figure approaching from the opposite direction  you little vagabond he panted seizing him by the collar as they reached the schooner together  a’right said henry ’ave it your own way then  drop him overboard said the mate who was standing on the deck  henry indulged in a glance of contempt—made safe by the darkness—at this partisan and with the air of one who knows that he has an interesting yarn to spin began at the beginning and worked slowly up for his effects the expediency of brevity and point was then tersely pointed out to him by both listeners the highly feminine trait of desiring the last page first being strongly manifested  i can’t make head or tail of it said the skipper after the artist had spoilt his tale to suit his public he’s taken fright at something or other well we’ll go after him  they’re getting away at about one said the mate and suppose he won’t come what are you going to do then after all it mightn’t be her father damned unsatisfactory i call it  i don’t know what to do said the bewildered skipper i don’t know what’s best  well it ain’t my business said henry who had been standing by silently but i know what i should do  both men leaned forward eagerly  i may be a young vagabond said henry enjoying to the full this tribute to his powers—p’raps i am i may be put to bed by a set of grinning idiots i may—  what would you do henry asked the skipper very quietly  go back an’ fetch miss gething o’ course said the boy an’ take her down to the ship that’ll settle it  by jove the boy’s right said the mate—if there’s time  but the skipper had already started  you’re a very good boy henry said the mate approvingly now go down and watch the frolic again and as soon as she starts getting under way run back and let us know if she passes before he comes back i’ll hail her and try and find out what it all means  meantime the skipper half walking half running went on his way to overcourt arriving at stagg’s gardens in a breathless condition number five was fast asleep when he reached it and began a violent thumping upon the door  who’s there what do you want demanded a shrill voice as the window was thrown up and a female head protruded  i want to see that young lady i brought here a little while ago said the skipper—quick  what at this time o’ night said the lady be reasonable young man if you are sweethearting  something important said the skipper impatiently  can’t you tell me what it is said the lady who felt that she was in a position to have her curiosity satisfied  tell her i’ve got news of her father said the skipper restraining himself with difficulty  the head disappeared and the window was closed after what seemed an hour to the impatient man he heard a step in the passage the door opened and annis stood before him  with a very few words they were walking together again down the road annis listening to his story as they went it was a long way and she was already tired but she refused the offer of her companion’s arm with a spirit which showed that she had not forgotten the previous journey as they neared the seamew the skipper’s spirits sank for the mate who was watching ran out to meet them  it’s no use he said sympathetically she’s under way shall we hail her as she goes by  the skipper leaving annis unceremoniously on the quay sprang aboard and peered anxiously down the river the night was starlit and he could just discern a craft coming slowly towards them  hoist a couple of lanterns jack and call the crew up quickly he cried to the mate  what for said the other in astonishment  you light ’em cried the skipper excitedly henry help me off with these hatches  he was down on his knees with the boy unfastening them while the mate having lit a lantern ran forward to rouse the men the frolic was now but twenty yards astern  ahoy schooner ahoy bawled wilson running suddenly to the side  halloa came a hoarse voice  are you full up shouted the master of the seamew  no came the roar again  drop your anchor and come alongside shouted the skipper i’ve got to stay here another week and i’ve got a dozen barrels o’ herring must be in london before then  the frolic was abreast of them and he held his breath with suspense  it won’t take you half an hour he shouted anxiously  the grating of the cable was music in his ears as it ran out and hardly able to believe in the success of his scheme he saw the crew taking in the sail they had just begun to set ten minutes later the frolic was rubbing against his side  the hatches were off the seamew and a lantern swinging in her hold shed a sickly light upon the sleepy faces of her crew the mate was at the foc’sle whispering instructions to annis  look alive said the master of the frolic i’ll just take ’em on deck for the present  he came fussily to the side to superintend gazing curiously at annis who was standing watching the operations  what a nice ship she said may i come on board  you’re quite welcome if you don’t get in the way was the reply  accepting this qualified permission annis stepped on board and walked quietly round the deck at the companion she paused and looked round everybody was busy and trembling with nervousness she hesitated a moment and then descended into the dark cabin  that you captain said a voice what are we stopping for  annis made no reply  who is it said the voice again  hush said annis  oh all right said mr tillotson shortly what’s wrong  annis hesitated waiting to hear another voice but in vain she fancied that she heard another person breathing but that was all  father she cried suddenly it’s me annis where are you  there was a great shout from the other side of the cabin and in the gloom she saw something spring up and come towards her something which caught her in a mighty grasp and crushed her soft face against a long stiff beard laughing and crying together she put her arms about its neck and clung to it convulsively  there there my lass said captain gething at last  we only stopped you by a miracle said annis hysterically the seamew is alongside and why you wanted to run away again i don’t know  i don’t understand said captain gething wearily  you can understand that i wouldn’t take you into danger said annis tenderly put your coat on and come with me  without another word captain gething did as he was bid he stopped as though to speak to tillotson and then thinking better of it followed his daughter on deck  i’m not coming with you cap’n he said as that ardent mariner passed them rolling a barrel along the deck  a’ right said the other briefly you won’t get your money back  in a shamefaced fashion captain gething still holding his daughter’s arm stepped on board the seamew and shook hands with its master by the time he was half through his story there was a burning desire on the part of the skipper to go down and have a look at tillotson—a desire peremptorily checked by annis who had an erroneous opinion concerning that gentleman’s identity and the frolic having taken in its herrings sheered off with a friendly goodnight the crew of the seamew watched her until she had her anchor up and then at the impatient suggestion of henry who was stage managing went below  are you satisfied now inquired wilson in a low voice as captain gething with a wisdom born of years went slowly below  quite breathed annis softly  i’m not said wilson in tones full of meaning  miss gething smiled and leaning against the side surveyed with some interest the dark water and the sleeping town she did not move when wilson came and stood by her and when he took her hand made no protest  i’m not satisfied—yet said wilson raising her hand to his lips  his eye caught the two lanterns which were burning somewhat garishly and crossing over he took them down and blew them out he turned suddenly at the sound of a smothered laugh a moment too late annis gething had gone below     the brown man’s servant     chap i     the shop of solomon hyams stood in a small thoroughfare branching off the commercial road in its windows unredeemed pledges of all kinds from oldtime watches to seamen’s boots appealed to all tastes and requirements bundles of cigars candidly described as wonderful were marked at absurdly low figures while silver watches endeavored to excuse the clumsiness of their make by describing themselves as strong workmen’s the side entrance up a narrow alley was surmounted by the usual three brass balls and here mr hyams’ clients were wont to call they entered as optimists smiled confidently upon mr hyams argued protested shrilly and left the establishment pessimists of a most pronounced and virulent type  none of these things however disturbed the pawnbroker the drunken client who endeavored to bail out his sunday clothes with a tram ticket was accommodated with a chair while the assistant went to hunt up his friends and contract for a speedy removal the old woman who with a view of obtaining a higher advance than usual poured a tale of grievous woe into the hardened ears of mr hyams found herself left to the same invaluable assistant and realizing her failure would at once become cheerful and take what was offered mr hyams’ methods of business were quiet and unostentatious and rumor had it that he might retire at any time and live in luxury  it was a cold cheerless afternoon in november as mr hyams who had occasional hazy ideas of hygiene stood at his door taking the air it was an atmosphere laden with soot and redolent of many blended odors but after the fusty smell of the shop it was almost healthgiving in the large publichouse opposite with its dirty windows and faded signboards the gas was already being lit which should change it from its daylight dreariness to a resort of light and life  mr hyams who was never in a hurry to light up his own premises many of his clients preferring the romantic light which comes between day and night for their visits was about to leave the chilly air for the warmth inside when his attention was attracted by a seaman of sturdy aspect stopping and looking in at his window mr hyams rubbed his hands softly there was an air of comfort and prosperity about this seaman and the pawnbroker had many small articles in his window utterly useless to the man which he would have liked to have sold him  the man came from the window made as though to pass and then paused irresolute before the pawnbroker  you want a watch said the latter genially come inside  mr hyams went behind his counter and waited  i don’t want to buy nothing and i don’t want to pawn nothing said the sailor what do you think o’ that  mr hyams who objected to riddles especially those which seemed to be against business eyed him unfavorably from beneath his shaggy eyebrows  we might have a little quiet talk together said the seaman you an’ me we might do a little bit o’ business together you an’ me in the parler shall we say over a glass o’ something hot  mr hyams hesitated he was not averse to a little business of an illicit nature but there rose up vividly before him the picture of another sailor who had made much the same sort of proposal and after four glasses of rum had merely suggested to him that he should lend him twenty pounds on the security of an iou it was long since but the memory of it still rankled  what sort of business is it he inquired  business that’s too big for you p’raps said the sailor with a lordly air i’ll try a bigger place what’s that lanternfaced swab shoving his ugly mug into the daylight for  get off said the pawnbroker to the assistant who was quietly and unobtrusively making a third  mind the shop this gentleman and i have business in the parlor come this way sir  he raised the flap of the counter and led the way to a small untidy room at the back of the shop a copper kettle was boiling on the fire and the table was already laid for tea the pawnbroker motioning his visitor to a dingy leather armchair went to a cupboard and produced a bottle of rum three parts full and a couple of glasses  tea for me said the seaman eyeing the bottle wistfully  the pawnbroker pricked up his ears nonsense he said with an attempt at heartiness a jolly fellow like you don’t want tea have some o’ this  tea confound yer said the other when i say tea i mean tea  the pawnbroker repressing his choler replaced the bottle and seating himself at the table reached over for the kettle and made the tea it was really a pleasing picture of domestic life and would have looked well in a lantern slide at a temperance lecture the long gaunt jew and the burly seaman hobnobbing over the blameless teapot but mr hyams grew restless he was intent upon business but the other so far as his inroads on the teapot and the eatables gave any indication seemed to be bent only upon pleasure once again the picture of the former sailor rose before mr hyams’ eyes and he scowled fiercely as the seaman pushed his cup up for the fourth time  and now for a smoke said his visitor as he settled back in his chair a good ’un mind lord this is comfort it’s the first bit o’ comfort i’ve ’ad since i come ashore five days ago  the pawnbroker grunted and producing a couple of black greasylooking cigars gave one to his guest they both fell to smoking the former ill at ease the latter with his feet spread out on the small fender making the very utmost of his bit of comfort  are you a man as is fond of asking questions he said at length  no said the pawnbroker shutting his lips illustratively  suppose said the sailor leaning forward intently—suppose a man came to you an’ ses— there’s that confounded assistant of yours peeping through the door  the pawnbroker got up almost as exasperated as the seaman and after rating his assistant through the halfopen door closed it with a bang and pulled down a small blind over the glass  suppose a man came to you resumed the sailor after the pawnbroker had seated himself again and asked you for five hundred pounds for something have you got it  not here said the pawnbroker suspiciously i don’t keep any money on the premises  you could get it though suggested the other  we’ll see said the pawnbroker five hundred pounds is a fortune—five hundred pounds why it takes years of work—five hundred pounds—  i don’t want no blessed psalms said the seaman abruptly but look here suppose i wanted five hundred pounds for something and you wouldn’t give it how am i to know you wouldn’t give information to the police if i didn’t take what you offered me for it  the pawnbroker threw up his huge palms in virtuous horror  i’d mark you for it if you did said the seaman menacingly through his teeth it ’ud be the worst day’s work you ever did will you take it or leave it at my price an’ if you won’t give it leave me to go as i came  i will said the pawnbroker solemnly  the seaman laid his cigar in the tray where it expired in a little puddle of tea and undoing his coat cautiously took from his waist a canvas belt in a hesitating fashion he dangled the belt in his hands looking from the jew to the door and from the door back to the jew again then from a pocket in the belt he took something wrapped in a small piece of dirty flannel and unrolling it deposited on the table a huge diamond whose smouldering fires flashed back in many colors the light from the gas  the jew with an exclamation reached forward to handle it but the sailor thrust him back  hands off he said grimly none of your ringing the changes on me  he tipped it over with his fingernail on the table from side to side the other with his head bent down closely inspecting it then as a great indulgence he laid it on the jew’s open palm for a few seconds  five hundred pounds he said taking it in his own hands again  the pawnbroker laughed it was a laugh which he kept for business purposes and would have formed a valuable addition to the goodwill of the shop  i’ll give you fifty he said after he had regained his composure  the seaman replaced the gem in its wrapper again  well i’ll give you seventy and risk whether i lose over it continued the pawnbroker  five hundred’s my price said the seaman calmly as he placed the belt about his waist and began to buckle it up  seventyfive said the pawnbroker persuasively  look here said the seaman regarding him sternly you drop it i’m not going to haggle with you i’m not going to haggle with any man i ain’t no judge o’ diamonds but i’ve ’ad cause to know as this is something special see here  he rolled back the coat sleeve from his brawny arm and revealed a long newly healed scar  i risked my life for that stone he said slowly i value my life at five hundred pounds it’s likely worth more than as many thousands and you know it however goodnight to you mate how much for the tea  he put his hand contemptuously in his trouser pocket and pulled out some small change  there’s the risk of getting rid of the stone said the pawnbroker pushing aside the proffered coin where did it come from has it got a history  not in europe it ain’t said the seaman so far as i know you an’ me an’ one other are the only white men as know of it that’s all i’m going to tell you  do you mind waiting while i go and fetch a friend of mine to see it inquired the pawnbroker you needn’t be afraid he added hastily he’s a respectable man and as close as the grave  i’m not afraid said the seaman quietly but no larks mind i’m not a nice man to play them on i’m pretty strong an’ i’ve got something else besides  he settled himself in the armchair again and accepting another cigar watched his host as he took his hat from the sideboard  i’ll be back as soon as i can said the latter somewhat anxiously you won’t go before i come  not me said the seaman bluntly when i say a thing i stick to it i don’t haggle and haggle and— he paused a moment for a word and haggle he concluded  left to himself he smoked on contentedly blandly undisturbed by the fact that the assistant looked in at the door occasionally to see that things were all right it was quite a new departure for mr hyams to leave his parlor to a stranger and the assistant felt a sense of responsibility so great that it was a positive relief to him when his master returned accompanied by another man  this is my friend said mr hyams as they entered the parlor and closed the door you might let him see the stone  the seaman took off his belt again and placing the diamond in his hand held it before the stranger who making no attempt to take it turned it over with his finger and examined it critically  are you going to sea again just yet he inquired softly  thursday night said the seaman five hundred is my price p’raps he told you i’m not going to haggle  just so just so said the other quietly it’s worth five hundred  spoke like a man said the seaman warmly  i like to deal with a man who knows his own mind said the stranger it saves trouble but if we buy it for that amount you must do one thing for us keep quiet and don’t touch a drop of liquor until you sail and not a word to anybody  you needn’t be afraid o’ the licker said the sailor grimly i shan’t touch that for my own sake  he’s a teetotaler explained the pawnbroker  he’s not said the seaman indignantly  why won’t you drink then asked the other man  fancy said the seaman dryly and closed his mouth  without another word the stranger turned to the pawnbroker who taking a pocketbook from his coat counted out the amount in notes these after the sailor had examined them in every possible manner he rolled up and put in his pocket then without a word he took out the diamond again and laid it silently on the table mr hyams his fingers trembling with eagerness took it up and examined it delightedly  you’ve got it a bargain said the seaman goodnight gentlemen i hope for your sakes nobody’ll know i’ve parted with it keep your eyes open and trust nobody when you see black smell mischief i’m glad to get rid of it  he threw his head back and expanding his chest as though he already breathed more freely nodded to both men and walking through the shop passed out into the street and disappeared  long after he had gone the pawnbroker and his friend levi sat with the door locked and the diamond before them eagerly inspecting it  it’s a great risk said the pawnbroker a stone like that generally makes some noise  anything good is risky said the other somewhat contemptuously you don’t expect to get a windfall like that without any drawback do you  he took the stone in his hand again and eyed it lovingly it’s from the east somewhere he said quietly it’s badly cut but it’s a diamond of diamonds a king of gems  i don’t want any trouble with the police said the pawnbroker as he took it from him  you are talking now as though you have just made a small advance on a stolen overcoat said his friend impatiently a risk like that—and you have done it before now—is a foolish one to run the game is not worth the candle but this—why it warms one’s blood to look at it  well i’ll leave it with you said the pawnbroker if you do well with it i ought not to want to work any more  the other placed it in an inside pocket while the owner watched him anxiously  don’t let any accident happen to you tonight levi he said nervously  thanks for your concern said levi grimacing i shall probably be careful for my own sake  he buttoned up his coat and drinking a glass of hot whisky went out whistling he had just reached the door when the pawnbroker called him back  if you like to take a cab levi he said in a low voice so that the assistant should not hear i’ll pay for it  i’ll take an omnibus said levi smiling quietly you’re getting extravagant hyams besides fancy the humor of sitting next to a pickpocket with this on me  he waved a cheery farewell and the pawnbroker watching him from the door scowled angrily as he saw his lighthearted friend hail an omnibus at the corner and board it then he went back to the shop and his everyday business of making advances on flatirons and other realizable assets of the neighborhood  at ten o’clock he closed for the night the assistant hurriedly pulling down the shutters that his time for recreation might not be unduly curtailed he slept off the premises and the pawnbroker after his departure made a slight supper and sat revolving the affairs of the day over another of his black cigars until nearly midnight then well contented with himself he went up the bare dirty stairs to his room and went to bed and despite the excitement of the evening was soon in a loud slumber from which he was aroused by a distant and sustained knocking     chap ii     at first the noise mingled with his dreams and helped to form them he was down a mine and grimy workers with strong picks were knocking diamonds from the walls diamonds so large that he became despondent at the comparative smallness of his own then he awoke suddenly and sat up with a start rubbing his eyes the din was infernal to a man who liked to do a quiet business in an unobtrusive way it was a knocking which he usually associated with the police and it came from his side door with a sense of evil strong upon him the jew sprang from his bed and slipping the catch noiselessly opened the window and thrust his head out in the light of a lamp which projected from the brick wall at the other end of the alley he saw a figure below  hulloa said the jew harshly  his voice was drowned in the noise  what do you want he yelled hulloa there what do you want i say  the knocking ceased and the figure stepping back a little looked up at the window  come down and open the door said a voice which the pawnbroker recognized as the sailor’s  go away he said in a low stern voice do you want to rouse the neighborhood  come down and let me in said the other it’s for your own good you’re a dead man if you don’t  impressed by his manner the jew after bidding him shortly not to make any more noise lit his candle and dressing hurriedly took the light in his hand and went grumbling downstairs into the shop  now what do you want he said through the door  let me in and i’ll tell you said the other or i’ll bawl it through the keyhole if you like  the jew placing the candle on the counter drew back the heavy bolts and cautiously opened the door the seaman stepped in and as the other closed the door vaulted on to the counter and sat there with his legs dangling  that’s right he said nodding approvingly in the direction of the jew’s right hand i hope you know how to use it  what do you want demanded the other irritably putting his hand behind him what time o’ night do you call this for turning respectable men out of their beds  i didn’t come for the pleasure o’ seeing your pretty face again you can bet said the seaman carelessly it’s good nature what’s brought me here what have you done with that diamond  that’s my business said the other what do you want  i told you i sailed in five days said the seaman well i got another ship this evening instead and i sail at 6 am things are getting just a bit too thick for me an’ i thought out o’ pure good nature i’d step round and put you on your guard  why didn’t you do so at first said the jew eyeing him suspiciously  well i didn’t want to spoil a bargain said the seaman carelessly maybe you wouldn’t have bought the stone if i had told you mind that thing don’t go off i don’t want to rob you point it the other way  there was four of us in that deal he continued after the other had complied with his request me an’ jack ball and nosey wheeler and a burmese chap the last i see o’ jack ball he was quiet and peaceful with a knife sticking in his chest if i hadn’t been a very careful man i’d have had one sticking in mine if you ain’t a very careful man and do what i tell you you’ll have one sticking in yours  speak a little more plainly said the jew come into the parlor i don’t want the police to see a light in the shop  we stole it said the seaman as he followed the other into the little back parlor the four of us from—  i don’t want to know anything about that interrupted the other hastily  the sailor grinned approvingly and continued then me an’ jack being stronger than them we took it from them two but they got level with poor jack i shipped before the mast on a barque and they came over by steamer an’ waited for me  well you’re not afraid of them said the jew interrogatively besides a word to the police—  telling ’em all about the diamond said the seaman oh yes well you can do that now if you feel so inclined they know all about that bless you and if they were had they’d blab about the diamond  have they been dogging you inquired the pawnbroker  dogging me said the seaman dogging’s no word for it wherever i’ve been they’ve been my shadders they want to hurt me but they’re careful about being hurt themselves that’s where i have the pull of them they want the stone back first and revenge afterwards so i thought i’d put you on your guard for they pretty well guess who’s got the thing now you’ll know wheeler by his nose which is broken  i’m not afraid of them said the jew but thank you for telling me did they follow you here  they’re outside i’ve no doubt said the other but they come along like human cats—leastways the burmah chap does you want eyes in the back of your head for them almost the burmese is an old man and soft as velvet and jack ball just afore he died was going to tell me something about him i don’t know what it was but pore jack he was a superstitious sort o’ chap and i know it was something horrible he was as brave as a lion was jack but he was afraid o’ that little shrivelledup burmese they’ll follow me to the ship tonight if they’ll only come close enough and there’s nobody nigh i’ll do jack a good turn  stay here till the morning said the jew  the seaman shook his head i don’t want to miss my ship said he but remember what i’ve told you and mind they’re villains both of them and if you are not very careful they’ll have you sooner or later goodnight  he buttoned up his coat and leading the way to the door followed by the jew with the candle opened it noiselessly and peered carefully out right and left the alley was empty  take this said the jew proffering his pistol  i’ve got one said the seaman goodnight  he strode boldly up the alley his footsteps sounding loudly in the silence of the night the jew watched him to the corner and then closing the door secured it with extra care and went back to his bedroom where he lay meditating upon the warning which had just been given to him until he fell asleep  before going downstairs next morning he placed the revolver in his pocket not necessarily for use but as a demonstration of the lengths to which he was prepared to go his manner with two or three inoffensive gentlemen of color was also somewhat strained especially was this the case with a worthy lascar who knowing no english gesticulated cheerfully in front of him with a long dagger which he wanted to pawn  the morning passed without anything happening and it was nearly dinnertime before anything occurred to justify the sailor’s warning then happening to glance at the window he saw between the articles which were hanging there a villainous face the principal feature of which being strangely bent at once recalled the warning of the sailor as he looked the face disappeared and a moment later its owner after furtively looking in at the side door entered quietly  morning boss said he  the pawnbroker nodded and waited  i want to have a little talk with you boss said the man after waiting for him to speak  all right go on said the other  what about ’im said the man indicating the assistant with a nod  well what about him inquired the jew  what i’ve got to say is private said the man  the jew raised his eyebrows  you can go in and get your dinner bob he said now what do you want he continued hurry up because i’m busy  i come from a pal o’ mine said the man speaking in a low voice him what was ’ere last night he couldn’t come himself so he sent me he wants it back  wants what back asked the jew  the diamond said the other  diamond what on earth are you talking about demanded the pawnbroker  you needn’t try to come it on me said the other fiercely we want that diamond back and mind you we’ll have it  you clear out said the jew i don’t allow people to come threatening me out you go  we’ll do more than threaten you said the man the veins in his forehead swelling with rage you’ve got that diamond you got it for five ’undred pound we’ll give you that back for it and you may think yourself lucky to get it  you’ve been drinking said the jew or somebody’s been fooling you  look here said the man with a snarl drop it i’m dealing fair an’ square by you i don’t want to hurt a hair of your head i’m a peaceable man but i want my own and what’s more i can get it i got the shell and i can get the kernel do you know what i mean by that  i don’t know and i don’t care said the jew he moved off a little way and taking some tarnished spoons from a box began to rub them with a piece of leather  i daresay you can take a hint as well as anybody else said the other have you seen that before  he threw something on the counter and the jew started despite himself as he glanced up it was the sailor’s belt  that’s a hint said the man with a leer and a very fair one  the jew looked at him steadily and saw that he was white and nervous his whole aspect that of a man who was running a great risk for a great stake  i suppose he said at length speaking very slowly that you want me to understand that you have murdered the owner of this  understand what you like said the other with sullen ferocity will you let us have that back again  no said the jew explosively i have no fear of a dog like you if it was worth the trouble i’d send for the police and hand you over to them  call them said the other do i’ll wait but mark my words if you don’t give us the stone back you’re a dead man i’ve got a pal what half that diamond belongs to he’s from the east and a bad man to cross he has only got to wish it and you’re a dead man without his raising a finger at you i’ve come here to do you a good turn if he comes here it’s all up with you  well you go back to him jeered the jew a clever man like that can get the diamond without going near it seemingly you’re wasting your time here and it’s a pity you must have got a lot of friends  well i’ve warned you said the other you’ll have one more warning if you won’t be wise you must keep the diamond but it won’t be much good to you it’s a good stone but speaking for myself i’d sooner be alive without it than dead with it  he gave the jew a menacing glance and departed and the assistant having by this time finished his dinner the pawnbroker went to his own with an appetite by no means improved by his late interview     chap iii     the cat with its forepaws tucked beneath it was dozing on the counter business had been slack that morning and it had only been pushed off three times it had staked out a claim on that counter some five years before and if anything was required to convince it of the value of the possession it was the fact that it was being constantly pushed off to a firmminded cat this alone gave the counter a value difficult to overestimate and sometimes an obsequious customer fell into raptures over its beauty this was soothing and the animal allowed customers of this type to scratch it gently behind the ear  the cat was for the time the only occupant of the shop the assistant was out and the pawnbroker sat in the small room beyond with the door half open reading a newspaper he had read the financial columns glanced at the foreign intelligence and was just about to turn to the leader when his eye was caught by the headline murder in whitechapel  he folded the paper back and with a chilly feeling creeping over him perused the account in the usual thrilling style it recorded the finding of the body of a man evidently a sailor behind a hoarding placed in front of some shops in course of erection there was no clue to the victim who had evidently been stabbed from behind in the street and then dragged or carried to the place in which the body had been discovered  the pockets had been emptied and the police who regarded the crime as an ordinary one of murder and robbery entertained the usual hopes of shortly arresting the assassins  the pawnbroker put the paper down and drummed on the table with his fingers the description of the body left no room for doubt that the victim of the tragedy and the man who had sold him the diamond were identical he began to realize the responsibilities of the bargain and the daring of his visitor of the day before in venturing before him almost redhanded gave him an unpleasant idea of the lengths to which he was prepared to go in a pleasanter direction it gave him another idea it was strong confirmation of levi’s valuation of the stone  i shall see my friend again said the jew to himself as he looked up from the paper let him make an attempt on me and we’ll see  he threw the paper down and settling back in his chair fell into a pleasing reverie he saw his release from sordid toil close at hand he would travel and enjoy his life pity the diamond hadn’t come twenty years before as for the sailor well poor fellow why didn’t he stay when he was asked  the cat still dozing became aware of a strong strange odor in a lazy fashion it opened one eye and discovered that an old shrivelled up little man with a brown face was standing by the counter it watched him lazily but warily out of a halfclosed eye and then finding that he appeared to be quite harmless closed it again  the intruder was not an impatient type of customer he stood for some time gazing round him then a thought struck him and he approached the cat and stroked it with a masterly hand never in the course of its life had the animal met such a born stroker every touch was a caress and a gentle thrum thrum rose from its interior in response  something went wrong with the stroker he hurt the cat started up suddenly and jumped behind the counter the dark gentleman smiled an evil smile and after waiting a little longer tapped on the counter  the pawnbroker came from the little room beyond with the newspaper in his hand and his brow darkened as he saw the customer he was of a harsh and dominant nature and he foresaw more distasteful threats  well what do you want he demanded abruptly  morning sir said the brown man in perfect english fine day  the day’s well enough said the jew  i want a little talk with you said the other suavely a little quiet reasonable talk  you’d better make it short said the jew my time is valuable  the brown man smiled and raised his hand with a deprecatory gesture many things are valuable said he but time is the most valuable of all and time to us means life  the jew saw the covert threat and grew more irritable still  get to your business he said sharply  the brown man leant on the counter and regarded him with a pair of fierce brown eyes which age had not dimmed  you are a reasonable man he said slowly a good merchant i can see it but sometimes a good merchant makes a bad bargain in that case what does the good merchant do  get out of here said the jew angrily  he makes the best of it continued the other calmly and he is a lucky man if he is not too late to repair the mischief you are not too late  the jew laughed boisterously  there was a sailor once made a bad bargain said the brown man still in the same even tones and he died—of grief  he grinned at this pleasantry until his face looked like a cracked mask  i read in this paper of a sailor being killed said the jew holding it up have you ever heard of the police of prison and of the hangman  all of them said the other softly  i might be able to put the hangman on the track of the sailor’s murderer continued the jew grimly  the brown man smiled and shook his head you are too good a merchant he said besides it would be very difficult  it would be a pleasure to me said the jew  let us talk business like men not nonsense like children said the brown man suddenly you talk of hangmen i talk of death well listen two nights ago you bought a diamond from a sailor for five hundred pounds unless you give me that diamond back for the same money i will kill you  what snarled the jew drawing his gaunt figure to its full height you you miserable mummy  i will kill you repeated the brown man calmly i will send death to you—death in a horrible shape i will send a devil a little artful teasing devil to worry you and kill you in the darkness he will come and spring out on you you had better give back the diamond and live if you give it back i promise you your life  he paused and the jew noticed that his face had changed and in place of the sardonic goodhumor which had before possessed it was now distorted by a devilish malice his eyes gleamed coldly and he snapped them quickly as he spoke  well what do you say he demanded  this said the jew  he leant over the counter and taking the brown man’s skinny throat in his great hand flung him reeling back to the partition which shook with his weight then he burst into a laugh as the being who had just been threatening him with a terrible and mysterious death changed into a little weak old man coughing and spitting as he clutched at his throat and fought for breath  what about your servant the devil asked the jew maliciously  he serves when i am absent said the brown man faintly even now i give you one more chance i will let you see the young fellow in your shop die first but no he has not offended i will kill—  he paused and his eye fell on the cat which at that moment sprang up and took its old place on the counter i will kill your cat said the brown man i will send the devil to worry it watch the cat and as its death is so shall yours be—unless—  unless said the jew regarding him mockingly  unless tonight before ten o’clock you mark on your doorpost two crosses in chalk said the other do that and live watch your cat  he pointed his lean brown finger at the animal and still feeling at his throat stepped softly to the door and passed out  with the entrance of other customers the pawnbroker forgot the annoyance to which he had been subjected and attended to their wants in a spirit made liberal by the near prospect of fortune it was certain that the stone must be of great value with that and the money he had made by his business he would give up work and settle down to a life of pleasant ease so liberal was he that an elderly irishwoman forgot their slight differences in creeds and blessed him fervently with all the saints in the calendar  his assistant being back in his place in the shop the pawnbroker returned to the little sittingroom and once more carefully looked through the account of the sailor’s murder then he sat still trying to work out a problem to hand the murderers over to the police without his connection with the stolen diamond being made public and after considerable deliberation convinced himself that the feat was impossible he was interrupted by a slight scuffling noise in the shop and the cat came bolting into the room and after running round the table went out at the door and fled upstairs the assistant came into the room  what are you worrying the thing for demanded his master  i’m not worrying it said the assistant in an aggrieved voice it’s been moving about up and down the shop and then it suddenly started like that it’s got a fit i suppose  he went back to the shop and the jew sat in his chair half ashamed of his nervous credulity listening to the animal which was rushing about in the rooms upstairs  go and see what’s the matter with the thing bob he cried  the assistant obeyed returning hastily in a minute or two and closing the door behind him  well what’s the matter demanded his master  the brute’s gone mad said the assistant whose face was white it’s flying about upstairs like a wild thing mind it don’t get in it’s as bad as a mad dog  oh rubbish said the jew cats are often like that  well i’ve never seen one like it before said the other and what’s more i’m not going to see that again  the animal came downstairs scuffling along the passage hit the door with its head and then dashed upstairs again  it must have been poisoned or else it’s mad said the assistant what’s it been eating i wonder  the pawnbroker made no reply the suggestion of poisoning was a welcome one it was preferable to the sinister hintings of the brown man but even if it had been poisoned it was a very singular coincidence unless indeed the burmese had himself poisoned it he tried to think whether it could have been possible for his visitor to have administered poison undetected  it’s quiet now said the assistant and he opened the door a little way  it’s all right said the pawnbroker half ashamed of his fears get back to the shop  the assistant complied and the jew after sitting down a little while to persuade himself that he really had no particular interest in the matter rose and went slowly upstairs the staircase was badly lighted and half way up he stumbled on something soft  he gave a hasty exclamation and stooping down saw that he had trodden on the dead cat     chap iv     at ten o’clock that night the pawnbroker sat with his friend levi discussing a bottle of champagne which the openeyed assistant had procured from the publichouse opposite  you’re a lucky man hyams said his friend as he raised his glass to his lips thirty thousand pounds it’s a fortune a small fortune he added correctively  i shall give this place up said the pawnbroker and go away for a time i’m not safe here  safe queried levi raising his eyebrows  the pawnbroker related his adventures with his visitors  i can’t understand that cat business said levi when he had finished it’s quite farcical he must have poisoned it  he wasn’t near it said the pawnbroker it was at the other end of the counter  oh hang it said levi the more irritably because he could not think of any solution to the mystery you don’t believe in occult powers and all that sort of thing this is the neighborhood of the commercial road time nineteenth century the thing’s got on your nerves keep your eyes open and stay indoors they can’t hurt you here why not tell the police  i don’t want any questions said the pawnbroker  i mean just tell them that one or two suspicious characters have been hanging round lately said the other if this precious couple see that they are watched they’ll probably bolt there’s nothing like a uniform to scare that sort  i won’t have anything to do with the police said the pawnbroker firmly  well let bob sleep on the premises suggested his friend  i think i will tomorrow said the other i’ll have a bed fixed up for him  why not tonight asked levi  he’s gone said the pawnbroker briefly didn’t you hear him shut up  he was in the shop five minutes ago said levi  he left at ten said the pawnbroker  i’ll swear i heard somebody only a minute or two back said levi staring  nerves as you remarked a little while ago said his friend with a grin  well i thought i heard him said levi you might just secure the door anyway  the pawnbroker went to the door and made it fast giving a careless glance round the dimly lighted shop as he did so  perhaps you could stay tonight yourself he said as he returned to the sittingroom  i can’t possibly tonight said the other by the way you might lend me a pistol of some kind with all these cutthroats hanging round visiting you is a somewhat perilous pleasure they might take it into their heads to kill me to see whether i have got the stone  take your pick said the pawnbroker going to the shop and returning with two or three secondhand revolvers and some cartridges  i never fired one in my life said levi dubiously but i believe the chief thing is to make a bang which’ll make the loudest  on his friend’s recommendation he selected a revolver of the service pattern and after one or two suggestions from the pawnbroker expressed himself as qualified to shoot anything between a chimneypot and a pavingstone  make your roomdoor fast tonight and tomorrow let bob have a bed there he said earnestly as he rose to go by the way why not make those chalk marks on the door just for the night you can laugh at them tomorrow sort of suggestion of the passover about it isn’t there  i’m not going to mark my door for all the assassins that ever breathed said the jew fiercely as he rose to see the other out  well i think you’re safe enough in the house said levi beastly dreary the shop looks to a man of imagination like myself it’s quite easy to fancy that there is one of your brown friend’s pet devils crouching under the counter ready to spring  the pawnbroker grunted and opened the door  poof fog said levi as a cloud streamed in bad night for pistol practice i shan’t be able to hit anything  the two men stood in the doorway for a minute trying to peer through the fog a heavy measured tread sounded in the alley a huge figure loomed up and to the relief of levi a constable halted before them  thick night sir said he to the pawnbroker  very was the reply just keep your eye on my place tonight constable there have been one or two suspiciouslooking characters hanging about here lately  i will sir said the constable and moved off in company with levi  the pawnbroker closed the door hastily behind them and bolted it securely his friend’s jest about the devil under the counter occurred to him as he eyed it and for the first time in his life the lonely silence of the shop became oppressive he half thought of opening the door again and calling them back but by this time they were out of earshot and he had a very strong idea that there might be somebody lurking in the fog outside  bah said he aloud thirty thousand pounds  he turned the gasjet on full—a man that had just made that sum could afford to burn a little gas—and first satisfying himself by looking under the counter and round the shop reentered the sitting room  despite his efforts he could not get rid of the sense of loneliness and danger which possessed him the clock had stopped and the only sound audible was the snapping of the extinguished coals in the grate he crossed over to the mantelpiece and taking out his watch wound the clock up then he heard something else  with great care he laid the key softly on the mantelpiece and listened intently the clock was now aggressively audible so that he opened the case again and putting his finger against the pendulum stopped it then he drew his revolver and cocked it and with his set face turned towards the door and his lips parted waited  at first—nothing then all the noises which a lonely man hears in a house at night the stairs creaked something moved in the walls he crossed noiselessly to the door and opened it at the head of the staircase he fancied the darkness moved  who’s there he cried in a strong voice  then he stepped back into the room and lit his lamp i’ll get to bed he said grimly i’ve got the horrors  he left the gas burning and with the lamp in his left hand and the pistol in his right slowly ascended the stairs the first landing was clear he opened the doors of each room and holding the lamp aloft peered in then he mounted higher and looked in the rooms crammed from floor to ceiling with pledges ticketed and placed on shelves in one room he thought he saw something crouching in a corner he entered boldly and as he passed along one side of a row of shelves could have sworn that he heard a stealthy footfall on the other he rushed back to the door and hung listening over the shaky balusters nothing stirred and satisfied that he must have been mistaken he gave up the search and went to his bedroom he set the lamp down on the drawers and turned to close the door when he distinctly heard a noise in the shop below he snatched up the lamp again and ran hastily downstairs pausing halfway on the lowest flight as he saw a dark figure spreadeagled against the side door standing on tiptoe to draw back the bolt  at the noise of his approach it turned its head hastily and revealed the face of the brown man the bolt shot back and at the same moment the jew raised his pistol and fired twice  from beneath the little cloud of smoke as it rose he saw that the door stood open and that the figure had vanished he ran hastily down to the door and with the pistol raised stood listening trying to peer through the fog  an unearthly stillness followed the deafening noise of the shots the fog poured in at the doorway as he stood there hoping that the noise had reached the ears of some chance passerby he stood so for a few minutes and then closing the door again resolutely turned back and went upstairs  his first proceeding upon entering his room was to carefully look beneath and behind the heavy dusty pieces of furniture and satisfied that no foe lurked there he closed the door and locked it then he opened the window gently and listened the court below was perfectly still he closed the window and taking off his coat barricaded the door with all the heaviest furniture in the room with a feeling of perfect security he complacently regarded his handiwork and then sitting on the edge of the bed began to undress he turned the lamp down a little and reloading the empty chambers of his revolver placed it by the side of the lamp on the drawers then as he turned back the clothes he fancied that something moved beneath them as he paused it dropped lightly from the other side of the bed to the floor  at first he sat with knitted brows trying to see what it was he had only had a glimpse of it but he certainly had an idea that it was alive a rat perhaps he got off the bed again with an oath and taking the lamp in his hand peered cautiously about the floor twice he walked round the room in this fashion then he stooped down and raising the dirty bed hangings peered beneath  he almost touched the wicked little head of the brown man’s devil and with a stifled cry sprang hastily backward the lamp shattered against the corner of the drawers and falling in a shower of broken glass and oil about his stockinged feet left him in darkness he threw the fragment of glass stand which remained in his hand from him and quick as thought gained the bed again and crouched there breathing heavily  he tried to think where he had put the matches and remembered there were some on the widowsill the room was so dark that he could not see the foot of the bed and in his fatuity he had barricaded himself in the room with the loathsome reptile which was to work the brown man’s vengeance  for some time he lay listening intently once or twice he fancied that he heard the rustle of the snake over the dingy carpet and he wondered whether it would attempt to climb on to the bed he stood up and tried to get his revolver from the drawers it was out of reach and as the bed creaked beneath his weight a faint hiss sounded from the floor and he sat still again hardly daring to breathe  the cold rawness of the room chilled him he cautiously drew the bedclothes towards him and rolled himself up in them leaving only his head and arms exposed in this position he began to feel more secure until the thought struck him that the snake might be inside them he fought against this idea and tried to force his nerves into steadiness then his fears suggested that two might have been placed in the bed at this his fears got the upper hand and it seemed to him that something stirred in the clothes he drew his body from them slowly and stealthily and taking them in his arms flung them violently to the other end of the room on his hands and knees he now travelled over the bare bed feeling there was nothing there  in this state of suspense and dread time seemed to stop several times he thought that the thing had got on the bed and to stay there in suspense in the darkness was impossible he felt it over again and again at last unable to endure it any longer he resolved to obtain the matches and stepped cautiously off the bed but no sooner had his feet touched the floor than his courage forsook him and he sprang hurriedly back to his refuge again  after that in a spirit of dogged fatalism he sat still and waited to his disordered mind it seemed that footsteps were moving about the house but they had no terrors for him to grapple with a man for life and death would be play to kill him joy unspeakable he sat still listening he heard rats in the walls and a babel of jeering voices on the staircase the whole blackness of the room with the devilish writhing thing on the floor became invested with supernatural significance then dimly at first and hardly comprehending the joy of it he saw the window a little later he saw the outlines of the things in the room the night had passed and he was alive  he raised his halffrozen body to its full height and expanding his chest planted his feet firmly on the bed stretching his long body to the utmost he clenched his fist and felt strong the bed was unoccupied except by himself he bent down and scrutinized the floor for his enemy and set his teeth as he thought how he would tear it and mangle it it was light enough but first he would put on his boots he leant over cautiously and lifting one on to the bed put it on then he bent down and took up the other and swift as lightning something issued from it and coiling round his wrist ran up the sleeve of his shirt  with starting eyeballs the jew held his breath and stiffened into stone waited helplessly the tightness round his arm relaxed as the snake drew the whole of its body under the sleeve and wound round his arm he felt its head moving it came wriggling across his chest and with a mad cry the wretched man clutched at the front of his shirt with both hands and strove to tear it off he felt the snake in his hands and for a moment hoped then the creature got its head free and struck him smartly in the throat  the jew’s hold relaxed and the snake fell at his feet he bent down and seized it careless now that it bit his hand and with bloodshot eyes dashed it repeatedly on the rail of the bed then he flung it to the floor and raising his heel smashed its head to pulp  his fury passed he strove to think but his brain was in a whirl he had heard of sucking the wound but one puncture was in his throat and he laughed discordantly he had heard that death had been prevented by drinking heavily of spirits he would do that first and then obtain medical assistance  he ran to the door and began to drag the furniture away in his haste the revolver fell from the drawers to the floor he looked at it steadily for a moment and then taking it up handled it wistfully he began to think more clearly although a numbing sensation was already stealing over him  thirty thousands pounds he said slowly and tapped his cheek lightly with the cold barrel  then he slipped it in his mouth and pulling the trigger crashed heavily to the floor  the end                                    ————
