the range  when madeline hammond stepped from the train at el cajon new mexico it was nearly midnight and her first impression was of a huge dark space of cool windy emptiness strange and silent stretching away under great blinking white stars  miss theres no one to meet you said the conductor rather anxiously  i wired my brother she replied the train being so lateperhaps he grew tired of waiting he will be here presently but if he should not comesurely i can find a hotel  theres lodgings to be had get the station agent to show you if youll excuse methis is no place for a lady like you to be alone at night its a rough little townmostly mexicans miners cowboys and they carouse a lot besides the revolution across the border has stirred up some excitement along the line miss i guess its safe enough if you  thank you i am not in the least afraid  as the train started to glide away miss hammond walked towards the dimly lighted station as she was about to enter she encountered a mexican with sombrero hiding his features and a blanket mantling his shoulders  is there any one here to meet miss hammond she asked  no sabe senora he replied from under the muffling blanket and he shuffled away into the shadow  she entered the empty waitingroom an oillamp gave out a thick yellow light the ticket window was open and through it she saw there was neither agent nor operator in the little compartment a telegraph instrument clicked faintly  madeline hammond stood tapping a shapely foot on the floor and with some amusement contrasted her reception in el cajon with what it was when she left a train at the grand central the only time she could remember ever having been alone like this was once when she had missed her maid and her train at a place outside of versaillesan adventure that had been a novel and delightful break in the prescribed routine of her muchchaperoned life she crossed the waitingroom to a window and holding aside her veil looked out at first she could descry only a few dim lights and these blurred in her sight as her eyes grew accustomed to the darkness she saw a superbly built horse standing near the window beyond was a bare square or if it was a street it was the widest one madeline had ever seen the dim lights shone from low flat buildings she made out the dark shapes of many horses all standing motionless with drooping heads through a hole in the windowglass came a cool breeze and on it breathed a sound that struck coarsely upon her eara discordant mingling of laughter and shout and the tramp of boots to the hard music of a phonograph  western revelry mused miss hammond as she left the window now what to do ill wait here perhaps the station agent will return soon or alfred will come for me  as she sat down to wait she reviewed the causes which accounted for the remarkable situation in which she found herself that madeline hammond should be alone at a late hour in a dingy little western railroad station was indeed extraordinary  the close of her debutante year had been marred by the only unhappy experience of her lifethe disgrace of her brother and his leaving home she dated the beginning of a certain thoughtful habit of mind from that time and a dissatisfaction with the brilliant life society offered her the change had been so gradual that it was permanent before she realized it for a while an active outdoor lifegolf tennis yachtingkept this realization from becoming morbid introspection there came a time when even these lost charm for her and then she believed she was indeed ill in mind travel did not help her  there had been months of unrest of curiously painful wonderment that her position her wealth her popularity no longer sufficed she believed she had lived through the dreams and fancies of a girl to become a woman of the world and she had gone on as before a part of the glittering show but no longer blind to the truththat there was nothing in her luxurious life to make it significant  sometimes from the depths of her there flashed up at odd moments intimations of a future revolt she remembered one evening at the opera when the curtain had risen upon a particularly welldone piece of stage scenerya broad space of deep desolateness reaching away under an infinitude of night sky illumined by stars the suggestion it brought of vast wastes of lonely rugged earth of a great bluearched vault of starry sky pervaded her soul with a strange sweet peace  when the scene was changed she lost this vague new sense of peace and she turned away from the stage in irritation she looked at the long curved tier of glittering boxes that represented her world it was a distinguished and splendid worldthe wealth fashion culture beauty and blood of a nation she madeline hammond was a part of it she smiled she listened she talked to the men who from time to time strolled into the hammond box and she felt that there was not a moment when she was natural true to herself she wondered why these people could not somehow some way be different but she could not tell what she wanted them to be if they had been different they would not have fitted the place indeed they would not have been there at all yet she thought wistfully that they lacked something for her  and suddenly realizing she would marry one of these men if she did not revolt she had been assailed by a great weariness an icysickening sense that life had palled upon her she was tired of fashionable society she was tired of polished imperturbable men who sought only to please her she was tired of being feted admired loved followed and importuned tired of people tired of houses noise ostentation luxury she was so tired of herself  in the lonely distances and the passionless stars of boldly painted stage scenery she had caught a glimpse of something that stirred her soul the feeling did not last she could not call it back she imagined that the very boldness of the scene had appealed to her she divined that the man who painted it had found inspiration joy strength serenity in rugged nature and at last she knew what she neededto be alone to brood for long hours to gaze out on lonely silent darkening stretches to watch the stars to face her soul to find her real self  then it was she had first thought of visiting the brother who had gone west to cast his fortune with the cattlemen as it happened she had friends who were on the eve of starting for california and she made a quick decision to travel with them when she calmly announced her intention of going out west her mother had exclaimed in consternation and her father surprised into pathetic memory of the black sheep of the family had stared at her with glistening eyes why madeline you want to see that wild boy then he had reverted to the anger he still felt for his wayward son and he had forbidden madeline to go her mother forgot her haughty poise and dignity madeline however had exhibited a will she had never before been known to possess she stood her ground even to reminding them that she was twentyfour and her own mistress in the end she had prevailed and that without betraying the real state of her mind  her decision to visit her brother had been too hurriedly made and acted upon for her to write him about it and so she had telegraphed him from new york and also a day later from chicago where her traveling friends had been delayed by illness nothing could have turned her back then madeline had planned to arrive in el cajon on october 3d her brothers birthday and she had succeeded though her arrival occurred at the twentyfourth hour her train had been several hours late whether or not the message had reached alfreds hands she had no means of telling and the thing which concerned her now was the fact that she had arrived and he was not there to meet her  it did not take long for thought of the past to give way wholly to the reality of the present  i hope nothing has happened to alfred she said to herself he was well doing splendidly the last time he wrote to be sure that was a good while ago but then he never wrote often hes all right pretty soon hell come and how glad ill be i wonder if he has changed  as madeline sat waiting in the yellow gloom she heard the faint intermittent click of the telegraph instrument the low hum of wires the occasional stamp of an ironshod hoof and a distant vacant laugh rising above the sounds of the dance these commonplace things were new to her she became conscious of a slight quickening of her pulse madeline had only a limited knowledge of the west like all of her class she had traveled europe and had neglected america a few letters from her brother had confused her already vague ideas of plains and mountains as well as of cowboys and cattle she had been astounded at the interminable distance she had traveled and if there had been anything attractive to look at in all that journey she had passed it in the night and here she sat in a dingy little station with telegraph wires moaning a lonely song in the wind  a faint sound like the rattling of thin chains diverted madelines attention at first she imagined it was made by the telegraph wires then she heard a step the door swung wide a tall man entered and with him came the clinking rattle she realized then that the sound came from his spurs the man was a cowboy and his entrance recalled vividly to her that of dustin farnum in the first act of the virginian  will you please direct me to a hotel asked madeline rising  the cowboy removed his sombrero and the sweep he made with it and the accompanying bow despite their exaggeration had a kind of rude grace he took two long strides toward her  lady are you married  in the past miss hammonds sense of humor had often helped her to overlook critical exactions natural to her breeding she kept silence and she imagined it was just as well that her veil hid her face at the moment she had been prepared to find cowboys rather striking and she had been warned not to laugh at them  this gentleman of the range deliberately reached down and took up her left hand before she recovered from her start of amaze he had stripped off her glove  fine spark but no weddingring he drawled lady im glad to see youre not married  he released her hand and returned the glove  you see the only hotel in this here town is against boarding married women  indeed said madeline trying to adjust her wits to the situation  it sure is he went on bad business for hotels to have married women keeps the boys away you see this isnt reno  then he laughed rather boyishly and from that and the way he slouched on his sombrero madeline realized he was half drunk as she instinctively recoiled she not only gave him a keener glance but stepped into a position where a better light shone on his face it was like red bronze bold raw sharp he laughed again as if goodnaturedly amused with himself and the laugh scarcely changed the hard set of his features like that of all women whose beauty and charm had brought them much before the world miss hammonds intuition had been developed until she had a delicate and exquisitely sensitive perception of the nature of men and of her effect upon them this crude cowboy under the influence of drink had affronted her nevertheless whatever was in his mind he meant no insult  i shall be greatly obliged if you will show me to the hotel she said  lady you wait here he replied slowly as if his thought did not come swiftly ill go fetch the porter  she thanked him and as he went out closing the door she sat down in considerable relief it occurred to her that she should have mentioned her brothers name then she fell to wondering what living with such uncouth cowboys had done to alfred he had been wild enough in college and she doubted that any cowboy could have taught him much she alone of her family had ever believed in any latent good in alfred hammond and her faith had scarcely survived the two years of silence  waiting there she again found herself listening to the moan of the wind through the wires the horse outside began to pound with heavy hoofs and once he whinnied then madeline heard a rapid pattering low at first and growing louder which presently she recognized as the galloping of horses she went to the window thinking hoping her brother had arrived but as the clatter increased to a roar shadows sped bylean horses flying manes and tails sombreroed riders all strange and wild in her sight recalling what the conductor had said she was at some pains to quell her uneasiness dustclouds shrouded the dim lights in the windows then out of the gloom two figures appeared one tall the other slight the cowboy was returning with a porter  heavy footsteps sounded without and lighter ones dragging along and then suddenly the door rasped open jarring the whole room the cowboy entered pulling a disheveled figurethat of a priest a padre whose mantle had manifestly been disarranged by the rude grasp of his captor plain it was that the padre was extremely terrified  madeline hammond gazed in bewilderment at the little man so pale and shaken and a protest trembled upon her lips but it was never uttered for this halfdrunken cowboy now appeared to be a cool grimsmiling devil and stretching out a long arm he grasped her and swung her back to the bench  you stay there he ordered  his voice though neither brutal nor harsh nor cruel had the unaccountable effect of making her feel powerless to move no man had ever before addressed her in such a tone it was the woman in her that obeyednot the personality of proud madeline hammond  the padre lifted his clasped hands as if supplicating for his life and began to speak hurriedly in spanish madeline did not understand the language the cowboy pulled out a huge gun and brandished it in the priests face then he lowered it apparently to point it at the priests feet there was a red flash and then a thundering report that stunned madeline the room filled with smoke and the smell of powder madeline did not faint or even shut her eyes but she felt as if she were fast in a cold vise when she could see distinctly through the smoke she experienced a sensation of immeasurable relief that the cowboy had not shot the padre but he was still waving the gun and now appeared to be dragging his victim toward her what possibly could be the drunken fools intention this must be this surely was a cowboy trick she had a vague swiftly flashing recollection of alfreds first letters descriptive of the extravagant fun of cowboys then she vividly remembered a moving picture she had seencowboys playing a monstrous joke on a lone schoolteacher madeline no sooner thought of it than she made certain her brother was introducing her to a little wild west amusement she could scarcely believe it yet it must be true alfreds old love of teasing her might have extended even to this outrage probably he stood just outside the door or window laughing at her embarrassment  anger checked her panic she straightened up with what composure this surprise had left her and started for the door but the cowboy barred her passagegrasped her arms then madeline divined that her brother could not have any knowledge of this indignity it was no trick it was something that was happening that was real that threatened she knew not what she tried to wrench free feeling hot all over at being handled by this drunken brute poise dignity cultureall the acquired habits of characterfled before the instinct to fight she was athletic she fought she struggled desperately but he forced her back with hands of iron she had never known a man could be so strong and then it was the mans coolly smiling face the paralyzing strangeness of his manner more than his strength that weakened madeline until she sank trembling against the bench  whatdo youmean she panted  dearie ease up a little on the bridle he replied gaily  madeline thought she must be dreaming she could not think clearly it had all been too swift too terrible for her to grasp yet she not only saw this man but also felt his powerful presence and the shaking priest the haze of blue smoke the smell of powderthese were not unreal  then close before her eyes burst another blinding red flash and close at her ears bellowed another report unable to stand madeline slipped down onto the bench her drifting faculties refused clearly to record what transpired during the next few moments presently however as her mind steadied somewhat she heard though as in a dream the voice of the padre hurrying over strange words it ceased and then the cowboys voice stirred her  lady say sisi say itquick say itsi  from sheer suggestion a force irresistible at this moment when her will was clamped by panic she spoke the word  and now ladyso we can finish this properlywhats your name  still obeying mechanically she told him  he stared for a while as if the name had awakened associations in a mind somewhat befogged he leaned back unsteadily madeline heard the expulsion of his breath a kind of hard puff not unusual in drunken men  what name he demanded  madeline hammond i am alfred hammonds sister  he put his hand up and brushed at an imaginary something before his eyes then he loomed over her and that hand now shaking a little reached out for her veil before he could touch it however she swept it back revealing her face  yourenotmajesty hammond  how strangestranger than anything that had ever happened to her beforewas it to hear that name on the lips of this cowboy it was a name by which she was familiarly known though only those nearest and dearest to her had the privilege of using it and now it revived her dulled faculties and by an effort she regained control of herself  you are majesty hammond he replied and this time he affirmed wonderingly rather than questioned  madeline rose and faced him  yes i am  he slammed his gun back into its holster  well i reckon we wont go on with it then  with what sir and why did you force me to say si to this priest  i reckon that was a way i took to show him youd be willing to get married  oh youyou words failed her  this appeared to galvanize the cowboy into action he grasped the padre and led him toward the door cursing and threatening no doubt enjoining secrecy then he pushed him across the threshold and stood there breathing hard and wrestling with himself  herewaitwait a minute missmiss hammond he said huskily you could fall into worse company than minethough i reckon you sure think not im pretty drunk but imall right otherwise just waita minute  she stood quivering and blazing with wrath and watched this savage fight his drunkenness he acted like a man who had been suddenly shocked into a rational state of mind and he was now battling with himself to hold on to it madeline saw the dark damp hair lift from his brows as he held it up to the cool wind above him she saw the white stars in the deepblue sky and they seemed as unreal to her as any other thing in this strange night they were cold brilliant aloof distant and looking at them she felt her wrath lessen and die and leave her calm  the cowboy turned and began to talk  you seei was pretty drunk he labored there was a fiestaand a wedding i do fool things when im drunk i made a fool bet id marry the first girl who came to town if you hadnt worn that veilthe fellows were joshing meand ed linton was getting marriedand everybody always wants to gamble i must have been pretty drunk  after the one look at her when she had first put aside her veil he had not raised his eyes to her face the cool audacity had vanished in what was either excessive emotion or the maudlin condition peculiar to some men when drunk he could not stand still perspiration collected in beads upon his forehead he kept wiping his face with his scarf and he breathed like a man after violent exertions  you seei was pretty he began  explanations are not necessary she interrupted i am very tireddistressed the hour is late have you the slightest idea what it means to be a gentleman  his bronzed face burned to a flaming crimson  is my brother herein town tonight madeline went on  no hes at his ranch  but i wired him  like as not the message is over in his box at the po hell be in town tomorrow hes shipping cattle for stillwell  meanwhile i must go to a hotel will you please  if he heard her last words he showed no evidence of it a noise outside had attracted his attention madeline listened low voices of men the softer liquid tones of a woman drifted in through the open door they spoke in spanish and the voices grew louder evidently the speakers were approaching the station footsteps crunching on gravel attested to this and quicker steps coming with deep tones of men in anger told of a quarrel then the womans voice hurried and broken rising higher was eloquent of vain appeal  the cowboys demeanor startled madeline into anticipation of something dreadful she was not deceived from outside came the sound of a scufflea muffled shot a groan the thud of a falling body a womans low cry and footsteps padding away in rapid retreat  madeline hammond leaned weakly back in her seat cold and sick and for a moment her ears throbbed to the tramp of the dancers across the way and the rhythm of the cheap music then into the open doorplace flashed a girls tragic face lighted by dark eyes and framed by dusky hair the girl reached a slim brown hand round the side of the door and held on as if to support herself a long black scarf accentuated her gaudy attire  senorgene she exclaimed and breathless glad recognition made a sudden break in her terror  bonita the cowboy leaped to her girl are you hurt  no senor  he took hold of her i heardsomebody got shot was it danny  no senor  did danny do the shooting tell me girl  no senor  im sure glad i thought danny was mixed up in that he had stillwells

wont put you in jail take my horse and hit the peloncillo trail bonita promise to stay away from el cajon  si senor  he led her outside madeline heard the horse snort and champ his bit the cowboy spoke low only a few words were intelligiblestirrups wait out of town mountain trail  now ride  a moments silence ensued and was broken by a pounding of hoofs a pattering of gravel then madeline saw a big dark horse run into the wide space she caught a glimpse of windswept scarf and hair a little form low down in the saddle the horse was outlined in black against the line of dim lights there was something wild and splendid in his flight  directly the cowboy appeared again in the doorway  miss hammond i reckon we want to rustle out of here been bad goingson and theres a train due  she hurried into the open air not daring to look back or to either side her guide strode swiftly she had almost to run to keep up with him many conflicting emotions confused her she had a strange sense of this stalking giant beside her silent except for his jangling spurs she had a strange feeling of the cool sweet wind and the white stars was it only her disordered fancy or did these wonderful stars open and shut she had a queer disembodied thought that somewhere in ages back in another life she had seen these stars the night seemed dark yet there was a pale luminous lighta light from the starsand she fancied it would always haunt her  suddenly aware that she had been led beyond the line of houses she spoke  where are you taking me  to florence kingsley he replied  who is she  i reckon shes your brothers best friend out here madeline kept pace with the cowboy for a few moments longer and then she stopped it was as much from necessity to catch her breath as it was from recurring fear all at once she realized what little use her training had been for such an experience as this the cowboy missing her came back the few intervening steps then he waited still silent looming beside her  its so dark so lonely she faltered how do i know what warrant can you give me that youthat no harm will befall me if i go farther  none miss hammond except that ive seen your face     ii a secret kept  because of that singular reply madeline found faith to go farther with the cowboy but at the moment she really did not think about what he had said any answer to her would have served if it had been kind his silence had augmented her nervousness compelling her to voice her fear still even if he had not replied at all she would have gone on with him she shuddered at the idea of returning to the station where she believed there had been murder she could hardly have forced herself to go back to those dim lights in the street she did not want to wander around alone in the dark  and as she walked on into the windy darkness much relieved that he had answered as he had reflecting that he had yet to prove his words true she began to grasp the deeper significance of them there was a revival of pride that made her feel that she ought to scorn to think at all about such a man but madeline hammond discovered that thought was involuntary that there were feelings in her never dreamed of before this night  presently madelines guide turned off the walk and rapped at a door of a lowroofed house  hullowhos there a deep voice answered  gene stewart said the cowboy call florencequick  thump of footsteps followed a tap on a door and voices madeline heard a woman exclaim gene here when theres a dance in town something wrong out on the range a light flared up and shone bright through a window in another moment there came a patter of soft steps and the door opened to disclose a woman holding a lamp  gene als not  al is all right interrupted the cowboy  madeline had two sensations thenone of wonder at the note of alarm and love in the womans voice and the other of unutterable relief to be safe with a friend of her brothers  its als sistercame on tonights train the cowboy was saying i happened to be at the station and ive fetched her up to you  madeline came forward out of the shadow  notnot really majesty hammond exclaimed florence kingsley she nearly dropped the lamp and she looked and looked astounded beyond belief  yes i am really she replied madeline my train was late and for some reason alfred did not meet me mrmr stewart saw fit to bring me to you instead of taking me to a hotel  oh im so glad to meet you replied florence warmly do come in im so surprised i forget my manners why al never mentioned your coming  he surely could not have received my messages said madeline as she entered  the cowboy who came in with her satchel had to stoop to enter the door and once in he seemed to fill the room florence set the lamp down upon the table madeline saw a young woman with a smiling friendly face and a profusion of fair hair hanging down over her dressinggown  oh but al will be glad cried florence why you are white as a sheet you must be tired what a long wait you had at the station i heard the train come in hours ago as i was going to bed that station is lonely at night if i had known you were coming indeed you are very pale are you ill  no only i am very tired traveling so far by rail is harder than i imagined i did have rather a long wait after arriving at the station but i cant say that it was lonely  florence kingsley searched madelines face with keen eyes and then took a long significant look at the silent stewart with that she deliberately and quietly closed a door leading into another room  miss hammond what has happened she had lowered her voice  i do not wish to recall all that has happened replied madeline i shall tell alfred however that i would rather have met a hostile apache than a cowboy  please dont tell al that cried florence then she grasped stewart and pulled him close to the light gene youre drunk  i was pretty drunk he replied hanging his head  oh what have you done  now see here flo i only  i dont want to know id tell it gene arent you ever going to learn decency arent you ever going to stop drinking youll lose all your friends stillwell has stuck to you als been your best friend molly and i have pleaded with you and now youve gone and donegod knows what  what do women want to wear veils for he growled id have known her but for that veil  and you wouldnt have insulted her but you would the next girl who came along gene you are hopeless now you get out of here and dont ever come back  flo he entreated  i mean it  i reckon then ill come back tomorrow and take my medicine he replied  dont you dare she cried  stewart went out and closed the door  miss hammond youyou dont know how this hurts me said florence what you must think of us its so unlucky that you should have had this happen right at first now maybe you wont have the heart to stay oh ive known more than one eastern girl to go home without ever learning what we really are cut here miss hammond gene stewart is a fiend when hes drunk all the same i know whatever he did he meant no shame to you come now dont think about it again tonight she took up the lamp and led madeline into a little room this is out west she went on smiling as she indicated the few furnishings but you can rest youre perfectly safe wont you let me help you undresscant i do anything for you  you are very kind thank you but i can manage replied madeline  well then good night the sooner i go the sooner youll rest just forget what happened and think how fine a surprise youre to give your brother tomorrow  with that she slipped out and softly shut the door  as madeline laid her watch on the bureau she noticed that the time was past two oclock it seemed long since she had gotten off the train when she had turned out the lamp and crept wearily into bed she knew what it was to be utterly spent she was too tired to move a finger but her brain whirled  she had at first no control over it and a thousand thronging sensations came and went and recurred with little logical relation there were the roar of the train the feeling of being lost the sound of pounding hoofs a picture of her brothers face as she had last seen it five years before a long dim line of lights the jingle of silver spurs night wind darkness stars then the gloomy station the shadowy blanketed mexican the empty room the dim lights across the square the tramp of the dancers and vacant laughs and discordant music the door flung wide and the entrance of the cowboy she did not recall how he had looked or what he had done and the next instant she saw him cool smiling devilishsaw him in violence the next his bigness his apparel his physical being were vague as outlines in a dream the white face of the padre flashed along in the train of thought and it brought the same dull halfblind indefinable state of mind subsequent to that last nervebreaking pistolshot that passed and then clear and vivid rose memories of the rest that had happenedstrange voices betraying fury of men a deadened report a moan of mortal pain a womans poignant cry and madeline saw the girls great tragic eyes and the wild flight of the big horse into the blackness and the dark stalking figure of the silent cowboy and the white stars that seemed to look down remorselessly  this tide of memory rolled over madeline again and again and gradually lost its power and faded all distress left her and she felt herself drifting how black the room wasas black with her eyes open as it was when they were shut and the silenceit was like a cloak there was absolutely no sound she was in another world from that which she knew she thought of this fairhaired florence and of alfred and wondering about them she dropped to sleep  when she awakened the room was bright with sunlight a cool wind blowing across the bed caused her to put her hands under the blanket she was lazily and dreamily contemplating the mud walls of this little room when she remembered where she was and how she had come there  how great a shock she had been subjected to was manifest in a sensation of disgust that overwhelmed her she even shut her eyes to try and blot out the recollection she felt that she had been contaminated  presently madeline hammond again awoke to the fact she had learned the preceding nightthat there were emotions to which she had heretofore been a stranger she did not try to analyze them but she exercised her selfcontrol to such good purpose that by the time she had dressed she was outwardly her usual self she scarcely remembered when she had found it necessary to control her emotions there had been no trouble no excitement no unpleasantness in her life it had been ordered for hertranquil luxurious brilliant varied yet always the same  she was not surprised to find the hour late and was going to make inquiry about her brother when a voice arrested her she recognized miss kingsleys voice addressing some one outside and it had a sharpness she had not noted before  so you came back did you well you dont look very proud of yourself this mawnin gene stewart you look like a coyote  say flo if i am a coyote im not going to sneak he said  what d you come for she demanded  i said i was coming round to take my medicine  meaning youll not run from al hammond gene your skull is as thick as an old cows al will never know anything about what you did to his sister unless you tell him and if you do that hell shoot you she wont give you away shes a thoroughbred why she was so white last night i thought shed drop at my feet but she never blinked an eyelash im a woman gene stewart and if i couldnt feel like miss hammond i know how awful an ordeal she must have had why shes one of the most beautiful the most sought after the most exclusive women in new york city theres a crowd of millionaires and lords and dukes after her how terrible itd be for a woman like her to be kissed by a drunken cowpuncher i say it  flo i never insulted her that way broke out stewart  it was worse then she queried sharply  i made a bet that id marry the first girl who came to town i was on the watch and pretty drunk when she camewell i got padre marcos and tried to bully her into marrying me  oh lord florence gasped its worse than i feared gene al will kill you  thatll be a good thing replied the cowboy dejectedly  gene stewart it certainly would unless you turn over a new leaf retorted florence but dont be a fool and here she became earnest and appealing go away gene go join the rebels across the borderyoure always threatening that anyhow dont stay here and run any chance of stirring al up hed kill you just the same as you would kill another man for insulting your sister dont make trouble for al thatd only make sorrow for her gene  the subtle import was not lost upon madeline she was distressed because she could not avoid hearing what was not meant for her ears she made an effort not to listen and it was futile  flo you cant see this a mans way he replied quietly ill stay and take my medicine  gene i could sure swear at you or any other pighead of a cowboy listen my brotherinlaw jack heard something of what i said to you last night he doesnt like you im afraid hell tell al for heavens sake man go downtown and shut him up and yourself too  then madeline heard her come into the house and presently rap on the door and call softly  miss hammond are you awake  awake and dressed miss kingsley come in  oh youve rested you look soso different im sure glad come out now well have breakfast and then you may expect to meet your brother any moment  wait please i heard you speaking to mr stewart it was unavoidable but i am glad i must see him will you please ask him to come into the parlor a moment  yes replied florence quickly and as she turned at the door she flashed at madeline a womans meaning glance make him keep his mouth shut  presently there were slow reluctant steps outside the front door then a pause and the door opened stewart stood bareheaded in the sunlight madeline remembered with a kind of shudder the tall form the embroidered buckskin vest the red scarf the bright leather wristbands the wide silverbuckled belt and chaps her glance seemed to run over him swift as lightning but as she saw his face now she did not recognize it the mans presence roused in her a revolt yet something in her the incomprehensible side of her nature thrilled in the look of this splendid darkfaced barbarian  mr stewart will you please come in she asked after that long pause  i reckon not he said the hopelessness of his tone meant that he knew he was not fit to enter a room with her and did not care or cared too much  madeline went to the door the mans face was hard yet it was sad too and it touched her  i shall not tell my brother of youryour rudeness to me she began it was impossible for her to keep the chill out of her voice to speak with other than the pride and aloofness of her class nevertheless despite her loathing when she had spoken so far it seemed that kindness and pity followed involuntarily i choose to overlook what you did because you were not wholly accountable and because there must be no trouble between alfred and you may i rely on you to keep silence and to seal the lips of that priest and you know there was a man killed or injured there last night i want to forget that dreadful thing i dont want it known that i heard  the greaser didnt die interrupted stewart  ah then thats not so bad after all i am glad for the sake of your friendthe little mexican girl  a slow scarlet wave overspread his face and his shame was painful to see that fixed in madelines mind a conviction that if he was a heathen he was not wholly bad and it made so much difference that she smiled down at him  you will spare me further distress will you not please his hoarse reply was incoherent but she needed only to see his working face to know his remorse and gratitude  madeline went back to her room and presently florence came for her and directly they were sitting at breakfast madeline hammonds impression of her brothers friend had to be reconstructed in the morning light she felt a wholesome frank sweet nature she liked the slow southern drawl and she was puzzled to know whether florence kingsley was pretty or striking or unusual she had a youthful glow and flush the clear tan of outdoors a face that lacked the soft curves and lines of eastern women and her eyes were light gray like crystal steady almost piercing and her hair was a beautiful bright waving mass  florences sister was the elder of the two a stout woman with a strong face and quiet eyes it was a simple fare and service they gave to their guest but they made no apologies for that indeed madeline felt their simplicity to be restful she was sated with respect sick of admiration tired of adulation and it was good to see that these western women treated her as very likely they would have treated any other visitor they were sweet kind and what madeline had at first thought was a lack of expression or vitality she soon discovered to be the natural reserve of women who did not live superficial lives florence was breezy and frank her sister quaint and not given much to speech madeline thought she would like to have these women near her if she were ill or in trouble and she reproached herself for a fastidiousness a hypercritical sense of refinement that could not help distinguishing what these women lacked  can you ride florence was asking thats what a westerner always asks any one from the east can you ride like a manastride i mean oh thats fine you look strong enough to hold a horse we have some fine horses out here i reckon when al comes well go out to bill stillwells ranch well have to go whether we want to or not for when bill learns you are here hell just pack us all off youll love old bill his ranch is run down but the range and the rides up in the mountainsthey are beautiful well hunt and climb and most of all well ride i love a horsei love the wind in my face and a wide stretch with the mountains beckoning you must have the best horse on the ranges and that means a scrap between al and bill and all the cowboys we dont all agree about horses except in case of gene stewarts irongray  does mr stewart own the best horse in the country asked madeline again she had an inexplicable thrill as she remembered the wild flight of stewarts big dark steed and rider  yes and thats all he does own replied florence gene cant keep even a quirt but he sure loves that horse and calls him  at this juncture a sharp knock on the parlor door interrupted the conversation florences sister went to open it she returned presently and said  its gene hes been dawdlin out there on the front porch and he knocked to let us know miss hammonds brother is comin  florence hurried into the parlor followed by madeline the door stood open and disclosed stewart sitting on the porch steps from down the road came a clatter of hoofs madeline looked out over florences shoulder and saw a cloud of dust approaching and in it she distinguished outlines of horses and riders a warmth spread over her a little tingle of gladness and the feeling recalled her girlish love for her brother what would he be like after long years  gene has jack kept his mouth shut queried florence and again madeline was aware of a sharp ring in the girls voice  no replied stewart  gene you wont let it come to a fight al can be managed but jack hates you and hell have his friends with him  there wont be any fight  use your brains now added florence and then she turned to push madeline gently back into the parlor  madelines glow of warmth changed to a blank dismay was she to see her brother act with the violence she now associated with cowboys the clatter of hoofs stopped before the door looking out madeline saw a bunch of dusty wiry horses pawing the gravel and tossing lean heads her swift glance ran over the lithe horsemen trying to pick out the one who was her brother but she could not her glance however caught the same rough dress and hard aspect that characterized the cowboy stewart then one rider threw his bridle leaped from the saddle and came bounding up the porch steps florence met him at the door  hello flo where is she he called eagerly with that he looked over her shoulder to espy madeline he actually jumped at her she hardly knew the tall form and the bronzed face but the warm flash of blue eyes was familiar as for him he had no doubt of his sister it appeared for with broken welcome he threw his arms around her then held her off and looked searchingly at her  well sister he began when florence turned hurriedly from the door and interrupted him  al i think youd better stop the wrangling out there he stared at her appeared suddenly to hear the loud voices from the street and then releasing madeline he said  by george i forgot flo there is a little business to see to keep my sister in here please and dont be fussed up now  he went out on the porch and called to his men  shut off your wind jack and you too blaze i didnt want you fellows to come here but as you would come youve got to shut up this is my business  whereupon he turned to stewart who was sitting on the fence  hello stewart he said  it was a greeting but there was that in the voice which alarmed madeline  stewart leisurely got up and leisurely advanced to the porch  hello hammond he drawled  drunk again last night  well if you want to know and if its any of your mix yes i waspretty drunk replied stewart  it was a kind of cool speech that showed the cowboy in control of himself and master of the situationnot an easy speech to follow up with undue inquisitiveness there was a short silence  damn it stewart said the speaker presently heres the situation its all over town that you met my sister last night at the station andand insulted her jacks got it in for you so have these other boys but its my affair understand i didnt fetch them here they can see you square yourself or elsegene youve been on the wrong trail for some time drinking and all that youre going to the bad but bill thinks and i think youre still a man we never knew you to lie now what have you to say for yourself  nobody is insinuating that i am a liar drawled stewart  no  well im glad to hear that you see al i was pretty drunk last night but not drunk enough to forget the least thing i did i told pat hawe so this morning when he was curious and thats polite for me to be to pat well i found miss hammond waiting alone at the station she wore a veil but i knew she was a lady of course i imagine now that i think of it that miss hammond found my gallantry rather startling and  at this point madeline answering to unconsidered impulse eluded florence and walked out upon the porch  sombreros flashed down and the lean horses jumped  gentlemen said madeline rather breathlessly and it did not add to her calmness to feel a hot flush in her cheeks i am very new to western ways but i think you are laboring under a mistake which in justice to mr stewart i want to correct indeed he was ratherrather abrupt and strange when he came up to me last night but as i understand him now i can attribute that to his gallantry he was somewhat wild and sudden andsentimental in his demand to protect meand it was not clear whether he meant his protection for last night or forever but i am happy to say be offered me no word that was not honorable and he saw me safely here to miss kingsleys home     iii sister and brother  then madeline returned to the little parlor with the brother whom she had hardly recognized  majesty he exclaimed to think of your being here  the warmth stole back along her veins she remembered how that pet name had sounded from the lips of this brother who had given it to her  alfred  then his words of gladness at sight of her his chagrin at not being at the train to welcome her were not so memorable of him as the way he clasped her for he had held her that way the day he left home and she had not forgotten but now he was so much taller and bigger so dusty and strange and different and forceful that she could scarcely think him the same man she even had a humorous thought that here was another cowboy bullying her and this time it was her brother  dear old girl he said more calmly as he let her go you havent changed at all except to grow lovelier only youre a woman now and youve fulfilled the name i gave you god how sight of you brings back home it seems a hundred years since i left i missed you more than all the rest  madeline seemed to feel with his every word that she was remembering him she was so amazed at the change in him that she could not believe her eyes she saw a bronzed strongjawed eagleeyed man stalwart superb of height and like the cowboys belted booted spurred and there was something hard as iron in his face that quivered with his words it seemed that only in those moments when the hard lines broke and softened could she see resemblance to the face she remembered it was his manner the tone of his voice and the tricks of speech that proved to her he was really alfred she had bidden goodby to a disgraced disinherited dissolute boy well she remembered the handsome pale face with its weakness and shadows and careless smile with the everpresent cigarette hanging between the lips the years had passed and now she saw him a manthe west had made him a man and madeline hammond felt a strong passionate gladness and gratefulness and a direct check to her suddenly inspired hatred of the west  majesty it was good of you to come im all broken up how did you ever do it but never mind that now tell me about that brother of mine  and madeline told him and then about their sister helen question after question he fired at her and she told him of her mother of aunt grace who had died a year ago of his old friends married scattered vanished but she did not tell him of his father for he did not ask  quite suddenly the rapidfire questioning ceased he choked was silent a moment and then burst into tears it seemed to her that a long storedup bitterness was flooding away it hurt her to see himhurt her more to hear him and in the succeeding few moments she grew closer to him than she had ever been in the past had her father and mother done right by him her pulse stirred with unwonted quickness she did not speak but she kissed him which for her was an indication of unusual feeling and when he recovered command over his emotions he made no reference to his breakdown nor did she but that scene struck deep into madeline hammonds heart through it she saw what he had lost and gained  alfred why did you not answer my last letters asked madeline i had not heard from you for two years  so long how time flies well things went bad with me about the last time i heard from you i always intended to write some day but i never did  things went wrong tell me  majesty you mustnt worry yourself with my troubles i want you to enjoy your stay and not be bothered with my difficulties  please tell me i suspected something had gone wrong that is partly why i decided to come out  all right if you must know he began and it seemed to madeline that there was a gladness in his decision to unburden himself you remember all about my little ranch and that for a while i did well raising stock i wrote you all that majesty a man makes enemies anywhere perhaps an eastern man in the west can make if not so many certainly more bitter ones at any rate i made several there was a cattleman ward by namehes gone nowand he and i had trouble over cattle that gave me a backset pat hawe the sheriff here has been instrumental in hurting my business hes not so much of a rancher but he has influence at santa fe and el paso and douglas i made an enemy of him i never did anything to him he hates gene stewart and upon one occasion i spoiled a little plot of his to get gene in his clutches the real reason for his animosity toward me is that he loves florence and florence is going to marry me  alfred  whats the matter majesty didnt florence impress you favorably he asked with a keen glance  whyyes indeed i like her but i did not think of her in relation to youthat way i am greatly surprised alfred is she well born what connections  florence is just a girl of ordinary people she was born in kentucky was brought up in texas my aristocratic and wealthy family would scorn  alfred you are still a hammond said madeline with uplifted head  alfred laughed we wont quarrel majesty i remember you and in spite of your pride youve got a heart if you stay here a month youll love florence kingsley i want you to know shes had a great deal to do with straightening me up well to go on with my story theres don carlos a mexican rancher and hes my worst enemy for that matter hes as bad an enemy of bill stillwell and other ranchers stillwell by the way is my friend and one of the finest men on earth i got in debt to don carlos before i knew he was so mean in the first place i lost money at faroi gambled some when i came westand then i made unwise cattle deals don carlos is a wily greaser he knows the ranges he has the water and he is dishonest so he outfigured me and now i am practically ruined he has not gotten possession of my ranch but thats only a matter of time pending lawsuits at santa fe at present i have a few hundred cattle running on stillwells range and i am his foreman  foreman queried madeline  i am simply boss of stillwells cowboys and right glad of my job  madeline was conscious of an inward burning it required an effort for her to retain her outward tranquillity annoying consciousness she had also of the returning sense of new disturbing emotions she began to see just how walled in from unusual thoughtprovoking incident and sensation had been her exclusive life  cannot your property be reclaimed she asked how much do you owe  ten thousand dollars would clear me and give me another start but majesty in this country thats a good deal of money and i havent been able to raise it stillwells in worse shape than i am  madeline went over to alfred and put her hands on his shoulders  we must not be in debt  he stared at her as if her words had recalled something long forgotten then he smiled  how imperious you are id forgotten just who my beautiful sister really is majesty youre not going to ask me to take money from you  i am  well ill not do it i never did even when i was in college and then there wasnt much beyond me  listen alfred she went on earnestly this is entirely different i had only an allowance then you had no way to know that since i last wrote you i had come into my inheritance from aunt grace it waswell that doesnt matter only i havent been able to spend half the income its mine its not fathers money you will make me very happy if youll consent alfred im soso amazed at the change in you im so happy you must never take a backward step from now on what is ten thousand dollars to me sometimes i spend that in a month i throw money away if you let me help you it will be doing me good as well as you please alfred  he kissed her evidently surprised at her earnestness and indeed madeline was surprised herself once started her speech had flowed  you always were the best of fellows majesty and if you really careif you really want to help me ill be only too glad to accept it will be fine florence will go wild and that greaser wont harass me any more majesty pretty soon some titled fellow will be spending your money i may as well take a little before he gets it all he finished jokingly  what do you know about me she asked lightly  more than you think even if we are lost out here in the woolly west we get news everybody knows about anglesbury and that dago duke who chased you all over europe that lord castleton has the running now and seems about to win how about it majesty  madeline detected a hint that suggested scorn in his gay speech and deep in his searching glance she saw a flame she became thoughtful she had forgotten castleton new york society  alfred she began seriously i dont believe any titled gentleman will ever spend my money as you elegantly express it  i dont care for that its you he cried passionately and he grasped her with a violence that startled her he was white his eyes were now like fire you are so splendidso wonderful people called you the american beauty but youre more than that youre the american girl majesty marry no man unless you love him and love an american stay away from europe long enough to learn to know the menthe real men of your own country  alfred im afraid there are not always real men and real love for american girls in international marriages but helen knows this itll be her choice shell be miserable if she marries anglesbury  itll serve her just right declared her brother helen was always crazy for glitter adulation fame ill gamble she never saw more of anglesbury than the gold and ribbons on his breast  i am sorry anglesbury is a gentleman but it is the money he wanted i think alfred tell me how you came to know about me way out here you may be assured i was astonished to find that miss kingsley knew me as majesty hammond  i imagine it was a surprise he replied with a laugh i told florence about yougave her a picture of you and of course being a woman she showed the picture and talked shes in love with you then my dear sister we do get new york papers out here occasionally and we can see and read you may not be aware that you and your society friends are objects of intense interest in the u s in general and the west in particular the papers are full of you and perhaps a lot of things you never did  that mr stewart knew too he said youre not majesty hammond  never mind his impudence exclaimed alfred and then again he laughed gene is all right only youve got to know him ill tell you what he did he got hold of one of those newspaper pictures of youthe one in the times he took it away from here and in spite of florence he wouldnt fetch it back it was a picture of you in ridinghabit with your blueribbon horse white stockingsremember it was taken at newport well stewart tacked the picture up in his bunkhouse and named his beautiful horse majesty all the cowboys knew it they would see the picture and tease him unmercifully but he didnt care one day i happened to drop in on him and found him just recovering from a carouse i saw the picture too and i said to him gene if my sister knew you were a drunkard shed not be proud of having her picture stuck up in your room majesty he did not touch a drop for a month and when he did drink again he took the picture down and he has never put it back  madeline smiled at her brothers amusement but she did not reply she simply could not adjust herself to these queer free western ways her brother had eloquently pleaded for her to keep herself above a sordid and brilliant marriage yet he not only allowed a cowboy to keep her picture in his room but actually spoke of her and used her name in a temperance lecture madeline just escaped feeling disgust she was saved from this however by nothing less than her brothers naive gladness that through subtle suggestion stewart had been persuaded to be good for a month something made up of stewarts effrontery to her of florence kingsley meeting her frankly as it were as an equal of the elder sisters slow quiet easy acceptance of this visitor who had been honored at the courts of royalty of that faint hint of scorn in alfreds voice and his amused statement in regard to her picture and the name majestysomething made up of all these stung madeline hammonds pride alienated her for an instant and then stimulated her intelligence excited her interest and made her resolve to learn a little about this incomprehensible west  majesty i must run down to the siding he said consulting his watch were loading a shipment of cattle ill be back by suppertime and bring stillwell with me youll like him give me the check for your trunk  she went into the little bedroom and taking up her bag she got out a number of checks  six six trunks he exclaimed well im very glad you intend to stay awhile say majesty it will take me as long to realize who you really are as itll take to break you of being a tenderfoot i hope you packed a ridingsuit if not youll have to wear trousers youll have to do that anyway when we go up in the mountains  no  you sure will as florence says  we shall see about that i dont know whats in the trunks i never pack anything my dear brother what do i have maids for  how did it come that you didnt travel with a maid  i wanted to be alone but dont you worry i shall be able to look after myself i dare say it will be good for me  she went to the gate with him  what a shaggy dusty horse hes wild too do you let him stand that way without being haltered i should think he would run off  tenderfoot youll be great fun majesty especially for the cowboys  oh will i she asked constrainedly  yes and in three days they will be fighting one another over you thats going to worry me cowboys fall in love with a plain woman an ugly woman any woman so long as shes young and you good lord theyll go out of their heads  you are pleased to be facetious alfred i think i have had quite enough of cowboys and i havent been here twentyfour hours  dont think too much of first impressions that was my mistake when i arrived here goodby ill go now better rest awhile you look tired  the horse started as alfred put his foot in the stirrup and was running when the rider slipped his leg over the saddle madeline watched him in admiration he seemed to be loosely fitted to the saddle moving with the horse  i suppose thats a cowboys style it pleases me she said how different from the seat of eastern riders  then madeline sat upon the porch and fell to interested observation of her surrounding near at hand it was decidedly not prepossessing the street was deep in dust and the cool wind whipped up little puffs the houses along this street were all low square flatroofed structures made of some kind of red cement it occurred to her suddenly that this buildingmaterial must be the adobe she had read about there was no person in sight the long street appeared to have no end though the line of houses did not extend far once she heard a horse trotting at some distance and several times the ringing of a locomotive bell where were the mountains wondered madeline soon low over the houseroofs she saw a dim darkblue rugged outline it seemed to charm her eyes and fix her gaze she knew the adirondacks she had seen the alps from the summit of mont blanc and had stood under the great black whitetipped shadow of the himalayas but they had not drawn her as these remote rockies this dim horizon line boldly cutting the blue sky fascinated her florence kingsleys expression beckoning mountains returned to madeline she could not see or feel so much as that her impression was rather that these mountains were aloof unattainable that if approached they would recede or vanish like the desert mirage  madeline went to her room intending to rest awhile and she fell asleep she was aroused by florences knock and call  miss hammond your brother has come back with stillwell  why how i have slept exclaimed madeline its nearly six oclock  im sure glad you were tired and the air here makes strangers sleepy come we want you to meet old bill he calls himself the last of the cattlemen he has lived in texas and here all his life  madeline accompanied florence to the porch her brother who was sitting near the door jumped up and said  hello majesty and as he put his arm around her he turned toward a massive man whose broad craggy face began to ripple and wrinkle i want to introduce my friend stillwell to you bill this is my sister the sister ive so often told you aboutmajesty  wal wal al thiss the proudest meetin of my life replied stillwell in a booming voice he extended a huge hand missmiss majesty sight of you is as welcome as the rain an the flowers to an old desert cattleman  madeline greeted him and it was all she could do to repress a cry at the way he crunched her hand in a grasp of iron he was old whitehaired weatherbeaten with long furrows down his checks and with gray eyes almost hidden in wrinkles if he was smiling she fancied it a most extraordinary smile the next instant she realized that it had been a smile for his face appeared to stop rippling the light died and suddenly it was like rudely chiseled stone the quality of hardness she had seen in stewart was immeasurably intensified in this old mans face  miss majesty its plumb humiliatin to all of us thet we wasnt on hand to meet you stillwell said me an al stepped into the p o an said a few mild an cheerful things them messages ought to hev been sent out to the ranch im sure afraid it was a bit unpleasant fer you last night at the station  i was rather anxious at first and perhaps frightened replied madeline  wal im some glad to tell you thet theres no man in these parts except your brother thet id as lief hev met you as gene stewart  indeed  yes an thets takin into consideration genes weakness too im allus fond of sayin of myself thet im the last of the old cattlemen wal stewarts not a native westerner but hes my pick of the last of the cowboys sure hes young but hes the last of the old stylethe picturesquean chivalrous too i make bold to say miss majesty as well as the old hardridin kind folks are down on stewart an im only sayin a good word for him because he is down an mebbe last night he might hev scared you you bein fresh from the east  madeline liked the old fellow for his loyalty to the cowboy he evidently cared for but as there did not seem anything for her to say she remained silent  miss majesty the day of the cattleman is about over an the day of the cowboy such as gene stewart is over theres no place for gene if these werent modern days hed come near bein a gunman same as we had in texas when i ranched there in the seventies but he cant fit nowhere now he cant hold a job an hes goin down  i am sorry to hear it murmured madeline but mr stillwell arent these modern days out here just a little wildyet the conductor on my train told me of rebels bandits raiders then i have had other impressions ofwell that were wild enough for me  wal its some more pleasant an excitin these days than for many years replied stillwell the boys hev took to packin guns again but thets owin to the revolution in mexico theres goin to be trouble along the border i reckon people in the east dont know there is a revolution wal madero will oust diaz an then some other rebel will oust madero it means trouble on the border an across the border too i wouldnt wonder if uncle sam hed to get a hand in the game theres already been holdups on the railroads an raids along the rio grande valley an these little towns are full of greasers all disturbed by the fightin down in mexico weve been hevin shootinscrapes an knifinscrapes an some cattleraidin i hev been losin a few cattle right along reminds me of old times an pretty soon if it doesnt stop ill take the oldtime way to stop it  yes indeed majesty put in alfred you have hit upon an interesting time to visit us  wal thet sure pears to be so rejoined stillwell stewart got in trouble down heah today an im more than sorry to hev to tell you thet your name figgered in it but i couldnt blame him fer i sure would hev done the same myself  that so queried alfred laughing well tell us about it  madeline simply gazed at her brother and though he seemed amused at her consternation there was mortification in his face  it required no great perspicuity madeline thought to see that stillwell loved to talk and the way he squared himself and spread his huge hands over his knees suggested that he meant to do this opportunity justice  miss majesty i reckon bein as youre in the west now thet you must take things as they come an mind each thing a little less than the one before if we old fellers hednt been thet way wed never hev lasted  last night wasnt particular bad ratin with some other nights lately there wasnt much doin but i had a hard knock yesterday when we started in with a bunch of cattle i sent one of my cowboys danny mains along ahead carryin money i hed to pay off hands an my bills an i wanted thet money to get in town before dark wal danny was held up i dont distrust the lad theres been strange greasers in town lately an mebbe they knew about the money comin  wal when i arrived with the cattle i was some put to it to make ends meet an today i wasnt in no angelic humor when i hed my business all done i went around pokin my nose beak an there tryin to get scent of thet money an i happened in at a hall we hev thet does duty fer jail an hospital an electionpost an what not wal just then it was doin duty as a hospital last night was fiesta nightthese greasers hev a fiesta every week or soan one greaser who hed been bad hurt was layin in the hall where he hed been fetched from the station somebody hed sent off to douglas fer a doctor but be hednt come yet ive hed some experience with gunshot wounds an i looked this feller over he wasnt shot up much but i thought there was danger of bloodpoisonin anyway i did all i could  the hall was full of cowboys ranchers greasers miners an town folks along with some strangers i was about to get started up this way when pat hawe come in  pat hes the sheriff i reckon miss majesty thet sheriffs are new to you an fer sake of the west ill explain to you thet we dont hev many of the real thing any more garrett who killed billy the kid an was killed himself near a year or so agohe was the kind of sheriff thet helps to make a selfrespectin country but this pat hawewal i reckon theres no good in me sayin what i think of him he come into the hall an he was roarin about things he was goin to arrest danny mains on sight wal i jest politelike told pat thet the money was mine an he neednt get riled about it an if i wanted to trail the thief i reckon i could do it as well as anybody pat howled thet law was law an he was goin to lay down the law sure it peared to me thet pat was daid set to arrest the first man he could find excuse to  then he cooled down a bit an was askin questions about the wounded greaser when gene stewart come in whenever pat an gene come together it reminds me of the early days back in the seventies jest naturally everybody shut up fer pat hates gene an i reckon gene aint very sweet on pat theyre jest natural foes in the first place an then the course of events here in el cajon has been aggravatin  hello stewart youre the feller im lookin fer said pat  stewart eyed him an said mighty cool an sarcastic hawe you look a good deal fer me when im hittin up the dust the other way  pat went red at thet but he held in say stewart youall think a lot of thet roan horse of yourn with the aristocratic name  i reckon i do replied gene shortly  wal where is he  thets none of your business hawe  oho it aint hey wal i guess i can make it my business stewart there was some queer goingson last night thet you know somethin about danny mains robbedstillwells money goneyour roan horse gonethet little hussy bonita gonean this greaser near gone too now seein thet you was up late an prowlin round the station where this greaser was found it aint onreasonable to think you might know how he got pluggedis it  stewart laughed kind of cold an he rolled a cigarette all the time eyin pat an then he said if hed plugged the greaser it d never hev been sich a bunglin job  i can arrest you on suspicion stewart but before i go thet far i want some evidence i want to round up danny mains an thet little greaser girl i want to find out whats become of your hoss youve never lent him since you hed him an there aint enough raiders across the border to steal him from you its got a queer lookthet hoss bein gone  you sure are a swell detective hawe an i wish you a heap of luck replied stewart  thet peared to nettle pat beyond bounds an he stamped around an swore then he had an idea it jest stuck out all over him an he shook his finger in stewarts face  you was drunk last night  stewart never batted an eye  you met some woman on number eight didnt you shouted hawe  i met a lady replied stewart quiet an menacin like  you met al hammonds sister an you took her up to kingsleys an cinch this my cowboy cavalier im goin up there an ask this grand dame some questions an if shes as closemouthed as you are ill arrest her  gene stewart turned white i fer one expected to see him jump like lightnin as he does when hes riled sudden but he was calm an he was thinkin hard presently he said  pat thets a fool idee an if you do the trick itll hurt you all the rest of your life theres absolutely no reason to frighten miss hammond an tryin to arrest her would be such a damned outrage as wont be stood fer in el cajon if youre sore on me send me to jail ill go if you want to hurt al hammond go an do it some man kind of way dont take your spite out on us by insultin a lady who has come hyar to hev a little visit were bad enough without bein lowdown as greasers  it was a long talk for gene an i was as surprised as the rest of the fellers think of gene stewart talkin soft an sweet to thet redeyed coyote of a sheriff an pat he looked so devilishly gleeful thet if somethin about gene hednt held me tight id hev got in the game myself it was plain to me an others who spoke of it afterwards thet pat hawe hed forgotten the law an the officer in the man an his hate  im agoin an im agoin right now he shouted an after thet any one could hev heerd a clock tick a mile off stewart seemed kind of chokin an he seemed to hev been bewildered by the idee of hawes confrontin you  an finally he burst out but man think who it is its miss hammond if you seen her even if you was locoed or drunk youyou couldnt do it  couldnt i wal ill show you damn quick what do i care who she is them swell eastern womenive heerd of them theyre not so much this hammond woman  suddenly hawe shut up an with his red mug turnin green he went for his gun  stillwell paused in his narrative to get breath and he wiped his moist brow and now his face began to lose its cragginess it changed it softened it rippled and wrinkled and all that strange mobility focused and shone in a wonderful smile  an then miss majesty then there was somethin happened stewart took pats gun away from him and throwed it on the floor an what followed was beautiful sure it was the beautifulest sight i ever seen only it was over so soon a little while after when the doctor came he hed another patient besides the wounded greaser an he said thet this new one would require about four months to be up an around cheerfullike again an gene stewart hed hit the trail for the border     iv a ride from sunrise to sunset  next morning when madeline was aroused by her brother it was not yet daybreak the air chilled her and in the gray gloom she had to feel around for matches and lamp her usual languid manner vanished at a touch of the cold water presently when alfred knocked on her door and said he was leaving a pitcher of hot water outside she replied with chattering teeth ththank yyou bbut i ddont neneed any now she found it necessary however to warm her numb fingers before she could fasten hooks and buttons and when she was dressed she marked in the dim mirror that there were tinges of red in her cheeks  well if i havent some color she exclaimed  breakfast waited for her in the diningroom the sisters ate with her madeline quickly caught the feeling of brisk action that seemed to be in the air from the back of the house sounded the tramp of boots and voices of men and from outside came a dull thump of hoofs the rattle of harness and creak of wheels then alfred came stamping in  majesty heres where you get the real thing he announced merrily were rushing you off im sorry to say but we must hustle back to the ranch the fall roundup begins tomorrow you will ride in the buckboard with florence and stillwell ill ride on ahead with the boys and fix up a little for you at the ranch your baggage will follow but wont get there till tomorrow sometime its a long ride outnearly fifty miles by wagonroad flo dont forget a couple of robes wrap her up well and hustle getting ready were waiting  a little later when madeline went out with florence the gray gloom was lightening horses were champing bits and pounding gravel  mawnin miss majesty said stillwell gruffly from the front seat of a high vehicle  alfred bundled her up into the back seat and florence after her and wrapped them with robes then he mounted his horse and started off gideb growled stillwell and with a crack of his whip the team jumped into a trot florence whispered into madelines ear  bills grouchy early in the mawnin hell thaw out soon as it gets warm  it was still so gray that madeline could not distinguish objects at any considerable distance and she left el cajon without knowing what the town really looked like she did know that she was glad to get out of it and found an easier task of dispelling persistent haunting memory  here come the cowboys said florence  a line of horsemen appeared coming from the right and fell in behind alfred and gradually they drew ahead to disappear from sight while madeline watched them the gray gloom lightened into dawn all about her was bare and dark the horizon seemed close not a hill nor a tree broke the monotony the ground appeared to be flat but the road went up and down over little ridges madeline glanced backward in the direction of el cajon and the mountains she had seen the day before and she saw only bare and dark ground like that which rolled before  a puff of cold wind struck her face and she shivered florence noticed her and pulled up the second robe and tucked it closely round her up to her chin  if we have a little wind youll sure feel it said the western girl  madeline replied that she already felt it the wind appeared to penetrate the robes it was cold pure nipping it was so thin she had to breathe as fast as if she were under ordinary exertion it hurt her nose and made her lungs ache  arent you cocold asked madeline  i florence laughed im used to it i never get cold  the western girl sat with ungloved hands on the outside of the robe she evidently did not need to draw up around her madeline thought she had never seen such a cleareyed healthy splendid girl  do you like to see the sun rise asked florence  yes i think i do replied madeline thoughtfully frankly i have not seen it for years  we have beautiful sunrises and sunsets from the ranch are glorious  long lines of pink fire ran level with the eastern horizon which appeared to recede as day brightened a bank of thin fleecy clouds was turning rose to the south and west the sky was dark but every moment it changed the blue turning bluer the eastern sky was opalescent then in one place gathered a golden light and slowly concentrated till it was like fire the rosy bank of cloud turned to silver and pearl and behind it shot up a great circle of gold above the dark horizon gleamed an intensely bright disk it was the sun it rose swiftly blazing out the darkness between the ridges and giving color and distance to the sweep of land  wal wal drawled stillwell and stretched his huge arms as if he had just awakened thets somethin like  florence nudged madeline and winked at her  fine mawnin girls went on old bill cracking his whip miss majesty itll be some oninterestin ride all mawnin but when we get up a bit youll sure like it there look to the southwest jest over thet farthest ridge  madeline swept her gaze along the gray sloping horizonline to where darkblue spires rose far beyond the ridge  peloncillo mountains said stillwell thets home when we get there we wont see no more of them till afternoon when they rise up suddenlike  peloncillo madeline murmured the melodious name where had she heard it then she remembered the cowboy stewart had told the little mexican girl bonita to hit the peloncillo trail probably the girl had ridden the big dark horse over this very road at night alone madeline had a little shiver that was not occasioned by the cold wind  theres a jack cried florence suddenly  madeline saw her first jackrabbit it was as large as a dog and its ears were enormous it appeared to be impudently tame and the horses kicked dust over it as they trotted by from then on old bill and florence vied with each other in calling madelines attention to many things along the way coyotes stealing away into the brush buzzards flapping over the carcass of a cow that had been mired in a wash queer little lizards running swiftly across the road cattle grazing in the hollows adobe huts of mexican herders wild shaggy horses with heads high watching from the gray ridgesall these things madeline looked at indifferently at first because indifference had become habitual with her and then with an interest that flourished up and insensibly grew as she rode on it grew until sight of a little ragged mexican boy astride the most diminutive burro she had ever seen awakened her to the truth she became conscious of faint unmistakable awakening of longdead feelingsenthusiasm and delight when she realized that she breathed deep of the cold sharp air and experienced an inward joy and she divined then though she did not know why that henceforth there was to be something new in her life something she had never felt before something good for her soul in the homely the commonplace the natural and the wild  meanwhile as madeline gazed about her and listened to her companions the sun rose higher and grew warm and soared and grew hot the horses held tirelessly to their steady trot and mile after mile of rolling land slipped by  from the top of a ridge madeline saw down into a hollow where a few of the cowboys had stopped and were sitting round a fire evidently busy at the noonday meal their horses were feeding on the long gray grass  wal smell of thet burnin greasewood makes my mouth water said stillwell im sure hungry well noon hyar an let the hosses rest its a long pull to the ranch  he halted near the campfire and clambering down began to unharness the team florence leaped out and turned to help madeline  walk round a little she said you must be cramped from sitting still so long ill get lunch ready  madeline got down glad to stretch her limbs and began to stroll about she heard stillwell throw the harness on the ground and slap his horses roll you sonsofguns he said both horses bent their fore legs heaved down on their sides and tried to roll over one horse succeeded on the fourth try and then heaved up with a satisfied snort and shook off the dust and gravel the other one failed to roll over and gave it up half rose to his feet and then lay down on the other side  hes sure going to feel the ground said florence smiling at madeline miss hammond i suppose that prize horse of yourswhite stockingswould spoil his coat if he were heah to roll in this greasewood and cactus  during lunchtime madeline observed that she was an object of manifestly great interest to the three cowboys she returned the compliment and was amused to see that a glance their way caused them painful embarrassment they were grown menone of whom had white hairyet they acted like boys caught in the act of stealing a forbidden look at a pretty girl  cowboys are sure all flirts said florence as if stating an uninteresting fact but madeline detected a merry twinkle in her clear eyes the cowboys heard and the effect upon them was magical they fell to shamed confusion and to hurried useless tasks madeline found it difficult to see where they had been bold though evidently they were stricken with conscious guilt she recalled appraising looks of critical english eyes impudent french stares burning spanish glancesgantlets which any american girl had to run abroad compared with foreign eyes the eyes of these cowboys were those of smiling eager babies  haw haw roared stillwell florence you jest hit the nail on the haid cowboys are all plumb flirts i was wonderin why them boys nooned hyar this aint no place to noon aint no grazin or wood wuth burnin or nuthin them boys jest held up throwed the packs an waited fer us it aint so surprisin fer booly an nedtheyre young an coltishbut nels there why hes old enough to be the paw of both you girls it sure is amazin strange  a silence ensued the whitehaired cowboy nels fussed aimlessly over the campfire and then straightened up with a very red face  bill youre a doggone liar he said i reckon i wont stand to be classed with booly an ned there aint no cowboy on this range thets more appreciatin of the ladies than me but i shore aint ridin out of my way i reckon i hev enough ridin to do now bill if youve sich doggone good eyes mebbe you seen somethin on the way out  nels i hevnt seen nothin he replied bluntly his levity disappeared and the red wrinkles narrowed round his searching eyes  jest take a squint at these hoss tracks said nels and he drew stillwell a few paces aside and pointed to large hoofprints in the dust i reckon you know the hoss thet made them  gene stewarts roan or im a sonofagun exclaimed stillwell and he dropped heavily to his knees and began to scrutinize the tracks my eyes are sure pore but nels they aint fresh  i reckon them tracks was made early yesterday mornin  wal what if they was stillwell looked at his cowboy its sure as thet red nose of yourn gene wasnt ridin the roan  whos sayin he was bill its more n your eyes thets gettin old jest foller them tracks come on  stillwell walked slowly with his head bent muttering to himself some thirty paces or more from the campfire he stopped short and again flopped to his knees then he crawled about evidently examining horse tracks  nels whoever was straddlin stewarts hoss met somebody an they hauled up a bit but didnt git down  tolerable good for you bill thet reasonin replied the cowboy  stillwell presently got up and walked swiftly to the left for some rods halted and faced toward the southwest then retraced his steps he looked at the imperturbable cowboy  nels i dont like this a little he growled them tracks make straight fer the peloncillo trail  shore replied nels  wal went on stillwell impatiently  i reckon you know what hoss made the other tracks  im thinkin hard but i aint sure  it was danny mainss bronc  how do you know thet demanded stillwell sharply bill the left front foot of thet little hoss always wears a shoe thet sets crooked any of the boys can tell you id know thet track if i was blind  stillwells ruddy face clouded and he kicked at a cactus plant  was danny comin or

better hit the peloncillo trail mebbe i can find danny  i reckon you had nels replied stillwell but dont take more n a couple of days we cant do much on the roundup without you im short of boys  that ended the conversation stillwell immediately began to hitch up his team and the cowboys went out to fetch their strayed horses madeline had been curiously interested and she saw that florence knew it  things happen miss hammond she said soberly almost sadly  madeline thought and then straightway florence began brightly to hum a tune and to busy herself repacking what was left of the lunch madeline conceived a strong liking and respect for this western girl she admired the consideration or delicacy or wisdomwhatever it waswhich kept florence from asking her what she knew or thought or felt about the events that had taken place  soon they were once more bowling along the road down a gradual incline and then they began to climb a long ridge that had for hours hidden what lay beyond that climb was rather tiresome owing to the sun and the dust and the restricted view  when they reached the summit madeline gave a little gasp of pleasure a deep gray smooth valley opened below and sloped up on the other side in little ridges like waves and these led to the foothills dotted with clumps of brush or trees and beyond rose dark mountains pinefringed and cragspired  wal miss majesty now were gettin somewhere said stillwell cracking his whip ten miles across this valley an well be in the foothills where the apaches used to run  ten miles exclaimed madeline it looks no more than half a mile to me  wal young woman before you go to ridin off alone you want to get your eyes corrected to western distance now whatd you call them black things off there on the slope  horsemen no cattle replied madeline doubtfully  nope jest plain everyday cactus an over hyarlook down the valley somethin of a pretty forest aint thet he asked pointing  madeline saw a beautiful forest in the center of the valley toward the south  wal miss majesty thets jest this deceivin air theres no forest its a mirage  indeed how beautiful it is madeline strained her gaze on the dark blot and it seemed to float in the atmosphere to have no clearly defined margins to waver and shimmer and then it faded and vanished  the mountains dropped down again behind the horizon and presently the road began once more to slope up the horses slowed to a walk there was a mile of rolling ridge and then came the foothills the road ascended through winding valleys trees and brush and rocks began to appear in the dry ravines there was no water yet all along the sandy washes were indications of floods at some periods the heat and the dust stifled madeline and she had already become tired still she looked with all her eyes and saw birds and beautiful quail with crests and rabbits and once she saw a deer  miss majesty said stillwell in the early days the indians made this country a bad one to live in i reckon you never heerd much about them times surely you was hardly born then ill hev to tell you some day how i fought comanches in the panhandlethet was northern texasan i had some mighty hairraisin scares in this country with apaches  he told her about cochise chief of the chiricahua apaches the most savage and bloodthirsty tribe that ever made life a horror for the pioneer cochise befriended the whites once but he was the victim of that friendliness and he became the most implacable of foes then geronimo another apache chief had as late as 1885 gone on the warpath and had left a bloody trail down the new mexico and arizona line almost to the border lone ranchmen and cowboys had been killed and mothers had shot their children and then themselves at the approach of the apache the name apache curdled the blood of any woman of the southwest in those days  madeline shuddered and was glad when the old frontiersman changed the subject and began to talk of the settling of that country by the spaniards the legends of lost goldmines handed down to the mexicans and strange stories of heroism and mystery and religion the mexicans had not advanced much in spite of the spread of civilization to the southwest they were still superstitious and believed the legends of treasures hidden in the walls of their missions and that unseen hands rolled rocks down the gullies upon the heads of prospectors who dared to hunt for the lost mines of the padres  up in the mountains back of my ranch theres a lost mine said stillwell mebbe its only a legend but somehow i believe its there other lost mines hev been found an as fer the rollin stones i sure know thets true as any one can find out if he goes trailin up the gulch mebbe thets only the weatherin of the cliffs its a sleepy strange country this southwest an miss majesty youre agoin to love it youll call it romantic wal i reckon romantic is correct a feller gets lazy out hyar an dreamy an he wants to put off work till tomorrow some folks say its a land of mananaa land of tomorrow thets the mexican of it  but i like best to think of what a lady said to me onctan eddicated lady like you miss majesty wal she said its a land where its always afternoon i liked thet i always get up sore in the mawnins an dont feel good till noon but in the afternoon i get sorta warm an like things an sunset is my time i reckon i dont want nothin any finer than sunset from my ranch you look out over a valley that spreads wide between guadalupe mountains an the chiricahuas down across the red arizona desert clear to the sierra madres in mexico two hundred miles miss majesty an all as clear as print an the sun sets behind all thet when my time comes to die id like it to be on my porch smokin my pipe an facin the west  so the old cattleman talked on while madeline listened and florence dozed in her seat and the sun began to wane and the horses climbed steadily presently at the foot of the steep ascent stillwell got out and walked leading the team during this long climb fatigue claimed madeline and she drowsily closed her eyes to find when she opened them again that the glaring white sky had changed to a steelblue the sun had sunk behind the foothills and the air was growing chilly stillwell had returned to the drivingseat and was chuckling to the horses shadows crept up out of the hollows  wal flo said stillwell i reckon wed better hev the rest of thet there lunch before dark  you didnt leave much of it laughed florence as she produced the basket from under the seat  while they ate the short twilight shaded and gloom filled the hollows madeline saw the first star a faint winking point of light the sky had now changed to a hazy gray madeline saw it gradually clear and darken to show other faint stars after that there was perceptible deepening of the gray and an enlarging of the stars and a brightening of newborn ones night seemed to come on the cold wind madeline was glad to have the robes close around her and to lean against florence the hollows were now black but the tops of the foothills gleamed pale in a soft light the steady tramp of the horses went on and the creak of wheels and crunching of gravel madeline grew so sleepy that she could not keep her weary eyelids from falling there were drowsier spells in which she lost a feeling of where she was and these were disturbed by the jolt of wheels over a rough place then came a blank interval short or long which ended in a more violent lurch of the buckboard madeline awoke to find her head on florences shoulder she sat up laughing and apologizing for her laziness florence assured her they would soon reach the ranch  madeline observed then that the horses were once more trotting the wind was colder the night darker the foothills flatter and the sky was now a wonderful deep velvetblue blazing with millions of stars some of them were magnificent how strangely white and alive again madeline felt the insistence of familiar yet baffling associations these white stars called strangely to her or haunted her     v the roundup  it was a crackling and roaring of fire that awakened madeline next morning and the first thing she saw was a huge stone fireplace in which lay a bundle of blazing sticks some one had kindled a fire while she slept for a moment the curious sensation of being lost returned to her she just dimly remembered reaching the ranch and being taken into a huge house and a huge dimly lighted room and it seemed to her that she had gone to sleep at once and had awakened without remembering how she had gotten to bed  but she was wide awake in an instant the bed stood near one end of an enormous chamber the adobe walls resembled a hall in an ancient feudal castle stonefloored stonewalled with great darkened rafters running across the ceiling the few articles of furniture were worn out and sadly dilapidated light flooded into the room from two windows on the right of the fireplace and two on the left and another large window near the bedstead looking out from where she lay madeline saw a dark slow upsweep of mountain her eyes returned to the cheery snapping fire and she watched it while gathering courage to get up the room was cold when she did slip her bare feet out upon the stone floor she very quickly put them back under the warm blankets and she was still in bed trying to pluck up her courage when with a knock on the door and a cheerful greeting florence entered carrying steaming hot water  good mawnin miss hammond hope you slept well you sure were tired last night i imagine youll find this old rancho house as cold as a barn itll warm up directly als gone with the boys and bill were to ride down on the range after a while when your baggage comes  florence wore a woolen blouse with a scarf round her neck a short corduroy divided skirt and boots and while she talked she energetically heaped up the burning wood in the fireplace and laid madelines clothes at the foot of the bed and heated a rug and put that on the floor by the bedside and lastly with a sweet direct smile she said  al told meand i sure saw myselfthat you werent used to being without your maid will you let me help you  thank you i am going to be my own maid for a while i expect i do appear a very helpless individual but really i do not feel so perhaps i have had just a little too much waiting on  all right breakfast will be ready soon and after that well look about the place  madeline was charmed with the old spanish house and the more she saw of it the more she thought what a delightful home it could be made all the doors opened into a courtyard or patio as florence called it the house was low in the shape of a rectangle and so immense in size that madeline wondered if it had been a spanish barracks many of the rooms were dark without windows and they were empty others were full of ranchers implements and sacks of grain and bales of hay florence called these last alfalfa the house itself appeared strong and well preserved and it was very picturesque but in the livingrooms were only the barest necessities and these were worn out and comfortless  however when madeline went outdoors she forgot the cheerless bare interior florence led the way out on a porch and waved a hand at a vast colored void thats what bill likes she said  at first madeline could not tell what was sky and what was land the immensity of the scene stunned her faculties of conception she sat down in one of the old rockingchairs and looked and looked and knew that she was not grasping the reality of what stretched wondrously before her  were up at the edge of the foothills florence said you remember we rode around the northern end of the mountain range well thats behind us now and you look down across the line into arizona and mexico that long slope of gray is the head of the san bernardino valley straight across you see the black chiricahua mountains and away down to the south the guadalupe mountains that awful red gulf between is the desert and far far beyond the dim blue peaks are the sierra madres in mexico  madeline listened and gazed with straining eyes and wondered if this was only a stupendous mirage and why it seemed so different from all else that she had seen and so endless so baffling so grand  itll sure take you a little while to get used to being up high and seeing so much explained florence thats the secretwere up high the air is clear and theres the whole bare world beneath us dont it somehow rest you well it will now see those specks in the valley they are stations little towns the railroad goes down that way the largest speck is chiricahua its over forty miles by trail here round to the north you can see don carloss rancho hes fifteen miles off and i sure wish he were a thousand that little green square about halfway between here and don carlosthats als ranch just below us are the adobe houses of the mexicans theres a church too and here to the left you see stillwells corrals and bunkhouses and his stables all falling to pieces the ranch has gone to ruin all the ranches are going to ruin but most of them are little onehorse affairs and heresee that cloud of dust down in the valley its the roundup the boys are there and the cattle wait ill get the glasses  by their aid madeline saw in the foreground a great dense herd of cattle with dark thick streams and dotted lines of cattle leading in every direction she saw streaks and clouds of dust running horses and a band of horses grazing and she descried horsemen standing still like sentinels and others in action  the roundup i want to know all about itto see it declared madeline please tell me what it means what its for and then take me down there  its sure a sight miss hammond ill be glad to take you down but i fancy youll not want to go close few eastern people who regularly eat their choice cuts of roast beef and porterhouse have any idea of the open range and the struggle cattle have to live and the hard life of cowboys itll sure open your eyes miss hammond im glad you care to know your brother would have made a big success in this cattle business if it hadnt been for crooked work by rival ranchers hell make it yet in spite of them  indeed he shall replied madeline but tell me please all about the roundup  well in the first place every cattleman has to have a brand to identify his stock without it no cattleman nor half a hundred cowboys if he had so many could ever recognize all the cattle in a big herd there are no fences on our ranges they are all open to everybody some day i hope well be rich enough to fence a range the different herds graze together every calf has to be caught if possible and branded with the mark of its mother thats no easy job a maverick is an unbranded calf that has been weaned and shifts for itself the maverick then belongs to the man who finds it and brands it these little calves that lose their mothers sure have a cruel time of it many of them die then the coyotes and wolves and lions prey on them every year we have two big roundups but the boys do some branding all the year a calf should be branded as soon as its found this is a safeguard against cattlethieves we dont have the rustling of herds and bunches of cattle like we used to but theres always the calfthief and always will be as long as theres cattleraising the thieves have a good many cunning tricks they kill the calfs mother or slit the calfs tongue so it cant suck and so loses its mother they steal and hide a calf and watch it till its big enough to fare for itself and then brand it they make imperfect brands and finish them at a later time  we have our big roundup in the fall when theres plenty of grass and water and all the ridingstock as well as the cattle are in fine shape the cattlemen in the valley meet with their cowboys and drive in all the cattle they can find then they brand and cut out each mans herd and drive it toward home then they go on up or down the valley make another camp and drive in more cattle it takes weeks there are so many greasers with little bands of stock and they are crafty and greedy bill says he knows greaser cowboys vaqueros who never owned a steer or a cow and now theyve got growing herds the same might be said of more than one white cowboy but theres not as much of that as there used to be  and the horses i want to know about them said madeline when florence paused  oh the cowponies well they sure are interesting broncos the boys call them wild theyre wilder than the steers they have to chase bills got broncos heah that never have been broken and never will be and not every boy can ride them either the vaqueros have the finest horses don carlos has a black that id give anything to own and he has other fine stock gene stewarts big roan is a mexican horse the swiftest and proudest i ever saw i was up on him once andoh he can run he likes a woman too and thats sure something i want in a horse i heard al and bill talking at breakfast about a horse for you they were wrangling bill wanted you to have one and al another it was funny to hear them finally they left the choice to me until the roundup is over then i suppose every cowboy on the range will offer you his best mount come lets go out to the corrals and look over the few horses left  for madeline the morning hours flew by with a goodly part of the time spent on the porch gazing out over that everchanging vista at noon a teamster drove up with her trunks then while florence helped the mexican woman get lunch madeline unpacked part of her effects and got out things for which she would have immediate need after lunch she changed her dress for a ridinghabit and going outside found florence waiting with the horses  the western girls clear eyes seemed to take stock of madelines appearance in one swift inquisitive glance and then shone with pleasure  you sure lookyoure a picture miss hammond that ridingoutfit is a new one what it d look like on me or another woman i cant imagine but on you itsits stunning bill wont let you go within a mile of the cowboys if they see you thatll be the finish of the roundup  while they rode down the slope florence talked about the open ranges of new mexico and arizona  water is scarce she said if bill could afford to pipe water down from the mountains hed have the finest ranch in the valley  she went on to tell that the climate was mild in winter and hot in summer warm sunshiny days prevailed nearly all the year round some summers it rained and occasionally there would be a dry year the dreaded ano seco of the mexicans rain was always expected and prayed for in the midsummer months and when it came the gramagrass sprang up making the valleys green from mountain to mountain the intersecting valleys ranging between the long slope of foothills afforded the best pasture for cattle and these were jealously sought by the mexicans who had only small herds to look after stillwells cowboys were always chasing these vaqueros off land that belonged to stillwell he owned twenty thousand acres of unfenced land adjoining the open range don carlos possessed more acreage than that and his cattle were always mingling with stillwells and in turn don carloss vaqueros were always chasing stillwells cattle away from the mexicans wateringplace bad feeling had been manifested for years and now relations were strained to the breakingpoint  as madeline rode along she made good use of her eyes the soil was sandy and porous and she understood why the rain and water from the few springs disappeared so quickly at a little distance the gramagrass appeared thick but near at hand it was seen to be sparse bunches of greasewood and cactus plants were interspersed here and there in the grass what surprised madeline was the fact that though she and florence had seemed to be riding quite awhile they had apparently not drawn any closer to the roundup the slope of the valley was noticeable only after some miles had been traversed looking forward madeline imagined the valley only a few miles wide she would have been sure she could walk her horse across it in an hour yet that black bold range of chiricahua mountains was distant a long days journey for even a hardriding cowboy it was only by looking back that madeline could grasp the true relation of things she could not be deceived by distance she had covered  gradually the black dots enlarged and assumed shape of cattle and horses moving round a great dusty patch in another halfhour madeline rode behind florence to the outskirts of the scene of action they drew rein near a huge wagon in the neighborhood of which were more than a hundred horses grazing and whistling and trotting about and lifting heads to watch the newcomers four cowboys stood mounted guard over this drove of horses perhaps a quarter of a mile farther out was a dusty melee a roar of tramping hoofs filled madelines ears the lines of marching cattle had merged into a great moving herd half obscured by dust  i can make little of what is going on said madeline i want to go closer  they trotted across half the intervening distance and when florence halted again madeline was still not satisfied and asked to be taken nearer this time before they reined in again al hammond saw them and wheeled his horse in their direction he yelled something which madeline did not understand and then halted them  close enough he called and in the din his voice was not very clear its not safe wild steers im glad you came girls majesty what do you think of that bunch of cattle  madeline could scarcely reply what she thought for the noise and dust and ceaseless action confused her  theyre milling al said florence  we just rounded them up theyre milling and thats bad the vaqueros are hard drivers they beat us all hollow and we drove some too he was wet with sweat black with dust and out of breath im off now flo my sister will have enough of this in about two minutes take her back to the wagon ill tell bill youre here and run in whenever i get a minute  the bawling and bellowing the crackling of horns and pounding of hoofs the dusty whirl of cattle and the flying cowboys disconcerted madeline and frightened her a little but she was intensely interested and meant to stay there until she saw for herself what that strife of sound and action meant when she tried to take in the whole scene she did not make out anything clearly and she determined to see it little by little  will you stay longer asked florence and receiving an affirmative reply she warned madeline if a runaway steer or angry cow comes this way let your horse go hell get out of the way  that lent the situation excitement and madeline became absorbed the great mass of cattle seemed to be eddying like a whirlpool and from that madeline understood the significance of the range word milling but when madeline looked at one end of the herd she saw cattle standing still facing outward and calves cringing close in fear the motion of the cattle slowed from the inside of the herd to the outside and gradually ceased the roar and tramp of hoofs and crack of horns and thump of heads also ceased in degree but the bawling and bellowing continued while she watched the herd spread grew less dense and stragglers appeared to be about to bolt through the line of mounted cowboys  from that moment so many things happened and so swiftly that madeline could not see a tenth of what was going on within eyesight it seemed horsemen darted into the herd and drove out cattle madeline pinned her gaze on one cowboy who rode a white horse and was chasing a steer he whirled a lasso around his head and threw it the rope streaked out and the loop caught the leg of the steer the white horse stopped with wonderful suddenness and the steer slid in the dust quick as a flash the cowboy was out of the saddle and grasping the legs of the steer before it could rise he tied them with a rope it had all been done almost as quickly as thought another man came with what madeline divined was a brandingiron he applied it to the flank of the steer then it seemed the steer was up with a jump wildly looking for some way to run and the cowboy was circling his lasso madeline saw fires in the background with a man in charge evidently heating the irons then this same cowboy roped a heifer which bawled lustily when the hot iron seared its hide madeline saw the smoke rising from the touch of the iron and the sight made her shrink and want to turn away but she resolutely fought her sensitiveness she had never been able to bear the sight of any animal suffering the rough work in mens lives was as a sealed book to her and now for some reason beyond her knowledge she wanted to see and hear and learn some of the everyday duties that made up those lives  look miss hammond theres don carlos said florence look at that black horse  madeleine saw a darkfaced mexican riding by he was too far away for her to distinguish his features but he reminded her of an italian brigand he bestrode a magnificent horse  stillwell rode up to the girls then and greeted them in his big voice  right in the thick of it hey wal thets sure fine im glad to see miss majesty thet you aint afraid of a little dust or smell of burnin hide an hair  couldnt you brand the calves without hurting them asked madeline  haw haw why they aint hurt none they jest bawl for their mammas sometimes though we hev to hurt one jest to find which is his mamma  i want to know how you tell what brand to put on those calves that are separated from their mothers asked madeline  thets decided by the roundup bosses ive one boss an don carlos has one they decide everything an they hev to be obyed theres nick steele my boss watch him hes ridin a bay in among the cattle there he orders the calves an steers to be cut out then the cowboys do the cuttin out an the brandin we try to divide up the mavericks as near as possible  at this juncture madelines brother joined the group evidently in search of stillwell  bill nels just rode in he said  good we sure need him any news of danny mains  no nels said he lost the trail when he got on hard ground  wal wal say al your sister is sure takin to the roundup an the boys are gettin wise see thet sunofagun ambrose cuttin capers all around hell sure do his prettiest ambrose is a ladies man he thinks  the two men and florence joined in a little pleasant teasing of madeline and drew her attention to what appeared to be really unnecessary feats of horsemanship all made in her vicinity the cowboys evinced their interest in covert glances while recoiling a lasso or while passing to and fro it was all too serious for madeline to be amused at that moment she did not care to talk she sat her horse and watched  the lithe dark vaqueros fascinated her they were here there everywhere with lariats flying horses plunging back jerking calves and yearlings to the grass they were cruel to their mounts cruel to their cattle madeline winced as the great silver rowels of the spurs went plowing into the flanks of their horses she saw these spurs stained with blood choked with hair she saw the vaqueros break the legs of calves and let them lie till a white cowboy came along and shot them calves were jerked down and dragged many yards steers were pulled by one leg these vaqueros were the most superb horsemen madeline had ever seen and she had seen the cossacks and tatars of the russian steppes they were swift graceful daring they never failed to catch a running steer and the lassoes always went true what sharp dashes the horses made and wheelings here and there and sudden stops and how they braced themselves to withstand the shock  the cowboys likewise showed wonderful horsemanship and reckless as they were madeline imagined she saw consideration for steed and cattle that was wanting in the vaqueros they changed mounts oftener than the mexican riders and the horses they unsaddled for fresh ones were not so spent so wet so covered with lather it was only after an hour or more of observation that madeline began to realize the exceedingly toilsome and dangerous work cowboys had to perform there was little or no rest for them they were continually among wild and vicious and widehorned steers in many instances they owed their lives to their horses the danger came mostly when the cowboy leaped off to tie and brand a calf he had thrown some of the cows charged with lowered twisting horns time and again madelines heart leaped to her throat for fear a man would be gored one cowboy roped a calf that bawled loudly its mother dashed in and just missed the kneeling cowboy as he rolled over then he had to run and he could not run very fast he was bowlegged and appeared awkward madeline saw another cowboy thrown and nearly run over by a plunging steer his horse bolted as if it intended to leave the range then close by madeline a big steer went down at the end of a lasso the cowboy who had thrown it nimbly jumped down and at that moment his horse began to rear and prance and suddenly to lower his head close to the ground and kick high he ran round in a circle the fallen steer on the taut lasso acting as a pivot the cowboy loosed the rope from the steer and then was dragged about on the grass it was almost frightful for madeline to see that cowboy go at his horse but she recognized the mastery and skill then two horses came into collision on the run one horse went down the rider of the other was unseated and was kicked before he could get up this fellow limped to his mount and struck at him while the horse showed his teeth in a vicious attempt to bite  all the while this ceaseless activity was going on there was a strange uproarbawl and bellow the shock of heavy bodies meeting and falling the shrill jabbering of the vaqueros and the shouts and banterings of the cowboys they took sharp orders and replied in jest they went about this stern toil as if it were a game to be played in good humor one sang a rollicking song another whistled another smoked a cigarette the sun was hot and they like their horses were dripping with sweat the characteristic red faces had taken on so much dust that cowboys could not be distinguished from vaqueros except by the difference in dress blood was not wanting on tireless hands the air was thick oppressive rank with the smell of cattle and of burning hide  madeline began to sicken she choked with dust was almost stifled by the odor but that made her all the more determined to stay there florence urged her to come away or at least move back out of the worst of it stillwell seconded florence madeline however smilingly refused then her brother said here this is making you sick youre pale and she replied that she intended to stay until the days work ended al gave her a strange look and made no more comment the kindly stillwell then began to talk  miss majesty youre seein the life of the cattleman an cowboythe real thingsame as it was in the early days the ranchers in texas an some in arizona hev took on style newfangled idees thet are good an i wish we could follow them but weve got to stick to the oldfashioned openrange roundup it looks cruel to you i can see thet wal mebbe so mebbe so them greasers are cruel thets certain fer thet matter i never seen a greaser who wasnt cruel but i reckon all the strenuous work youve seen today aint any tougher than most any day of a cowboys life long hours on hossback poor grub sleepin on the ground lonesome watches dust an sun an wind an thirst day in an day out all the year roundthets what a cowboy has  look at nels there see what little hair he has is snowwhite hes red an thin an hardburned up you notice thet hump of his shoulders an his hands when he gets closejest take a peep at his hands nels cant pick up a pin he cant hardly button his shirt or untie a knot in his rope he looks sixty yearsan old man wal nels aint seen forty hes a young man but hes seen a lifetime fer every year miss majesty it was arizona thet made nels what he is the arizona desert an the work of a cowman hes seen ridin at canyon diablo an the verdi an tonto basin he knows every mile of aravaipa valley an the pinaleno country hes ranged from tombstone to douglas he hed shot bad white men an bad greasers before he was twentyone hes seen some life nels has my sixty years aint nothin my early days in the staked plains an on the border with apaches aint nothin to what nels has seen an lived through hes just come to be part of the desert you might say hes stone an fire an silence an cactus an force hes a man miss majesty a wonderful man rough hell seem to you wal ill show you pieces of quartz from the mountains back of my ranch an theyre thet rough theyd cut your hands but theres pure gold in them an so it is with nels an many of these cowboys  an theres pricemonty price monty stands fer montana where he hails from take a good look at him miss majesty hes been hurt i reckon thet accounts fer him bein without hoss or rope an thet limp wal hes been ripped a little its sure rare an seldom thet a cowboy gets foul of one of them thousands of sharp horns but it does happen  madeline saw a very short wizened little man ludicrously bowlegged with a face the color and hardness of a burnedout cinder he was hobbling by toward the wagon and one of his short crooked legs dragged  not much to look at is he went on stillwell wal i know its natural thet were all best pleased by good looks in any one even a man it hednt ought to be thet way monty price looks like hell but appearances are sure deceivin monty saw years of ridin along the missouri bottoms the big prairies where theres high grass an sometimes fires in montana they have blizzards that freeze cattle standin in their tracks an hosses freeze to death they tell me thet a drivin sleet in the face with the mercury forty below is somethin to ride against you cant get monty to say much about cold all you hev to do is to watch him how he hunts the sun it never gets too hot fer monty wal i reckon he was a little more prepossessin once the story thet come to us about monty is this he got caught out in a prairie fire an could hev saved himself easy but there was a lone ranch right in the line of fire an monty knowed the rancher was away an his wife an baby was home he knowed too the way the wind was thet the ranchhouse would burn it was a long chance he was takin but he went over put the woman up behind him wrapped the baby an his hosss haid in a wet blanket an rode away thet was sure some ride ive heerd but the fire ketched monty at the last the woman fell an was lost an then his hoss an monty ran an walked an crawled through the fire with thet baby an he saved it monty was never much good as a cowboy after thet he couldnt hold no jobs wal hell have one with me as long as i have a steer left     vi a gift and a purchase  for a week the scene of the roundup lay within ridingdistance of the ranchhouse and madeline passed most of this time in the saddle watching the strenuous labors of the vaqueros and cowboys she overestimated her strength and more than once had to be lifted from her horse stillwells pleasure in her attendance gave place to concern he tried to persuade her to stay away from the roundup and florence grew even more solicitous  madeline however was not moved by their entreaties she grasped only dimly the truth of what it was she was learningsomething infinitely more than the rounding up of cattle by cowboys and she was loath to lose an hour of her opportunity  her brother looked out for her as much as his duties permitted but for several days he never once mentioned her growing fatigue and the strain of excitement or suggested that she had better go back to the house with florence many times she felt the drawing power of his keen blue eyes on her face and at these moments she sensed more than brotherly regard he was watching her studying her weighing her and the conviction was vaguely disturbing it was disquieting for madeline to think that alfred might have guessed her trouble from time to time he brought cowboys to her and introduced them and laughed and jested trying to make the ordeal less embarrassing for these men so little used to women  before the week was out however alfred found occasion to tell her that it would be wiser for her to let the roundup go on without gracing it further with her presence he said it laughingly nevertheless he was serious and when madeline turned to him in surprise he said bluntly  i dont like the way don carlos follows you around bills afraid that nels or ambrose or one of the cowboys will take a fall out of the mexican theyre itching for the chance of course dear its absurd to you but its true  absurd it certainly was yet it served to show madeline how intensely occupied she had been with her own feelings roused by the tumult and toil of the roundup she recalled that don carlos had been presented to her and that she had not liked his dark striking face with its bold prominent glittering eyes and sinister lines and she had not liked his suave sweet insinuating voice or his subtle manner with its slow bows and gestures she had thought he looked handsome and dashing on the magnificent black horse however now that alfreds words made her think she recalled that wherever she had been in the field the noble horse with his silvermounted saddle and his dark rider had been always in her vicinity  don carlos has been after florence for a long time said alfred hes not a young man by any means hes fifty bill says but you can seldom tell a mexicans age from his looks don carlos is well educated and a man we know very little about mexicans of his stamp dont regard women as we white men do now my dear beautiful sister from new york i havent much use for don carlos but i dont want nels or ambrose to make a wild throw with a rope and pull the don off his horse so you had better ride up to the house and stay there  alfred you are joking teasing me said madeline indeed not replied alfred how about it flo florence replied that the cowboys would upon the slightest provocation treat don carlos with less ceremony and gentleness than a roped steer old bill stillwell came up to be importuned by alfred regarding the conduct of cowboys on occasion and he not only corroborated the assertion but added emphasis and evidence of his own  an miss majesty he concluded i reckon if gene stewart was ridin fer me thet grinnin greaser would hev hed a bump in the dust before now  madeline had been wavering between sobriety and laughter until stillwells mention of his ideal of cowboy chivalry decided in favor of the laughter  i am not convinced but i surrender she said you have only some occult motive for driving me away i am sure that handsome don carlos is being unjustly suspected but as i have seen a little of cowboys singular imagination and gallantry i am rather inclined to fear their possibilities so goodby  then she rode with florence up the long gray slope to the ranchhouse that night she suffered from excessive weariness which she attributed more to the strange working of her mind than to riding and sitting her horse morning however found her in no disposition to rest it was not activity that she craved or excitement or pleasure an unerring instinct rising dear from the thronging sensations of the last few days told her that she had missed something in life it could not have been love for she loved brother sister parents friends it could not have been consideration for the poor the unfortunate the hapless she had expressed her sympathy for these by giving freely it could not have been pleasure culture travel society wealth position fame for these had been hers all her life whatever this something was she had baffling intimations of it hopes that faded on the verge of realizations haunting promises that were unfulfilled whatever it was it had remained hidden and unknown at home and here in the west it began to allure and drive her to discovery therefore she could not rest she wanted to go and see she was no longer chasing phantoms it was a hunt for treasure that held aloof as intangible as the substance of dreams  that morning she spoke a desire to visit the mexican quarters lying at the base of the foothills florence protested that this was no place to take madeline but madeline insisted and it required only a few words and a persuading smile to win florence over  from the porch the cluster of adobe houses added a picturesque touch of color and contrast to the waste of gray valley near at hand they proved the enchantment lent by distance they were old crumbling broken down squalid a few goats climbed around upon them a few mangy dogs barked announcement of visitors and then a troop of halfnaked dirty ragged children ran out they were very shy and at first retreated in affright but kind words and smiles gained their confidence and then they followed in a body gathering a quota of new children at each house madeline at once conceived the idea of doing something to better the condition of these poor mexicans and with this in mind she decided to have a look indoors she fancied she might have been an apparition judging from the effect her presence had upon the first woman she encountered while florence exercised what little spanish she had command of trying to get the women to talk madeline looked about the miserable little rooms and there grew upon her a feeling of sickness which increased as she passed from one house to another she had not believed such squalor could exist anywhere in america the huts reeked with filth vermin crawled over the dirt floors there was absolutely no evidence of water and she believed what florence told herthat these people never bathed there was little evidence of labor idle men and women smoking cigarettes lolled about some silent others jabbering they did not resent the visit of the american women nor did they show hospitality they appeared stupid disease was rampant in these houses when the doors were shut there was no ventilation and even with the doors open madeline felt choked and stifled a powerful penetrating odor pervaded the rooms that were less stifling than others and this odor florence explained came from a liquor the mexicans distilled from a cactus plant here drunkenness was manifest a terrible inert drunkenness that made its victims deathlike  madeline could not extend her visit to the little missionhouse she saw a padre a starved sadfaced man who she instinctively felt was good she managed to mount her horse and ride up to the house but once there she weakened and florence had almost to carry her indoors she fought off a faintness only to succumb to it when alone in her room still she did not entirely lose consciousness and soon recovered to the extent that she did not require assistance  upon the morning after the end of the roundup when she went out on the porch her brother and stillwell appeared to be arguing about the identity of a horse  wal i reckon its my old roan said stillwell shading his eyes with his hand  bill if that isnt stewarts horse my eyes are going back on me replied al its not the color or shapethe distance is too far to judge by that its the motionthe swing  al mebbe youre right but they aint no rider up on thet hoss flo fetch my glass  florence went into the house while madeline tried to discover the object of attention presently far up the gray hollow along a foothill she saw dust and then the dark moving figure of a horse she was watching when florence returned with the glass bill took a long look adjusted the glasses carefully and tried again  wal i hate to admit my eyes are gettin pore but i guess ill hev to thets gene stewarts hoss saddled an comin at a fast clip without a rider its amazin strange an some in keepin with other things concernin gene  give me the glass said al yes i was right bill the horse is not frightened hes coming steadily hes got something on his mind  thets a trained hoss al he has more sense than some men i know take a look with the glasses up the hollow see anybody  no  swing up over the foothillswhere the trail leads higheralong thet ridge where the rocks begin see anybody  by jove billtwo horses but i cant make out much for dust they are climbing fast one horse gone among the rocks therethe others gone what do you make of that  wal i cant make no more n you but ill bet we know somethin soon fer genes hoss is comin faster as he nears the ranch  the wide hollow sloping up into the foothills lay open to unobstructed view and less than half a mile distant madeline saw the riderless horse coming along the white trail at a rapid canter she watched him recalling the circumstances under which she had first seen him and then his wild flight through the dimly lighted streets of el cajon out into the black night she thrilled again and believed she would never think of that starry nights adventure without a thrill she watched the horse and felt more than curiosity a shrill piercing whistle pealed in  wal hes seen us thets sure said bill  the horse neared the corrals disappeared into a lane and then breaking his gait again thundered into the inclosure and pounded to a halt some twenty yards from where stillwell waited for him  one look at him at close range in the clear light of day was enough for madeline to award him a blue ribbon over all horses even her prizewinner white stockings the cowboys great steed was no lithe slenderbodied mustang he was a charger almost tremendous of build with a black coat faintly mottled in gray and it shone like polished glass in the sun evidently he had been carefully dressed down for this occasion for there was no dust on him nor a kink in his beautiful mane nor a mark on his glossy hide  come hyar you sonofagun said stillwell  the horse dropped his head snorted and came obediently up he was neither shy nor wild he poked a friendly nose at stillwell and then looked at al and the women unhooking the stirrups from the pommel stillwell let them fall and began to search the saddle for something which he evidently expected to find presently from somewhere among the trappings he produced a folded bit of paper and after scrutinizing it handed it to al  addressed to you an ill bet you two bits i know whats in it he said  alfred unfolded the letter read it and then looked at stillwell  bill youre a pretty good guesser genes made for the border he sent the horse by somebody no names mentioned and wants my sister to have him if she will accept  any mention of danny mains asked the rancher  not a word  thets bad gened know about danny if anybody did but hes a closemouthed cuss so hes sure hittin for mexico wonder if dannys goin too wal theres two of the best cowmen i ever seen gone to hell an im sorry  with that he bowed his head and grumbling to himself went into the house alfred lifted the reins over the head of the horse and leading him to madeline slipped the knot over her arm and placed the letter in her hand  majesty id accept the horse he said stewart is only a cowboy now and as tough as any ive known but he comes of a good family he was a college man and a gentleman once he went to the bad out here like so many fellows go like i nearly did then he had told me about his sister and mother he cared a good deal for them i think he has been a source of unhappiness to them it was mostly when he was reminded of this in some way that hed get drunk i have always stuck to him and i would do so yet if i had the chance you can see bill is heartbroken about danny mains and stewart i think he rather hoped to get good news theres not much chance of them coming back now at least not in the case of stewart this giving up his horse means hes going to join the rebel forces across the border what wouldnt i give to see that cowboy break loose on a bunch of greasers oh damn the luck i beg your pardon majesty but im upset too im sorry about stewart i liked him pretty well before he thrashed that coyote of a sheriff pat hawe and afterward i guess i liked him more you read the letter sister and accept the horse  in silence madeline bent her gaze from her brothers face to the letter  friend alim sending my horse down to you because im going away and havent the nerve to take him where hed get hurt or fall into strange hands  if you think its all right why give him to your sister with my respects but if you dont like the idea al or if she wont have him then hes for you im not forgetting your kindness to me even if i never showed it and al my horse has never felt a quirt or a spur and id like to think youd never hurt him im hoping your sister will take him shell be good to him and she can afford to take care of him and while im waiting to be plugged by a greaser bullet if i happen to have a picture in mind of how shell look upon my horse why man its not going to make any difference to you she neednt ever know it between you and me al dont let her or flo ride alone over don carloss way if i had time i could tell you something about that slick greaser and tell your sister if theres ever any reason for her to run away from anybody when shes up on that roan just let her lean over and yell in his ear shell find herself riding the wind so long  gene stewart   madeline thoughtfully folded the letter and murmured how he must love his horse  well i should say so replied alfred flo will tell you shes the only person gene ever let ride that horse unless as bill thinks the little mexican girl bonita rode him out of el cajon the other night well sister mine how about itwill you accept the horse  assuredly and very happy indeed am i to get him al you said i think that mr stewart named him after mesaw my nickname in the new york paper  yes  well i will not change his name but al how shall i ever climb up on him hes taller than i am what a giant of a horse oh look at himhes nosing my hand i really believe he understood what i said al did you ever see such a splendid head and such beautiful eyes they are so large and dark and softand human oh i am a fickle woman for i am forgetting white stockings  ill gamble hell make you forget any other horse said alfred youll have to get on him from the porch  as madeline was not dressed for the saddle she did not attempt to mount  come majestyhow strange that soundswe must get acquainted you have now a new owner a very severe young woman who will demand loyalty from you and obedience and some day after a decent period she will expect love  madeline led the horse to and fro and was delighted with his gentleness she discovered that he did not need to be led he came at her call followed her like a pet dog rubbed his black muzzle against her sometimes at the turns in their walk he lifted his head and with ears forward looked up the trail by which he had come and beyond the foothills he was looking over the range some one was calling to him perhaps from beyond the mountains madeline liked him the better for that memory and pitied the wayward cowboy who had parted with his only possession for very love of it  that afternoon when alfred lifted madeline to the back of the big roan she felt high in the air  well have a run out to the mesa said her brother as he mounted keep a tight rein on him and ease up when you want him to go faster but dont yell in his ear unless you want florence and me to see you disappear on the horizon  he trotted out of the yard down by the corrals to come out on the edge of a gray open flat that stretched several miles to the slope of a mesa florence led and madeline saw that she rode like a cowboy alfred drew on to her side leaving madeline in the rear then the leading horses broke into a gallop they wanted to run and madeline felt with a thrill that she would hardly be able to keep majesty from running even if she wanted to he sawed on the tight bridle as the others drew away and broke from pace to gallop then florence put her horse into a run alfred turned and called to madeline to come along  this will never do they are running away from us said madeline and she eased up her hold on the bridle something happened beneath her just then she did not know at first exactly what as much as she had been on horseback she had never ridden at a running gait in new york it was not decorous or safe so when majesty lowered and stretched and changed the stiff jolting gallop for a wonderful smooth gliding run it required madeline some moments to realize what was happening it did not take long for her to see the distance diminishing between her and her companions still they had gotten a goodly start and were far advanced she felt the steady even rush of the wind it amazed her to find how easily comfortably she kept to the saddle the experience was new the one fault she had heretofore found with riding was the violent shakingup in this instance she experienced nothing of that kind no strain no necessity to hold on with a desperate awareness of work she had never felt the wind in her face the whip of a horses mane the buoyant level spring of a tanning gait it thrilled her exhilarated her fired her blood suddenly she found herself alive throbbing and inspired by she knew not what she loosened the bridle and leaning far forward she cried oh you splendid fellow run  she heard from under her a sudden quick clattering roar of hoofs and she swayed back with the wonderfully swift increase in majestys speed the wind stung her face howled in her ears tore at her hair the gray plain swept by on each side and in front seemed to be waving toward her in her blurred sight florence and alfred appeared to be coming back but she saw presently upon nearer view that majesty was overhauling the other horses was going to pass them indeed he did pass them shooting by so as almost to make them appear standing still and he ran on not breaking his gait till he reached the steep side of the mesa where he slowed down and stopped  glorious exclaimed madeline she was all in a blaze and every muscle and nerve of her body tingled and quivered her hands as she endeavored to put up the loosened strands of hair trembled and failed of their accustomed dexterity then she faced about and waited for her companions  alfred reached her first laughing delighted yet also a little anxious  holy smoke but cant he run did he bolt on you  no i called in his ear replied madeline  so that was it thats the woman of you and forbidden fruit flo said shed do it the minute she was on him majesty you can ride see if flo doesnt say so  the western girl came up then with her pleasure bright in her face  it was just great to see you how your hair burned in the wind al she sure can ride oh im so glad i was a little afraid and that horse isnt he grand cant he run  alfred led the way up the steep zigzag trail to the top of the mesa madeline saw a beautiful flat surface of short grass level as a floor she uttered a little cry of wonder and enthusiasm  al what a place for golf this would be the finest links in the world  well ive thought of that myself he replied the only trouble would becould anybody stop looking at the scenery long enough to hit a ball majesty look  and then it seemed that madeline was confronted by a spectacle too sublime and terrible for her gaze the immensity of this redridged deepgulfed world descending incalculable distances refused to be grasped and awed her shocked her  once majesty when i first came out west i was down and outdetermined to end it all said alfred and happened to climb up here looking for a lonely place to die when i saw that i changed my mind  madeline was silent she remained so during the ride around the rim of the mesa and down the steep trail this time alfred and florence failed to tempt her into a race she had been awestruck she had been exalted she had been confounded and she recovered slowly without divining exactly what had come to her  she reached the ranchhouse far behind her companions and at suppertime was unusually thoughtful later when they assembled on the porch to watch the sunset stillwells humorous complainings inspired the inception of an idea which flashed up in her mind swift as lightning and then by listening sympathetically she encouraged him to recite the troubles of a poor cattleman they were many and long and interesting and rather numbing to the life of her inspired idea  mr stillwell could ranching here on a large scale with uptodate methods be madewell not profitable exactly but to payto run without loss she asked determined to kill her newborn idea at birth or else give it breath and hope of life  wal i reckon it could he replied with a short laugh itd sure be a moneymaker why with all my bad luck an poor equipment ive lived pretty well an paid my debts an havent really lost any money except the original outlay i reckon thets sunk fer good  would you sellif some one would pay your price  miss majesty id jump at the chance yet somehow id hate to leave hyar id jest be fool enough to go sink the money in another ranch  would don carlos and these other mexicans sell  they sure would the don has been after me fer years wantin to sell thet old rancho of his an these herders in the valley with their stray cattle theyd fall daid at sight of a little money  please tell me mr stillwell exactly what you would do here if you had unlimited means went on madeline  good lud ejaculated the rancher and started so he dropped his pipe then with his clumsy huge fingers he refilled it relighted it took a few long pulls puffed great clouds of smoke and squaring round hands on his knees he looked at madeline with piercing intentness his hard face began to relax and soften and wrinkle into a smile  wal miss majesty it jest makes my old heart warm up to think of sich a thing i dreamed a lot when i first come hyar what would i do if i hed unlimited money listen id buy out don carlos an the greasers id give a job to every good cowman in this country id make them prosper as i prospered myself id buy all the good horses on the ranges id fence twenty thousand acres of the best grazin id drill fer water in the valley id pipe water down from the mountains id dam up that draw out there a milelong dam from hill to hill would give me a big lake an hevin an eye fer beauty id plant cottonwoods around it id fill that lake full of fish id put in the biggest field of alfalfa in the southwest id plant fruittrees an garden id tear down them old corrals an barns an bunkhouses to build new ones id make this old rancho some comfortable an fine id put in grass an flowers all around an bring young pinetrees down from the mountains an when all thet was done id sit in my chair an smoke an watch the cattle stringin in fer water an stragglin back into the valley an i see the cowboys ridin easy an heah them singin in their bunks an thet red sun out there wouldnt set on a happier man in the world than bill stillwell last of the old cattlemen  madeline thanked the rancher and then rather abruptly retired to her room where she felt no restraint to hide the force of that wonderful idea now fullgrown and tenacious and alluring  upon the next day late in the afternoon she asked alfred if it would be safe for her to ride out to the mesa  ill go with you he said gaily  dear fellow i want to go alone she replied  ah alfred exclaimed suddenly serious he gave her just a quick glance then turned away go ahead i think its safe ill make it safe by sitting here with my glass and keeping an eye on you be careful coming down the trail let the horse pick his way thats all  she rode majesty across the wide flat up the zigzag trail across the beautiful grassy level to the far rim of the mesa and not till then did she lift her eyes to face the southwest  madeline looked from the gray valley at her feet to the blue sierra madres goldtipped in the setting sun her vision embraced in that glance distance and depth and glory hitherto unrevealed to her the gray valley sloped and widened to the black sentinel chiricahuas and beyond was lost in a vast corrugated sweep of earth reddening down to the west where a golden blaze lifted the dark rugged mountains into bold relief the scene had infinite beauty but after madelines first swift allembracing flash of enraptured eyes thought of beauty passed away in that darkening desert there was something illimitable madeline saw the hollow of a stupendous hand she felt a mighty hold upon her heart out of the endless space out of silence and desolation and mystery and age came slowchanging colored shadows phantoms of peace and they whispered to madeline they whispered that it was a great grim immutable earth that time was eternity that life was fleeting they whispered for her to be a woman to love some one before it was too late to love any one every one to realize the need of work and in doing it to find happiness  she rode back across the mesa and down the trail and once more upon the flat she called to the horse and made him run his spirit seemed to race with hers the wind of his speed blew her hair from its fastenings when he thundered to a halt at the porch steps madeline breathless and disheveled alighted with the mass of her hair tumbling around her  alfred met her and his exclamation and florences rapt eyes shining on her face and stillwells speechlessness made her selfconscious laughing she tried to put up the mass of hair  i mustlook afright she panted  wal you can say what you like replied the old cattleman but i know what i think  madeline strove to attain calmness  my hatand my combswent on the wind i thought my hair would go too there is the evening star i think i am very hungry  and then she gave up trying to be calm and likewise to fasten up her hair which fell again in a golden mass  mr stillwell she began and paused strangely aware of a hurried note a deeper ring in her voice mr stillwell i want to buy your ranchto engage you as my superintendent i want to buy don carloss ranch and other property to the extent say of fifty thousand acres i want you to buy horses and cattlein short to make all those improvements which you said you had so long dreamed of then i have ideas of my own in the development of which i must have your advice and alfreds i intend to better the condition of those poor mexicans in the valley i intend to make life a little more worth living for them and for the cowboys of this range tomorrow we shall talk it all over plan all the business details  madeline turned from the huge everwidening smile that beamed down upon her and held out her hands to her brother  alfred strange is it not my coming out to you nay dont smile i hope i have found myselfmy workmy happinesshere under the light of that western star     vii her majestys rancho  five months brought all that stillwell had dreamed of and so many more changes and improvements and innovations that it was as if a magic touch had transformed the old ranch madeline and alfred and florence had talked over a fitting name and had decided on one chosen by madeline but this instance was the only one in the course of developments in which madelines wishes were not compiled with the cowboys named the new ranch her majestys rancho stillwell said the names cowboys bestowed were felicitous and as unchangeable as the everlasting hills florence went over to the enemy and alfred laughing at madelines protest declared the cowboys had elected her queen of the ranges and that there was no help for it so the name stood her majestys rancho  the april sun shone down upon a slowrising green knoll that nestled in the lee of the foothills and seemed to center bright rays upon the long ranchhouse which gleamed snowwhite from the level summit the grounds around the house bore no semblance to eastern lawns or parks there had been no landscapegardening stillwell had just brought water and grass and flowers and plants to the knolltop and there had left them as it were to follow nature his idea may have been crude but the result was beautiful under that hot sun and balmy air with cool water daily soaking into the rich soil a green covering sprang into life and everywhere upon it as if by magic many colored flowers rose in the sweet air pale wild flowers lavender daisies fragile bluebells white fourpetaled lilies like eastern mayflowers and golden poppies deep sunset gold color of the west bloomed in happy confusion california roses crimson as blood nodded heavy heads and trembled with the weight of bees low down in bare places isolated open to the full power of the sun blazed the vermilion and magenta blossoms of cactus plants  green slopes led all the way down to where new adobe barns and sheds had been erected and wide corrals stretched highbarred fences down to the great squares of alfalfa gently inclining to the gray of the valley the bottom of a dammedup hollow shone brightly with its slowly increasing acreage of water upon which thousands of migratory wildfowl whirred and splashed and squawked as if reluctant to leave this cool wet surprise so new in the long desert journey to the northland quarters for the cowboyscomfortable roomy adobe houses that not even the lamest cowboy dared describe as crampy bunksstood in a row upon a long bench of ground above the lake and down to the edge of the valley the cluster of mexican habitations and the little church showed the touch of the same renewing hand   all that had been left of the old spanish house which had been stillwells home for so long was the bare massive structure and some of this had been cut away for new doors and windows every modern convenience even to hot and cold running water and acetylene light had been installed and the whole interior painted and carpentered and furnished the ideal sought had not been luxury but comfort every door into the patio looked out upon dark rich grass and sweetfaced flowers and every window looked down the green slopes  madelines rooms occupied the west end of the building and comprised four in number all opening out upon the long porch there was a small room for her maid another which she used as an office then her sleepingapartment and lastly the great light chamber which she had liked so well upon first sight and which now simply yet beautifully furnished and containing her favorite books and pictures she had come to love as she had never loved any room at home in the morning the fragrant balmy air blew the white curtains of the open windows at noon the drowsy sultry quiet seemed to creep in for the siesta that was characteristic of the country in the afternoon the westering sun peeped under the porch roof and painted the walls with gold bars that slowly changed to red  madeline hammond cherished a fancy that the transformation she had wrought in the old spanish house and in the people with whom she had surrounded herself great as that transformation had been was as nothing compared to the one wrought in herself she had found an object in life she was busy she worked with her hands as well as mind yet she seemed to have more time to read and think and study and idle and dream than ever before she had seen her brother through his difficulties on the road to all the success and prosperity that he cared for madeline had been a conscientious student of ranching and an apt pupil of stillwell the old cattleman in his simplicity gave her the place in his heart that was meant for the daughter he had never had his pride in her madeline thought was beyond reason or belief or words to tell under his guidance sometimes accompanied by alfred and florence madeline had ridden the ranges and had studied the life and work of the cowboys she had camped on the open range slept under the blinking stars ridden forty miles a day in the face of dust and wind she had taken two wonderful trips down into the desertone trip to chiricahua and from there across the waste of sand and rock and alkali and cactus to the mexican borderline and the other through the aravaipa valley with its deep redwalled canyons and wild fastnesses  this breakingin this training into western ways though she had been a socalled outdoor girl had required great effort and severe pain but the education now past its grades had become a labor of love she had perfect health abounding spirits she was so active hat she had to train herself into taking the midday siesta a custom of the country and imperative during the hot summer months sometimes she looked in her mirror and laughed with sheer joy at sight of the lithe audacious brownfaced flashingeyed creature reflected there it was not so much joy in her beauty as sheer joy of life eastern critics had been wont to call her beautiful in those days when she had been pale and slender and proud and cold she laughed if they could only see her now from the tip of her golden head to her feet she was alive pulsating on fire  sometimes she thought of her parents sister friends of how they had persistently refused to believe she could or would stay in the west they were always asking her to come home and when she wrote which was dutifully often the last thing under the sun that she was likely to mention was the change in her she wrote that she would return to her old home some time of course for a visit and letters such as this brought returns that amused madeline sometimes saddened her she meant to go back east for a while and after that once or twice every year but the initiative was a difficult step from which she shrank once home she would have to make explanations and these would not be understood her fathers business had been such that he could not leave it for the time required for a western trip or else according to his letter he would have come for her mrs hammond could not have been driven to cross the hudson river her unamerican idea of the wilderness westward was that indians still chased buffalo on the outskirts of chicago madelines sister helen had long been eager to come as much from curiosity madeline thought as from sisterly regard and at length madeline concluded that the proof of her breaking permanent ties might better be seen by visiting relatives and friends before she went back east with that in mind she invited helen to visit her during the summer and bring as many friends as she liked                      no slight task indeed was it to oversee the many business details of her majestys rancho and to keep a record of them madeline found the course of business training upon which her father had insisted to be invaluable to her now it helped her to assimilate and arrange the practical details of cattleraising as put forth by the blunt stillwell she split up the great stock of cattle into different herds and when any of these were out running upon the open range she had them closely watched part of the time each herd was kept in an inclosed range fed and watered and carefully handled by a big force of cowboys she employed three cowboy scouts whose sole duty was to ride the ranges searching for stray sick or crippled cattle or motherless calves and to bring these in to be treated and nursed there were two cowboys whose business was to master a pack of russian staghounds and to hunt down the coyotes wolves and lions that preyed upon the herds the better and tamer milch cows were separated from the ranging herds and kept in a pasture adjoining the dairy all branding was done in corrals and calves were weaned from mothercows at the proper time to benefit both the old method of branding and classing that had so shocked madeline had been abandoned and one had been inaugurated whereby cattle and cowboys and horses were spared brutality and injury  madeline established an extensive vegetable farm and she planted orchards the climate was superior to that of california and with abundant water trees and plants and gardens flourished and bloomed in a way wonderful to behold it was with everincreasing pleasure that madeline walked through acres of ground once bare now green and bright and fragrant there were poultryyards and pigpens and marshy quarters for ducks and geese here in the farming section of the ranch madeline found employment for the little colony of mexicans their lives had been as hard and barren as the dry valley where they had lived but as the valley had been transformed by the soft rich touch of water so their lives had been transformed by help and sympathy and work the children were wretched no more and many that had been blind could now see and madeline had become to them a new and blessed virgin  madeline looked abroad over these lands and likened the change in them and those who lived by them to the change in her heart it may have been fancy but the sun seemed to be brighter the sky bluer the wind sweeter certain it was that the deep green of grass and garden was not fancy nor the white and pink of blossom nor the blaze and perfume of flower nor the sheen of lake and the fluttering of newborn leaves where there had been monotonous gray there was now vivid and changing color formerly there had been silence both day and night now during the sunny hours there was music the whistle of prancing stallions pealed in from the grassy ridges innumerable birds had come and like the northwardjourneying ducks they had tarried to stay the song of meadowlark and blackbird and robin familiar to madeline from childhood mingled with the new and strange heartthrobbing song of mockingbird and the piercing blast of the desert eagle and the melancholy moan of turtledove              one april morning madeline sat in her office wrestling with a problem she had problems to solve every day the majority of these were concerned with the management of twentyseven incomprehensible cowboys this particular problem involved ambrose mills who had eloped with her french maid christine  stillwell faced madeline with a smile almost as huge as his bulk  wal miss majesty we ketched them but not before padre marcos had married them all thet speedin in the autoomoobile was jest ascarin of me to death fer nothin i tell you link stevens is crazy about runnin thet car link never hed no sense even with a hoss he aint afraid of the devil hisself if my hair hednt been white it d be white now no more rides in thet thing fer me wal we ketched ambrose an the girl too late but we fetched them back an theyre out there now spoonin sure oblivious to their shameless conduct  stillwell what shall i say to ambrose how shall i punish him he has done wrong to deceive me i never was so surprised in my life christine did not seem to care any more for ambrose than for any of the other cowboys what does my authority amount to i must do something stillwell you must help me  whenever madeline fell into a quandary she had to call upon the old cattleman no man ever held a position with greater pride than stillwell but he had been put to tests that steeped him in humility here he scratched his head in great perplexity  doggone the luck whats this elopin bizness to do with cattleraisin i dont know nothin but cattle miss majesty its amazin strange what these cowboys hev come to i never seen no cowboys like these weve got hyar now i dont know them any more they dress swell an read books an some of them hev actooly stopped cussin an drinkin i aint sayin all this is against them why now theyre jest the finest bunch of cowpunchers i ever seen or dreamed of but managin them now is beyond me when cowboys begin to play thet game gollof an run off with french maids i reckon bill stillwell has got to resign  stillwell oh you will not leave me what in the world would i do exclaimed madeline in great anxiety  wal i sure wont leave you miss majesty no i neverll do thet ill run the cattle bizness fer you an see after the hosses an other stock but ive got to hev a foreman who can handle this amazin strange bunch of cowboys  youve tried half a dozen foremen try more until you find the man who meets your requirements said madeline never mind that now tell me how to impress ambroseto make him an example so to speak i must have another maid and i do not want a new one carried off in this summary manner  wal if you fetch pretty maids out hyar you cant expect nothin else why thet blackeyed little french girl with her white skin an pretty airs an smiles an shrugs she had the cowboys crazy itll be wuss with the next one  oh dear sighed madeline  an as fer impressin ambrose i reckon i can tell you how to do thet jest give it to him good an say youre goin to fire him thatll fix ambrose an mebbe scare the other boys fer a spell  very well stillwell bring ambrose in to see me and tell christine to wait in my room  it was a handsome debonair brighteyed cowboy that came tramping into madelines presence his accustomed shyness and awkwardness had disappeared in an excited manner he was a happy boy he looked straight into madelines face as if he expected her to wish him joy and madeline actually found that expression trembling to her lips she held it back until she could be severe but madeline feared she would fail of much severity something warm and sweet like a fragrance had entered the room with ambrose  ambrose what have you done she asked  miss hammond ive been and gone and got married replied ambrose his words tumbling over one another his eyes snapped and there was a kind of glow upon his cleanshaven brown cheek ive stole a march on the other boys there was frank slade pushin me close and i was havin some runnin to keep jim bell back in my dust even old man nels made eyes at christine so i wasnt goin to take any chances i just packed her off to el cajon and married her  oh so i heard said madeline slowly as she watched him ambrose do youlove her  he reddened under her clear gaze dropped his head and fumbled with his new sombrero and there was a catch in his breath madeline saw his powerful brown hand tremble it affected her strangely that this stalwart cowboy who could rope and throw and tie a wild steer in less than one minute should tremble at a mere question suddenly he raised his head and at the beautiful blase of his eyes madeline turned her own away  yes miss hammond i love her he said i think i love her in the way youre askin about i know the first time i saw her i thought how wonderful itd be to have a girl like that for my wife its all been so strangeher comin an how she made me feel sure i never knew many girls and i havent seen any girls at all for years but when she came a girl makes a wonderful difference in a mans feelins and thoughts i guess i never had any before leastways none like i have now myitwell i guess i have a little understandin now of padre marcoss blessin  ambrose have you nothing to say to me asked madeline  im sure sorry i didnt have time to tell you but i was in some hurry  what did you intend to do where were you going when stillwell found you  wed just been married i hadnt thought of anything after that suppose id have rustled back to my job ill sure have to work now and save my money  oh well ambrose i am glad you realize your responsibilities do you earn enoughis your pay sufficient to keep a wife  sure it is why miss hammond i never before earned half the salary im gettin now its some fine to work for you im goin to fire the boys out of my bunkhouse and fix it up for christine and me say wont they be jealous  ambrose ii congratulate you i wish you joy said madeline ii shall make christine a little weddingpresent i want to talk to her for a few moments you may go now  it would have been impossible for madeline to say one severe word to that happy cowboy she experienced difficulty in hiding her own happiness at the turn of events curiosity and interest mingled with her pleasure when she called to christine  mrs ambrose mills please come in  no sound came from the other room  i should like very much to see the bride went on madeline  still there was no stir or reply  christine called madeline  then it was as if a little whirlwind of flying feet and entreating hands and beseeching eyes blew in upon madeline christine was small graceful plump with very white skin and very dark hair she had been madelines favorite maid for years and there was sincere affection between the two whatever had been the blissful ignorance of ambrose it was manifestly certain that christine knew how she had transgressed her fear and remorse and appeal for forgiveness were poured out in an incoherent storm plain it was that the little french maid had been overwhelmed it was only after madeline had taken the emotional girl in her arms and had forgiven and soothed her that her part in the elopement became clear christine was in a maze but gradually as she talked and saw that she was forgiven calmness came in some degree and with it a story which amused yet shocked madeline the unmistakable shy marveling love scarcely realized by christine gave madeline relief and joy if christine loved ambrose there was no harm done watching the girls eyes wonderful with their changes of thought listening to her attempts to explain what it was evident she did not understand madeline gathered that if ever a caveman had taken unto himself a wife if ever a barbarian had carried off a sabine woman then ambrose mills had acted with the violence of such ancient forebears just how it all happened seemed to be beyond christine  he say he love me repeated the girl in a kind of rapt awe he ask me to marry himhe kees mehe hug mehe lift me on ze horsehe ride with me all nighthe marry me  and she exhibited a ring on the third finger of her left hand madeline saw that whatever had been the state of christines feeling for ambrose before this marriage she loved him now she had been taken forcibly but she was won  after christine had gone comforted and betraying her shy eagerness to get back to ambrose madeline was haunted by the look in the girls eyes and her words assuredly the spell of romance was on this sunny land for madeline there was a nameless charm a nameless thrill combating her sense of the violence and unfitness of ambroses wooing something she knew not what took arms against her intellectual arraignment of the cowboys method of getting himself a wife he had said straight out that he loved the girlhe had asked her to marry himhe kissed herhe hugged herhe lifted her upon his horsehe rode away with her through the nightand he married her in whatever light madeline reviewed this thing she always came back to her first natural impression it thrilled her charmed her it went against all the precepts of her training nevertheless it was somehow splendid and beautiful she imagined it stripped another artificial scale from her oversophisticated eyes  scarcely had she settled again to the task on her desk when stillwells heavy tread across the porch interrupted her this time when he entered he wore a look that bordered upon the hysterical it was difficult to tell whether he was trying to suppress grief or glee  miss majesty theres another amazin strange thing sprung on me hyars jim bell come to see you an when i taxed him sayin you was tolerable busy he up an says he was hungry an he aint agoin to eat any more bread made in a washbasin says hell starve first says nels hed the gang over to big bunk an feasted them on bread you taught him how to make in some newfangled bucketmachine with a crank jim says thet bread beat any cake he ever eat an he wants you to show him how to make some now miss majesty as superintendent of this ranch i ought to know whats goin on mebbe jim is jest ajoshin me mebbe hes gone clean dotty mebbe i hev an beggin your pardon i want to know if theres any truth in what jim says nels says  whereupon it became necessary for madeline to stifle her mirth and to inform the sadly perplexed old cattleman that she had received from the east a patent breadmixer and in view of the fact that her household women had taken fright at the contrivance she had essayed to operate it herself this had turned out to be so simple so saving of time and energy and flour so much more cleanly than the old method of mixing dough with the hands and particularly it had resulted in such good bread that madeline had been pleased immediately she ordered more of the breadmixers one day she had happened upon nels making biscuit dough in his washbasin and she had delicately and considerately introduced to him the idea of her new method nels it appeared had a great reputation as a breadmaker and he was proud of it moreover he was skeptical of any claptrap thing with wheels and cranks he consented however to let her show how the thing worked and to sample some of the bread to that end she had him come up to the house where she won him over stillwell laughed loud and long  wal wal wal he exclaimed at length thets fine an its powerful funny mebbe you dont see how funny wal nels has jest been lordin it over the boys about how you showed him an now youll hev to show every last cowboy on the place the same thing cowboys are the jealousest kind of fellers theyre all crazy about you anyway take jim out hyar why thet lazy cowpuncher jest never would make bread hes notorious fer shirkin his share of the grub deal ive knowed jim to trade off washin the pots an pans fer a lonely watch on a rainy night all he wants is to see you show him the same as nels is crowin over then hell crow over his bunkie frank slade an then frankll get lonely to know all about this wonderful breadmachine cowboys are amazin strange critters miss majesty an now thet youve begun with them this way youll hev to keep it up i will say i never seen such a bunch to work youve sure put heart in them  indeed stillwell i am glad to hear that replied madeline and i shall be pleased to teach them all but may i not have them all up here at onceat least those off duty  wal i reckon you cant onless you want to hev them scrappin rejoined stillwell dryly what youve got on your hands now miss majesty is to let em come one by one an make each cowboy think youre takin more especial pleasure in showin him than the feller who came before him then mebbe we can go on with cattleraisin  madeline protested and stillwell held inexorably to what he said was wisdom several times madeline had gone against his advice to her utter discomfiture and rout she dared not risk it again and resigned herself gracefully and with subdued merriment to her task jim bell was ushered into the great light spotless kitchen where presently madeline appeared to put on an apron and roll up her sleeves she explained the use of the several pieces of aluminum that made up the breadmixer and fastened the bucket to the tableshelf jims life might have depended upon this lesson judging from his absorbed manner and his desire to have things explained over and over especially the turning of the crank when madeline had to take jims hand three times to show him the simple mechanism and then he did not understand she began to have faint misgivings as to his absolute sincerity she guessed that as long as she touched jims hand he never would understand then as she began to measure out flour and milk and lard and salt and yeast she saw with despair that jim was not looking at the ingredients was not paying the slightest attention to them his eyes were covertly upon her  jim i am not sure about you said madeline severely how can you learn to make bread if you do not watch me mix it  i am awatchin you replied jim innocently  finally madeline sent the cowboy on his way rejoicing with the breadmixer under his arm next morning true to stillwells prophecy frank slade jims bunkmate presented himself cheerfully to madeline and unbosomed himself of a longdeferred and persistent desire to relieve his overworked comrade of some of the housekeeping in their bunk  miss hammond said frank jims orful kind wantin to do it all hisself but he aint very bright an i didnt believe him you see im from missouri an youll have to show me  for a whole week madeline held clinics where she expounded the scientific method of modern breadmaking she got a good deal of enjoyment out of her lectures what boys these great hulking fellows were she saw through their simple ruses some of them were grave as deacons others wore expressions important enough to have fitted the faces of statesmen signing government treaties these cowboys were children they needed to be governed but in order to govern them they had to be humored a more lighthearted funloving crowd of boys could not have been found and they were grown men stillwell explained that the exuberance of spirits lay in the difference in their fortunes twentyseven cowboys in relays of nine worked eight hours a day that had never been heard of before in the west stillwell declared that cowboys from all points of the compass would head their horses toward her majestys rancho     viii el capitan  stillwells interest in the revolution across the mexican line had manifestly increased with the news that gene stewart had achieved distinction with the rebel forces thereafter the old cattleman sent for el paso and douglas newspapers wrote to ranchmen he knew on the big bend of the rio grande and he would talk indefinitely to any one who would listen to him there was not any possibility of stillwells friends at the ranch forgetting his favorite cowboy stillwell always prefaced his eulogy with an apologetic statement that stewart had gone to the bad madeline liked to listen to him though she was not always sure which news was authentic and which imagination  there appeared to be no doubt however that the cowboy had performed some daring feats for the rebels madeline found his name mentioned in several of the border papers when the rebels under madero stormed and captured the city of juarez stewart did fighting that won him the name of el capitan this battle apparently ended the revolution the capitulation of president diaz followed shortly and there was a feeling of relief among ranchers on the border from texas to california nothing more was heard of gene stewart until april when a report reached stillwell that the cowboy had arrived in el cajon evidently hunting trouble the old cattleman saddled a horse and started posthaste for town in two days he returned depressed in spirit madeline happened to be present when stillwell talked to alfred  i got there too late al said the cattleman gene was gone an what do you think of this danny mains hed jest left with a couple of burros packed i couldnt find what way he went but im bettin he hit the peloncillo trail  danny will show up some day replied alfred what did you learn about stewart maybe he left with danny  not much said stillwell shortly genes hellbent fer election no mountains fer him  well tell us about him  stillwell wiped his sweaty brow and squared himself to talk  wal its sure amazin strange about gene its got me locoed he arrived in el cajon a week or so ago he was trained down like as if hed been ridin the range all winter he hed plenty of moneymex they said an all the greasers was crazy about him called him el capitan he got drunk an went roarin round fer pat hawe you remember that greaser who was plugged last octoberthe night miss majesty arrived wal hes daid hes daid an people says thet pat is agoin to lay thet killin onto gene i reckon thets jest talk though pat is mean enough to do it if he hed the nerve anyway if he was in el cajon he kept mighty much to hisself gene walked up an down up an down all day an night lookin fer pat but he didnt find him an of course he kept gettin drunker he jest got plumb bad he made lots of trouble but there wasnt no gunplay mebbe thet made him sore so he went an licked flos brotherinlaw thet wasnt so bad jack sure needed a good lickin wal then gene met danny an tried to get danny drunk an he couldnt what do you think of that danny hednt been drinkinwouldnt touch a drop im sure glad of thet but its amazin strange why danny was a fish fer red liquor i guess he an gene had some pretty hard words though im not sure about thet anyway gene went down to the railroad an he got on an engine an he was in the engine when it pulled out lord i hope he doesnt hold up the train if he gets gay over in arizona hell go to the pen at yuma an thet pen is a graveyard fer cowboys i wired to agents along the railroad to look out fer stewart an to wire back to me if hes located  suppose you do find him stillwell what can you do inquired alfred  the old man nodded gloomily  i straightened him up once mebbe i can do it again then brightening somewhat he turned to madeline i jest hed an idee miss majesty if i can get him gene steward is the cowboy i want fer my foreman he can manage this bunch of cowpunchers thet are drivin me dotty whats more since hes fought fer the rebels an got that name el capitan all the greasers in the country will kneel to him now miss majesty we hevnt got rid of don carlos an his vaqueros yet to be sure he sold you his house an ranch an stock but you remember nothin was put in black and white about when he should get out an don carlos aint gettin out i dont like the looks of things a little bit ill tell you now thet don carlos knows somethin about the cattle i lost an thet youve been losin right along thet greaser is hand an glove with the rebels im willin to gamble thet when he does get out he an his vaqueros will make another one of the bands of guerrillas thet are harassin the border this revolution aint over yet its jest commenced an all these gangs of outlaws are goin to take advantage of it well see some old times mebbe wal i need gene stewart i need him bad will you let me hire him miss majesty if i can get him straightened up  the old cattleman ended huskily  stillwell by all means find stewart and do not wait to straighten him up bring him to the ranch replied madeline  thanking her stillwell led his horse away  strange how he loves that cowboy murmured madeline  not so strange majesty replied her brother not when you know stewart has been with stillwell on some hard trips into the desert alone theres no middle course of feeling between men facing death in the desert either they hate each other or love each other i dont know but i imagine stewart did something for stillwellsaved us life perhaps besides stewarts a lovable chap when hes going straight i hope stillwell brings him back we do need him majesty hes a born leader once i saw him ride into a bunch of mexicans whom we suspected of rustling it was fine to see him well im sorry to tell you that we are worried about don carlos some of his vaqueros came into my yard the other day when i had left flo alone she had a bad scare these vaqueros have been different since don carlos sold the ranch for that matter i never would have trusted a white woman alone with them but they are bolder now somethings in the wind theyve got assurance they can ride off any night and cross the border  during the succeeding week madeline discovered that a good deal of her sympathy for stillwell in his hunt for the reckless stewart had insensibly grown to be sympathy for the cowboy it was rather a paradox she thought that opposed to the continual reports of stewarts wildness as he caroused from town to town were the continual expressions of good will and faith and hope universally given out by those near her at the ranch stillwell loved the cowboy florence was fond of him alfred liked and admired him pitied him the cowboys swore their regard for him the more he disgraced himself the mexicans called him el gran capitan madelines personal opinion of stewart had not changed in the least since the night it had been formed but certain attributes of his not clearly defined in her mind and the gift of his beautiful horse his valor with the fighting rebels and all this strange regard for him especially that of her brother made her exceedingly regret the cowboys present behavior  meanwhile stillwell was so earnest and zealous that one not familiar with the situation would have believed he was trying to find and reclaim his own son he made several trips to little stations in the valley and from these he returned with a gloomy face madeline got the details from alfred stewart was going from bad to worsedrunk disorderly savage sure to land in the penitentiary then came a report that hurried stillwell off to rodeo he returned on the third day a crushed man he had been so bitterly hurt that no one not even madeline could get out of him what had happened he admitted finding stewart failing to influence him and when the old cattleman got so far he turned purple in the face and talked to himself as if dazed but gene was drunk he was drunk or he couldnt hev treated old bill like thet  madeline was stirred with an anger toward the brutal cowboy that was as strong as her sorrow for the loyal old cattleman and it was when stillwell gave up that she resolved to take a hand the persistent faith of stillwell his pathetic excuses in the face of what must have been stewarts violence perhaps baseness actuated her powerfully gave her new insight into human nature she honored a faith that remained unshaken and the strange thought came to her that stewart must somehow be worthy of such a faith or he never could have inspired it madeline discovered that she wanted to believe that somewhere deep down in the most depraved and sinful wretch upon earth there was some grain of good she yearned to have the faith in human nature that stillwell had in stewart  she sent nels mounted upon his own horse and leading majesty to rodeo in search of stewart nels had instructions to bring stewart back to the ranch in due time nels returned leading the roan without a rider  yep i shore found him replied nels when questioned found him half sobered up hed been in a scrap an somebody hed put him to sleep i guess wal when he seen thet roan hoss he let out a yell an grabbed him round the neck the hoss knowed him all right then gene hugged the hoss an criedcried likei never seen no one who cried like he did i waited awhile an was jest goin to say somethin to him when he turned on me redeyed mad as fire nels he said i care a hell of a lot fer thet boss an i liked you pretty well but if you dont take him away quick ill shoot you both wal i lit out i didnt even git to say howdy to him  nels you think it uselessany attempt to see himpersuade him asked madeline  i shore do miss hammond replied nels gravely ive seen a few sunblinded an locoed an snakepoisoned an skunkbitten cowpunchers in my day but gene stewart beats em all hes shore runnin wild fer the divide  madeline dismissed nels but before he got out of earshot she heard him speak to stillwell who awaited him on the porch  bill put this in your pipe an smoke itnone of them scraps gene has hed was over a woman it used to be thet when he was drank hed scrap over every pretty greaser girl hed run across thets why pat hawe thinks gene plugged the strange vaquero who was with little bonita thet night last fall wal genes scrappin now jest to git shot up hisself for some reason thet only god almighty knows  nelss story of how stewart wept over his horse influenced madeline powerfully her next move was to persuade alfred to see if he could not do better with this doggedly bent cowboy alfred needed only a word of persuasion for he said he had considered going to rodeo of his own accord he went and returned alone  majesty i cant explain stewarts singular actions said alfred i saw him talked with him he knew me but nothing i said appeared to get to him he has changed terribly i fancy his once magnificent strength is breaking itit actually hurt me to look at him i couldnt have fetched him back herenot as he is now i heard all about him and if he isnt downright out of his mind hes hellbent as bill says on getting killed some of his escapades areare not for your ears bill did all any man could do for another weve all done our best for stewart if youd been given a chance perhaps you could have saved him but its too late put it out of mind now dear  madeline however did not forget nor give it up if she had forgotten or surrendered she felt that she would have been relinquishing infinitely more than hope to aid one ruined man but she was at a loss to know what further steps to take days passed and each one brought additional gossip of stewarts headlong career toward the yuma penitentiary for he had crossed the line into cochise county arizona where sheriffs kept a stricter observance of law finally a letter came from a friend of nelss in chiricahua saying that stewart had been hurt in a brawl there his hurt was not serious but it would probably keep him quiet long enough to get sober and this opportunity nelss informant said would be a good one for stewarts friends to take him home before he got locked up this epistle inclosed a letter to stewart from his sister evidently it had been found upon him it told a story of illness and made an appeal for aid nelss friend forwarded this letter without stewarts knowledge thinking stillwell might care to help stewarts family stewart had no money he said  the sisters letter found its way to madeline she read it tears in her eyes it told madeline much more than its brief story of illness and poverty and wonder why gene had not written home for so long it told of motherly love sisterly love brotherly lovedear family ties that had not been broken it spoke of pride in this el capitan brother who had become famous it was signed your loving sister letty  not improbably madeline revolved in mind this letter was one reason for stewarts headstrong longcontinued abasement it had been received too lateafter he had squandered the money that would have meant so much to mother and sister be that as it might madeline immediately sent a bankdraft to stewarts sister with a letter explaining that the money was drawn in advance on stewarts salary this done she impulsively determined to go to chiricahua herself  the horsebackrides madeline had taken to this little arizona hamlet had tried her endurance to the utmost but the journey by automobile except for some rocky bits of road and sandy stretches was comfortable and a matter of only a few hours the big touringcar was still a kind of seventh wonder to the mexicans and cowboys not that automobiles were very new and strange but because this one was such an enormous machine and capable of greater speed than an expresstrain the chauffeur who had arrived with the car found his situation among the jealous cowboys somewhat far removed from a bed of roses he had been induced to remain long enough to teach the operating and mechanical technique of the car and choice fell upon link stevens for the simple reason that of all the cowboys he was the only one with any knack for mechanics now link had been a hardriding harddriving cowboy and that winter he had sustained an injury to his leg caused by a bad fall and was unable to sit his horse this had been gall and wormwood to him but when the big white automobile came and he was elected to drive it life was once more worth living for him but all the other cowboys regarded link and his machine as some correlated species of demon they were deathly afraid of both  it was for this reason that nels when madeline asked him to accompany her to chiricahua replied reluctantly that he would rather follow on his horse however she prevailed over his hesitancy and with florence also in the car they set out for miles and miles the valley road was smooth hardpacked and slightly downhill and when speeding was perfectly safe madeline was not averse to it the grassy plain sailed backward in gray sheets and the little dot in the valley grew larger and larger from time to time link glanced round at unhappy nels whose eyes were wild and whose hands clutched his seat while the car was crossing the sandy and rocky places going slowly nels appeared to breathe easier and when it stopped in the wide dusty street of chiricahua nels gladly tumbled out  nels we shall wait here in the car while you find stewart said madeline  miss hammond i reckon genell run when he sees us if hes able to run replied nels wal ill go find him an make up my mind then what wed better do  nels crossed the railroad track and disappeared behind the low flat houses after a little time he reappeared and hurried up to the car madeline felt his gray gaze searching her face  miss hammond i found him said nels he was sleepin i woke him hes sober an not bad hurt but i dont believe you ought to see him mebbe florence  nels i want to see him myself why not what did he say when you told him i was here  shore i didnt tell him that i jest says hullo gene an he says my gawd nels mebbe i aint glad to see a human bein he asked me who was with me an i told him link an some friends i said id fetch them in he hollered at thet but i went anyway now if you really will see him miss hammond its a good chance but shore its a touchy matter an youll be some sick at sight of him hes layin in a greaser hole over here likely the greasers hev been kind to him but theyre shore a poor lot  madeline did not hesitate a moment  thank you nels take me at once come florence  they left the car now surrounded by gapingeyed mexican children and crossed the dusty space to a narrow lane between red adobe walls passing by several houses nels stopped at the door of what appeared to be an alleyway leading back it was filthy  hes in there around thet first corner its a patio open an sunny an miss hammond if you dont mind ill wait here for you i reckon gene wouldnt like any fellers around when he sees you girls  it was that which made madeline hesitate then and go forward slowly she had given no thought at all to what stewart might feel when suddenly surprised by her presence  florence you wait also said madeline at the doorway and turned in alone  and she had stepped into a brokendown patio littered with alfalfa straw and debris all clear in the sunlight upon a bench back toward her sat a man looking out through the rents in the broken wall he had not heard her the place was not quite so filthy and stifling as the passages madeline had come through to get there then she saw that it had been used as a corral a rat ran boldly across the dirt floor the air swarmed with flies which the man brushed at with weary hand madeline did not recognize stewart the side of his face exposed to her gaze was black bruised bearded his clothes were ragged and soiled there were bits of alfalfa in his hair his shoulders sagged he made a wretched and hopeless figure sitting there madeline divined something of why nels shrank from being present  mr stewart it is i miss hammond come to see you she said  he grew suddenly perfectly motionless as if he had been changed to stone she repeated her greeting  his body jerked he moved violently as if instinctively to turn and face this intruder but a more violent movement checked him  madeline waited how singular that this ruined cowboy had pride which kept him from showing his face and was it not shame more than pride  mr stewart i have come to talk with you if you will let me  go away he muttered  mr stewart she began with involuntary hauteur but instantly she corrected herself became deliberate and cool for she saw that she might fail to be even heard by this man i have come to help you will you let me  for gods sake youyou he choked over the words go away  stewart perhaps it was for gods sake that i came said madeline gently surely it was for yoursand your sisters madeline bit her tongue for she had not meant to betray her knowledge of letty  he groaned and staggering up to the broken wall he leaned there with his face hidden madeline reflected that perhaps the slip of speech had been well  stewart please let me say what i have to say  he was silent and she gathered courage and inspiration  stillwell is deeply hurt deeply grieved that he could not turn you back from thisthis fatal course my brother is also they wanted to help you and so do i i have come thinking somehow i might succeed where they have failed nels brought your sisters letter ii read it i was only the more determined to try to help you and indirectly help your mother and letty stewart we want you to come to the ranch stillwell needs you for his foreman the position is open to you and you can name your salary both al and stillwell are worried about don carlos the vaqueros and the raids down along the border my cowboys are without a capable leader will you come  no he answered  but stillwell wants you so badly  no  stewart i want you to come  no  his replies had been hoarse loud furious they disconcerted madeline and she paused trying to think of a way to proceed stewart staggered away from the wall and falling upon the bench he hid his face in his hands all his motions like his speech had been violent  will you please go away he asked  stewart certainly i cannot remain here longer if you insist upon my going but why not listen to me when i want so much to help you why  im a damned blackguard he burst out but i was a gentleman once and im not so low that i can stand for you seeing me here  when i made up my mind to help you i made it up to see you wherever you were stewart come away come back with us to the ranch you are in a bad condition now everything looks black to you but that will pass when you are among friends again you will get well you will be your old self the very fact that you were once a gentleman that you come of good family makes you owe so much more to yourself why stewart think how young you are it is a shame to waste your life come back with me  miss hammond this was my last plunge he replied despondently its too late  oh no it is not so bad as that  its too late  at least make an effort stewart try  no theres no use im done for please leave methank you for  he had been savage then sullen and now he was grim madeline all but lost power to resist his strange deadly cold finality no doubt he knew he was doomed yet something halted herheld her even as she took a backward step and she became conscious of a subtle change in her own feeling she had come into that squalid hole madeline hammond earnest enough kind enough in her own intentions but she had been almost imperiousa woman habitually proudly used to being obeyed she divined that all the pride blue blood wealth culture distinction all the impersonal condescending persuasion all the fatuous philanthropy on earth would not avail to turn this man a single hairsbreadth from his downward career to destruction her coming had terribly augmented his bitter hate of himself she was going to fail to help him she experienced a sensation of impotence that amounted almost to distress the situation assumed a tragic keenness she had set forth to reverse the tide of a wild cowboys fortunes she faced the swift wasting of his life the damnation of his soul the subtle consciousness of change in her was the birth of that faith she had revered in stillwell and all at once she became merely a woman brave and sweet and indomitable  stewart look at me she said  he shuddered she advanced and laid a hand on his bent shoulder under the light touch he appeared to sink  look at me she repeated  but he could not lift his head he was abject crushed he dared not show his swollen blackened face his fierce cramped posture revealed more than his features might have shown it betrayed the torturing shame of a man of pride and passion a man who had been confronted in his degradation by the woman he had dared to enshrine in his heart it betrayed his love  listen then went on madeline and her voice was unsteady listen to me stewart the greatest men are those who have fallen deepest into the mire sinned most suffered most and then have fought their evil natures and conquered i think you can shake off this desperate mood and be a man  no he cried  listen to me again somehow i know youre worthy of stillwells love will you come back with usfor his sake  no its too late i tell you  stewart the best thing in life is faith in human nature i have faith in you i believe you are worth it  youre only kind and goodsaying that you cant mean it  i mean it with all my heart she replied a sudden rich warmth suffusing her body as she saw the first sign of his softening will you come backif not for your own sake or stillwellsthen for mine  what am i to such a woman as you  a man in trouble stewart but i have come to help you to show my faith in you  if i believed that i might try he said  listen she began softly hurriedly my word is not lightly given let it prove my faith in you look at me now and say you will come  he heaved up his big frame as if trying to cast off a giants burden and then slowly he turned toward her his face was a blotched and terrible thing the physical brutalizing marks were there and at that instant all that appeared human to madeline was the dawning in dead furnacelike eyes of a beautiful light  ill come he whispered huskily give me a few days to straighten up then ill come     ix the new foreman  toward the end of the week stillwell informed madeline that stewart had arrived at the ranch and had taken up quarters with nels  genes sick he looks bad said the old cattleman hes so weak an shaky he cant lift a cup nels says that gene has hed some bad spells a little liquor would straighten him up now but nels cant force him to drink a drop an has hed to sneak some liquor in his coffee wal i think well pull gene through hes forgotten a lot i was goin to tell him what he did to me up at rodeo but i know if hed believe it hed be sicker than he is genes losin his mind or hes got somethin powerful strange on it  from that time stillwell who evidently found madeline his most sympathetic listener unburdened himself daily of his hopes and fears and conjectures  stewart was really ill it became necessary to send link stevens for a physician then stewart began slowly to mend and presently was able to get up and about stillwell said the cowboy lacked interest and seemed to be a broken man this statement however the old cattleman modified as stewart continued to improve then presently it was a good augury of stewarts progress that the cowboys once more took up the teasing relation which had been characteristic of them before his illness a cowboy was indeed out of sorts when he could not vent his peculiar humor on somebody or something stewart had evidently become a broad target for their badinage  wal the boys are sure after gene said stillwell with his huge smile joshin him all the time about how he sits around an hangs around an loafs around jest to get a glimpse of you miss majesty sure all the boys hev a pretty bad case over their pretty boss but none of them is a marker to gene hes got it so bad miss majesty thet he actooly dont know they are joshin him its the amazinest strange thing i ever seen why gene was always a feller thet you could josh an hed laugh an get back at you but he was never before deaf to talk an there was a certain limit no feller cared to cross with him now he takes every word an smiles dreamy like an jest looks an looks why hes beginnin to make me tired hell never run thet bunch of cowboys if he doesnt wake up quick  madeline smiled her amusement and expressed a belief that stillwell wanted too much in such short time from a man who had done body and mind a grievous injury  it had been impossible for madeline to fail to observe stewarts singular behavior she never went out to take her customary walks and rides without seeing him somewhere in the distance she was aware that he watched for her and avoided meeting her when she sat on the porch during the afternoon or at sunset stewart could always be descried at some point near he idled listlessly in the sun lounged on the porch of his bunkhouse sat whittling the top bar of the corral fence and always it seemed to madeline he was watching her once while going the rounds with her gardener she encountered stewart and greeted him kindly he said little but he was not embarrassed she did not recognize in his face any feature that she remembered in fact on each of the few occasions when she had met stewart he had looked so different that she had no consistent idea of his facial appearance he was now pale haggard drawn his eyes held a shadow through which shone a soft subdued light and once having observed this madeline fancied it was like the light in majestys eyes in the dumb worshiping eyes of her favorite staghound she told stewart that she hoped he would soon be in the saddle again and passed on her way  that stewart loved her madeline could not help but see she endeavored to think of him as one of the many who she was glad to know liked her but she could not regulate her thoughts to fit the order her intelligence prescribed thought of stewart dissociated itself from thought of the other cowboys when she discovered this she felt a little surprise and annoyance then she interrogated herself and concluded that it was not that stewart was so different from his comrades but that circumstances made him stand out from them she recalled her meeting with him that night when he had tried to force her to marry him this was unforgettable in itself she called subsequent mention of him and found it had been peculiarly memorable the man and his actions seemed to hinge on events lastly the fact standing clear of all others in its relation to her interest was that he had been almost ruined almost lost and she had saved him that alone was sufficient to explain why she thought of him differently she had befriended uplifted the other cowboys she had saved stewarts life to be sure he had been a ruffian but a woman could not save the life of even a ruffian without remembering it with gladness madeline at length decided her interest in stewart was natural and that her deeper feeling was pity perhaps the interest had been forced from her however she gave the pity as she gave everything  stewart recovered his strength though not in time to ride at the spring roundup and stillwell discussed with madeline the advisability of making the cowboy his foreman  wal gene seems to be gettin along said stillwell but he aint like his old self i think more of him at thet but wheres his spirit the boysd ride roughshod all over him mebbe id do best to wait longer now as the slack season is on all the same if those vaquero of don carloss dont lay low ill send gene over there thetll wake him up  a few days afterward stillwell came to madeline rubbing his big hands in satisfaction and wearing a grin that was enormous  miss majesty i reckon before this ive said things was amazin strange but now gene stewart has gone an done it listen to me them greasers down on our slope hev been gettin prosperous theyre growin like bad weeds an they got a new padrethe little old feller from el cajon padre marcos wal this was all right all the boys thought except gene an he got blacker n thunder an roared round like a dehorned bull i was sure glad to see he could get mad again then gene haids down the slope fer the church nels an me follered him thinkin he might hev been took sudden with a crazy spell or somethin he hasnt never been jest right yet since he left off drinkin wal we run into him comin out of the church we never was so dumfounded in our lives gene was crazy all righthe sure hed a spell but it was the kind of a spell he hed thet paralyzed us he ran past us like a streak an we follered we couldnt ketch him we heerd him laughthe strangest laugh i ever heerd youd thought the feller was suddenly made a king he was like thet feller who was tied in a bunyinsack an throwed into the sea an cut his way out an swam to the island where the treasures was an stood up yellin the world is mine wal when we got up to his bunkhouse he was gone he didnt come back all day an all night frankie slade who has a sharp tongue says gene hed gone crazy for liquor an thet was his finish nels was some worried an i was sick  wal this mawnin i went over to nelss bunk some of the fellers was there all speculatin about gene then big as life gene struts round the corner he wasnt the same gene his face was pale an his eyes burned like fire he had thet old mockin cool smile an somethin besides thet i couldnt understand frankie slade up an made a remarkno wuss than hed been makin fer daysan gene tumbled him out of his chair punched him good walked all over him frankie wasnt hurt so much as he was bewildered gene he says what the hell struck you an gene says kind of sweet like frankie you may be a nice feller when youre alone but your talks offensive to a gentleman  after thet what was said to gene was with a nice smile now miss majesty its beyond me what to allow for genes sudden change first off i thought padre marcos had converted him i actooly thought thet but i reckon its only gene stewart come backthe old gene stewart an some thets all i care about im rememberin how i once told you thet gene was the last of the cowboys perhaps i should hev said hes the last of my kind of cowboys wal miss majesty youll be apprecatin of what i meant from now on  it was also beyond madeline to account for gene stewarts antics and making allowance for the old cattlemans fancy she did not weigh his remarks very heavily she guessed why stewart might have been angry at the presence of padre marcos madeline supposed that it was rather an unusual circumstance for a cowboy to be converted to religious belief but it was possible and she knew that religious fervor often manifested itself in extremes of feeling and action most likely in stewarts case his real manner had been both misunderstood and exaggerated however madeline had a curious desire which she did not wholly admit to herself to see the cowboy and make her own deductions  the opportunity did not present itself for nearly two weeks stewart had taken up his duties as foreman and his activities were ceaseless he was absent most of the time ranging down toward the mexican line when he returned stillwell sent for him  this was late in the afternoon of a day in the middle of april alfred and florence were with madeline on the porch they saw the cowboy turn his horse over to one of the mexican boys at the corral and then come with weary step up to the house beating the dust out of his gauntlets little streams of gray sand trickled from his sombrero as he removed it and bowed to the women  madeline saw the man she remembered but with a singularly different aspect his skin was brown his eyes were piercing and dark and steady he carried himself erect he seemed preoccupied and there was not a trace of embarrassment in his manner  wal gene im sure glad to see you stillwell was saying where do you hail from  guadaloupe canyon replied the cowboy  stillwell whistled  way down there you dont mean you follered them hoss tracks thet far  all the way from don carloss rancho across the mexican line i took nick steele with me nick is the best tracker in the outfit this trail we were on led along the foothill valleys first we thought whoever made it was hunting for water but they passed two ranches without watering at seatons wash they dug for water here they met a packtrain of burros that came down the mountain trail the burros were heavily loaded horse and burro tracks struck south from seatons to the old california emigrant road we followed the trail through guadelope canyon and across the border on the way back we stopped at slaughters ranch where the united states cavalry are camping there we met foresters from the peloncillo forest reserve if these fellows knew anything they kept it to themselves so we hit the trail home  wal i reckon you know enough inquired stillwell slowly  i reckon replied stewart  wal out with it then said stillwell gruffly miss hammond cant be kept in the dark much longer make your report to her  the cowboy shifted his dark gaze to madeline he was cool and slow  were losing a few cattle on the open range nightdrives by the vaqueros some of these cattle are driven across the valley others up to the foothills so far as i can find out no cattle are being driven south so this raiding is a blind to fool the cowboys don carlos is a mexican rebel he located his rancho here a few years ago and pretended to raise cattle all that time he has been smuggling arms and ammunition across the border he was for madero against diaz now he is against madero because he and all the rebels think madero failed to keep his promises there will be another revolution and all the arms go from the states across the border those burros i told about were packed with contraband goods  thats a matter for the united states cavalry they are patrolling the border said alfred  they cant stop the smuggling of arms not down in that wild corner replied stewart  what is mymy duty what has it to do with me inquired madeline somewhat perturbed  wal miss majesty i reckon it hasnt nothing to do with you put in stillwell thets my bizness an stewarts but i jest wanted you to know there might be some trouble follerin my orders  your orders  i want to send stewart over to fire don carlos an his vaqueros off the range theyve got to go don carlos is breakin the law of the united states an doin it on our property an with our hosses hev i your permission miss hammond  why assuredly you have stillwell you know what to do alfred what do you think best  itll make trouble majesty but its got to be done replied alfred here you have a crowd of eastern friends due next month we want the range to ourselves then but stillwell if you drive those vaqueros off wont they hang around in the foothills i declare they are a bad lot  stillwells mind was not at ease he paced the porch with a frown clouding his brow  gene i reckon you got this greaser deal figgered bettern me said stillwell now what do you say  hell have to be forced off replied stewart quietly the dons pretty slick but his vaqueros are bad actors its just this way nels said the other day to me gene i havent packed a gun for years until lately and it feels good whenever i meet any of those strange greasers you see stillwell don carlos has vaqueros coming and going all the time theyre guerrilla bands thats all and theyre getting uglier there have been several shootingscrapes lately a rancher named white who lives up the valley was badly hurt its only a matter of time till something stirs up the boys here stillwell you know nels and monty and nick  sure i know em an youre not mentionin one more particular cowboy in my outfit said stillwell with a dry chuckle and a glance at stewart  madeline divined the covert meaning and a slight chill passed over her as if a cold wind had blown in from the hills  stewart i see you carry a gun she said pointing to a black handle protruding from a sheath swinging low along his leather chaps  yes maam  why do you carry it she asked  well he said its not a pretty gunand its heavy she caught the inference the gun was not an ornament his keen steady dark gaze caused her vague alarm what had once seemed cool and audacious about this cowboy was now cold and powerful and mystical both her instinct and her intelligence realized the steel fiber of the mans nature as she was his employer she had the right to demand that he should not do what was so chillingly manifest that he might do but madeline could not demand she felt curiously young and weak and the five months of western life were as if they had never been she now had to do with a question involving human life and the value she placed upon human life and its spiritual significance was a matter far from her cowboys thoughts a strange idea flashed up did she place too much value upon all human life she checked that wondering almost horrified at herself and then her intuition told her that she possessed a far stronger power to move these primitive men than any womans stern rule or order  stewart i do not fully understand what you hint that nels and his comrades might do please be frank with me do you mean nels would shoot upon little provocation  miss hammond as far as nels is concerned shooting is now just a matter of his meeting don carloss vaqueros its wonderful what nels has stood from them considering the mexicans hes already killed  already killed stewart you are not in earnest cried madeline shocked  i am nels has seen hard life along the arizona border he likes peace as well as any man but a few years of that doesnt change what the early days made of him as for nick steele and monty theyre just bad men and looking for trouble  how about yourself stewart stillwells remark was not lost upon me said madeline prompted by curiosity  stewart did not reply he looked at her in respectful silence in her keen earnestness madeline saw beneath his cool exterior and was all the more baffled was there a slight inscrutable mocking light in his eyes or was it only her imagination however the cowboys face was as hard as flint  stewart i have come to love my ranch said madeline slowly and i care a great deal for mymy cowboys it would be dreadful if they were to kill anybody or especially if one of them should be killed  miss hammond youve changed things considerable out here but you cant change these men all thats needed to start them is a little trouble and this mexican revolution is bound to make rough times along some of the wilder passes across the border were in line thats all and the boys are getting stirred up  very well then i must accept the inevitable i am facing a rough time and some of my cowboys cannot be checked much longer but stewart whatever you have been in the past you have changed she smiled at him and her voice was singularly sweet and rich stillwell has so often referred to you as the last of his kind of cowboy i have just a faint idea of what a wild life you have led perhaps that fits you to be a leader of such rough men i am no judge of what a leader should do in this crisis my cowboys are entailing risk in my employ my property is not safe perhaps my life even might be endangered i want to rely upon you since stillwell believes and i too that you are the man for this place i shall give you no orders but is it too much to ask that you be my kind of a cowboy  madeline remembered stewarts former brutality and shame and abject worship and she measured the great change in him by the contrast afforded now in his dark changeless intent face  miss hammond what kind of a cowboy is that he asked  ii dont exactly know it is that kind which i feel you might be but i do know that in the problem at hand i want your actions to be governed by reason not passion human life is not for any man to sacrifice unless in selfdefense or in protecting those dependent upon him what stillwell and you hinted makes me afraid of nels and nick steele and monty cannot they be controlled i want to feel that they will not go gunning for don carloss men i want to avoid all violence and yet when my guests come i want to feel that they will be safe from danger or fright or even annoyance may i not rely wholly upon you stewart just trust you to manage these obstreperous cowboys and protect my property and alfreds and take care of usof me until this revolution is ended i have never had a days worry since i bought the ranch it is not that i want to shirk my responsibilities it is that i like being happy may i put so much faith in you  i hope so miss hammond replied stewart it was an instant response but none the less fraught with consciousness of responsibility he waited a moment and then as neither stillwell nor madeline offered further speech he bowed and turned down the path his long spurs clinking in the gravel  wal wal exclaimed stillwell thets no little job you give him miss majesty  it was a womans cunning stillwell said alfred my sister used to be a wonder at getting her own way when we were kids just a smile or two a few sweet words or turns of thought and she had what she wanted  al what a character to give me protested madeline indeed i was deeply in earnest with stewart i do not understand just why but i trust him he seems like iron and steel then i was a little frightened at the prospect of trouble with the vaqueros both you and stillwell have influenced me to look upon stewart as invaluable i thought it best to confess my utter helplessness and to look to him for support  majesty whatever actuated you it was a stroke of diplomacy replied her brother stewart has got good stuff in him he was down and out well hes made a game fight and it looks as if hed win trusting him giving him responsibility relying upon him was the surest way to strengthen his hold upon himself then that little touch of sentiment about being your kind of cowboy and protecting youwell if gene stewart doesnt develop into an arguseyed knight ill say i dont know cowboys but majesty remember hes a composite of tiger breed and forked lightning and dont imagine he has failed you if he gets into a fight  ill sure tell you what gene stewart will do said florence dont i know cowboys why they used to take me up on their horses when i was a baby gene stewart will be the kind of cowboy your sister said he might be whatever that is she may not know and we may not guess but he knows  wal flo there you hit plumb center replied the old cattleman an i couldnt be gladder if he was my own son     x don carloss vaqueros  early the following morning stewart with a company of cowboys departed for don carloss rancho as the day wore on without any report from him stillwell appeared to grow more at ease and at nightfall he told madeline that he guessed there was now no reason for concern  wal though its sure amazin strange he continued ive been worryin some about how we was goin to fire don carlos but gene has a way of doin things  next day stillwell and alfred decided to ride over don carloss place taking madeline and florence with them and upon the return trip to stop at alfreds ranch they started in the cool gray dawn and after three hours riding as the sun began to get bright they entered a mesquite grove surrounding corrals and barns and a number of low squat buildings and a huge rambling structure all built of adobe and mostly crumbling to ruin only one green spot relieved the bald red of grounds and walls and this evidently was made by the spring which had given both value and fame to don carloss range the approach to the house was through a wide courtyard bare stony hard packed with hitchingrails and wateringtroughs in front of a long porch several dusty tired horses stood with drooping heads and bridles down their wet flanks attesting to travel just ended  wal doggone it al if there aint pat hawes hoss ill eat it exclaimed stillwell  whats pat want here anyhow growled alfred  no one was in sight but madeline heard loud voices coming from the house stillwell dismounted at the porch and stalked in at the door alfred leaped off his horse helped florence and madeline down and bidding them rest and wait on the porch he followed stillwell  i hate these greaser places said florence with a grimace theyre so mysterious and creepy just watch now theyll be darkskinned beadyeyed softfooted greasers slip right up out of the ground therell be an ugly face in every door and window and crack  its like a huge barn with its characteristic odor permeated by tobacco smoke replied madeline sitting down beside florence i dont think very much of this end of my purchase florence isnt that don carloss black horse over there in the corral  it sure is then the dons heah yet i wish we hadnt been in such a hurry to come over there that doesnt sound encouraging  from the corridor came the rattling of spurs tramping of boots and loud voices madeline detected alfreds quick notes when he was annoyed well rustle back home then he said the answer came no madeline recognized stewarts voice and she quickly straightened up i wont have them in here went on alfred  outdoors or in theyve got to be with us replied stewart sharply listen al came the boom of stillwells big voice now that weve butted in over hyar with the girls you let stewart run things  then a crowd of men tramped pellmell out upon the porch stewart darkbrowed and somber was in the lead nels hung close to him and madelines quick glance saw that nels had undergone some indescribable change the grinning brillianteyed don carlos came jostling out beside a gaunt sharpfeatured man wearing a silver shield this no doubt was pat hawe in the background behind stillwell and alfred stood nick steele head and shoulders over a number of vaqueros and cowboys  miss hammond im sorry you came said stewart bluntly were in a muddle here ive insisted that you and flo be kept close to us ill explain later if you cant stop your ears i beg you to overlook rough talk  with that he turned to the men behind him nick take booly go back to monty and the boys fetch out that stuff all of it rustle now  stillwell and alfred disengaged themselves from the crowd to take up positions in front of madeline and florence pat hawe leaned against a post and insolently ogled madeline and then florence don carlos pressed forward his whole figure filled madelines reluctant but fascinated eyes he wore tight velveteen breeches with a heavy fold down the outside seam which was ornamented with silver buttons round his waist was a sash and a belt with fringed holster from which protruded a pearlhandled gun a vest or waistcoat richly embroidered partly concealed a blouse of silk and wholly revealed a silken scarf round his neck his swarthy face showed dark lines like cords under the surface his little eyes were exceedingly prominent and glittering to madeline his face seemed to be a bold handsome mask through which his eyes piercingly betrayed the evil nature of the man  he bowed low with elaborate and sinuous grace his smile revealed brilliant teeth enhanced the brilliance of his eyes he slowly spread deprecatory hands  senoritas i beg a thousand pardons he said how strange it was for madeline to hear english spoken in a soft whiningly sweet accent the gracious hospitality of don carlos has passed with his house  stewart stepped forward and thrusting don carlos aside he called make way there  the crowd fell back to the tramp of heavy boots cowboys appeared staggering out of the corridor with long boxes these they placed side by side upon the floor of the porch  now hawe well proceed with our business said stewart you see these boxes dont you  i reckon i see a good many things round hyar replied hawe meaningly  well do you intend to open these boxes upon my sayso  no retorted hawe its not my place to meddle with property as come by express an all accounted fer regular  you call yourself a sheriff exclaimed stewart scornfully  mebbe youll think so before long rejoined hawe sullenly  ill open them here one of you boys knock the tops off these boxes ordered stewart no not you monty you use your eyes let booly handle the ax rustle now  monty price had jumped out of the crowd into the middle of the porch the manner in which he gave way to booly and faced the vaqueros was not significant of friendliness or trust  stewart youre dead wrong to bust open them boxes thets agin the law protested hawe trying to interfere  stewart pushed him back then don carlos who had been stunned by the appearance of the boxes suddenly became active in speech and person stewart thrust him back also the mexicans excitement increased he wildly gesticulated he exclaimed shrilly in spanish when however the lids were wrenched open and an inside packing torn away he grew rigid and silent madeline raised herself behind stillwell to see that the boxes were full of rifles and ammunition  there hawe what did i tell you demanded stewart i came over here to take charge of this ranch i found these boxes hidden in an unused room i suspected what they were contraband goods  wal supposin they are i dont see any call fer sech allfired fuss as youre makin stewart i calkilate youre some stuck on your new job an want to make a big show before  hawe stop slinging that kind of talk interrupted stewart you got too free with your mouth once before now here im supposed to be consulting an officer of the law will you take charge of these contraband goods  say youre holdin on high an mighty replied hawe in astonishment that was plainly pretended what re you drivin at  stewart muttered an imprecation he took several swift strides across the porch he held out his hands to stillwell as if to indicate the hopelessness of intelligent and reasonable arbitration he looked at madeline with a glance eloquent of his regret that he could not handle the situation to please her then as he wheeled he came face to face with nels who had slipped forward out of the crowd  madeline gathered serious import from the steelblue meaning flash of eyes whereby nels communicated something to stewart whatever that something was it dispelled stewarts impatience a slight movement of his hand brought monty price forward with a jump in these sudden jumps of montys there was a suggestion of restrained ferocity then nels and monty lined up behind stewart it was a deliberate action even to madeline unmistakably formidable pat hawes face took on an ugly look his eyes had a reddish gleam don carlos added a pale face and extreme nervousness to his former expressions of agitation the cowboys edged away from the vaqueros and the bronzed bearded horsemen who were evidently hawes assistants  im driving at this spoke up stewart presently and now he was slow and caustic heres contraband of war hawe do you get that arms and ammunition for the rebels across the border i charge you as an officer to confiscate these goods and to arrest the smugglerdon carlos  these words of stewarts precipitated a riot among don carlos and his followers and they surged wildly around the sheriff there was an upflinging of brown clenching hands a shrill jabbering babel of mexican voices the crowd around don carlos grew louder and denser with the addition of armed vaqueros and barefooted stableboys and dustybooted herdsmen and blanketed mexicans the last of whom suddenly slipped from doors and windows and round comers it was a motley assemblage the laced fringed ornamented vaqueros presented a sharp contrast to the barelegged sandalfooted boys and the ragged herders shrill cries evidently from don carlos somewhat quieted the commotion then don carlos could be heard addressing sheriff hawe in an exhortation of mingled english and spanish he denied he avowed he proclaimed and all in rapid passionate utterance he tossed his black hair in his vehemence he waved his fists and stamped the floor he rolled his glittering eyes he twisted his thin lips into a hundred different shapes and like a cornered wolf showed snarling white teeth  it seemed to madeline that don carlos denied knowledge of the boxes of contraband goods then knowledge of their real contents then knowledge of their destination and finally everything except that they were there in sight damning witnesses to somebodys complicity in the breaking of neutrality laws passionate as had been his denial of all this it was as nothing compared to his denunciation of stewart  senor stewart he keel my vaquero shouted don carlos as sweating and spent he concluded his arraignment of the cowboy him you must arrest senor stewart a bad man he keel my vaquero  do you hear thet yelled hawe the dons got you figgered fer thet little job at el cajon last fall  the clamor burst into a roar hawe began shaking his finger in stewarts face and hoarsely shouting then a lithe young vaquero swift as an indian glided under hawes uplifted arm whatever the action he intended he was too late for its execution stewart lunged out struck the vaquero and knocked him off the porch as he fell a dagger glittered in the sunlight and rolled clinking over the stones the man went down hard and did not move with the same abrupt violence and a manner of contempt stewart threw hawe off the porch then don carlos who being less supple fell heavily then the mob backed before stewarts rush until all were down in the courtyard  the shuffling of feet ceased the clanking of spurs and the shouting nels and monty now reinforced by nick steele were as shadows of stewart so closely did they follow him stewart waved them back and stepped down into the yard he was absolutely fearless but what struck madeline so keenly was his magnificent disdain manifestly he knew the nature of the men with whom he was dealing from the look of him it was natural for madeline to expect them to give way before him which they did even hawe and his attendants sullenly retreating  don carlos got up to confront stewart the prostrate vaquero stirred and moaned but did not rise  you neednt jibber spanish to me said stewart you can talk american and you can understand american if you start a roughhouse here you and your greasers will be cleaned up youve got to leave this ranch you can have the stock the packs and traps in the second corral theres grub too saddle up and hit the trail don carlos im dealing more than square with you youre lying about these boxes of guns and cartridges youre breaking the laws of my country and youre doing it on property in my charge if i let smuggling go on here id be implicated myself now you get off the range if you dont ill have the united states cavalry here in six hours and you can gamble theyll get what my cowboys leave of you  don carlos was either a capital actor and gratefully relieved at stewarts leniency or else he was thoroughly cowed by references to the troops si senor gracias senor he exclaimed and then turning away he called to his men they hurried after him while the fallen vaquero got to his feet with stewarts help and staggered across the courtyard in a moment they were gone leaving hawe and his several comrades behind  hawe was spitefully ejecting a wad of tobacco from his mouth and swearing in an undertone about whitelivered greasers he cocked his red eye speculatively at stewart  wal i reckon as youre so hellbent on doin it up brown thet youll try to fire me offn the range too  if i ever do pat youll need to be carried off replied stewart just now im politely inviting you and your deputy sheriffs to leave  well go but were comin back one of these days an when we do well put you in irons  hawe if youve got it in that bad for me come over here in the corral and lets fight it out  im an officer an i dont fight outlaws an sich except when i hev to make arrests  officer youre a disgrace to the county if you ever did get irons on me youd take me some place out of sight shoot me and then swear you killed me in selfdefense it wouldnt be the first time you pulled that trick pat hawe  ho ho laughed hawe derisively then he started toward the horses  stewarts long arm shot out his hand clapped on hawes shoulder spinning him round like a top  youre leaving pat but before you leave youll come out with your play or youll crawl said stewart youve got it in for me man to man speak up now and prove youre not the cowardly skunk ive always thought you ive called your hand  pat hawes face turned a blackishpurple hue  you can jest bet thet ive got it in fer you he shouted hoarsely youre only a lowdown cowpuncher you never hed a dollar or a decent job till you was mixed up with thet hammond woman  stewarts hand flashed out and hit hawes face in a ringing slap the sheriffs head jerked back his sombrero fell to the ground as he bent over to reach it his hand shook his arm shook his whole body shook  monty price jumped straight forward and crouched down with a strange low cry  stewart seemed all at once rigid bending a little  say miss hammond if theres occasion to use her name said stewart in a voice that seemed coolly pleasant yet had a deadly undernote  hawe did a moments battle with strangling fury which he conquered in some measure  i said you was a lowdown drunken cowpuncher a tough as damn near a desperado as we ever hed on the border went on hawe deliberately his speech appeared to be addressed to stewart although his flamepointed eyes were riveted upon monty price i know you plugged that vaquero last fall an when i git my proof im comin after you  thats all right hawe you can call me what you like and you can come after me when you like replied stewart but youre going to get in bad with me youre in bad now with monty and nels pretty soon youll queer yourself with all the cowboys and the ranchers too if that dont put sense into youhere listen to this you knew what these boxes contained you know don carlos has been smuggling arms and ammunition across the border you know he is hand and glove with the rebels youve been wearing blinders and it has been to your interest take a hunch from me thats all light out now and the less we see of your handsome mug the better well like you  muttering cursing pallid of face hawe climbed astride his horse his comrades followed suit certain it appeared that the sheriff was contending with more than fear and wrath he must have had an irresistible impulse to fling more invective and threat upon stewart but he was speechless savagely he spurred his horse and as it snorted and leaped he turned in his saddle shaking his fist his comrades led the way with their horses clattering into a canter they disappeared through the gate                      when later in the day madeline and florence accompanied by alfred and stillwell left don carloss ranch it was not any too soon for madeline the inside of the mexicans home was more unprepossessing and uncomfortable than the outside the halls were dark the rooms huge empty and musty and there was an air of silence and secrecy and mystery about them most fitting to the character florence had bestowed upon the place  on the other hand alfreds ranchhouse where the party halted to spend the night was picturesquely located small and cozy camplike in its arrangement and altogether agreeable to madeline  the days long rides and the exciting events had wearied her she rested while florence and the two men got supper during the meal stillwell expressed satisfaction over the good riddance of the vaqueros and with his usual optimism trusted he had seen the last of them alfred too took a decidedly favorable view of the days proceedings however it was not lost upon madeline that florence appeared unusually quiet and thoughtful madeline wondered a little at the cause she remembered that stewart had wanted to come with them or detail a few cowboys to accompany them but alfred had laughed at the idea and would have none of it  after supper alfred monopolized the conversation by describing what he wanted to do to improve his home before he and florence were married  then at an early hour they all retired  madelines deep slumbers were disturbed by a pounding upon the wall and then by florences crying out in answer to a call  get up throw some clothes on and come out  it was alfreds voice  whats the matter asked florence as she slipped out of bed  alfred is there anything wrong added madeline sitting up  the room was dark as pitch but a faint glow seemed to mark the position of the window  oh nothing much replied alfred only don carloss rancho going up in smoke  fire cried florence sharply  youll think so when you see it hurry out majesty old girl now you wont have to tear down that heap of adobe as you threatened i dont believe a wall will stand after that fire  well im glad of it said madeline a good healthy fire will purify the atmosphere over there and save me expense ugh that haunted rancho got on my nerves florence i do believe youve appropriated part of my ridinghabit doesnt alfred have lights in this house  florence laughingly helped madeline to dress then they hurriedly stumbled over chairs and passing through the diningroom went out upon the porch  away to the westward low down along the horizon she saw leaping red flames and windswept columns of smoke  stillwell appeared greatly perturbed  al im lookin fer that ammunition to blow up he said there was enough of it to blow the roof off the rancho  bill surely the cowboys would get that stuff out the first thing replied alfred anxiously  i reckon so but all the same im worryin mebbe there wasnt time supposin thet powder went off as the boys was goin fer it or carryin it out well know soon if the explosion doesnt come quick now we can figger the boys got the boxes out  for the next few moments there was a silence of sustained and painful suspense florence gripped madelines arm madeline felt a fullness in her throat and a rapid beating of her heart presently she was relieved with the others when stillwell declared the danger of an explosion needed to be feared no longer  sure you can gamble on gene stewart he added  the night happened to be partly cloudy with broken rifts showing the moon and the wind blew unusually strong the brightness of the fire seemed subdued it was like a huge bonfire smothered by some great covering penetrated by different widely separated points of flame these corners of flame flew up curling in the wind and then died down thus the scene was constantly changing from dull light to dark there came a moment when a blacker shade overspread the wide area of flickering gleams and then obliterated them night enfolded the scene the moon peeped a curved yellow rim from under broken clouds to all appearances the fire had burned itself out but suddenly a pinpoint of light showed where all had been dense black it grew and became long and sharp it moved it had life it leaped up its color warmed from white to red then from all about it burst flame on flame to leap into a great changing pillar of fire that climbed high and higher huge funnels of smoke yellow black white all tinged with the color of fire slanted skyward drifting away on the wind  wal i reckon we wont hev the good of them two thousand tons of alfalfa we was figgerin on remarked stillwell  ah then that last outbreak of fire was burning hay said madeline i do not regret the rancho but its too bad to lose such a quantity of good feed for the stock  its lost an no mistake the fires dyin as quick as she flared up wal i hope none of the boys got risky to save a saddle or blanket montyhes hell on runnin the gantlet of fire hes like a hoss thats jest been dragged out of a burnin stable an runs back sure locoed there shes smolderin down now reckon weall might jest as well turn in again its only three oclock  i wonder how the fire originated remarked alfred some careless cowboys cigarette ill bet  stillwell rolled out his laugh  al you sure are a freehearted trustin feller im some doubtin the cigarette idee but you can gamble if it was a cigarette it belonged to a cunnin vaquero an wasnt dropped accidentlike  now bill you dont mean don carlos burned the rancho ejaculated alfred in mingled amaze and anger  again the old cattleman laughed  powerful strange to say my friend ole bill means jest thet  of course don carlos set that fire put in florence with spirit al if you live out heah a hundred years youll never learn that greasers are treacherous i know gene stewart suspected something underhand thats why he wanted us to hurry away thats why he put me on the black horse of don carloss he wants that horse for himself and feared the don would steal or shoot him and you bill stillwell youre as bad as al you never distrust anybody till its too late youve been singing ever since stewart ordered the vaqueros off the range but you sure havent been thinking  wal now flo you neednt pitch into me jest because i hev a natural christian spirit replied stillwell much aggrieved i reckon ive hed enough trouble in my life sos not to go lookin fer more wal im sorry about the hay burnin but mebbe the boys saved the stock an as fer that ole adobe house of dark holes an underground passages so longs miss majesty doesnt mind im darn glad it burned come lets all turn in again somebodyll ride over early an tell us whats what  madeline awakened early but not so early as the others who were up and had breakfast ready when she went into the diningroom stillwell was not in an amiable frame of mind the furrows of worry lined his broad brow and he continually glanced at his watch and growled because the cowboys were so late in riding over with the news he gulped his breakfast and while madeline and the others ate theirs he tramped up and down the porch madeline noted that alfred grew nervous and restless presently he left the table to join stillwell outside  theyll slope off to don carloss rancho and leave us to ride home alone observed florence  do you mind questioned madeline  no i dont exactly mind weve got the fastest horses in this country id like to run that big black devil off his legs no i dont mind but ive no hankering for a situation gene stewart thinks  florence began disconnectedly and she ended evasively madeline did not press the point although she had some sense of misgiving stillwell tramped in shaking the floor with his huge boots alfred followed him carrying a fieldglass  not a hoss in sight complained stillwell somethin wrong over don carloss way miss majesty itll be jest as well fer you an flo to hit the home trail we can telephone over an see that the boys know youre comin  alfred standing in the door swept the gray valley with his fieldglass  bill i see running stockhorses or cattle i cant make out which i guess wed better rustle over there  both men hurried out and while the horses were being brought up and saddled madeline and florence put away the breakfastdishes then speedily donned spurs sombreros and gauntlets  here are the horses ready called alfred flo that black mexican horse is a prince  the girls went out in time to hear stillwells goodby as he mounted and spurred away alfred went through the motions of assisting madeline and florence to mount which assistance they always flouted and then he too swung up astride  i guess its all right he said rather dubiously you really must not go over toward don carloss its only a few miles home  sure its all right we can ride cant we retorted florence better have a care for yourself going off over there to mix in goodness knows what  alfred said goodby spurred his horse and rode away  if bill didnt forget to telephone exclaimed florence i declare he and al were sure rattled  florence dismounted and went into the house she left the door open madeline had some difficulty in holding majesty it struck madeline that florence stayed rather long indoors presently she came out with sober face and rather tight lips  i couldnt get anybody on the phone no answer i tried a dozen times  why florence madeline was more concerned by the girls looks than by the information she imparted  the wires been cut said florence her gray glance swept swiftly after alfred who was now far out of earshot i dont like this a little bit heahs where ive got to figger as bill says  she pondered a moment then hurried into the house to return presently with the fieldglass that alfred had used with this she took a survey of the valley particularly in the direction of madelines ranchhouse this was hidden by low rolling ridges which were quite close by  anyway nobody in that direction can see us leave heah she mused theres mesquite on the ridges weve got cover long enough to save us till we can see whats ahead  florence whatwhat do you expect asked madeline nervously  i dont know theres never any telling about greasers i wish bill and al hadnt left us still come to think of that they couldnt help us much in case of a chase wed run right away from them besides theyd shoot i guess im as well as satisfied that weve got the job of getting home on our own hands we dont dare follow al toward don carloss ranch we know theres trouble over there so all thats left is to hit the trail for home come lets ride you stick like a spanish needle to me  a heavy growth of mesquite covered the top of the first ridge and the trail went through it florence took the lead proceeding cautiously and as soon as she could see over the summit she used the fieldglass then she went on madeline following closely saw down the slope of the ridge to a bare wide grassy hollow and onward to more rolling land thick with cactus and mesquite florence appeared cautious deliberate yet she lost no time she was ominously silent madelines misgivings took definite shape in the fear of vaqueros in ambush  upon the ascent of the third ridge which madeline remembered was the last uneven ground between the point she had reached and home florence exercised even more guarded care in advancing before she reached the top of this ridge she dismounted looped her bridle round a dead snag and motioning madeline to wait she slipped ahead through the mesquite out of sight madeline waited anxiously listening and watching certain it was that she could not see or hear anything alarming the sun began to have a touch of heat the morning breeze rustled the thin mesquite foliage the deep magenta of a cactus flower caught her eye a longtailed cruelbeaked brown bird sailed so close to her she could have touched it with her whip but she was only vaguely aware of these things she was watching for florence listening for some sound fraught with untoward meaning all of a sudden she saw majestys ears were held straight up then florences face now strangely white showed round the turn of the trail  ssssh whispered florence holding up a warning finger she reached the black horse and petted him evidently to still an uneasiness he manifested were in for it she went on a whole bunch of vaqueros hiding among the mesquite over the ridge theyve not seen or heard us yet wed better risk riding ahead cut off the trail and beat them to the ranch madeline youre white as death dont faint now  i shall not faint but you frighten me is there danger what shall we do  theres danger madeline i wouldnt deceive you went on florence in an earnest whisper things have turned out just as gene stewart hinted oh we shouldal should have listened to gene i believeim afraid gene knew  knew what asked madeline  never mind now listen we darent take the back trail well go on ive a scheme to fool that grinning don carlos get down madelinehurry  madeline dismounted  give me your white sweater take it offand that white hat hurry madeline  florence what on earth do you mean cried madeline  not so loud whispered the other her gray eyes snapped she had divested herself of sombrero and jacket which she held out to madeline heah take these give me yours then get up on the black ill ride majesty rustle now madeline this is no time to talk  but dear whywhy do you want ah youre going to make the vaqueros take you for me  you guessed it will you  i shall not allow you to do anything of the kind returned madeline  it was then that florences face changing took on the hard stern sharpness so typical of a cowboys madeline had caught glimpses of that expression in alfreds face and on stewarts when he was silent and on stillwells always it was a look of iron and fireunchangeable unquenchable will there was even much of violence in the swift action whereby florence compelled madeline to the change of apparel  it d been my idea anyhow if stewart hadnt told me to do it said florence her words as swift as her hands don carlos is after youyou miss madeline hammond he wouldnt ambush a trail for any one else hes not killing cowboys these days he wants you for some reason so gene thought and now i believe him well well know for sure in five minutes you ride the black ill ride majesty well slip round through the brush out of sight and sound till we can break out into the open then well split you make straight for the ranch ill cut loose for the valley where gene said positively the cowboys were with the cattle the vaqueros will take me for you they all know those striking white things you wear theyll chase me theyll never get anywhere near me and youll be on a fast horse he can take you home ahead of any vaqueros but you wont be chased im staking all on that trust me madeline if it were only my calculation maybe idits because i remember stewart that cowboy knows things come this heahs the safest and smartest way to fool don carlos madeline felt herself more forced than persuaded into acquiescence she mounted the black and took up the bridle in another moment she was guiding her horse off the trail in the tracks of majesty florence led off at right angles threading a slow passage through the mesquite she favored sandy patches and open aisles between the trees and was careful not to break a branch often she stopped to listen this detour of perhaps half a mile brought madeline to where she could see open ground the ranchhouse only a few miles off and the cattle dotting the valley she had not lost her courage but it was certain that these familiar sights somewhat lightened the pressure upon her breast excitement gripped her the shrill whistle of a horse made both the black and majesty jump florence quickened the gait down the slope soon madeline saw the edge of the brush the graybleached grass and level ground  florence waited at the opening between the low trees she gave madeline a quick bright glance  all over but the ride thatll sure be easy bolt now and keep your nerve  when florence wheeled the fiery roan and screamed in his ear madeline seemed suddenly to grow lax and helpless the big horse leaped into thundering action this was memorable of bonita of the flying hair and the wild night ride florences hair streamed on the wind and shone gold in the sunlight yet madeline saw her with the same thrill with which she had seen the wildriding bonita then hoarse shouts unclamped madelines power of movement and she spurred the black into the open  he wanted to run and he was swift madeline loosened the reinslaid them loose upon his neck his action was strange to her he was hard to ride but he was fast and she cared for nothing else madeline knew horses well enough to realize that the black had found he was free and carrying a light weight a few times she took up the bridle and pulled to right or left trying to guide him he kept a straight course however and crashed through small patches of mesquite and jumped the cracks and washes uneven ground offered no perceptible obstacle to his running to madeline there was now a thrilling difference in the lash of wind and the flash of the gray ground underneath she was running away from something what that was she did not know but she remembered florence and she wanted to look back yet hated to do so for fear of the nameless danger florence had mentioned  madeline listened for the pounding of pursuing hoofs in her rear involuntarily she glanced back on the mile or more of gray level between her and the ridge there was not a horse a man or anything living she wheeled to look back on the other side down the valley slope  the sight of florence riding majesty in zigzag flight before a whole troop of vaqueros blanched madelines cheek and made her grip the pommel of her saddle in terror that strange gait of her roan was not his wonderful stride could majesty be running wild madeline saw one vaquero draw closer whirling his lasso round his head but he did not get near enough to throw so it seemed to madeline another vaquero swept across in front of the first one then when madeline gasped in breathless expectancy the roan swerved to elude the attack it flashed over madeline that florence was putting the horse to some such awkward flight as might have been expected of an eastern girl frightened out of her wits madeline made sure of this when after looking again she saw that florence in spite of the horses breaking gait and the irregular course was drawing slowly and surely down the valley  madeline had not lost her head to the extent of forgetting her own mount and the nature of the ground in front when presently she turned again to watch florence uncertainty ceased in her mind the strange features of that race between girl and vaqueros were no longer in evidence majesty was in his beautiful wonderful stride low down along the ground stretching with his nose level and straight for the valley between him and the lean horses in pursuit lay an everincreasing space he was running away from the vaqueros florence was indeed riding the wind as stewart had aptly expressed his idea of flight upon the fleet roan  a dimness came over madelines eyes and it was not all owing to the sting of the wind she rubbed it away seeing florence as a flying dot in a strange blur what a daring intrepid girl this kind of strengthand aye splendid thought for a weaker sisterwas what the west inculcated in a woman  the next time madeline looked back florence was far ahead of her pursuers and going out of sight behind a low knoll assured of florences safety madeline put her mind to her own ride and the possibilities awaiting at the ranch she remembered the failure to get any of her servants or cowboys on the telephone to be sure a windstorm had once broken the wire but she had little real hope of such being the case in this instance she rode on pulling the black as she neared the ranch her approach was from the south and off the usual trail so that she went up the long slope of the knoll toward the back of the house under these circumstances she could not consider it out of the ordinary that she did not see any one about the grounds  it was perhaps fortunate for her she thought that the climb up the slope cut the blacks speed so she could manage him he was not very hard to stop the moment she dismounted however he jumped and trotted off at the edge of the slope facing the corrals he halted to lift his head and shoot up his ears then he let out a piercing whistle and dashed down the lane  madeline prepared by that warning whistle tried to fortify herself for a new and unexpected situation but as she espied an unfamiliar company of horsemen rapidly riding down a hollow leading from the foothills she felt the return of fears gripping at her like cold hands and she fled precipitously into the house     xi a band of guerrillas  madeline bolted the door and flying into the kitchen she told the scared servants to shut themselves in then she ran to her own rooms it was only a matter of a few moments for her to close and bar the heavy shutters yet even as she was fastening the last one in the room she used as an office a clattering roar of hoofs seemed to swell up to the front of the house she caught a glimpse of wild shaggy horses and ragged dusty men she had never seen any vaqueros that resembled these horsemen vaqueros had grace and style they were fond of lace and glitter and fringe they dressed their horses in silvered trappings but the riders now trampling into the driveway were uncouth lean savage they were guerrillas a band of the raiders who had been harassing the border since the beginning of the revolution a second glimpse assured madeline that they were not all mexicans  the presence of outlaws in that band brought home to madeline her real danger she remembered what stillwell had told her about recent outlaw raids along the rio grande these flying bands operating under the excitement of the revolution appeared here and there everywhere in remote places and were gone as quickly as they came mostly they wanted money and arms but they would steal anything and unprotected women had suffered at their hands  madeline hurriedly collecting her securities and the considerable money she had in her desk ran out closed and locked the door crossed the patio to the opposite side of the house and entering again went down a long corridor trying to decide which of the many unused rooms would be best to hide in and before she made up her mind she came to the last room just then a battering on door or window in the direction of the kitchen and shrill screams from the servant women increased madelines alarm  she entered the last room there was no lock or bar upon the door but the room was large and dark and it was half full of bales of alfalfa hay probably it was the safest place in the house at least time would be necessary to find any one hidden there she dropped her valuables in a dark corner and covered them with loose hay that done she felt her way down a narrow aisle between the piledup bales and presently crouched in a niche  with the necessity of action over for the immediate present madeline became conscious that she was quivering and almost breathless her skin felt tight and cold there was a weight on her chest her mouth was dry and she had a strange tendency to swallow her listening faculty seemed most acute dull sounds came from parts of the house remote from her in the intervals of silence between these sounds she heard the squeaking and rustling of mice in the hay a mouse ran over her hand  she listened waiting hoping yet dreading to hear the clattering approach of her cowboys there would be fightingbloodmen injured perhaps killed even the thought of violence of any kind hurt her but perhaps the guerrillas would run in time to avoid a clash with her men she hoped for that prayed for it through her mind flitted what she knew of nels of monty of nick steele and she experienced a sensation that left her somewhat chilled and sick then she thought of the darkbrowed fireeyed stewart she felt a thrill drive away the cold nausea and her excitement augmented  waiting listening increased all her emotions nothing appeared to be happening yet hours seemed to pass while she crouched there had florence been overtaken could any of those lean horses outrun majesty she doubted it she knew it could not be true nevertheless the strain of uncertainty was torturing  suddenly the bang of the corridor door pierced her through and through with the dread of uncertainty some of the guerrillas had entered the east wing of the house she heard a babel of jabbering voices the shuffling of boots and clinking of spurs the slamming of doors and ransacking of rooms  madeline lost faith in her hidingplace moreover she found it impossible to take the chance the idea of being caught in that dark room by those ruffians filled her with horror she must get out into the light swiftly she rose and went to the window it was rather more of a door than window being a large aperture closed by two wooden doors on hinges the iron hook yielded readily to her grasp and one door stuck fast while the other opened a few inches she looked out upon a green slope covered with flowers and bunches of sage and bushes neither man nor horse showed in the narrow field of her vision she believed she would be safer hidden out there in the shrubbery than in the house the jump from the window would be easy for her and with her quick decision came a rush and stir of spirit that warded off her weakness  she pulled at the door it did not budge it had caught at the bottom pulling with all her might proved to be in vain pausing with palms hot and bruised she heard a louder closer approach of the invaders of her home fear wrath and impotence contested for supremacy over her and drove her to desperation she was alone here and she must rely on herself and as she strained every muscle to move that obstinate door and heard the quick harsh voices of men and the sounds of a hurried search she suddenly felt sure that they were hunting for her she knew it she did not wonder at it but she wondered if she were really madeline hammond and if it were possible that brutal men would harm her then the tramping of heavy feet on the floor of the adjoining room lent her the last strength of fear pushing with hands and shoulders she moved the door far enough to permit the passage of her body then she stepped up on the sill and slipped through the aperture she saw no one lightly she jumped down and ran in among the bushes but these did not afford her the cover she needed she stole from one clump to another finding too late that she had chosen with poor judgment the position of the bushes had drawn her closer to the front of the house rather than away from it and just before her were horses and beyond a group of excited men with her heart in her throat madeline crouched down  a shrill yell followed by running and mounting guerrillas roused her hope they had sighted the cowboys and were in flight rapid thumping of boots on the porch told of men hurrying from the house several horses dashed past her not ten feet distant one rider saw her for he turned to shout back this drove madeline into a panic hardly knowing what she did she began to run away from the house her feet seemed leaden she felt the same horrible powerlessness that sometimes came over her when she dreamed of being pursued horses with shouting riders streaked past her in the shrubbery there was a thunder of hoofs behind her she turned aside but the thundering grew nearer she was being run down  as madeline shut her eyes and staggering was about to fall apparently right under pounding hoofs a rude powerful hand clapped round her waist clutched deep and strong and swung her aloft she felt a heavy blow when the shoulder of the horse struck her and then a wrenching of her arm as she was dragged up a sudden blighting pain made sight and feeling fade from her  but she did not become unconscious to the extent that she lost the sense of being rapidly borne away she seemed to hold that for a long time when her faculties began to return the motion of the horse was no longer violent for a few moments she could not determine her position apparently she was upside down then she saw that she was facing the ground and must be lying across a saddle with her head hanging down she could not move a hand she could not tell where her hands were then she felt the touch of soft leather she saw a hightopped mexican boot wearing a huge silver spur and the reeking flank and legs of a horse and a dusty narrow trail soon a kind of red darkness veiled her eyes her head swam and she felt motion and pain only dully  after what seemed a thousand weary hours some one lifted her from the horse and laid her upon the ground where gradually as the blood left her head and she could see she began to get the right relation of things  she lay in a sparse grove of firs and the shadows told of late afternoon she smelled wood smoke and she heard the sharp crunch of horses teeth nipping grass voices caused her to turn her face a group of men stood and sat round a campfire eating like wolves the looks of her captors made madeline close her eyes and the fascination the fear they roused in her made her open them again mostly they were thinbodied thinbearded mexicans black and haggard and starved whatever they might be they surely were hungerstricken and squalid not one had a coat a few had scarfs some wore belts in which were scattered cartridges only a few had guns and these were of diverse patterns madeline could see no packs no blankets and only a few cookingutensils all battered and blackened her eyes fastened upon men she believed were white men but it was from their features and not their color that she judged once she had seen a band of nomad robbers in the sahara and somehow was reminded of them by this motley outlaw troop  they divided attention between the satisfying of ravenous appetites and a vigilant watching down the forest aisles they expected some one madeline thought and manifestly if it were a pursuing posse they did not show anxiety she could not understand more than a word here and there that they uttered presently however the name of don carlos revived keen curiosity in her and realization of her situation and then once more dread possessed her breast  a low exclamation and a sweep of arm from one of the guerrillas caused the whole band to wheel and concentrate their attention in the opposite direction they heard something they saw some one grimy hands sought weapons and then every man stiffened madeline saw what hunted men looked like at the moment of discovery and the sight was terrible she closed her eyes sick with what she saw fearful of the moment when the guns would leap out  there were muttered curses a short period of silence followed by whisperings and then a clear voice rang out el capitan  a strong shock vibrated through madeline and her eyelids swept open instantly she associated the name el capitan with stewart and experienced a sensation of strange regret it was not pursuit or rescue she thought of then but death these men would kill stewart but surely he had not come alone the lean dark faces corded and rigid told her in what direction to look she heard the slow heavy thump of hoofs soon into the wide aisle between the trees moved the form of a man arms flung high over his head then madeline saw the horse and she recognized majesty and she knew it was really stewart who rode the roan when doubt was no longer possible she felt a suffocating sense of gladness and fear and wonder  many of the guerrillas leaped up with drawn weapons still stewart approached with his hands high and he rode right into the campfire circle then a guerrilla evidently the chief waved down the threatening men and strode up to stewart he greeted him there was amaze and pleasure and respect in the greeting madeline could tell that though she did not know what was said at the moment stewart appeared to her as cool and careless as if he were dismounting at her porch steps but when he got down she saw that his face was white he shook hands with the guerrilla and then his glittering eyes roved over the men and around the glade until they rested upon madeline without moving from his tracks he seemed to leap as if a powerful current had shocked him madeline tried to smile to assure him she was alive and well but the intent in his eyes the power of his controlled spirit telling her of her peril and his froze the smile on her lips  with that he faced the chief and spoke rapidly in the mexican jargon madeline had always found so difficult to translate the chief answered spreading wide his hands one of which indicated madeline as she lay there stewart drew the fellow a little aside and said something for his ear alone the chiefs hands swept up in a gesture of surprise and acquiescence again stewart spoke swiftly his hearer then turned to address the band madeline caught the words don carlos and pesos there was a brief muttering protest which the chief thundered down madeline guessed her release had been given by this guerrilla and bought from the others of the band  stewart strode to her side leading the roan majesty reared and snorted when he saw his mistress prostrate stewart knelt still holding the bridle  are you all right he asked  i think so she replied essaying a laugh that was rather a failure my feet are tied  dark blood blotted out all the white from his face and lightning shot from his eyes she felt his hands like steel tongs loosening the bonds round her ankles without a word he lifted her upright and then upon majesty madeline reeled a little in the saddle held hard to the pommel with one hand and tried to lean on stewarts shoulder with the other  dont give up he said  she saw him gaze furtively into the forest on all sides and it surprised her to see the guerrillas riding away putting the two facts together madeline formed an idea that neither stewart nor the others desired to meet with some one evidently due shortly in the glade stewart guided the roan off to the right and walked beside madeline steadying her in the saddle at first madeline was so weak and dizzy that she could scarcely retain her seat the dizziness left her presently and then she made an effort to ride without help her weakness however and a pain in her wrenched arm made the task laborsome  stewart had struck off the trail if there were one and was keeping to denser parts of the forest the sun sank low and the shafts of gold fell with a long slant among the firs majestys hoofs made no sound on the soft ground and stewart strode on without speaking neither his hurry nor vigilance relaxed until at least two miles had been covered then he held to a straighter course and did not send so many glances into the darkening woods the level of the forest began to be cut up by little hollows all of which sloped and widened presently the soft ground gave place to bare rocky soil the horse snorted and tossed his head a sound of splashing water broke the silence the hollow opened into a wider one through which a little brook murmured its way over the stones majesty snorted again and stopped and bent his head  he wants a drink said madeline im thirsty too and very tired  stewart lifted her out of the saddle and as their hands parted she felt something moist and warm blood was running down her arm and into the palm of her hand  imbleeding she said a little unsteadily oh i remember my arm was hurt  she held it out the blood making her conscious of her weakness stewarts fingers felt so firm and sure swiftly he ripped the wet sleeve her forearm had been cut or scratched he washed off the blood  why stewart its nothing i was only a little nervous i guess thats the first time i ever saw my own blood  he made no reply as he tore her handkerchief into strips and bound her arm his swift motions and his silence gave her a hint of how he might meet a more serious emergency she felt safe and because of that impression when he lifted his head and she saw that he was pale and shaking she was surprised he stood before her folding his scarf which was still wet and from which he made no effort to remove the red stains  miss hammond he said hoarsely it was a mans handsa greasers fingernailsthat cut your arm i know who he was i could have killed him but i mightnt have got your freedom you understand i didnt dare  madeline gazed at stewart astounded more by his speech than his excessive emotion  my dear boy she exclaimed and then she paused she could not find words  he was making an apology to her for not killing a man who had laid a rough hand upon her person he was ashamed and seemed to be in a torture that she would not understand why he had not killed the man there seemed to be something of passionate scorn in him that he had not been able to avenge her as well as free her  stewart i understand you were being my kind of cowboy i thank you  but she did not understand so much as she implied she had heard many stories of this mans cool indifference to peril and death he had always seemed as hard as granite why should the sight of a little blood upon her arm pale his cheek and shake his hand and thicken his voice what was there in his nature to make him implore her to see the only reason he could not kill an outlaw the answer to the first question was that he loved her it was beyond her to answer the second but the secret of it lay in the same strength from which his love sprangan intensity of feeling which seemed characteristic of these western men of simple lonely elemental lives all at once over madeline rushed a tide of realization of how greatly it was possible for such a man as stewart to love her the thought came to her in all its singular power all her eastern lovers who had the graces that made them her equals in the sight of the world were without the only great essential that a lonely hard life had given to stewart nature here struck a just balance something deep and dim in the future an unknown voice called to madeline and disturbed her and because it was not a voice to her intelligence she deadened the ears of her warm and throbbing life and decided never to listen  is it safe to rest a little she asked i am so tired perhaps ill be stronger if i rest  were all right now he said the horse will be better too i ran him out and uphill at that  where are we  up in the mountains ten miles and more from the ranch theres a trail just below here i can get you home by midnight theyll be some worried down there  what happened  nothing much to any one but you thats thethe hard luck of it florence caught us out on the slope we were returning from the fire we were dead beat but we got to the ranch before any damage was done we sure had trouble in finding a trace of you nick spotted the prints of your heels under the window and then we knew i had to fight the boys if theyd come after you wed never have gotten you without a fight i didnt want that old bill came out packing a dozen guns he was crazy i had to rope monty honest i tied him to the porch nels and nick promised to stay and hold him till morning that was the best i could do i was sure lucky to come up with the band so soon i had figured right i knew that guerrilla chief hes a bandit in mexico its a business with him but he fought for madero and i was with him a good deal he may be a greaser but hes white  how did you effect my release  i offered them money thats what the rebels all want they need money theyre a lot of poor hungry devils  i gathered that you offered to pay ransom how much  two thousand dollars mex i gave my word ill have to take the money i told them when and where id meet them  certainly im glad ive got the money madeline laughed what a strange thing to happen to me i wonder what dad would say to that stewart im afraid hed say two thousand dollars is more than im worth but tell me that rebel chieftain did not demand money  no the money is for his men  what did you say to him i saw you whisper in his ear  stewart dropped his head averting her direct gaze  we were comrades before juarez one day i dragged him out of a ditch i reminded him then ii told him something ii thought  stewart i know from the way he looked at me that you spoke of me  her companion did not offer a reply to this and madeline did not press the point  i heard don carloss name several times that interests me what have don carlos and his vaqueros to do with this  that greaser has all to do with it replied stewart grimly he burned his ranch and corrals to keep us from getting them but he also did it to draw all the boys away from your home they had a deep plot all right i left orders for some one to stay with you but al and stillwell whore both hotheaded rode off this morning then the guerrillas came down  well what was the ideathe plotas you call it  to get you he said bluntly  me stewart you do not mean my capturewhatever you call itwas anything more than mere accident  i do mean that but stillwell and your brother think the guerrillas wanted money and arms and they just happened to make off with you because you ran under a horses nose  you do not incline to that point of view  i dont neither does nels nor nick steele and we know don carlos and the greasers look how the vaqueros chased flo for you  what do you think then  id rather not say  but stewart i would like to know if it is about me surely i ought to know protested madeline what reason have nels and nick to suspect don carlos of plotting to abduct me  i suppose theyve no reason youd take once i heard nels say hed seen the greaser look at you and if he ever saw him do it again hed shoot him  why stewart that is ridiculous to shoot a man for looking at a woman this is a civilized country  well maybe it would be ridiculous in a civilized country theres some things about civilization i dont care for  what for instance  for one thing i cant stand for the way men let other men treat women  but stewart this is strange talk from you who that night i came  she broke off sorry that she had spoken his shame was not pleasant to see suddenly he lifted his head and she felt scorched by flaming eyes  suppose i was drunk suppose i had met some ordinary girl suppose i had really made her marry me dont you think i would have stopped being a drunkard and have been good to her  stewart i do not know what to think about you replied madeline  then followed a short silence madeline saw the last bright rays of the setting sun glide up over a distant crag stewart rebridled the horse and looked at the saddlegirths  i got off the trail about don carlos ill say right out not what nels and nick think but what i know don carlos hoped to make off with you for himself the same as if you had been a poor peon slavegirl down in sonora maybe he had a deeper plot than my rebel friend told me maybe he even went so far as to hope for american troops to chase him the rebels are trying to stir up the united states theyd welcome intervention but however that may be the greaser meant evil to you and has meant it ever since he saw you first thats all  stewart you have done me and my family a service we can never hope to repay  ive done the service only dont mention pay to me but theres one thing id like you to know and i find it hard to say its prompted maybe by what i know you think of me and what i imagine your family and friends would think if they knew its not prompted by pride or conceit and its this such a woman as you should never have come to this godforsaken country unless she meant to forget herself but as you did come and as you were dragged away by those devils i want you to know that all your wealth and position and influenceall that power behind youwould never have saved you from hell tonight only such a man as nels or nick steele or i could have done that  madeline hammond felt the great leveling force of the truth whatever the difference between her and stewart or whatever the imagined difference set up by false standards of class and culture the truth was that here on this wild mountainside she was only a woman and he was simply a man it was a man that she needed and if her choice could have been considered in this extremity it would have fallen upon him who had just faced her in quiet bitter speech here was food for thought  i reckon wed better start now he said and drew the horse close to a large rock come  madelines will greatly exceeded her strength for the first time she acknowledged to herself that she had been hurt still she did not feel much pain except when she moved her shoulder once in the saddle where stewart lifted her she drooped weakly the way was rough every step the horse took hurt her and the slope of the ground threw her forward on the pommel presently as the slope grew rockier and her discomfort increased she forgot everything except that she was suffering  here is the trail said stewart at length  not far from that point madeline swayed and but for stewarts support would have fallen from the saddle she heard him swear under his breath  here this wont do he said throw your leg over the pommel the other onethere  then mounting he slipped behind her and lifted and turned her and then held her with his left arm so that she lay across the saddle and his knees her head against his shoulder  as the horse started into a rapid walk madeline gradually lost all pain and discomfort when she relaxed her muscles presently she let herself go and lay inert greatly to her relief for a little while she seemed to be half drunk with the gentle swaying of a hammock her mind became at once dreamy and active as if it thoughtfully recorded the slow soft impressions pouring in from all her senses  a red glow faded in the west she could see out over the foothills where twilight was settling gray on the crests dark in the hollows cedar and pinyon trees lined the trail and there were no more firs at intervals huge drabcolored rocks loomed over her the sky was clear and steely a faint star twinkled and lastly close to her she saw stewarts face once more dark and impassive with the inscrutable eyes fixed on the trail  his arm like a band of iron held her yet it was flexible and yielded her to the motion of the horse one instant she felt the brawn the bone heavy and powerful the next the stretch and ripple the elasticity of muscles he held her as easily as if she were a child the roughness of his flannel shirt rubbed her cheek and beneath that she felt the dampness of the scarf he had used to bathe her arm and deeper still the regular pound of his heart against her ear filling it with strong vibrant beat his heart seemed a mighty engine deep within a great cavern her head had never before rested on a mans breast and she had no liking for it there but she felt more than the physical contact the position was mysterious and fascinating and something natural in it made her think of life then as the cool wind blew down from the heights loosening her tumbled hair she was compelled to see strands of it curl softly into stewarts face before his eyes across his lips she was unable to reach it with her free hand and therefore could not refasten it and when she shut her eyes she felt those loosened strands playing against his cheeks  in the keener press of such sensations she caught the smell of dust and a faint wild sweet tang on the air there was a low rustling sigh of wind in the brush along the trail suddenly the silence ripped apart to the sharp bark of a coyote and then from far away came a long wail and then majestys metalrimmed hoof rang on a stone  these later things lent probability to that ride for madeline otherwise it would have seemed like a dream even so it was hard to believe again she wondered if this woman who had begun to think and feel so much was madeline hammond nothing had ever happened to her and here playing about her like her hair played about stewarts face was adventure perhaps death and surely life she could not believe the evidence of the days happenings would any of her people her friends ever believe it could she tell it how impossible to think that a cunning mexican might have used her to further the interests of a forlorn revolution she remembered the ghoulish visages of those starved rebels and marveled at her blessed fortune in escaping them she was safe and now selfpreservation had some meaning for her stewarts arrival in the glade the courage with which he had faced the outlawed men grew as real to her now as the iron arm that clasped her had it been an instinct which had importuned her to save this man when he lay ill and hopeless in the shack at chiricahua in helping him had she hedged round her forces that had just operated to save her life or if not that more than life was to her she believed so  madeline opened her eyes after a while and found that night had fallen the sky was a dark velvety blue blazing with white stars the cool wind tugged at her hair and through waving strands she saw stewarts profile bold and sharp against the sky  then as her mind succumbed to her bodily fatigue again her situation became unreal and wild a heavy languor like a blanket began to steal upon her she wavered and drifted with the last halfconscious sense of a muffled throb at her ear a something intangibly sweet deeptoned and strange like a distant calling bell she fell asleep with her head on stewarts breast     xii friends from the east  three days after her return to the ranch madeline could not discover any physical discomfort as a reminder of her adventurous experiences this surprised her but not nearly so much as the fact that after a few weeks she found she scarcely remembered the adventures at all if it had not been for the quiet and persistent guardianship of her cowboys she might almost have forgotten don carlos and the raiders madeline was assured of the splendid physical fitness to which this ranch life had developed her and that she was assimilating something of the western disregard of danger a hard ride an accident a day in the sun and dust an adventure with outlawsthese might once have been matters of large import but now for madeline they were in order with all the rest of her changed life  there was never a day that something interesting was not brought to her notice stillwell who had ceaselessly reproached himself for riding away the morning madeline was captured grew more like an anxious parent than a faithful superintendent he was never at ease regarding her unless he was near the ranch or had left stewart there or else nels and nick steele naturally he trusted more to stewart than to any one else  miss majesty its sure amazin strange about gene said the old cattleman as he tramped into madelines office  whats the matter now she inquired  wal gene has rustled off into the mountains again  again i did not know he had gone i gave him money for that band of guerrillas perhaps he went to take it to them  no he took that a day or so after he fetched you back home then in about a week he went a second time an he packed some stuff with him now hes sneaked off an nels who was down to the lower trail saw him meet somebody that looked like padre marcos wal i went down to the church and sure enough padre marcos is gone what do you think of that miss majesty  maybe stewart is getting religious laughed madeline you told me so once  stillwell puffed and wiped his red face  if youd heerd him cuss monty this mawnin youd never guess it was religion monty an nels hev been givin gene a lot of trouble lately theyre both sore an in fightin mood ever since don carlos hed you kidnapped sure theyre goin to break soon an then well hev a couple of wild texas steers ridin the range ive a heap to worry me  let stewart take his mysterious trips into the mountains here stillwell i have news for you that may give you reason for worry i have letters from home and my sister with a party of friends is coming out to visit me they are society folk and one of them is an english lord  wal miss majesty i reckon well all be glad to see them said stillwell onless they pack you off back east  that isnt likely replied madeline thoughtfully i must go back some time though well let me read you a few extracts from my mail  madeline took up her sisters letter with a strange sensation of how easily sight of a crested monogram and scent of delicately perfumed paper could recall the brilliant life she had given up she scanned the pages of beautiful handwriting helens letter was in turn gay and brilliant and lazy just as she was herself but madeline detected more of curiosity in it than of real longing to see the sister and brother in the far west much of what helen wrote was enthusiastic anticipation of the fun she expected to have with bashful cowboys helen seldom wrote letters and she never read anything not even popular novels of the day she was as absolutely ignorant of the west as the englishman who she said expected to hunt buffalo and fight indians moreover there was a satiric note in the letter that madeline did not like and which roused her spirit manifestly helen was reveling in the prospect of new sensation  when she finished reading aloud a few paragraphs the old cattleman snorted and his face grew redder  did your sister write that he asked  yes  wal ii beg pawdin miss majesty but it doesnt seem like you does she think were a lot of wild men from borneo  evidently she does i rather think she is in for a surprise now stillwell you are clever and you can see the situation i want my guests to enjoy their stay here but i do not want that to be at the expense of the feelings of all of us or even any one helen will bring a lively crowd theyll crave excitementthe unusual let us see that they are not disappointed you take the boys into your confidence tell them what to expect and tell them how to meet it i shall help you in that i want the boys to be on dressparade when they are off duty i want them to be on their most elegant behavior i do not care what they do what measures they take to protect themselves what tricks they contrive so long as they do not overstep the limit of kindness and courtesy i want them to play their parts seriously naturally as if they had lived no other way my guests expect to have fun let us meet them with fun now what do you say  stillwell rose his great bulk towering his huge face beaming  wal i say its the most amazin fine idee i ever heerd in my life  indeed i am glad you like it went on madeline  come to me again stillwell after you have spoken to the boys but now that i have suggested it i am a little afraid you know what cowboy fun is perhaps  dont you go back on that idee interrupted stillwell he was assuring and bland but his hurry to convince madeline betrayed him leave the boys to me why dont they all swear by you same as the mexicans do to the virgin they wont disgrace you miss majesty theyll be simply immense itll beat any show you ever seen  i believe it will replied madeline she was still doubtful of her plan but the enthusiasm of the old cattleman was infectious and irresistible very well we will consider it settled my guests will arrive on may ninth meanwhile let us get her majestys rancho in shape for this invasion                      on the afternoon of the ninth of may perhaps half an hour after madeline had received a telephone message from link stevens announcing the arrival of her guests at el cajon florence called her out upon the porch stillwell was there with his face wrinkled by his wonderful smile and his eagle eyes riveted upon the distant valley far away perhaps twenty miles a thin streak of white dust rose from the valley floor and slanted skyward  look said florence excitedly  what is that asked madeline  link stevens and the automobile  oh no why its only a few minutes since he telephoned saying the party had just arrived  take a look with the glasses said florence  one glance through the powerful binoculars convinced madeline that florence was right and another glance at stillwell told her that he was speechless with delight she remembered a little conversation she had had with link stevens a short while previous  stevens i hope the car is in good shape she had said now miss hammond shes as right as the besttrained hoss i ever rode he had replied  the valley road is perfect she had gone on musingly i never saw such a beautiful road even in france no fences no ditches no rocks no vehicles just a lonely road on the desert  shore its lonely stevens had answered with slowly brightening eyes an safe miss hammond  my sister used to like fast riding if i remember correctly all of my guests were a little afflicted with the speed mania it is a common disease with newyorkers i hope stevens that you will not give them reason to think we are altogether steeped in the slow dreamy manana languor of the southwest  link doubtfully eyed her and then his bronze face changed its dark aspect and seemed to shine  beggin your pardon miss hammond thets shore tall talk fer link stevens to savvy you meanas long as i drive careful an safe i can run away from my dust so to say an get here in somethin less than the greasers tomorrow  madeline had laughed her assent and now as she watched the thin streak of dust at that distance moving with snail pace she reproached herself she trusted stevens she had never known so skilful daring and ironnerved a driver as he was if she had been in the car herself she would have had no anxiety but imagining what stevens would do on forty miles and more of that desert road madeline suffered a prick of conscience  oh stillwell she exclaimed i am afraid i will go back on my wonderful idea what made me do it  your sister wanted the real thing didnt she said they all wanted it wal i reckon theyve begun gettin it replied stillwell  that statement from the cattleman allayed madelines pangs of conscience she understood just what she felt though she could not have put it in words she was hungry for a sight of wellremembered faces she longed to hear the soft laughter and gay repartee of old friends she was eager for gossipy firsthand news of her old world nevertheless something in her sisters letter in messages from the others who were coming had touched madelines pride in one sense the expected guests were hostile inasmuch as they were scornful and curious about the west that had claimed her she imagined what they would expect in a western ranch they would surely get the real thing too as stillwell said and in that certainty was satisfaction for a small grain of something within madeline which approached resentment she wistfully wondered however if her sister or friends would come to see the west even a little as she saw it that perhaps would he hoping too much she resolved once for all to do her best to give them the sensation their senses craved and equally to show them the sweetness and beauty and wholesomeness and strength of life in the southwest  wal as nels says i wouldnt be in that there ottomobile right now for a million pesos remarked stillwell  why is stevens driving fast  good lord fast miss majesty there haint ever been anythin except a streak of lightnin run so fast in this country ill bet link for once is in heaven i can jest see him now the grim crookedlegged little devil hunchin down over that wheel as if it was a hosss neck  i told him not to let the ride be hot or dusty remarked madeline  haw haw roared stillwell wal ill be goin i reckon id like to be hyar when link drives up but i want to be with the boys down by the bunks itll be some fun to see nels an monty when link comes flyin along  i wish al had stayed to meet them said madeline  her brother had rather hurried a shipment of cattle to california and it was madelines supposition that he had welcomed the opportunity to absent himself from the ranch  i am sorry he wouldnt stay replied florence but als all business now and hes doing finely its just as well perhaps  surely that was my pride speaking i would like to have all my family and all my old friends see what a man al has become well link stevens is running like the wind the car will be here before we know it florence weve only a few moments to dress but first i want to order many and various and exceedingly cold refreshments for that approaching party  less than a halfhour later madeline went again to the porch and found florence there  oh you look just lovely exclaimed florence impulsively as she gazed wideeyed up at madeline and somehow so different  madeline smiled a little sadly perhaps when she had put on that exquisite white gown something had come to her of the manner which befitted the wearing of it she could not resist the desire to look fair once more in the eyes of these hypercritical friends the sad smile had been for the days that were gone for she knew that what society had once been pleased to call her beauty had trebled since it had last been seen in a drawingroom madeline wore no jewels but at her waist she had pinned two great crimson roses against the dead white they had the life and fire and redness of the desert  links hit the old roundup trail said florence and oh isnt he riding that car  with florence as with most of the cowboys the car was never driven but ridden  a white spot with a long trail of dust showed low down in the valley it was now headed almost straight for the ranch madeline watched it growing larger moment by moment and her pleasurable emotion grew accordingly then the rapid beat of a horses hoofs caused her to turn  stewart was riding in on his black horse he had been absent on an important mission and his duty had taken him to the international boundaryline his presence home long before he was expected was particularly gratifying to madeline for it meant that his mission had been brought to a successful issue once more for the hundredth time the mans reliability struck madeline he was a doer of things the black horse halted wearily without the usual pound of hoofs on the gravel and the dusty rider dismounted wearily both horse and rider showed the heat and dust and wind of many miles  madeline advanced to the porch steps and stewart after taking a parcel of papers from a saddlebag turned toward her  stewart you are the best of couriers she said i am pleased  dust streamed from his sombrero as he doffed it his dark face seemed to rise as he straightened weary shoulders  here are the reports miss hammond he replied  as he looked up to see her standing there dressed to receive her eastern guests he checked his advance with a violent action which recalled to madeline the one he had made on the night she had met him when she disclosed her identity it was not fear nor embarrassment nor awkwardness and it was only momentary yet slight as had been his pause madeline received from it an impression of some strong halting force a man struck by a bullet might have had an instant jerk of muscular control such as convulsed stewart in that instant as her keen gaze searched his dustcaked face she met the full free look of his eyes her own did not fall though she felt a warmth steal to her cheeks madeline very seldom blushed and now conscious of her sudden color a genuine blush flamed on her face it was irritating because it was incomprehensible she received the papers from stewart and thanked him he bowed then led the black down the path toward the corrals  when stewart looks like that hes been riding said florence but when his horse looks like that hes sure been burning the wind  madeline watched the weary horse and rider limp down the path what had made her thoughtful mostly it was something new or sudden or inexplicable that stirred her mind to quick analysis in this instance the thing that had struck madeline was stewarts glance he had looked at her and the old burning inscrutable fire the darkness had left his eyes suddenly they had been beautiful the look had not been one of surprise or admiration nor had it been one of love she was familiar too familiar with all three it had not been a gaze of passion for there was nothing beautiful in that madeline pondered and presently she realized that stewarts eyes had expressed a strange joy of pride that expression madeline had never before encountered in the look of any man probably its strangeness had made her notice it and accounted for her blushing the longer she lived among these outdoor men the more they surprised her particularly how incomprehensible was this cowboy stewart why should he have pride or joy at sight of her  florences exclamation made madeline once more attend to the approaching automobile it was on the slope now some miles down the long gradual slant two yellow funnelshaped clouds of dust seemed to shoot out from behind the car and roll aloft to join the column that stretched down the valley  i wonder what riding a mile a minute would be like said florence ill sure make link take me oh but look at him come  the giant car resembled a white demon and but for the dust would have appeared to be sailing in the air its motion was steadily forward holding to the road as if on rails and its velocity was astounding long gray veils like pennants streamed in the wind a low rushing sound became perceptible and it grew louder became a roar the car shot like an arrow past the alfalfafield by the bunkhouses where the cowboys waved and cheered the horses and burros in the corrals began to snort and tramp and race in fright at the base of the long slope of the foothill link cut the speed more than half yet the car roared up rolling the dust flying capes and veils and ulsters and crashed and cracked to a halt in the yard before the porch  madeline descried a gray disheveled mass of humanity packed inside the car besides the driver there were seven occupants and for a moment they appeared to be coming to life moving and exclaiming under the veils and wraps and dustshields  link stevens stepped out and removing helmet and goggles coolly looked at his watch  an hour an a quarter miss hammond he said its sixtythree miles by the valley road an you know theres a couple of bad hills i reckon we made fair time considerin you wanted me to drive slow an safe  from the mass of dustyveiled humanity in the car came low exclamations and plaintive feminine wails  madeline stepped to the front of the porch then the deep voices of men and softer voices of women united in one glad outburst as much a thanksgiving as a greeting majesty              helen hammond was three years younger than madeline and a slender pretty girl she did not resemble her sister except in whiteness and fineness of skin being more of a browneyed brownhaired type having recovered her breath soon after madeline took her to her room she began to talk  majesty old girl im here but you can bet i would never have gotten here if i had known about that ride from the railroad you never wrote that you had a car i thought this was out weststagecoach and all that sort of thing such a tremendous car and the road and that terrible little man with the leather trousers what kind of a chauffeur is he  hes a cowboy he was crippled by falling under his horse so i had him instructed to run the car he can drive dont you think  drive good gracious he scared us to death except castleton nothing could scare that coldblooded little englishman i am dizzy yet do you know majesty i was delighted when i saw the car then your cowboy driver met us at the platform what a queerlooking individual he had a big pistol strapped to those leather trousers that made me nervous when he piled us all in with our grips he put me in the seat beside him whether i liked it or not i was fool enough to tell him i loved to travel fast what do you think he said well he eyed me in a rather cool and speculative way and said with a smile miss i reckon anything you love an want bad will be coming to you out here i didnt know whether it was delightful candor or impudence then he said to all of us shore you had better wrap up in the veils an dusters its a long slow hot dusty ride to the ranch an miss hammonds order was to drive safe he got our baggage checks and gave them to a man with a huge wagon and a fourhorse team then he cranked the car jumped in wrapped his arms round the wheel and sank down low in his seat there was a crack a jerk a kind of flash around us and that dirty little town was somewhere on the map behind for about five minutes i had a lovely time then the wind began to tear me to pieces i couldnt hear anything but the rush of wind and roar of the car i could see only straight ahead what a road i never saw a road in my life till today miles and miles and miles ahead with not even a post or tree that big car seemed to leap at the miles it hummed and sang i was fascinated then terrified we went so fast i couldnt catch my breath the wind went through me and i expected to be disrobed by it any minute i was afraid i couldnt hold any clothes on presently all i could see was a flashing gray wall with a white line in the middle then my eyes blurred my face burned my ears grew full of a hundred thousand howling devils i was about ready to die when the car stopped i looked and looked and when i could see there you stood  helen i thought you were fond of speeding said madeline with a laugh  i was but i assure you i never before was in a fast car i never saw a road i never met a driver  perhaps i may have a few surprises for you out here in the wild and woolly west  helens dark eyes showed a sisters memory of possibilities  youve started well she said i am simply stunned i expected to find you old and dowdy majesty youre the handsomest thing i ever laid eyes on youre so splendid and strong and your skin is like white gold whats happened to you whats changed you this beautiful room those glorious roses out there the cool dark sweetness of this wonderful house i know you majesty and though you never wrote it i believe you have made a home out here thats the most stunning surprise of all come confess i know ive always been selfish and not much of a sister but if you are happy out here i am glad you were not happy at home tell me about yourself and about alfred then i shall give you all the messages and news from the east  it afforded madeline exceeding pleasure to have from one and all of her guests varied encomiums of her beautiful home and a real and warm interest in what promised to be a delightful and memorable visit  of them all castleton was the only one who failed to show surprise he greeted her precisely as he had when he had last seen her in london madeline rather to her astonishment found meeting him again pleasurable she discovered she liked this imperturbable englishman manifestly her capacity for liking any one had immeasurably enlarged quite unexpectedly her old girlish love for her younger sister sprang into life and with it interest in these halfforgotten friends and a warm regard for edith wayne a chum of college days  helens party was smaller than madeline had expected it to be helen had been careful to select a company of good friends all of whom were well known to madeline edith wayne was a patrician brunette a serious softvoiced woman sweet and kindly despite a rather bitter experience that had left her worldly wise mrs carrollton beck a plain lively person had chaperoned the party the fourth and last of the feminine contingent was miss dorothy coombsdot as they called hera young woman of attractive blond prettiness  for a man castleton was of very small stature he had a pinkandwhite complexion a small golden mustache and his heavy eyelids always drooping made him look dull his attire cut to what appeared to be an exaggerated english style attracted attention to his diminutive size he was immaculate and fastidious robert weede was a rather large florid young man remarkable only for his good nature counting boyd harvey a handsome palefaced fellow with the careless smile of the man for whom life had been easy and pleasant the party was complete  dinner was a happy hour especially for the mexican women who served it and who could not fail to note its success the mingling of low voices and laughter the old gay superficial talk the graciousness of a class which lived for the pleasure of things and to make time pass pleasurably for othersall took madeline far back into the past she did not care to return to it but she saw that it was well she had not wholly cut herself off from her people and friends  when the party adjourned to the porch the heat had markedly decreased and the red sun was sinking over the red desert an absence of spoken praise a gradually deepening silence attested to the impression on the visitors of that noble sunset just as the last curve of red rim vanished beyond the dim sierra madres and the golden lightning began to flare brighter helen broke the silence with an exclamation  it wants only life ah theres a horse climbing the hill see hes up he has a rider  madeline knew before she looked the identity of the man riding up the mesa but she did not know until that moment how the habit of watching for him at this hour had grown upon her he rode along the rim of the mesa and out to the point where against the golden background horse and rider stood silhouetted in bold relief  whats he doing there who is he inquired the curious helen  that is stewart my righthand man replied madeline every day when he is at the ranch he rides up there at sunset i think he likes the ride and the scene but he goes to take a look at the cattle in the valley  is he a cowboy asked helen  indeed yes replied madeline with a little laugh you will think so when stillwell gets hold of you and begins to talk  madeline found it necessary to explain who stillwell was and what he thought of stewart and while she was about it of her own accord she added a few details of stewarts fame  el capitan how interesting mused helen what does he look like  he is superb  florence handed the fieldglass to helen and bade her look  oh thank you said helen as she complied there i see him indeed he is superb what a magnificent horse how still he stands why he seems carved in stone  let me look said dorothy coombs eagerly  helen gave her the glass  you can look dot but thats all hes mine i saw him first  whereupon madelines feminine guests held a spirited contest over the fieldglass and three of them made gay bantering boasts not to consider helens selfasserted rights madeline laughed with the others while she watched the dark figure of stewart and his black outline against the sky there came over her a thought not by any means new or strangeshe wondered what was in stewarts mind as he stood there in the solitude and faced the desert and the darkening west some day she meant to ask him presently he turned the horse and rode down into the shadow creeping up the mesa  majesty have you planned any fun any excitement for us asked helen she was restless nervous and did not seem to be able to sit still a moment  you will think so when i get through with you replied madeline  what for instance inquired helen and dot and mrs beck in unison edith wayne smiled her interest  well i am not counting rides and climbs and golf but these are necessary to train you for trips over into arizona i want to show you the desert and the aravaipa canyon we have to go on horseback and pack our outfit if any of you are alive after those trips and want more we shall go up into the mountains i should like very much to know what you each want particularly  ill tell you replied helen promptly dot will be the same out here as she was in the east she wants to look bashfully down at her handa hand imprisoned in another by the wayand listen to a man talk poetry about her eyes if cowboys dont make love that way dots visit will be a failure now elsie beck wants solely to be revenged upon us for dragging her out here she wants some dreadful thing to happen to us i dont know whats in ediths head but it isnt fun bobby wants to be near elsie and no more boyd wants what he has always wantedthe only thing he ever wanted that he didnt get castleton has a horrible bloodthirsty desire to kill something  i declare now i want to ride and camp out also protested castleton  as for myself went on helen i wantoh if i only knew what it is that i want well i know i want to be outdoors to get into the open to feel sun and wind to burn some color into my white face i want some flesh and blood and life i am tired out beyond all that i dont know very well ill try to keep dot from attaching all the cowboys to her train  what a diversity of wants said madeline  above all majesty we want something to happen concluded helen with passionate finality  my dear sister maybe you will have your wish fulfilled replied madeline soberly edith helen has made me curious about your especial yearning  majesty it is only that i wanted to be with you for a while replied this old friend  there was in the wistful reply accompanied by a dark and eloquent glance of eyes what told madeline of ediths understanding of her sympathy and perhaps a betrayal of her own unquiet soul it saddened madeline how many women might there not be who had the longing to break down the bars of their cage but had not the spirit     xiii cowboy golf  in the whirl of the succeeding days it was a mooted question whether madelines guests or her cowboys or herself got the keenest enjoyment out of the flying time considering the sameness of the cowboys ordinary life she was inclined to think they made the most of the present stillwell and stewart however had found the situation trying the work of the ranch had to go on and some of it got sadly neglected stillwell could not resist the ladies any more than he could resist the fun in the extraordinary goingson of the cowboys stewart alone kept the business of cattleraising from a serious setback early and late he was in the saddle driving the lazy mexicans whom he had hired to relieve the cowboys  one morning in june madeline was sitting on the porch with her merry friends when stillwell appeared on the corral path he had not come to consult madeline for several daysan omission so unusual as to be remarked  here comes billin trouble laughed florence  indeed he bore some faint resemblance to a thundercloud as he approached the porch but the greetings he got from madelines party especially from helen and dorothy chased away the blackness from his face and brought the wonderful wrinkling smile  miss majesty sure im a sad demoralized old cattleman he said presently an im in need of a heap of help  whats wrong now asked madeline with her encouraging smile  wal its so amazin strange what cowboys will do i jest am about to give up why you might say my cowboys were all on strike for vacations what do you think of that weve changed the shifts shortened hours let one an another off duty hired greasers an in fact done everythin that could be thought of but this vacation idee growed worse when stewart set his foot down then the boys begin to get sick never in my born days as a cattleman have i heerd of so many diseases an you ought to see how lame an crippled an weak many of the boys have got all of a sudden the idee of a cowboy comin to me with a sore finger an askin to be let off for a day theres booly now ive knowed a hoss to fall all over him an onct he rolled down a canyon never bothered him at all hes got a blister on his heel a ridin blister an he says its goin to bloodpoisonin if he doesnt rest theres jim bell hes developed what he says is spinal mengalootis or some such like theres frankie slade he swore he had scarlet fever because his face burnt so red i guess an when i hollered that scarlet fever was contagious an he must be put away somewhere he up an says he guessed it wasnt that but he was sure awful sick an needed to loaf around an be amused why even nels doesnt want to work these days if it wasnt for stewart whos had greasers with the cattle i dont know what id do  why all this sudden illness and idleness asked madeline  wal you see the truth is every blamed cowboy on the range except stewart thinks its his bounden duty to entertain the ladies  i think that is just fine exclaimed dorothy coombs and she joined in the general laugh  stewart then doesnt care to help entertain us inquired helen in curious interest wal miss helen stewart is sure different from the other cowboys replied stillwell yet he used to be like them there never was a cowboy fuller of the devil than gene but hes changed hes foreman here an that must be it all the responsibility rests on him he sure has no time for amusin the ladies  i imagine that is our loss said edith wayne in her earnest way i admire him  stillwell you need not be so distressed with what is only gallantry in the boys even if it does make a temporary confusion in the work said madeline  miss majesty all i said is not the half nor the quarter nor nuthin of whats troublin me answered he sadly  very well unburden yourself  wal the cowboys exceptin gene have gone plumb batty jest plain crazy over this heah game of gollof  a merry peal of mirth greeted stillwells solemn assertion  oh stillwell you are in fun replied madeline  i hope to die if im not in daid earnest declared the cattleman its an amazin strange fact ask flo shell tell you she knows cowboys an how if they ever start on somethin they ride it as they ride a hoss  florence being appealed to and evidently feeling all eyes upon her modestly replied that stillwell had scarcely misstated the situation  cowboys play like they work or fight she added they give their whole souls to it they are great big simple boys  indeed they are said madeline oh im glad if they like the game of golf they have so little play  wal somethins got to be did if were to go on raisin cattle at her majestys rancho replied stillwell he appeared both deliberate and resigned  madeline remembered that despite stillwells simplicity he was as deep as any of his cowboys and there was absolutely no gaging him where possibilities of fun were concerned madeline fancied that his exaggerated talk about the cowboys sudden craze for golf was in line with certain other remarkable tales that had lately emanated from him some very strange things had occurred of late and it was impossible to tell whether or not they were accidents mere coincidents or deeplaid skilfully workedout designs of the funloving cowboys certainly there had been great fun and at the expense of her guests particularly castleton so madeline was at a loss to know what to think about stillwells latest elaboration from mere force of habit she sympathized with him and found difficulty in doubting his apparent sincerity  to go back a ways went on stillwell as madeline looked up expectantly you recollect what pride the boys took in fixin up that gollof course out on the mesa wal they worked on that job an though i never seen any other course ill gamble yours cant be beat the boys was sure curious about that game you recollect also how they all wanted to see you an your brother play an be caddies for you wal whenever youd quit theyd go to work tryin to play the game monty price he was the leadin spirit old as i am miss majesty an used as i am to cowboy excentrikities i nearly dropped daid when i heered that little hobblefooted burnedup montana cowpuncher say there wasnt any game too swell for him an gollof was just his speed serious as a preacher mind you he was an he was always practisin when stewart gave him charge of the course an the clubhouse an all them funny sticks why monty was tickled to death you see monty is sensitive that he aint much good any more for cowboy work he was glad to have a job that he didnt feel he was hangin to by kindness wal he practised the game an he read the books in the clubhouse an he got the boys to doin the same that wasnt very hard i reckon they played early an late an in the moonlight for a while monty was coach an the boys stood it but pretty soon frankie slade got puffed on his game an he had to have it out with monty wal monty beat him bad then one after another the other boys tackled monty he beat them all after that they split up an begin to play matches two on a side for a spell this worked fine but cowboys cant never be satisfied long onless they win all the time monty an link stevens both cripples you might say joined forces an elected to beat all comers wal they did an thats the trouble long an patient the other cowboys tried to beat them two game legs an hevnt done it mebbe if monty an link was perfectly sound in their legs like the other cowboys there wouldnt hev been such a holler but no sound cowboysll ever stand for a disgrace like that why down at the bunks in the evenins its some mortifyin the way monty an link crow over the rest of the outfit theyve taken on superior airs you couldnt reach up to monty with a trimmed spruce pole an linkwal hes just amazin scornful  its a swell game aint it says link powerful sarcastic wal whats hurtin you lowdown common cowmen you keep harpin on montys game leg an on my game leg if we hed good legs wed beat you all the wuss its brains that wins in gollof brains an airstoocratik blood which of the same you fellers sure hev little  an then monty he blows smoke powerful careless an superior an he says  sure its a swell game you cowheaded gents think beef an brawn ought to hev the call over skill an gray matter youll all hev to back up an get down go out an learn the game you dont know a baffy from a chinee sandwich all you can do is waggle with a club an fozzle the ball  whenever monty gets to usin them queer names the boys go round kind of dotty monty an link hev got the books an directions of the game an they wont let the other boys see them they show the rules but thats all an of course every game ends in a row almost before its started the boys are all turrible in earnest about this gollof an i want to say for the good of ranchin not to mention a possible fight that monty an link hev got to be beat therell be no peace round this ranch till thats done  madelines guests were much amused as for herself in spite of her scarcely considered doubt stillwells tale of woe occasioned her anxiety however she could hardly control her mirth  what in the world can i do  wal i reckon i couldnt say i only come to you for advice it seems that a queer kind of game has locoed my cowboys an for the time bein ranchin is at a standstill sounds ridiculous i know but cowboys are as strange as wild cattle all im sure of is that the conceit has got to be taken out of monty an link onct just onct will square it an then we can resoome our work  stillwell listen said madeline brightly well arrange a match game a foursome between monty and link and your best picked team castleton who is an expert golfer will umpire my sister and friends and i will take turns as caddies for your team that will be fair considering yours is the weaker caddies may coach and perhaps expert advice is all that is necessary for your team to defeat montys  a grand idee declared stillwell with instant decision when can we have this match game  why todaythis afternoon well all ride out to the links  wal i reckon ill be some indebted to you miss majesty an all your guests replied stillwell warmly he rose with sombrero in hand and a twinkle in his eye that again prompted madeline to wonder an now ill be goin to fix up for the game of cowboy gollof adios  the idea was as enthusiastically received by madelines guests as it had been by stillwell they were highly amused and speculative to the point of taking sides and making wagers on their choice moreover this situation so frankly revealed by stillwell had completed their deep mystification they were now absolutely nonplussed by the singular character of american cowboys madeline was pleased to note how seriously they had taken the old cattlemans story she had a little throb of wild expectancy that made her both fear and delight in the afternoons prospect  the june days had set in warm in fact hot during the noon hours and this had inculcated in her insatiable visitors a tendency to profit by the experience of those used to the southwest they indulged in the restful siesta during the heated term of the day  madeline was awakened by majestys wellknown whistle and pounding on the gravel then she heard the other horses when she went out she found her party assembled in gala golf attire and with spirits to match their costumes castleton especially appeared resplendent in a golf coat that beggared description madeline had faint misgivings when she reflected on what monty and nels and nick might do under the influence of that blazing garment  oh majesty cried helen as madeline went up to her horse dont make him kneel try that flying mount we all want to see it its so stunning  but that way too i must have him kneel said madeline or i cant reach the stirrup hes so tremendously high  madeline had to yield to the laughing insistence of her friends and after all of them except florence were up she made majesty go down on one knee then she stood on his left side facing back and took a good firm grip on the bridle and pommel and his mane after she had slipped the toe of her boot firmly into the stirrup she called to majesty he jumped and swung her up into the saddle  now just to see how it ought to be done watch florence said madeline  the western girl was at her best in ridinghabit and with her horse it was beautiful to see the ease and grace with which she accomplished the cowboys flying mount then she led the party down the slope and across the flat to climb the mesa  madeline never saw a group of her cowboys without looking them over almost unconsciously for her foreman gene stewart this afternoon as usual he was not present however she now had a senseof which she was wholly consciousthat she was both disappointed and irritated he had really not been attentive to her guests and he of all her cowboys was the one of whom they wanted most to see something helen particularly had asked to have him attend the match but stewart was with the cattle madeline thought of his faithfulness and was ashamed of her momentary lapse into that old imperious habit of desiring things irrespective of reason  stewart however immediately slipped out of her mind as she surveyed the group of cowboys on the links by actual count there were sixteen not including stillwell and the same number of splendid horses all shiny and clean grazed on the rim in the care of mexican lads the cowboys were on dressparade looking very different in madelines eyes at least from the way cowboys usually appeared but they were real and natural to her guests and they were so picturesque that they might have been stage cowboys instead of real ones sombreros with silver buckles and horsehair bands were in evidence and bright silk scarfs embroidered vests fringed and ornamented chaps huge swinging guns and clinking silver spurs lent a festive appearance  madeline and her party were at once eagerly surrounded by the cowboys and she found it difficult to repress a smile if these cowboys were still remarkable to her what must they be to her guests  wal youall raced over i seen said stillwell taking madelines bridle get downget down were sure amazin glad an proud an miss majesty im offerin to beg pawdin for the way the boys are packin guns mebbe it aint polite but its stewarts orders  stewarts orders echoed madeline her friends were suddenly silent  i reckon he wont take no chances on the boys bein surprised sudden by raiders an theres raiders operatin in from the guadalupes thats all nothin to worry over i was just explainin  madeline with several of her party expressed relief but helen showed excitement and then disappointment  oh i want something to happen she cried  sixteen pairs of keen cowboy eyes fastened intently upon her pretty petulant face and madeline divined if helen did not that the desired consummation was not far off  so do i said dot coombs it would be perfectly lovely to have a real adventure  the gaze of the sixteen cowboys shifted and sought the demure face of this other discontented girl madeline laughed and stillwell wore his strange moving smile  wal i reckon you ladies sure wont have to go home unhappy he said why as boss of this heah outfit id feel myself disgraced forever if you didnt have your wish just wait an now ladies the matter on hand may not be amusin or excitin to you but to this heah cowboy outfit its powerful important an all the help you can give us will sure be thankfully received take a look across the links do youall see them two apologies for human beins prancin like a couple of hobbled broncs wal youre gazin at monty price an link stevens who have of a sudden got too swell to associate with their old bunkies theyre practisin for the toornament they dont want my boys to see how they handle them crooked clubs  have you picked your team inquired madeline  stillwell mopped his red face with an immense bandana and showed something of confusion and perplexity  ive sixteen boys an they all want to play he replied pickin the team aint goin to be an easy job mebbe it wont be healthy either theres nels and nick they just stated cheerfullike that if they didnt play we wont have any game at all nick never tried before an nels all he wants is to get a crack at monty with one of them crooked clubs  i suggest you let all your boys drive from the tee and choose the two who drive the farthest said madeline  stillwells perplexed face lighted up  wal thats a plumb good idee the boysll stand for that  wherewith he broke up the admiring circle of cowboys round the ladies  grap a ropei mean a cluball you cowpunchers an march over hyar an take a swipe at this little white bean  the cowboys obeyed with alacrity there was considerable difficulty over the choice of clubs and who should try first the latter question had to be adjusted by lot however after frankie slade made several ineffectual attempts to hit the ball from the teeingground at last to send it only a few yards the other players were not so eager to follow stillwell had to push booly forward and booly executed a most miserable shot and retired to the laughing comments of his comrades the efforts of several succeeding cowboys attested to the extreme difficulty of making a good drive  wal nick its your turn said stillwell  bill i aint so allfired particular about playin replied nick  why you was roarin about it a little while ago afraid to show how bad youll play  nope jest plain consideration for my feller cowpunchers answered nick with spirit im appreciatin how bad they play an im not mean enough to show them up  wal youve got to show me said stillwell i know you never seen a gollof stick in your life whats more ill bet you cant hit that little ball squarenot in a dozen cracks at it  bill im also too much of a gent to take your money but you know im from missouri gimme a club  nicks angry confidence seemed to evaporate as one after another he took up and handled the clubs it was plain that he had never before wielded one but also it was plain that he was not the kind of a man to give in finally he selected a driver looked doubtfully at the small knob and then stepped into position on the teeingground  nick steele stood six feet four inches in height he had the riders wiry slenderness yet he was broad of shoulder his arms were long manifestly he was an exceedingly powerful man he swung the driver aloft and whirled it down with a tremendous swing crack the white ball disappeared and from where it had been rose a tiny cloud of dust  madelines quick sight caught the ball as it lined somewhat to the right it was shooting low and level with the speed of a bullet it went up and up in swift beautiful flight then lost its speed and began to sail to curve to drop and it fell out of sight beyond the rim of the mesa madeline had never seen a drive that approached this one it was magnificent beyond belief except for actual evidence of her own eyes  the yelling of the cowboys probably brought nick steele out of the astounding spell with which he beheld his shot then nick suddenly alive to the situation recovered from his trance and resting nonchalantly upon his club he surveyed stillwell and the boys after their first surprised outburst they were dumb  youall seen thet nick grandly waved his hand thaught i was joshin didnt you why i used to go to st louis an kansas city to play this here game there was some talk of the golf clubs takin me down east to play the champions but i never cared fer the game too easy fer me them fellers back in missouri were a lot of cheap dubs anyhow always kickin because whenever i hit a ball hard i always lost it why i hed to hit sort of lefthanded to let em stay in my class now youall can go ahead an play monty an link i could beat em both playin with one hand if i wanted to but i aint interested i jest hit thet ball off the mesa to show you i sure wouldnt be seen playin on your team  with that nick sauntered away toward the horses stillwell appeared crushed and not a scornful word was hurled after nick which fact proved the nature of his victory then nels strode into the limelight as far as it was possible for this ironfaced cowboy to be so he was bland and suave he remarked to stillwell and the other cowboys that sometimes it was painful for them to judge of the gifts of superior cowboys such as belonged to nick and himself he picked up the club nick had used and called for a new ball stillwell carefully built up a little mound of sand and placing the ball upon it squared away to watch he looked grim and expectant  nels was not so large a man as nick and did not look so formidable as he waved his club at the gaping cowboys still he was lithe tough strong briskly with a debonair manner he stepped up and then delivered a mighty swing at the ball he missed the power and momentum of his swing flung him off his feet and he actually turned upside down and spun round on his head the cowboys howled stillwells stentorian laugh rolled across the mesa madeline and her guests found it impossible to restrain their mirth and when nels got up he cast a reproachful glance at madeline his feelings were hurt  his second attempt not by any means so violent resulted in as clean a miss as the first and brought jeers from the cowboys nelss red face flamed redder angrily he swung again the mound of sand spread over the teeingground and the exasperating little ball rolled a few inches this time he had to build up the sand mound and replace the ball himself stillwell stood scornfully by and the boys addressed remarks to nels  take off them blinders said one  nels your eyes are shore bad said another  you dont hit where you look  nels your left eye has sprung a limp  why you doggoned old fule you caint hit thet bawl  nels essayed again only to meet ignominious failure then carefully he gathered himself together gaged distance balanced the club swung cautiously and the head of the club made a beautiful curve round the ball  shore its jest thet crooked club he declared  he changed clubs and made another signal failure rage suddenly possessing him he began to swing wildly always it appeared the illusive little ball was not where he aimed stillwell hunched his huge bulk leaned hands on knees and roared his riotous mirth the cowboys leaped up and down in glee  you caint hit thet bawl sang out one of the noisiest a few more whirling desperate lunges on the part of nels all as futile as if the ball had been thin air finally brought to the dogged cowboy a realization that golf was beyond him  stillwell bawled oh haw haw haw nels youretoo oldeyes no good  nels slammed down the club and when he straightened up with the red leaving his face then the real pride and fire of the man showed deliberately he stepped off ten paces and turned toward the little mound upon which rested the ball his arm shot down elbow crooked hand like a claw  aw nels this is fun yelled stillwell  but swift as a gleam of light nels flashed his gun and the report came with the action chips flew from the golfball as it tumbled from the mound nels had hit it without raising the dust then he dropped the gun back in its sheath and faced the cowboys  mebbe my eyes aint so orful bad he said coolly and started to walk off  but look ahheah nels yelled stillwell we come out to play gollof we cant let you knock the ball around with your gun whatd you want to get mad for its only fun now you an nick hang round heah an be sociable we aint depreciatin your company none nor your usefulness on occasions an if you just haint got inborn politeness sufficient to do the gallant before the ladies why remember stewarts orders  stewarts orders queried nels coming to a sudden halt  thats what i said replied stillwell with asperity his orders are you forgettin orders wal youre a fine cowboy you an nick an monty specially are to obey orders  nels took off his sombrero and scratched his head bill i reckon im some forgetful but i was mad id a remembered pretty soon an mebbe my manners  sure you would replied stillwell wal now we dont seem to be proceedin much with my gollof team next ambitious player step up  in ambrose who showed some skill in driving stillwell found one of his team the succeeding players however were so poor and so evenly matched that the earnest stillwell was in despair he lost his temper just as speedily as nels had finally ed lintons wife appeared riding up with ambroses wife and perhaps this helped for ed suddenly disclosed ability that made stillwell single him out  let me coach you a little said bill  sure if you like replied ed but i know more about this game than you do  wal then lets see you hit a ball straight seems to me you got good allfired quick its amazin strange ere bill looked around to discover the two young wives modestly casting eyes of admiration upon their husbands haw haw it aint so darned strange mebbe thatll help some now ed stand up and dont sling your club as if you was ropin a steer come round easylike an hit straight  ed made several attempts which although better than those of his predecessors were rather discouraging to the exacting coach presently after a particularly atrocious shot stillwell strode in distress here and there and finally stopped a dozen paces or more in front of the teeingground ed who for a cowboy was somewhat phlegmatic calmly made ready for another attempt  fore he called  stillwell stared  fore yelled ed  whyre you hollerin that way at me demanded bill  i mean for you to lope off the horizon get back from in front  oh that was one of them durned crazy words monty is always hollerin wal i reckon im safe enough hyar you couldnt hit me in a million years  bill ooze away urged ed  didnt i say you couldnt hit me what am i coachin you for its because you hit crooked aint it wal go ahaid an break your back  ed linton was a short heavy man and his stocky build gave evidence of considerable strength his former strokes had not been made at the expense of exertion but now he got ready for a supreme effort a sudden silence clamped down upon the exuberant cowboys it was one of those fateful moments when the air was charged with disaster as ed swung the club it fairly whistled  crack instantly came a thump but no one saw the ball until it dropped from stillwells shrinking body his big hands went spasmodically to the place that hurt and a terrible groan rumbled from him  then the cowboys broke into a frenzy of mirth that seemed to find adequate expression only in dancing and rolling accompaniment to their howls stillwell recovered his dignity as soon as he caught his breath and he advanced with a rueful face  wal boys its on bill he said im a livin proof of the pigheadedness of mankind ed you win youre captain of the team you hit straight an if i hadnt been obstructin the general atmosphere that ball would sure have gone clear to the chiricahuas  then making a megaphone of his huge hands he yelled a loud blast of defiance at monty and link  hey you swell gollofers were waitin come on if you aint scared  instantly monty and link quit practising and like two emperors came stalking across the links  guess my bluff didnt work much said stillwell then he turned to madeline and her friends sure i hope miss majesty that youall wont weaken an go over to the enemy monty is some eloquent an besides he has a way of gettin people to agree with him hell be plumb wild when he heahs what he an link are up against but its a square deal because he wouldnt help us or lend the book that shows how to play an besides its policy for us to beat him now if youll elect whos to be caddies an umpire ill be powerful obliged  madelines friends were hugely amused over the prospective match but except for dorothy and castleton they disclaimed any ambition for active participation accordingly madeline appointed castleton to judge the play dorothy to act as caddie for ed linton and she herself to be caddie for ambrose while stillwell beamingly announced this momentous news to his team and supporters monty and link were striding up  both were diminutive in size bowlegged lame in one foot and altogether unprepossessing link was young and montys years more than twice links had left their mark but it would have been impossible to tell montys age as stillwell said monty was burned to the color and hardness of a cinder he never minded the heat and always wore heavy sheepskin chaps with the wool outside this made him look broader than he was long link partial to leather had since he became madelines chauffeur taken to leather altogether he carried no weapon but monty wore a huge gunsheath and gun link smoked a cigarette and looked coolly impudent monty was darkfaced swaggering for all the world like a barbarian chief  that monty makes my flesh creep said helen lowvoiced really mr stillwell is he so baddesperateas ive heard did he ever kill anybody  sure most as many as nels replied stillwell cheerfully  oh and is that nice mr nels a desperado too i wouldnt have thought so hes so kind and oldfashioned and softvoiced  nels is sure an example of the dooplicity of men miss helen dont you listen to his soft voice hes really as bad as a sidewinder rattlesnake  at this juncture monty and link reached the teeingground and stillwell went out to meet them the other cowboys pressed forward to surround the trio madeline heard stillwells voice and evidently he was explaining that his team was to have skilled advice during the play suddenly there came from the center of the group a loud angry roar that broke off as suddenly then followed excited voices all mingled together presently monty appeared breaking away from restraining hands and he strode toward madeline  monty price was a type of cowboy who had never been known to speak to a woman unless he was first addressed and then he answered in blunt awkward shyness upon this great occasion however it appeared that he meant to protest or plead with madeline for he showed stress of emotion madeline had never gotten acquainted with monty she was a little in awe if not in fear of him and now she found it imperative for her to keep in mind that more than any other of the wild fellows on her ranch this one should be dealt with as if he were a big boy  monty removed his sombrerosomething he had never done beforeand the single instant when it was off was long enough to show his head entirely bald this was one of the hallmarks of that terrible montana prairie fire through which he had fought to save the life of a child madeline did not forget it and all at once she wanted to take montys side remembering stillwells wisdom however she forebore yielding to sentiment and called upon her wits  missmiss hammond began monty stammering im extendin admirin greetins to you an your friends link an me are right down proud to play the match game with you watchin but bill says youre goin to caddie for his team an coach em on the fine points an i want to ask all respectful if thets fair an square  monty that is for you to say replied madeline it was my suggestion but if you object in the least of course we shall withdraw it seems fair to me because you have learned the game you are expert and i understand the other boys have no chance with you then you have coached link i think it would be sportsmanlike of you to accept the handicap  aw a handicap thet was what bill was drivin at why didnt he say so every time bill comes to a word thets pie to us old golfers he jest stumbles miss majesty youve made it all clear as print an i may say with becomin modesty thet you wasnt mistaken none about me bein sportsmanlike me an link was born thet way an we accept the handicap lackin thet handicap i reckon link an me would have no ambish to play our most beootiful game an thankin you miss majesty an all your friends i want to add thet if bills outfit couldnt beat us before theyve got a swell chanct now with you ladies awatchin me an link  monty had seemed to expand with pride as he delivered this speech and at the end he bowed low and turned away he joined the group round stillwell once more there was animated discussion and argument and expostulation one of the cowboys came for castleton and led him away to exploit upon ground rules  it seemed to madeline that the game never would begin she strolled on the rim of the mesa arm in arm with edith wayne and while edith talked she looked out over the gray valley leading to the rugged black mountains and the vast red wastes in the foreground on the gray slope she saw cattle in movement and cowboys riding to and fro she thought of stewart then boyd harvey came for them saying all details had been arranged stillwell met them halfway and this cool dry old cattleman whose face and manner scarcely changed at the announcement of a cattleraid now showed extreme agitation  wal miss majesty weve gone an made a foozle right at the start he said dejectedly  a foozle but the game has not yet begun replied madeline  a bad start i mean its amazin bad an were licked already  what in the world is wrong  she wanted to laugh but stillwells distress restrained her  wal its this way that darn monty is as cute an slick as a fox after he got done declaimin about the handicap he an link was so happy to take he got castleton over hyar an drove us all dotty with his crazy gollof names then he borrowed castletons gollof coat i reckon borrowed is some kind word he just about took that blazin coat off the englishman though i aint sayin but that casleton was agreeable when he tumbled to montys meanin which was nothin more n to break ambroses heart that coat dazzles ambrose you know how vain ambrose is why hed die to get to wear that englishmans gollof coat an monty forestalled him its plumb pitiful to see the look in ambroses eyes he wont be able to play much then what do you think monty fixed ed linton all right usually ed is easygoin an cool but now hes on the rampage wal mebbe its news to you to learn that eds wife is powerful turrible jealous of him ed was somethin of a devil with the wimmen monty goes over an tells beulahthats eds wifethat ed is goin to have for caddie the lovely miss dorothy with the googoo eyes i reckon this was some disrespectful but with all doo respect to miss dorothy she has got a pair of unbridled eyes mebbe its just natural for her to look at a feller like that oh its all right im not sayin anythin i know its all proper an regular for girls back east to use their eyes but out hyar its bound to result disastrous all the boys talk about among themselves is miss dots eyes an all they brag about is which feller is the luckiest anyway sure eds wife knows it an monty up an told her that it was fine for her to come out an see how swell ed was prancin round under the light of miss dots brown eyes beulah calls over ed figgertively speakin ropes him for a minnit ed comes back huggin a grouch as big as a hill oh it was funny he was goin to punch montys haid off an monty stands there an laughs says monty sarcastic as alkali water ed weall knowed you was a heap married man but youre some locoed to give yourself away that settled ed hes some touchy about the way beulah henpecks him he lost his spirit an now he couldnt play marbles let alone gollof nope monty was too smart an i reckon he was right about brains bein what wins  the game began at first madeline and dorothy essayed to direct the endeavors of their respective players but all they said and did only made their team play the worse at the third hole they were far behind and hopelessly bewildered what with montys borrowed coat with its dazzling effect upon ambrose and links oftrepeated allusion to eds matrimonial state and stillwells vociferated disgust and the clamoring good intention and pursuit of the cowboy supporters and the embarrassing presence of the ladies ambrose and ed wore through all manner of strange play until it became ridiculous  hey link came montys voice booming over the links our esteemed rivals are playin shinny  madeline and dorothy gave up presently when the game became a rout and they sat down with their followers to watch the fun whether by hook or crook ed and ambrose forged ahead to come close upon monty and link castleton disappeared in a mass of gesticulating shouting cowboys when that compact mass disintegrated castleton came forth rather hurriedly it appeared to stalk back toward his hostess and friends  look exclaimed helen in delight castleton is actually excited whatever did they do to him oh this is immense  castleton was excited indeed and also somewhat disheveled  by jove that was a rum go he said as he came up never saw such blooming golf i resigned my office as umpire  only upon considerable pressure did he reveal the reason it was like this dont you know they were all together over there watching each other monty prices ball dropped into a hazard and he moved it to improve the lie by jove theyve all been doing that but over there the game was waxing hot stillwell and his cowboys saw monty move the ball and there was a row they appealed to me i corrected the play showed the rules monty agreed he was in the wrong however when it came to moving his ball back to its former lie in the hazard there was more blooming trouble monty placed the ball to suit him and then he transfixed me with an evil eye  dook he said i wish the bloody cowboy would not call me that dook mebbe this game aint as important as international politics or some other things relatin but theres some health an peace dependin on it savvy for some space our opponents have been dead to honor an sportsmanlike conduct i calculate the game depends on my next drive im placin my ball as near to where it was as human eyesight could you seen where it was same as i seen it youre the umpire an dook i take you as a honorable man moreover never in my born days has my word been doubted without sorrow so im askin you wasnt my ball layin just about here  the bloody little desperado smiled cheerfully and he dropped his right hand down to the butt of his gun by jove he did then i had to tell a blooming lie  castleton even caught the tone of montys voice but it was plain that he had not the least conception that monty had been fooling madeline and her friends divined it however and there being no need of reserve they let loose the fountains of mirth     xiv bandits  when madeline and her party recovered composure they sat up to watch the finish of the match it came with spectacular suddenness a sharp yell pealed out and all the cowboys turned attentively in its direction a big black horse had surmounted the rim of the mesa and was just breaking into a run his rider yelled sharply to the cowboys they wheeled to dash toward their grazing horses  thats stewart there is something wrong said madeline in alarm  castleton stared the other men exclaimed uneasily the women sought madelines face with anxious eyes  the black got into his stride and bore swiftly down upon them  oh look at that horse run cried helen look at that fellow ride  helen was not alone in her admiration for madeline divided her emotions between growing alarm of some danger menacing and a thrill and quickening of pulsebeat that tingled over her whenever she saw stewart in violent action no action of his was any longer insignificant but violent action meant so much it might mean anything for one moment she remembered stillwell and all his talk about fun and plots and tricks to amuse her guest then she discountenanced the thought stewart might lend himself to a little fun but he cared too much for a horse to run him at that speed unless there was imperious need that alone sufficed to answer madelines questioning curiosity and her alarm mounted to fear not so much for herself as for her guests but what danger could there be she could think of nothing except the guerrillas  whatever threatened it would be met and checked by this man stewart who was thundering up on his fleet horse and as he neared her so that she could see the dark gleam of face and eyes she had a strange feeling of trust in her dependence upon him  the big black was so close to madeline and her friends that when stewart pulled him the dust and sand kicked up by his pounding hoofs flew in their faces  oh stewart what is it cried madeline  guess i scared you miss hammond he replied but im pressed for time theres a gang of bandits hiding on the ranch most likely in a deserted hut they held up a train near agua prieta pat hawe is with the posse thats trailing them and you know pat has no use for us im afraid it wouldnt be pleasant for you or your guests to meet either the posse or the bandits  i fancy not said madeline considerably relieved well hurry back to the house  they exchanged no more speech at the moment and madelines guests were silent perhaps stewarts actions and looks belied his calm words his piercing eyes roved round the rim of the mesa and his face was as hard and stern as chiseled bronze  monty and nick came galloping up each leading several horses by the bridles nels appeared behind them with majesty and he was having trouble with the roan madeline observed that all the other cowboys had disappeared  one sharp word from stewart calmed madelines horse the other horses however were frightened and not inclined to stand the men mounted without trouble and likewise madeline and florence but edith wayne and mrs beck being nervous and almost helpless were with difficulty gotten into the saddle  beg pardon but im pressed for time said stewart coolly as with iron arm he forced dorothys horse almost to its knees dorothy who was active and plucky climbed astride and when stewart loosed his hold on bit and mane the horse doubled up and began to buck dorothy screamed as she shot into the air stewart as quick as the horse leaped forward and caught dorothy in his arms she had slipped head downward and had he not caught her would have had a serious fall stewart handling her as if she were a child turned her right side up to set her upon her feet dorothy evidently thought only of the spectacle she presented and made startled motions to readjust her ridinghabit it was no time to laugh though madeline felt as if she wanted to besides it was impossible to be anything but sober with stewart in violent mood for he had jumped at dorothys stubborn mount all cowboys were masters of horses it was wonderful to see him conquer the vicious animal he was cruel perhaps yet it was from necessity when presently he led the horse back to dorothy she mounted without further trouble meanwhile nels and nick had lifted helen into her saddle  well take the side trail said stewart shortly as he swung upon the big black then he led the way and the other cowboys trotted in the rear  it was only a short distance to the rim of the mesa and when madeline saw the steep trail narrow and choked with weathered stone she felt that her guests would certainly flinch  thats a jolly bad course observed castleton  the women appeared to be speechless  stewart checked his horse at the deep cut where the trail started down  boys drop over and go slow he said dismounting flo you follow now ladies let your horses loose and hold on lean forward and hang to the pommel it looks bad but the horses are used to such trails  helen followed closely after florence mrs beck went next and then edith wayne dorothys horse balked  im not soso frightened said dorothy if only he would behave  she began to urge him into the trail making him rear when stewart grasped the bit and jerked the horse down  put your foot in my stirrup said stewart we cant waste time  he lifted her upon his horse and started him down over the rim  go on miss hammond ill have to lead this nag down itll save time  then madeline attended to the business of getting down herself it was a loose trail the weathered slopes seemed to slide under the feet of the horses dustclouds formed rocks rolled and rattled down cactus spikes tore at horse and rider mrs beck broke into laughter and there was a note in it that suggested hysteria once or twice dorothy murmured plaintively half the time madeline could not distinguish those ahead through the yellow dust it was dry and made her cough the horses snorted she heared stewart close behind starting little avalanches that kept rolling on majestys fetlocks she feared his legs might be cut or bruised for some of the stones cracked by and went rattling down the slope at length the clouds of dust thinned and madeline saw the others before her ride out upon a level soon she was down and stewart also  here there was a delay occasioned by stewart changing dorothy from his horse to her own this struck madeline as being singular and made her thoughtful in fact the alert quiet manner of all the cowboys was not reassuring as they resumed the ride it was noticeable that nels and nick were far in advance monty stayed far in the rear and stewart rode with the party madeline heard boyd harvey ask stewart if lawlessness such as he had mentioned was not unusual stewart replied that except for occasional deeds of outlawry such as might break out in any isolated section of the country there had been peace and quiet along the border for years it was the mexican revolution that had revived wild times with all the attendant raids and holdups and gunpacking madeline knew that they were really being escorted home under armed guard  when they rounded the head of the mesa bringing into view the ranchhouse and the valley madeline saw dust or smoke hovering over a hut upon the outskirts of the mexican quarters as the sun had set and the light was fading she could not distinguish which it was then stewart set a fast pace for the house in a few minutes the party was in the yard ready and willing to dismount  stillwell appeared ostensibly cheerful too cheerful to deceive madeline she noted also that a number of armed cowboys were walking with their horses just below the house  wal youall had a nice little run stillwell said speaking generally i reckon there wasnt much need of it pat hawe thinks hes got some outlaws corralled on the ranch nothin at all to be fussed up about stewarts that particular he wont have you meetin with any rowdies  many and fervent were the expressions of relief from madelines feminine guests as they dismounted and went into the house madeline lingered behind to speak with stillwell and stewart  now stillwell out with it she said briefly  the cattleman stared and then he laughed evidently pleased with her keenness  wal miss majesty theres goin to be a fight somewhere an stewart wanted to get youall in before it come off he says the valleys overrun by vaqueros an guerrillas an robbers an lord knows what else  he stamped off the porch his huge spurs rattling and started down the path toward the waiting men  stewart stood in his familiar attentive position erect silent with a hand on pommel and bridle  stewart you are exceedinglythoughtful of my interests she said wanting to thank him and not readily finding words i would not know what to do without you is there danger  im not sure but i want to be on the safe side  she hesitated it was no longer easy for her to talk to him and she did not know why  may i know the special orders you gave nels and nick and monty she asked  who said i gave those boys special orders  i heard stillwell tell them so  of course ill tell you if you insist but why should you worry over something thatll likely never happen  i insist stewart she replied quietly  my orders were that at least one of them must be on guard near you day and nightnever to be out of hearing of your voice  i thought as much but why nels or monty or nick that seems rather hard on them for that matter why put any one to keep guard over me do you not trust any other of my cowboys  id trust their honesty but not their ability  ability of what nature  with guns  stewart she exclaimed  miss hammond you have been having such a good time entertaining your guests that you forget im glad of that i wish you had not questioned me  forget what  don carlos and his guerrillas  indeed i have not forgotten stewart you still think don carlos tried to make off with memay try it again  i dont think i know  and besides all your other duties you have shared the watch with these three cowboys  yes  it has been going on without my knowledge  yes  since when  since i brought you down from the mountains last month  how long is it to continue  thats hard to say till the revolution is over anyhow  she mused a moment looking away to the west where the great void was filling with red haze she believed implicitly in him and the menace hovering near her fell like a shadow upon her present happiness  what must i do she asked  i think you ought to send your friends back eastand go with them until this guerrilla war is over  why stewart they would be brokenhearted and so would i  he had no reply for that  if i do not take your advice it will be the first time since i have come to look to you for so much she went on cannot you suggest something else my friends are having such a splendid visit helen is getting well oh i should be sorry to see them go before they want to  we might take them up into the mountains and camp out for a while he said presently i know a wild place up among the crags its a hard climb but worth the work i never saw a more beautiful spot fine water and it will be cool pretty soon itll be too hot here for your party to go outofdoors  you mean to hide me away among the crags and clouds replied madeline with a laugh  well itd amount to that your friends need not know perhaps in a few weeks this spell of trouble on the border will be over till fall  you say its a hard climb up to this place  it surely is your friends will get the real thing if they make that trip  that suits me helen especially wants something to happen and they are all crazy for excitement  theyd get it up there bad trails canyons to head steep climbs windstorms thunder and lightning rain mountainlions and wildcats  very well i am decided stewart of course you will take charge i dont believe istewart isnt there something more you could tell mewhy you think why you know my own personal liberty is in peril  yes but do not ask me what it is if i hadnt been a rebel soldier i would never have known  if you had not been a rebel soldier where would madeline hammond be now she asked earnestly  he made no reply  stewart she continued with warm impulse you once mentioned a debt you owed me and seeing his dark face pale she wavered then went on it is paid  no no he answered huskily  yes i will not have it otherwise  no that never can be paid  madeline held out her hand  it is paid i tell you she repeated  suddenly he drew back from the outstretched white hand that seemed to fascinate him  id kill a man to touch your hand but i wont touch it on the terms you offer  his unexpected passion disconcerted her  stewart no man ever before refused to shake hands with me for any reason itit is scarcely flattering she said with a little laugh why wont you because you think i offer it as mistress to servantrancher to cowboy  no  then why the debt you owed me is paid i cancel it so why not shake hands upon it as men do  i wont thats all  i fear you are ungracious whatever your reason she replied still i may offer it again some day good night  he said good night and turned madeline wonderingly watched him go down the path with his hand on the black horses neck  she went in to rest a little before dressing for dinner and being fatigued from the days riding and excitement she fell asleep when she awoke it was twilight she wondered why her mexican maid had not come to her and she rang the bell the maid did not put in an appearance nor was there any answer to the ring the house seemed unusually quiet it was a brooding silence which presently broke to the sound of footsteps on the porch madeline recognized stillwells tread though it appeared to be light for him then she heard him call softly in at the open door of her office the suggestion of caution in his voice suited the strangeness of his walk with a boding sense of trouble she hurried through the rooms he was standing outside her office door  stillwell she exclaimed  anybody with you he asked in a low tone  no  please come out on the porch he added  she complied and once out was enabled to see him his grave face paler than she had ever beheld it caused her to stretch an appealing hand toward him stillwell intercepted it and held it in his own  miss majesty im amazin sorry to tell worrisome news he spoke almost in a whisper cautiously looked about him and seemed both hurried and mysterious if youd heerd stewart cuss youd sure know how we hate to hev to tell you this but it cant be avoided the fact is were in a bad fix if your guests aint scared out of their skins itll be owin to your nerve an how you carry out stewarts orders  you can rely upon me replied madeline firmly though she trembled  wal what were up against is this that gang of bandits pat hawe was chasintheyre hidin in the house  in the house echoed madeline aghast  miss majesty its the amazin truth an shamed indeed am i to admit it stewartwhy hes wild with rage to think it could hev happened you see it couldnt hev happened if i hednt sloped the boys off to the golloflinks an if stewart hednt rid out on the mesa after us its my fault ive hed too much femininity around fer my old haid gene cussed mehe cussed me sure scandalous but now weve got to face itto figger  do you mean that a gang of hunted outlawsbanditshave actually taken refuge somewhere in my house demanded madeline  i sure do seems powerful strange to me why you didnt find somethin was wrong seem all your servants hev sloped  gone ah i missed my maid i wondered why no lights were lit where did my servants go  down to the mexican quarters an scared half to death now listen when stewart left you an hour or so ago he follered me direct to where me an the boys was tryin to keep pat hawe from tearin the ranch to pieces at that we was helpin pat all we could to find them bandits but when stewart got there he made a difference pat was nasty before but seein stewart made him wuss i reckon gene to pat is the same as red to a greaser bull anyway when the sheriff set fire to an old adobe hut stewart called him an called him hard pat hawe hed six fellers with him an from all appearances bandithuntin was some fiesta there was a row an it looked bad fer a little but gene was cool an he controlled the boys then pat an his tough depooties went on huntin that huntin miss majesty petered out into what was only a farce i reckon pat could hev kept on foolin me an the boys but as soon as stewart showed up on the scenewal either pat got to blunderin or else weall shed our blinders anyway the facts stood plain pat hawe wasnt lookin hard fer any bandits he wasnt daid set huntin anythin unless it was trouble fer stewart finally when pats men made fer our storehouse where we keep ammunition grub liquors an sich then gene called a halt an he ordered pat hawe off the ranch it was hyar hawe an stewart locked horns  an hyar the truth come out there was a gang of bandits hid somewheres an at fust pat hawe hed been powerful active an earnest in his huntin but suddenlike hed fetched a pecooliar change of heart he had been some flustered with stewarts eyes apryin into his moves an then mebbe to hide somethin mebbe jest natrul he got mad he hollered law he pulled down off the shelf his old stock grudge on stewart accusin him over again of that greaser murder last fall stewart made him look like a foolshowed him up as bein scared of the bandits or hevin some reason fer slopin off the trail anyway the row started all right an but fer nels it might hev amounted to a fight in the thick of it when stewart was drivin pat an his crowd off the place one of them depooties lost his head an went fer his gun nels throwed his gun an crippled the fellers arm monty jumped then an throwed two fortyfives an fer a second or so it looked ticklish but the bandithunters crawled an then lit out  stillwell paused in the rapid delivery of his narrative he still retained madelines hand as if by that he might comfort her  after pat left we put our haids together began the old cattleman with a long respiration we rounded up a lad who hed seen a dozen or so fellershe wouldnt to they was greasersbreakin through the shrubbery to the back of the house that was while stewart was ridin out to the mesa then this lad seen your servants all runnin down the hill toward the village now heahs the way gene figgers there sure was some deviltry down along the railroad an pat hawe trailed bandits up to the ranch he hunts hard an then all to onct he quits stewart says pat hawe wasnt scared but he discovered signs or somethin or got wind in some strange way that there was in the gang of bandits some fellers he didnt want to ketch sabe then gene quicker n a flash springs his plan on me hed go down to padre marcos

ive used up a lot of time explainin youll sure keep your nerve  yes madeline replied and was surprised at herself better tell florence shell be a power of comfort to you im goin now to fetch up the boys  instead of returning to her room madeline went through the office into the long corridor it was almost as dark as night she fancied she saw a slowgliding figure darker than the surrounding gloom and she entered upon the fulfilment of her part of the plan in something like trepidation her footsteps were noiseless finding the door to the kitchen and going in she struck lights upon passing out again she made certain she discerned a dark shape now motionless crouching along the wall but she mistrusted her vivid imagination it took all her boldness to enable her unconcernedly and naturally to strike the corridor light then she went on through her own rooms and thence into the patio  her guests laughingly and gladly entered into the spirit of the occasion madeline fancied her deceit must have been perfect seeing that it deceived even florence they trooped merrily into the kitchen madeline delaying at the door took a sharp but unobtrusive glance down the great barnlike hall she saw nothing but blank dark space suddenly from one side not a rod distant protruded a pale gleaming face breaking the even blackness instantly it flashed back out of sight yet that time was long enough for madeline to see a pair of glittering eyes and to recognize them as don carloss  without betraying either hurry or alarm she closed the door it had a heavy bolt which she slowly noiselessly shot then the cold amaze that had all but stunned her into inaction throbbed into wrath how dared that mexican steal into her home what did he mean was he one of the bandits supposed to be hidden in her house she was thinking herself into greater anger and excitement and probably would have betrayed herself had not florence who had evidently seen her bolt the door and now read her thoughts come toward her with a bright intent questioning look madeline caught herself in time  thereupon she gave each of her guests a duty to perform leading florence into the pantry she unburdened herself of the secret in one brief whisper florences reply was to point out of the little open window passing which was a file of stealthily moving cowboys then madeline lost both anger and fear retaining only the glow of excitement  madeline could be gay and she initiated the abandonment of dignity by calling castleton into the pantry and while interesting him in some pretext or other imprinting the outlines of her flourcovered hands upon the back of his black coat castleton innocently returned to the kitchen to be greeted with a roar that surprising act of the hostess set the pace and there followed a merry noisy time everybody helped the miscellaneous collection of dishes so confusingly contrived made up a dinner which they all heartily enjoyed madeline enjoyed it herself even with the feeling of a sword hanging suspended over her  the hour was late when she rose from the table and told her guests to go to their rooms don their ridingclothes pack what they needed for the long and adventurous camping trip that she hoped would be the climax of their western experience and to snatch a little sleep before the cowboys roused them for the early start  madeline went immediately to her room and was getting out her camping apparel when a knock interrupted her she thought florence had come to help her pack but this knock was upon the door opening out in the porch it was repeated  whos there she questioned  stewart came the reply  she opened the door he stood on the threshold beyond him indistinct in the gloom were several cowboys  may i speak to you he asked  certainly she hesitated a moment then asked him in and closed the door isis everything all right  no these bandits stick to cover pretty close they must have found out were on the watch but im sure well get you and your friends away before anything starts i wanted to tell you that ive talked with your servants they were just scared theyll come back tomorrow soon as bill gets rid of this gang you need not worry about them or your property  do you have any idea who is hiding in the house  i was worried some at first pat hawe acted queer i imagined hed discovered he was trailing bandits who might turn out to be his smuggling guerrilla cronies but talking with your servants finding a bunch of horses upon hidden down in the mesquite behind the pondseveral things have changed my mind my idea is that a cowardly handful of riffraff outcasts from the border have hidden in your house more by accident than design well let them goget rid of them without even a shot if i didnt think sowell id be considerably worried it would make a different state of affairs  stewart you are wrong she said  he started but his reply did not follow swiftly the expression of his eyes altered presently he spoke  how so  i saw one of these bandits i distinctly recognized him  one long step brought him close to her  who was he demanded stewart  don carlos  he muttered low and deep then said are you sure  absolutely i saw his figure twice in the hall then his face in the light i could never mistake his eyes  did he know you saw him  i am not positive but i think so oh he must have known i was standing full in the light i had entered the door then purposely stepped out his face showed from around a corner and swiftly flashed out of sight  madeline was tremblingly conscious that stewart underwent a transformation she saw as well as felt the leaping passion that changed him  call your friendsget them in here he ordered tersely and wheeled toward the door  stewart wait she said  he turned his white face his burning eyes his presence now charged with definite fearful meaning influenced her strangely weakened her  what will you do she asked  that neednt concern you get your party in here bar the windows and lock the doors youll be safe  stewart tell me what you intend to do  i wont tell you he replied and turned away again  but i will know she said with a hand on his arm she detained him she saw how he haltedfelt the shock in him as she touched him oh i do know you mean to fight  well miss hammond isnt it about time he asked evidently he overcame a violent passion for instant action there was weariness dignity even reproof in his question the fact of that mexicans presence here in your house ought to prove to you the nature of the case these vaqueros these guerrillas have found out you wont stand for any fighting on the part of your men don carlos is a sneak a coward yet hes not afraid to hide in your own house he has learned you wont let your cowboys hurt anybody hes taking advantage of it hell rob burn and make off with you hell murder too if it falls his way these greasers use knives in the dark so i askisnt it about time we stop him  stewart i forbid you to fight unless in selfdefense i forbid you  what i mean to do is selfdefense havent i tried to explain to you that just now weve wild times along this stretch of border must i tell you again that don carlos is hand and glove with the revolution the rebels are crazy to stir up the united states you are a woman of prominence don carlos would make off with you if he got you what little matter to cross the border with you well where would the hue and cry go through the troops along the border to new york to washington why it would mean what the rebels are working forunited states intervention in other words war  oh surely you exaggerate she cried  maybe so but im beginning to see the dons game and miss hammond iits awful for me to think what youd suffer if don carlos got you over the line i know these lowcaste mexicans ive been among the peonsthe slaves  stewart dont let don carlos get me replied madeline in sweet directness  she saw him shake saw his throat swell as he swallowed hard saw the hard fierceness return to his face  i wont thats why im going after him  but i forbade you to start a fight deliberately  then ill go ahead and start one without your permission he replied shortly and again he wheeled  this time when madeline caught his arm she held to it even after he stopped  no she said imperiously  he shook off her hand and strode forward  please dont go she called beseechingly but he kept on stewart  she ran ahead of him intercepted him faced him with her back against the door he swept out a long arm as if to brush her aside but it wavered and fell haggard troubled with working face he stood before her  its for your sake he expostulated  if it is for my sake then do what pleases me  these guerrillas will knife somebody theyll burn the house theyll make off with you theyll do something bad unless we stop them  let us risk all that she importuned  but its a terrible risk and it oughtnt be run he exclaimed passionately i know best here stillwell upholds me let me out miss hammond im going to take the boys and go after these guerrillas  no  good heavens exclaimed stewart why not let me go its the thing to do im sorry to distress you and your guests why not put an end to don carloss badgering is it because youre afraid a rumpus will spoil your friends visit  it isntnot this time  then its the idea of a little shooting at these greasers  no  youre sick to think of a little greaser blood staining the halls of your home  no  well then why keep me from doing what i know is best  stewart ii she faltered in growing agitation im frightenedconfused all this is tootoo much for me im not a coward if you have to fight youll see im not a coward but your way seems so recklessthat hall is so darkthe guerrillas would shoot from behind doors youre so wild so daring youd rush right into peril is that necessary i thinki meani dont know just why i feel soso about you doing it but i believe its because im afraid youyou might be hurt  youre afraid ii might be hurt he echoed wonderingly the hard whiteness of his face warming flushing glowing  yes  the single word with all it might mean with all it might not mean softened him as if by magic made him gentle amazed shy as a boy stifling under a torrent of emotions  madeline thought she had persuaded himworked her will with him then another of his startlingly sudden moves told her that she had reckoned too quickly this move was to put her firmly aside so he could pass and madeline seeing he would not hesitate to lift her out of the way surrendered the door he turned on the threshold his face was still working but the flamepointed gleam of his eyes indicated the return of that cowboy ruthlessness  im going to drive don carlos and his gang out of the house declared stewart i think i may promise you to do it without a fight but if it takes a fight off he goes     xv the mountain trail  as stewart departed from one door florence knocked upon another and madeline far shaken out of her usual serenity admitted the cool western girl with more than gladness just to have her near helped madeline to get back her balance she was conscious of florences sharp scrutiny then of a sweet deliberate change of manner florence might have been burning with curiosity to know more about the bandits hidden in the house the plans of the cowboys the reason for madelines suppressed emotion but instead of asking madeline questions she introduced the important subject of what to take on the camping trip for an hour they discussed the need of this and that article selected those things most needful and then packed them in madelines dufflebags  that done they decided to lie down fully dressed as they were in ridingcostume and sleep or at least rest the little remaining time left before the call to saddle madeline turned out the light and peeping through her window saw dark forms standing sentinellike in the gloom when she lay down she heard soft steps on the path this fidelity to her swelled her heart while the need of it presaged that fearful something which since stewarts passionate appeal to her haunted her as inevitable  madeline did not expect to sleep yet she did sleep and it seemed to have been only a moment until florence called her she followed florence outside it was the dark hour before dawn she could discern saddled horses being held by cowboys there was an air of hurry and mystery about the departure helen who came tiptoeing out with madelines other guests whispered that it was like an escape she was delighted the others were amused to madeline it was indeed an escape  in the darkness madeline could not see how many escorts her party was to have she heard low voices the champing of bits and thumping of hoofs and she recognized stewart when he led up majesty for her to mount then came a pattering of soft feet and the whining of dogs cold noses touched her hands and she saw the long gray shaggy shapes of her pack of russian wolfhounds that stewart meant to let them go with her was indicative of how he studied her pleasure she loved to be out with the hounds and her horse  stewart led majesty out into the darkness past a line of mounted horses  guess were ready he said ill make the count he went back along the line and on the return madeline heard him say several times now everybody ride close to the horse in front and keep quiet till daylight then the snorting and pounding of the big black horse in front of her told madeline that stewart had mounted  all right were off he called  madeline lifted majestys bridle and let the roan go there was a crack and crunch of gravel fire struck from stone a low whinny a snort and then steady short clipclop of iron hoofs on hard ground madeline could just discern stewart and his black outlined in shadowy gray before her yet they were almost within touching distance once or twice one of the huge staghounds leaped up at her and whined joyously a thick belt of darkness lay low and seemed to thin out above to a gray fog through which a few wan stars showed it was altogether an unusual departure from the ranch and madeline always susceptible even to ordinary incident that promised well now found herself thrillingly sensitive to the soft beat of hoofs the feel of cool moist air the dim sight of stewarts dark figure the caution the early start before dawn the enforced silencethese lent the occasion all that was needful to make it stirring  majesty plunged into a gully where sand and rough going made madeline stop romancing to attend to riding in the darkness stewart was not so easy to keep close to even on smooth trails and now she had to be watchfully attentive to do it then followed a long march through dragging sand meantime the blackness gradually changed to gray at length majesty climbed out of the wash and once more his iron shoes rang on stone he began to climb the figure of stewart and his horse loomed more distinctly in madelines sight bending over she tried to see the trail but could not she wondered how stewart could follow a trail in the dark his eyes must be as piercing as they sometimes looked over her shoulder madeline could not see the horse behind her but she heard him  as majesty climbed steadily madeline saw the gray darkness grow opaque change and lighten lose its substance and yield the grotesque shapes of yucca and ocotillo dawn was about to break madeline imagined she was facing east still she saw no brightening of sky all at once to her surprise stewart and his powerful horse stood clear in her sight she saw the characteristic rock and cactus and brush that covered the foothills the trail was old and seldom used and it zigzagged and turned and twisted looking back she saw the short squat figure of monty price humped over his saddle montys face was hidden under his sombrero behind him rode dorothy coombs and next loomed up the lofty form of nick steele madeline and the members of her party were riding between cowboy escorts  bright daylight came and madeline saw the trail was leading up through foothills it led in a roundabout way through shallow gullies full of stone and brush washed down by floods at every turn now madeline expected to come upon water and the waiting packtrain but time passed and miles of climbing and no water or horses were met expectation in madeline gave place to desire she was hungry  presently stewarts horse went splashing into a shallow pool beyond that damp places in the sand showed here and there and again more water in rocky pockets stewart kept on it was eight oclock by madelines watch when upon turning into a wide hollow she saw horses grazing on spare grass a great pile of canvascovered bundles and a fire round which cowboys and two mexican women were busy  madeline sat her horse and reviewed her followers as they rode up single file her guests were in merry mood and they all talked at once  breakfastand rustle called out stewart without ceremony  no need to tell me to rustle said helen i am simply ravenous this air makes me hungry  for that matter madeline observed helen did not show any marked contrast to the others the hurry order however did not interfere with the meal being somewhat in the nature of a picnic while they ate and talked and laughed the cowboys were packing horses and burros and throwing the diamondhitch a procedure so interesting to castleton that he got up with coffeecup in hand and tramped from one place to another  heard of that diamondhitchup he observed to a cowboy bally nice little job  as soon as the packtrain was in readiness stewart started it off in the lead to break trail a heavy growth of shrub interspersed with rock and cactus covered the slopes and now all the trail appeared to be uphill it was not a question of comfort for madeline and her party for comfort was impossible it was a matter of making the travel possible for him florence wore corduroy breeches and hightop boots and the advantage of this masculine garb was at once in evidence the ridinghabits of the other ladies suffered considerably from the sharp spikes it took all madelines watchfulness to save her horses legs to pick the best bits of open ground to make cutoffs from the trail and to protect herself from outreaching thorny branches so that the time sped by without her knowing it the packtrain forged ahead and the trailing couples grew farther apart at noon they got out of the foothills to face the real ascent of the mountains the sun beat down hot there was little breeze and the dust rose thick and hung in a pall the view was restricted and what scenery lay open to the eye was dreary and drab a barren monotony of slowmounting slopes ridged by rocky canyons  once stewart waited for madeline and as she came up he said  were going to have a storm  that will be a relief its so hot and dusty replied madeline  shall i call a halt and make camp  here oh no what do you think best  well if we have a good healthy thunderstorm it will be something new for your friends i think wed be wise to keep on the go theres no place to make a good camp the wind would blow us off this slope if the rain didnt wash us off itll take allday travel to reach a good campsite and i dont promise that were making slow time if it rains let it rain the pack outfit is well covered we will have to get wet  surely replied madeline and she smiled at his inference she knew what a storm was in that country and her guests had yet to experience one if it rains let it rain  stewart rode on and madeline followed up the slope toiled and nodded the packanimals the little burros going easily where the horses labored their packs like the humps of camels bobbed from side to side stones rattled down the heatwaves wavered black the dust puffed up and sailed the sky was a pale blue like heated steel except where dark clouds peeped over the mountain crests a heavy sultry atmosphere made breathing difficult down the slope the trailing party stretched out in twos and threes and it was easy to distinguish the weary riders  half a mile farther up madeline could see over the foothills to the north and west and a little south and she forgot the heat and weariness and discomfort for her guests in wide unlimited prospects of sunscorched earth she marked the gray valley and the black mountains and the wide red gateway of the desert and the dim shadowy peaks blue as the sky they pierced she was sorry when the bleak gnarled cedartrees shut off her view  then there came a respite from the steep climb and the way led in a winding course through a matted stormwrenched forest of stunted trees even up to this elevation the desert reached with its gaunt hand the clouds overspreading the sky hiding the sun made a welcome change the packtrain rested and stewart and madeline waited for the party to come up here he briefly explained to her that don carlos and his bandits had left the ranch some time in the night thunder rumbled in the distance and a faint wind rustled the scant foliage of the cedars the air grew oppressive the horses panted  sure itll be a hummer said stewart the first storm almost always is bad i can feel it in the air  the air indeed seemed to be charged with a heavy force that was waiting to be liberated  one by one the couples mounted to the cedar forest and the feminine contingent declaimed eloquently for rest but there was to be no permanent rest until night and then that depended upon reaching the crags the packtrain wagged onward and stewart fell in behind the stormcenter gathered slowly around the peaks low rumble and howl of thunder increased in frequence slowly the light shaded as smoky clouds rolled up the air grew sultrier and the exasperating breeze puffed a few times and then failed  an hour later the party had climbed high and was rounding the side of a great bare ridge that long had hidden the crags the last burro of the packtrain plodded over the ridge out of madelines sight she looked backward down the slope amused to see her guests change wearily from side to side in their saddles far below lay the cedar flat and the foothills far to the west the sky was still clear with shafts of sunlight shooting down from behind the encroaching clouds  stewart reached the summit of the ridge and though only a few rods ahead he waved to her sweeping his hand round to what he saw beyond it was an impressive gesture and madeline never having climbed as high as this anticipated much  majesty surmounted the last few steps and snorting halted beside stewarts black to madeline the scene was as if the world had changed the ridge was a mountaintop it dropped before her into a black stoneridged shrubpatched manycanyoned gulf eastward beyond the gulf round bare mountainheads loomed up upward on the right led giant steps of cliff and bench and weathered slope to the firbordered and pinefringed crags standing dark and bare against the stormy sky massed inky clouds were piling across the peaks obscuring the highest ones a fork of white lightning flashed and like the booming of an avalanche thunder followed  that bold world of broken rock under the slow mustering of stormclouds was a grim aweinspiring spectacle it had beauty but beauty of the sublime and majestic kind the fierce desert had reached up to meet the magnetic heights where heat and wind and frost and lightning and flood contended in everlasting strife and before their onslaught this mighty upflung world of rugged stone was crumbling splitting wearing to ruin  madeline glanced at stewart he had forgotten her presence immovable as stone he sat his horse darkfaced darkeyed and like an indian unconscious of thought he watched and watched to see him thus to divine the strange affinity between the soul of this man become primitive and the savage environment that had developed him were powerful helps to madeline hammond in her strange desire to understand his nature  a cracking of ironshod hoofs behind her broke the spell monty had reached the summit  gene what it wont all be doin in a minnut moses hisself couldnt tell observed monty  then dorothy climbed to his side and looked  oh isnt it just perfectly lovely she exclaimed but i wish it wouldnt storm well all get wet  once more stewart faced the ascent keeping to the slow heave of the ridge as it rose southward toward the looming spires of rock soon he was off smooth ground and madeline some rods behind him looked back with concern at her friends here the real toil the real climb began and a mountain storm was about to burst in all its fury  the slope that stewart entered upon was a magnificent monument to the ruined crags above it was a southerly slope and therefore semiarid covered with cercocarpus and yucca and some shrub that madeline believed was manzanita every foot of the trail seemed to slide under majesty what hard ground there was could not be traveled upon owing to the spiny covering or masses of shattered rocks gullies lined the slope  then the sky grew blacker the slowgathering clouds appeared to be suddenly agitated they piled and rolled and mushroomed and obscured the crags the air moved heavily and seemed to be laden with sulphurous smoke and sharp lightning flashes began to play a distant roar of wind could be heard between the peals of thunder  stewart waited for madeline under the lee of a shelving cliff where the cowboys had halted the packtrain majesty was sensitive to the flashes of lightning madeline patted his neck and softly called to him the weary burros nodded the mexican women covered their heads with their mantles stewart untied the slicker at the back of madelines saddle and helped her on with it then he put on his own the other cowboys followed suit presently madeline saw monty and dorothy rounding the cliff and hoped the others would come soon  a bluewhite knotted rope of lightning burned down out of the clouds and instantly a thunderclap crashed seeming to shake the foundations of the earth then it rolled as if banging from cloud to cloud and boomed along the peaks and reverberated from deep to low at last to rumble away into silence madeline felt the electricity in majestys mane and it seemed to tingle through her nerves the air had a weird bright cast the ponderous clouds swallowed more and more of the eastern domes this moment of the breaking of the storm with the strange growing roar of wind like a moaning monster was pregnant with a heartdisturbing emotion for madeline hammond glorious it was to be free healthy out in the open under the shadow of the mountain and cloud in the teeth of the wind and rain and storm  another dazzling blue blaze showed the bold mountainside and the stormdriven clouds in the flare of light madeline saw stewarts face  are you afraid she asked  yes he replied simply  then the thunderbolt racked the heavens and as it boomed away in lessening power madeline reflected with surprise upon stewarts answer something in his face had made her ask him what she considered a foolish question his reply amazed her she loved a storm why should he fear ithe with whom she could not associate fear  how strange have you not been out in many storms  a smile that was only a gleam flitted over his dark face  in hundreds of them by day with the cattle stampeding at night alone on the mountain with the pines crashing and the rocks rollingin flood on the desert  its not only the lightning then she asked  no all the storm  madeline felt that henceforth she would have less faith in what she had imagined was her love of the elements what little she knew if this ironnerved man feared a storm then there was something about a storm to fear  and suddenly as the ground quaked under her horses feet and all the sky grew black and crisscrossed by flaming streaks and between thunderous reports there was a strange hollow roar sweeping down upon her she realized how small was her knowledge and experience of the mighty forces of nature then with that perversity of character of which she was wholly conscious she was humble submissive reverent and fearful even while she gloried in the grandeur of the dark cloudshadowed crags and canyons the stupendous strife of sound the wonderful driving lances of white fire  with blacker gloom and deafening roar came the torrent of rain it was a cloudburst it was like solid water tumbling down for long madeline sat her horse head bent to the pelting rain when its force lessened and she heard stewart call for all to follow she looked up to see that he was starting once more she shot a glimpse at dorothy and as quickly glanced away dorothy who would not wear a hat suitable for inclement weather nor one of the horrid yellow sticky slickers was a drenched and disheveled spectacle madeline did not trust herself to look at the other girls it was enough to hear their lament so she turned her horse into stewarts trail  rain fell steadily the fury of the storm however had passed and the roll of thunder diminished in volume the air had wonderfully cleared and was growing cool madeline began to feel uncomfortably cold and wet stewart was climbing faster than formerly and she noted that monty kept at her heels pressing her on time had been lost and the campsite was a long way off the staghounds began to lag and get footsore the sharp rocks of the trail were cruel to their feet then as madeline began to tire she noticed less and less around her the ascent grew rougher and steeperslow toil for panting horses the thinning rain grew colder and sometimes a stronger whip of wind lashed stingingly in madelines face her horse climbed and climbed and brush and sharp corners of stone everlastingly pulled and tore at her wet garments a gray gloom settled down around her night was approaching majesty heaved upward with a snort the wet saddle creaked and an even motion told madeline she was on level ground she looked up to see looming crags and spires like huge pipeorgans dark at the base and growing light upward the rain had ceased but the branches of firtrees and juniper were watersoaked arms reaching out for her through an opening between crags madeline caught a momentary glimpse of the west red sunshafts shone through the murky broken clouds the sun had set  stewarts horse was on a jogtrot now and madeline left the trail more to majesty than to her own choosing the shadows deepened and the crags grew gloomy and spectral a cool wind moaned through the dark trees coyotes scenting the hounds kept apace of them and barked and howled off in the gloom but the tired hounds did not appear to notice  as black night began to envelop her surroundings madeline marked that the firtrees had given place to pine forest suddenly a pinpoint of light pierced the ebony blackness like a solitary star in dark sky it twinkled and blinked she lost sight of itfound it again it grew larger black treetrunks crossed her line of vision the light was a fire she heard a cowboy song and the wild chorus of a pack of coyotes drops of rain on the branches of trees glittered in the rays of the fire stewarts tall figure with sombrero slouched down was now and then outlined against a growing circle of light and by the aid of that light she saw him turn every moment or so to look back probably to assure himself that she was close behind  with a prospect of fire and warmth and food and rest madelines enthusiasm revived what a climb there was promise in this wild ride and lonely trail and hidden craggy height not only in the adventure her friends yearned for but in some nameless joy and spirit for herself     xvi the crags  glad indeed was madeline to be lifted off her horse beside a roaring fireto see steaming pots upon redhot coals except about her shoulders which had been protected by the slicker she was wringing wet the mexican women came quickly to help her change in a tent near by but madeline preferred for the moment to warm her numb feet and hands and to watch the spectacle of her arriving friends  dorothy plumped off her saddle into the arms of several waiting cowboys she could scarcely walk far removed in appearance was she from her usual stylish self her face was hidden by a limp and lopsided hat from under the disheveled brim came a plaintive moan ohh what aan aawful ride mrs beck was in worse condition she had to be taken off her horse im paralyzedim a wreck bobby get a rollerchair bobby was solicitous and willing but there were no rollerchairs florence dismounted easily and but for her mass of hair wet and tumbling would have been taken for a handsome cowboy edith wayne had stood the physical strain of the ride better than dorothy however as her mount was rather small she had been more at the mercy of cactus and brush her habit hung in tatters helen had preserved a remnant of style as well as of pride and perhaps a little strength but her face was white her eyes were big and she limped majesty she exclaimed what did you want to do to us kill us outright or make us homesick of all of them however ambroses wife christine the little french maid had suffered the most in that long ride she was unaccustomed to horses ambrose had to carry her into the big tent florence persuaded madeline to leave the fire and when they went in with the others dorothy was wailing because her wet boots would not come off mrs beck was weeping and trying to direct a mexican woman to unfasten her bedraggled dress and there was general pandemonium  warm clotheshot drinks and grubwarm blankets rang out stewarts sharp order  then with florence helping the mexican women it was not long until madeline and the feminine side of the party were comfortable except for the weariness and aches that only rest and sleep could alleviate  neither fatigue nor pains however nor the strangeness of being packed sardinelike under canvas nor the howls of coyotes kept madelines guests from stretching out with long grateful sighs and one by one dropping into deep slumber madeline whispered a little to florence and laughed with her once or twice and then the light flickering on the canvas faded and her eyelids closed darkness and roar of camp life low voices of men thump of horses hoofs coyote serenade the sense of warmth and sweet restall drifted away              when she awakened shadows of swaying branches moved on the sunlit canvas above her she heard the ringing strokes of an ax but no other sound from outside slow regular breathing attested to the deep slumbers of her tent comrades she observed presently that florence was missing from the number madeline rose and peeped out between the flaps  an exquisitely beautiful scene surprised and enthralled her gaze she saw a level space green with long grass bright with flowers dotted with groves of graceful firs and pines and spruces reaching to superb crags rosy and golden in the sunlight eager to get out where she could enjoy an unrestricted view she searched for her pack found it in a corner and then hurriedly and quietly dressed  her favorite staghounds russ and tartar were asleep before the door where they had been chained she awakened them and loosened them thinking the while that it must have been stewart who had chained them near her close at hand also was a cowboys bed rolled up in a tarpaulin  the cool air fragrant with pine and spruce and some subtle nameless tang sweet and tonic made madeline stand erect and breathe slowly and deeply it was like drinking of a magic draught she felt it in her blood that it quickened its flow turning to look in the other direction beyond the tent she saw the remnants of last nights temporary camp and farther on a grove of beautiful pines from which came the sharp ring of the ax wider gaze took in a wonderful park not only surrounded by lofty crags but full of crags of lesser height many lifting their heads from darkgreen groves of trees the morning sun not yet above the eastern elevations sent its rosy and golden shafts in between the towering rocks to tip the pines  madeline with the hounds beside her walked through the nearest grove the ground was soft and springy and brown with pineneedles then she saw that a clump of trees had prevented her from seeing the most striking part of this natural park the cowboys had selected a campsite where they would have the morning sun and afternoon shade several tents and flies were already up there was a huge leanto made of spruce boughs cowboys were busy round several campfires piles of packs lay covered with tarpaulins and beds were rolled up under the trees this space was a kind of rolling meadow with isolated trees here and there and other trees in aisles and circles and it mounted up in low grassy banks to great towers of stone five hundred feet high other crags rose behind these from under a mossy cliff huge and green and cool bubbled a full clear spring wild flowers fringed its banks out in the meadow the horses were kneedeep in grass that waved in the morning breeze  florence espied madeline under the trees and came running she was like a young girl with life and color and joy she wore a flannel blouse corduroy skirt and moccasins and her hair was fastened under a band like an indians  castletons gone with a gun for hours it seems said florence gene just went to hunt him up the other gentlemen are still asleep i imagine they sure will sleep up heah in this air  then businesslike florence fell to questioning madeline about details of camp arrangement which stewart and florence herself could hardly see to without suggestion  before any of madelines sleepy guests awakened the camp was completed madeline and florence had a tent under a pinetree but they did not intend to sleep in it except during stormy weather they spread a tarpaulin made their bed on it and elected to sleep under the light of the stars after that taking the hounds with them they explored to madelines surprise the park was not a little halfmile nook nestling among the crags but extended farther than they cared to walk and was rather a series of parks they were no more than small valleys between graytoothed peaks as the day advanced the charm of the place grew upon madeline even at noon with the sun beating down there was comfortable warmth rather than heat it was the kind of warmth that madeline liked to feel in the spring and the sweet thin rare atmosphere began to affect her strangely she breathed deeply of it until she felt lightheaded as if her body lacked substance and might drift away like a thistledown all at once she grew uncomfortably sleepy a dreamy languor possessed her and lying under a pine with her head against florence she went to sleep when she opened her eyes the shadows of the crags stretched from the west and between them streamed a redgold light it was hazy smoky sunshine losing its fire the afternoon had far advanced madeline sat up florence was lazily reading the two mexican women were at work under the fly where the big stone fireplace had been erected no one else was in sight  florence upon being questioned informed madeline that incident about camp had been delightfully absent castleton had returned and was profoundly sleeping with the other men presently a chorus of merry calls attracted madelines attention and she turned to see helen limping along with dorothy and mrs beck and edith supporting each other they were all rested but lame and delighted with the place and as hungry as bears awakened from a winters sleep madeline forthwith escorted them round the camp and through the many aisles between the trees and to the mossy pinematted nooks under the crags  then they had dinner sitting on the ground after the manner of indians and it was a dinner that lacked merriment only because everybody was too busily appeasing appetite  later stewart led them across a neck of the park up a rather steep climb between towering crags to take them out upon a grassy promontory that faced the great open westa vast ridged streaked and reddened sweep of earth rolling down as it seemed to the golden sunset end of the world castleton said it was a jolly fine view dorothy voiced her usual languid enthusiasm helen was on fire with pleasure and wonder mrs beck appealed to bobby to see how he liked it before she ventured and she then reiterated his praise and edith wayne like madeline and florence was silent boyd was politely interested he was the kind of man who appeared to care for things as other people cared for them  madeline watched the slow transformation of the changing west with its haze of desert dust through which mountain and cloud and sun slowly darkened she watched until her eyes ached and scarcely had a thought of what she was watching when her eyes shifted to encounter the tall form of stewart standing motionless on the rim her mind became active again as usual he stood apart from the others and now he seemed aloof and unconscious he made a dark powerful figure and he fitted that wild promontory  she experienced a strange annoying surprise when she discovered both helen and dorothy watching stewart with peculiar interest edith too was alive to the splendid picture the cowboy made but when edith smiled and whispered in her ear its so good to look at a man like that madeline again felt the surprise only this time the accompaniment was a vague pleasure rather than annoyance helen and dorothy were flirts one deliberate and skilled the other unconscious and natural edith wayne occasionallyand madeline reflected that the occasions were infrequentadmired a man sincerely just here madeline might have fallen into a somewhat revealing state of mind if it had not been for the fact that she believed stewart was only an object of deep interest to her not as a man but as a part of this wild and wonderful west which was claiming her so she did not inquire of herself why helens coquetry and dorothys languishing allurement annoyed her or why ediths eloquent smile and words had pleased her she got as far however as to think scornfully how helen and dorothy would welcome and meet a flirtation with this cowboy and then go back home and forget him as utterly as if he had never existed she wondered too with a curious twist of feeling that was almost eagerness how the cowboy would meet their advances obviously the situation was unfair to him and if by some strange accident he escaped unscathed by dorothys beautiful eyes he would never be able to withstand helens subtle and fascinating and imperious personality  they returned to camp in the cool of the evening and made merry round a blazing campfire but madelines guests soon succumbed to the persistent and irresistible desire to sleep  then madeline went to bed with florence under the pinetree russ lay upon one side and tartar upon the other the cool night breeze swept over her fanning her face waving her hair it was not strong enough to make any sound through the branches but it stirred a faint silken rustle in the long grass the coyotes began their weird bark and howl russ raised his head to growl at their impudence  madeline faced upward and it seemed to her that under those wonderful white stars she would never be able to go to sleep they blinked down through the blackbarred delicate crisscross of pine foliage and they looked so big and so close then she gazed away to open space where an expanse of sky glittered with stars and the longer she gazed the larger they grew and the more she saw  it was her belief that she had come to love all the physical things from which sensations of beauty and mystery and strength poured into her responsive mind but best of all she loved these western stars for they were to have something to do with her life were somehow to influence her destiny              for a few days the prevailing features of camp life for madelines guests were sleep and rest dorothy coombs slept through twentyfour hours and then was so difficult to awaken that for a while her friends were alarmed helen almost fell asleep while eating and talking the men were more visibly affected by the mountain air than the women castleton however would not succumb to the strange drowsiness while he had a chance to prowl around with a gun  this languorous spell disappeared presently and then the days were full of life and action mrs beck and bobby and boyd however did not go in for anything very strenuous edith wayne too preferred to walk through the groves or sit upon the grassy promontory it was helen and dorothy who wanted to explore the crags and canyons and when they could not get the others to accompany them they went alone giving the cowboy guides many a long climb  necessarily of course madeline and her guests were now thrown much in company with the cowboys and the party grew to be like one big family her friends not only adapted themselves admirably to the situation but came to revel in it as for madeline she saw that outside of a certain proclivity of the cowboys to be gallant and on dressparade and alive to possibilities of fun and excitement they were not greatly different from what they were at all times if there were a leveling process here it was made by her friends coming down to meet the westerners besides any class of people would tend to grow natural in such circumstances and environment  madeline found the situation one of keen and double interest for her if before she had cared to study her cowboys particularly stewart now with the contrasts afforded by her guests she felt by turns she was amused and mystified and perplexed and saddened and then again subtly pleased  monty once he had overcome his shyness became a source of delight to madeline and for that matter to everybody monty had suddenly discovered that he was a success among the ladies either he was exalted to heroic heights by this knowledge or he made it appear so dorothy had been his undoing and in justice to her madeline believed her innocent dorothy thought monty hideous to look at and accordingly if he had been a hero a hundred times and had saved a hundred poor little babies lives he could not have interested her monty followed her around reminding her she told madeline of a little adoring dog one moment and the next of a huge devouring gorilla  nels and nick stalked at helens heels like grenadiers on duty and if she as much as dropped her glove they almost came to blows to see who should pick it up  in a way castleton was the best feature of the camping party he was such an absurdlooking little man and his abilities were at such tremendous odds with what might have been expected of him from his looks he could ride tramp climb shoot he liked to help around the camp and the cowboys could not keep him from it he had an insatiable desire to do things that were new to him the cowboys played innumerable tricks upon him not one of which he ever discovered he was serious slow in speech and action and absolutely imperturbable if imperturbability could ever be good humor then he was always goodhumored presently the cowboys began to understand him and then to like him when they liked a man it meant something madeline had been sorry more than once to see how little the cowboys chose to speak to boyd harvey with castleton however they actually became friends they did not know it and certainly such a thing never occurred to him all the same it was a fact and it grew solely out of the truth that the englishman was manly in the only way cowboys could have interpreted manliness when after innumerable attempts he succeeded in throwing the diamondhitch on a packhorse the cowboys began to respect him castleton needed only one more accomplishment to claim their hearts and he kept trying thatto ride a bucking bronco one of the cowboys had a bronco that they called devil every day for a week devil threw the englishman all over the park ruined his clothes bruised him and finally kicked him then the cowboys solicitously tried to make castleton give up and this was remarkable enough for the spectacle of an english lord on a bucking bronco was one that any westerner would have ridden a thousand miles to see whenever devil threw castleton the cowboys went into spasms but castleton did not know the meaning of the word fail and there came a day when devil could not throw him then it was a singular sight to see the men line up to shake hands with the cool englishman even stewart who had watched from the background came forward with a warm and pleasant smile on his dark face when castleton went to his tent there was much characteristic cowboy talk and this time vastly different from the former persiflage  by gawd ejaculated monty price who seemed to be the most amazed and elated of them all thets the fust englishman i ever seen hes orful deceivin to look at but i know now why england rules the wurrld jest take a peek at thet bronco his spirit is broke rid by a leetle english dook no bigger n a grasshopper fellers if it haint dawned on you yit let monty price give you a hunch theres no flies on castleton an ill bet a million steers to a rawhide rope thet next hell be throwin a gun as good as nels  it was a distinct pleasure for madeline to realize that she liked castleton all the better for the traits brought out so forcibly by his association with the cowboys on the other hand she liked the cowboys better for something in them that contact with easterners brought out this was especially true in stewarts case she had been wholly wrong when she had imagined he would fall an easy victim to dorothys eyes and helens lures he was kind helpful courteous and watchful but he had no sentiment he did not see dorothys charms or feel helens fascination and their efforts to captivate him were now so obvious that mrs beck taunted them and edith smiled knowingly and bobby and boyd made playful remarks all of which cut helens pride and hurt dorothys vanity they essayed open conquest of stewart  so it came about that madeline unconsciously admitted the cowboy to a place in her mind never occupied by any other the instant it occurred to her why he was proof against the wiles of the other women she drove that amazing and strangely disturbing thought from her nevertheless as she was human she could not help thinking and being pleased and enjoying a little the discomfiture of the two coquettes  moreover from this thought of stewart and the watchfulness growing out of it she discovered more about him he was not happy he often paced up and down the grove at night he absented himself from camp sometimes during the afternoon when nels and nick and monty were there he was always watching the trails as if he expected to see some one come riding up he alone of the cowboys did not indulge in the fun and talk around the campfire he remained preoccupied and sad and was always looking away into distance madeline had a strange sense of his guardianship over her and remembering don carlos she imagined he worried a good deal over his charge and indeed over the safety of all the party  but if he did worry about possible visits from wandering guerrillas why did he absent himself from camp suddenly into madelines inquisitive mind flashed a remembrance of the darkeyed mexican girl bonita who had never been heard of since that night she rode stewarts big horse out of el cajon the remembrance of her brought an idea perhaps stewart had a rendezvous in the mountains and these lonely trips of his were to meet bonita with the idea hot blood flamed into madelines cheek then she was amazed at her own feelingsamazed because her swiftest succeeding thought was to deny the ideaamazed that its conception had fired her cheek with shame then her old self the one aloof from this redblooded new self gained control over her emotions  but madeline found that newborn self a creature of strange power to return and govern at any moment she found it fighting loyally for what intelligence and wisdom told her was only her romantic conception of a cowboy she reasoned if stewart were the kind of man her feminine skepticism wanted to make him he would not have been so blind to the coquettish advances of helen and dorothy he had once beenshe did not want to recall what he had once been but he had been uplifted madeline hammond declared that she was swayed by a strong beating pride and her instinctive womans faith told her that he could not stoop to such dishonor she reproached herself for having momentarily thought of it              one afternoon a huge stormcloud swooped out of the sky and enveloped the crags it obscured the westering sun and laid a mantle of darkness over the park madeline was uneasy because several of her party including helen and dorothy had ridden off with the cowboys that afternoon and had not returned florence assured her that even if they did not get back before the storm broke there was no reason for apprehension nevertheless madeline sent for stewart and asked him to go or send some one in search of them  perhaps half an hour later madeline heard the welcome pattering of hoofs on the trail the big tent was brightly lighted by several lanterns edith and florence were with her it was so black outside that madeline could not see a rod before her face the wind was moaning in the trees and big drops of rain were pelting upon the canvas  presently just outside the door the horses halted and there was a sharp bustle of sound such as would naturally result from a hurried dismounting and confusion in the dark mrs beck came running into the tent out of breath and radiant because they had beaten the storm helen entered next and a little later came dorothy but long enough to make her entrance more noticeable the instant madeline saw dorothys blazing eyes she knew something unusual had happened whatever it was might have escaped comment had not helen caught sight of dorothy  heavens dot but youre handsome occasionally remarked helen when you get some life in your face and eyes  dorothy turned her face away from the others and perhaps it was only accident that she looked into a mirror hanging on the tent wall swiftly she put her hand up to feel a wide red welt on her cheek dorothy had been assiduously careful of her soft white skin and here was an ugly mark marring its beauty  look at that she cried in distress my complexions ruined  how did you get such a splotch inquired helen going closer  ive been kissed exclaimed dorothy dramatically  what queried helen more curiously while the others laughed  ive been kissedhugged and kissed by one of those shameless cowboys it was so pitchdark outside i couldnt see a thing and so noisy i couldnt hear but somebody was trying to help me off my horse my foot caught in the stirrup and away i wentright into somebodys arms then he did it the wretch he hugged and kissed me in a most awful bearish manner i couldnt budge a finger im simply boiling with rage  when the outburst of mirth subsided dorothy turned her big dilated eyes upon florence  do these cowboys really take advantage of a girl when shes helpless and in the dark  of course they do replied florence with her frank smile  dot what in the world could you expect asked helen havent you been dying to be kissed  no  well you acted like it then i never before saw you in a rage over being kissed  ii wouldnt care so much if the brute hadnt scoured the skin off my face he had whiskers as sharp and stiff as sandpaper and when i jerked away he rubbed my cheek with them  this revelation as to the cause of her outraged dignity almost prostrated her friends with glee  dot i agree with you its one thing to be kissed and quite another to have your beauty spoiled replied helen presently who was this particular savage  i dont know burst out dorothy if i did idid  her eyes expressed the direful punishment she could not speak  honestly now dot havent you the least idea who did it questioned helen  i hopei think it was stewart replied dorothy  ah dot your hope is father to the thought my dear im sorry to riddle your little romance stewart did notcould not have been the offender or hero  how do you know he couldnt demanded dorothy flushing  because he was cleanshaven today at noon before we rode out i remember perfectly how nice and smooth and brown his face looked  oh do you well if your memory for faces is so good maybe you can tell me which one of these cowboys wasnt cleanshaven  merely a matter of elimination replied helen merrily it was not nick it was not nels it was not frankie there was only one other cowboy with us and he had a short stubby growth of black beard much like that cactus we passed on the trail  oh i was afraid of it moaned dorothy i knew he was going to do it that horrible little smiling demon monty price              a favorite loungingspot of madelines was a shaded niche under the lee of crags facing the east here the outlook was entirely different from that on the western side it was not red and white and glaring nor so changeable that it taxed attention this eastern view was one of the mountains and valleys where to be sure there were arid patches but the restful green of pine and fir was there and the cool gray of crags bold and rugged indeed were these mountain features yet they were companionably close not immeasurably distant and unattainable like the desert here in the shade of afternoon madeline and edith would often lounge under a lowbranched tree seldom they talked much for it was afternoon and dreamy with the strange spell of this mountain fastness there was smoky haze in the valleys a fleecy cloud resting over the peaks a sailing eagle in the blue sky silence that was the unbroken silence of the wild heights and a soft wind laden with incense of pine  one afternoon however edith appeared prone to talk seriously  majesty i must go home soon i cannot stay out here forever are you going back with me  well maybe replied madeline thoughtfully i have considered it i shall have to visit home some time but this summer mother and father are going to europe  see here majesty hammond do you intend to spend the rest of your life in this wilderness asked edith bluntly  madeline was silent  oh it is glorious dont misunderstand me dear went on edith earnestly as she laid her hand on madelines this trip has been a revelation to me i did not tell you majesty that i was ill when i arrived now im well so well look at helen too why she was a ghost when we got here now she is brown and strong and beautiful if it were for nothing else than this wonderful gift of health i would love the west but i have come to love it for other thingseven spiritual things majesty i have been studying you i see and feel what this life has made of you when i came i wondered at your strength your virility your serenity your happiness and i was stunned i wondered at the causes of your change now i know you were sick of idleness sick of uselessness if not of societysick of the horrible noises and smells and contacts one can no longer escape in the cities i am sick of all that too and i could tell you many women of our kind who suffer in a like manner you have done what many of us want to do but have not the courage you have left it i am not blind to the splendid difference you have made in your life i think i would have discovered even if your brother had not told me what good you have done to the mexicans and cattlemen of your range then you have work to do that is much the secret of your happiness is it not tell me tell me something of what it means to you  work of course has much to do with any ones happiness replied madeline no one can be happy who has no work as regards myselffor the rest i can hardly tell you i have never tried to put it in words frankly i believe if i had not had money that i could not have found such contentment here that is not in any sense a judgment against the west but if i had been poor i could not have bought and maintained my ranch stillwell tells me there are many larger ranches than mine but none just like it then i am almost paying my expenses out of my business think of that my income instead of being wasted is mostly saved i thinki hope i am useful i have been of some little good to the mexicanseased the hardships of a few cowboys for the rest i think my life is a kind of dream of course my ranch and range are real my cowboys are typical if i were to tell you how i feel about them it would simply be a story of how madeline hammond sees the west they are true to the west it is i who am strange and what i feel for them may be strange too edith hold to your own impressions  but majesty my impressions have changed at first i did not like the wind the dust the sun the endless open stretches but now i do like them where once i saw only terrible wastes of barren ground now i see beauty and something noble then at first your cowboys struck me as dirty rough loud crude savageall that was primitive i did not want them near me i imagined them callous hard men their only joy a carouse with their kind but i was wrong i have changed the dirt was only dust and this desert dust is clean they are still rough loud crude and savage in my eyes but with a difference they are natural men they are little children monty price is one of natures noblemen the hard thing is to discover it all his hideous person all his actions and speech are masks of his real nature nels is a joy a simple sweet kindly quiet man whom some woman should have loved what would love have meant to him he told me that no woman ever loved him except his mother and he lost her when he was ten every man ought to be lovedespecially such a man as nels somehow his gun record does not impress me i never could believe he killed a man then take your foreman stewart he is a cowboy his work and life the same as the others but he has education and most of the graces we are in the habit of saying make a gentleman stewart is a strange fellow just like this strange country hes a man majesty and i admire him so you see my impressions are developing with my stay out here  edith i am so glad you told me that replied madeline warmly  i like the country and i like the men went on edith one reason i want to go home soon is because i am discontented enough at home now without falling in love with the west for of course majesty i would i could not live out here and that brings me to my point admitting all the beauty and charm and wholesomeness and good of this wonderful country still it is no place for you madeline hammond you have your position your wealth your name your family you must marry you must have children you must not give up all that for a quixotic life in a wilderness  i am convinced edith that i shall live here all the rest of my life  oh majesty i hate to preach this way but i promised your mother i would talk to you and the truth is i hatei hate what im saying i envy you your courage and wisdom i know you have refused to marry boyd harvey i could see that in his face i believe you will refuse castleton whom will you marry what chance is there for a woman of your position to marry out here what in the world will become of you  quien sabe replied madeline with a smile that was almost sad              not so many hours after this conversation with edith madeline sat with boyd harvey upon the grassy promontory overlooking the west and she listened once again to his suave courtship  suddenly she turned to him and said boyd if i married you would you be willingglad to spend the rest of your life here in the west  majesty he exclaimed there was amaze in the voice usually so even and well modulatedamaze in the handsome face usually so indifferent her question had startled him she saw him look down the irongray cliffs over the barren slopes and cedared ridges beyond the cactuscovered foothills to the grim and ghastly desert just then with its red veils of sunlit dustclouds its illimitable waste of ruined and upheaved earth it was a sinister spectacle  no he replied with a tinge of shame in his cheek madeline said no more nor did he speak she was spared the pain of refusing him and she imagined he would never ask her again there was both relief and regret in the conviction humiliated lovers seldom made good friends  it was impossible not to like boyd harvey the thought of that and why she could not marry him concentrated her neversatisfied mind upon the man she looked at him and she thought of him  he was handsome young rich well born pleasant cultivatedhe was all that made a gentleman of his class if he had any vices she had not heard of them she knew he had no thirst for drink or craze for gambling he was considered a very desirable and eligible young man madeline admitted all this  then she thought of things that were perhaps exclusively her own strange ideas boyd harveys white skin did not tan even in this southwestern sun and wind his hands were whiter than her own and as soft they were really beautiful and she remembered what care he took of them they were a proof that he never worked his frame was tall graceful elegant it did not bear evidence of ruggedness he had never indulged in a sport more strenuous than yachting he hated effort and activity he rode horseback very little disliked any but moderate motoring spent much time in newport and europe never walked when he could help it and had no ambition unless it were to pass the days pleasantly if he ever had any sons they would be like him only a generation more toward the inevitable extinction of his race  madeline returned to camp in just the mood to make a sharp deciding contrast it happenedfatefully perhapsthat the first man she saw was stewart he had just ridden into camp and as she came up he explained that he had gone down to the ranch for the important mail about which she had expressed anxiety  down and back in one day she exclaimed  yes he replied it wasnt so bad  but why did you not send one of the boys and let him make the regular twoday trip  you were worried about your mail he answered briefly as he delivered it then he bent to examine the fetlocks of his weary horse  it was midsummer now madeline reflected and exceedingly hot and dusty on the lower trail stewart had ridden down the mountain and back again in twelve hours probably no horse in the outfit except his big black or majesty could have stood that trip and his horse showed the effects of a grueling day he was caked with dust and lame and weary  stewart looked as if he had spared the horse his weight on many a mile of that rough ascent his boots were evidence of it his heavy flannel shirt wet through with perspiration adhered closely to his shoulders and arms so that every ripple of muscle plainly showed his face was black except round the temples and forehead where it was bright red drops of sweat running off his blackened hands dripped to the ground he got up from examining the lame foot and then threw off the saddle the black horse snorted and lunged for the wateringpool stewart let him drink a little then with iron arms dragged him away in this action the mans lithe powerful form impressed madeline with a wonderful sense of muscular force his brawny wrist was bare his big strong hand first clutching the horses mane then patting his neck had a bruised knuckle and one finger was bound up that hand expressed as much gentleness and thoughtfulness for the horse as it had strength to drag him back from too much drinking at a dangerous moment  stewart was a combination of fire strength and action these attributes seemed to cling about him there was something vital and compelling in his presence worn and spent and drawn as he was from the long ride he thrilled madeline with his potential youth and unused vitality and promise of things to be redblooded deeds both of flesh and spirit in him she saw the strength of his forefathers unimpaired the life in him was marvelously significant the dust the dirt the sweat the soiled clothes the bruised and bandaged hand the brawn and bonethese had not been despised by the knights of ancient days nor by modern women whose eyes shed soft light upon coarse and bloody toilers  madeline hammond compared the man of the east with the man of the west and that comparison was the last parting regret for her old standards     xvii the lost mine of the padres  in the cool starry evenings the campers sat around a blazing fire and told and listened to stories thrillingly fitted to the dark crags and the wild solitude  monty price had come to shine brilliantly as a storyteller he was an atrocious liar but this fact would not have been evident to his enthralled listeners if his cowboy comrades in base jealousy had not betrayed him the truth about his remarkable fabrications however had not become known to castleton solely because of the englishmans obtuseness and there was another thing much stranger than this and quite as amusing dorothy coombs knew monty was a liar but she was so fascinated by the glittering basilisk eyes he riveted upon her so taken in by his horrible tales of blood that despite her knowledge she could not help believing them  manifestly monty was very proud of his suddenly acquired gift formerly he had hardly been known to open his lips in the presence of strangers monty had developed more than one singular and hitherto unknown trait since his supremacy at golf had revealed his possibilities he was as sober and vain and pompous about his capacity for lying as about anything else some of the cowboys were jealous of him because he held the attention and apparently the admiration of the ladies and nels was jealous not because monty made himself out to be a wonderful gunman but because monty could tell a story nels really had been the hero of a hundred fights he had never been known to talk about them but dorothys eyes and helens smile had somehow upset his modesty whenever monty would begin to talk nels would growl and knock his pipe on a log and make it appear he could not stay and listen though he never really left the charmed circle of the campfire wild horses could not have dragged him away  one evening at twilight as madeline was leaving her tent she encountered monty evidently he had waylaid her with the most mysterious of signs and whispers he led her a little aside  miss hammond im makin bold to ask a favor of you he said  madeline smiled her willingness  tonight when theyve all shot off their chins an its quietlike i want you to ask me jest this way monty seein as youve hed more adventures than all them cowpunchers put together tell us about the most turrible time you ever hed will you ask me miss hammond jest kinda sincere like  certainly i will monty she replied  his dark seared face had no more warmth than a piece of cold volcanic rock which it resembled madeline appreciated how monstrous dorothy found this burned and distorted visage how deformed the little man looked to a woman of refined sensibilities it was difficult for madeline to look into his face but she saw behind the blackened mask and now she saw in montys deep eyes a spirit of pure fun  so true to her word madeline remembered at an opportune moment when conversation had hushed and only the long dismal wail of coyotes broke the silence to turn toward the little cowboy  monty she said and paused for effectmonty seeing that you have had more adventures than all the cowboys together tell us about the most terrible time you ever had  monty appeared startled at the question that fastened all eyes upon him he waved a deprecatory hand  aw miss hammond thankin you all modestlike fer the compliment ill hev to refuse replied monty laboring in distress its too harrowin fer tenderhearted gurls to listen to  go on cried everybody except the cowboys nels began to nod his head as if he as well as monty understood human nature dorothy hugged her knees with a kind of shudder monty had fastened the hypnotic eyes upon her castleton ceased smoking adjusted his eyeglass and prepared to listen in great earnestness  monty changed his seat to one where the light from the blazing logs fell upon his face and he appeared plunged into melancholy and profound thought  now i tax myself i cant jest decide which was the orfulest time i ever hed he said reflectively  here nels blew forth an immense cloud of smoke as if he desired to hide himself from sight monty pondered and then when the smoke rolled away he turned to nels  see hyar old pard me an you seen somethin of each other in the panhandle more n thirty years ago  which we didnt interrupted nels bluntly shore you cant make me out an ole man  mebbe it wasnt so darn long anyhow nels you recollect them three hossthieves i hung all on one cottonwoodtree an likewise thet bootiful blond gurl i rescooed from a band of cutthroats who murdered her paw ole bill warren the buffalohunter now which of them two scraps was the turriblest in your idee  monty my memorys shore bad replied the unimpeachable nels  tell us about the beautiful blonde cried at least three of the ladies dorothy who had suffered from nightmare because of a former story of hanging men on trees had voicelessly appealed to monty to spare her more of that  all right well hev the blond gurl said monty settling back though i aint thinkin her story is most turrible of the two an itll rake over tender affections long slumberin in my breast  as he paused there came a sharp rapping sound this appeared to be nels knocking the ashes out of his pipe on a stumpa true indication of the passing of content from that jealous cowboy  it was down in the panhandle way over in the west end of thet comanche huntinground an all the redskins an outlaws in thet country were hidin in the riverbottoms an chasin some of the last buffalo herds thet hed wintered in there i was a young buck them days an purty much of a desperado im thinkin though of all the seventeen notches on my gunan each notch meant a man killed face to facethere was only one thet i was ashamed of thet one was fer an express messenger who i hit on the head most unprofessional like jest because he wouldnt hand over a leetle package i hed the kind of a reputashun thet made all the fellers in saloons smile an buy drinks  well i dropped into a place named taylors bend an was peaceful standin to the bar when three cowpunchers come in an me bein with my back turned they didnt recognize me an got playful i didnt stop drinkin an i didnt turn square round but when i stopped shootin under my arm the saloonkeeper hed to go over to the sawmill an fetch a heap of sawdust to cover up what was left of them three cowpunchers after they was hauled out you see i was rough them

buffalo  ladies i aint denyin that then monty price was some scairt fust time in my life but the trustin face of thet bootiful gurl as she lay in my arms an hugged me an yelled made my spirit leap

rescooed the gurl  well as my memory takes me back thet was a most affectin walk home to the little town where she lived but she wasnt troo to me an married another feller i was too much a sport to kill him but thet lowdown trick rankled in my breast gurls is strange ive never stopped wonderin how any gurl who has been hugged an kissed by one man could marry another but matoor experience teaches me thet sich is the case  the cowboys roared helen and mrs beck and edith laughed till they cried madeline found repression absolutely impossible dorothy sat hugging her knees her horror at the story no greater than at montys unmistakable reference to her and to the fickleness of women and castleton for the first time appeared to be moved out of his imperturbability though not in any sense by humor indeed when he came to notice it he was dumfounded by the mirth  by jove you americans are an extraordinary people he said i dont see anything blooming funny in mr prices story of his adventure by jove that was a bally warm occasion mr price when you speak of being frightened for the only time in your life i appreciate what you mean i have experienced that i was frightened once  dook i wouldnt hev thought it of you replied monty im sure tolerable curious to hear about it  madeline and her friends dared not break the spell for fear that the englishman might hold to his usual modest reticence he had explored in brazil seen service in the boer war hunted in india and africamatters of experience of which he never spoke upon this occasion however evidently taking montys recital word for word as literal truth and excited by it into a homeric mood he might tell a story the cowboys almost fell upon their knees in their importunity there was a suppressed eagerness in their solicitations a hint of something that meant more than desire great as it was to hear a story told by an english lord madeline divined instantly that the cowboys had suddenly fancied that castleton was not the dense and easily fooled person they had made such game of that he had played his part well that he was having fun at their expense that he meant to tell a story a lie which would simply dwarf montys nelss keen bright expectation suggested how he would welcome the joke turned upon monty the slow closing of montys cavernous smile the gradual sinking of his proud bearing the doubt with which he began to regard castletonthese were proofs of his fears  i have faced charging tigers and elephants in india and charging rhinos and lions in africa began castleton his quick and fluent speech so different from the drawl of his ordinary conversation but i never was frightened but once it will not do to hunt those wild beasts if you are easily balled up this adventure i have in mind happened in british east africa in uganda i was out with safari and we were in a native district much infested by maneating lions perhaps i may as well state that maneaters are very different from ordinary lions they are always matured beasts and sometimesindeed mostlyare old they become maneaters most likely by accident or necessity when old they find it more difficult to make a kill being slower probably and with poorer teeth driven by hunger they stalk and kill a native and once having tasted human blood they want no other they become absolutely fearless and terrible in their attacks  the natives of this village near where we camped were in a terrorized state owing to depredations of two or more maneaters the night of our arrival a lion leaped a stockade fence seized a native from among others sitting round a fire and leaped out again carrying the screaming fellow away into the darkness i determined to kill these lions and made a permanent camp in the village for that purpose by day i sent beaters into the brush and rocks of the rivervalley and by night i watched every night the lions visited us but i did not see one i discovered that when they roared around the camp they were not so liable to attack as when they were silent it was indeed remarkable how silently they could stalk a man they could creep through a thicket so dense you would not believe a rabbit could get through and do it without the slightest sound then when ready to charge they did so with terrible onslaught and roar they leaped right into a circle of fires tore down huts even dragged natives from the low trees there was no way to tell at which point they would make an attack  after ten days or more of this i was worn out by loss of sleep and one night when tired out with watching i fell asleep my gunbearer was alone in the tent with me a terrible roar awakened me then an unearthly scream pierced right into my ears i always slept with my rifle in my hands and grasping it i tried to rise but i could not for the reason that a lion was standing over me then i lay still the screams of my gunbearer told me that the lion had him i was fond of this fellow and wanted to save him i thought it best however not to move while the lion stood over me suddenly he stepped and i felt poor lukis feet dragging across me he screamed save me master and instinctively i grasped at him and caught his foot the lion walked out of the tent dragging me as i held to lukis foot the night was bright moonlight i could see the lion distinctly he was a huge blackmaned brute and he held luki by the shoulder the poor lad kept screaming frightfully the maneater must have dragged me forty yards before he became aware of a double incumbrance to his progress then he halted and turned by jove he made a devilish fierce object with his shaggy massive head his greenfire eyes and his huge jaws holding luki i let go of lukis foot and bethought myself of the gun but as i lay there on my side before attempting to rise i made a horrible discovery i did not have my rifle at all i had lukis iron spear which he always had near him my rifle had slipped out of the hollow of my arm and when the lion awakened me in my confusion i picked up lukis spear instead the bloody brute dropped luki and uttered a roar that shook the ground it was then i felt frightened for an instant i was almost paralyzed the lion meant to charge and in one spring he could reach me under circumstances like those a man can think many things in little time i knew to try to run would be fatal i remembered how strangely lions had been known to act upon occasion one had been frightened by an umbrella one had been frightened by a blast from a cowhorn another had been frightened by a native who in running from one lion ran right at the other which he had not seen accordingly i wondered if i could frighten the lion that meant to leap at me acting upon wild impulse i prodded him in the hind quarters with the spear ladies and gentlemen i am a blooming idiot if that lion did not cower like a whipped dog put his tail down and begin to slink away quick to see my chance i jumped up yelling and made after him prodding him again he let out a bellow such as you could imagine would come from an outraged king of beasts i prodded again and then he loped off i found luki not badly hurt in fact he got well but ive never forgotten that scare  when castleton finished his narrative there was a trenchant silence all eyes were upon monty he looked beaten disgraced a disgusted man yet there shone from his face a wonderful admiration for castleton  dook you win he said and dropping his head he left the campfire circle with the manner of a deposed emperor  then the cowboys exploded the quiet serene lowvoiced nels yelled like a madman and he stood upon his head all the other cowboys went through marvelous contortions mere noise was insufficient to relieve their joy at what they considered the fall and humiliation of the tyrant monty  the englishman stood there and watched them in amused consternation they baffled his understanding plain it was to madeline and her friends that castleton had told the simple truth but never on the earth or anywhere else could nels and his comrades have been persuaded that castleton had not lied deliberately to humble their great exponent of ananias  everybody seemed reluctant to break the campfire spell the logs had burned out to a great heap of opal and gold and red coals in the heart of which quivered a glow alluring to the spirit of dreams as the blaze subsided the shadows of the pines encroached darker and darker upon the circle of fading light a cool wind fanned the embers whipped up flakes of white ashes and moaned through the trees the wild yelps of coyotes were dying in the distance and the sky was a wonderful darkblue dome spangled with white stars  what a perfect night said madeline this is a night to understand the dream the mystery the wonder of the southwest florence for long you have promised to tell us the story of the lost mine of the padres it will give us all pleasure make us understand something of the thrall in which this land held the spaniards who discovered it so many years ago it will be especially interesting now because this mountain hides somewhere under its crags the treasures of the lost mine of the padres              in the sixteenth century florence began in her soft slow voice so suited to the nature of the legend a poor young padre of new spain was shepherding his goats upon a hill when the virgin appeared before him he prostrated himself at her feet and when he looked up she was gone but upon the maguey plant near where she had stood there were golden ashes of a strange and wonderful substance he took the incident as a good omen and went again to the hilltop under the maguey had sprung up slender stalks of white bearing delicate gold flowers and as these flowers waved in the wind a fine golden dust as fine as powdered ashes blew away toward the north padre juan was mystified but believed that great fortune attended upon him and his poor people so he went again and again to the hilltop in hope that the virgin would appear to him  one morning as the sun rose gloriously he looked across the windy hill toward the waving grass and golden flowers under the maguey and he saw the virgin beckoning to him again he fell upon his knees but she lifted him and gave him of the golden flowers and bade him leave his home and people to follow where these blowing golden ashes led there he would find goldpure goldwonderful fortune to bring back to his poor people to build a church for them and a city  padre juan took the flowers and left his home promising to return and he traveled northward over the hot and dusty desert through the mountain passes to a new country where fierce and warlike indians menaced his life he was gentle and good and of a persuasive speech moreover he was young and handsome of person the indians were apaches and among them he became a missionary while always he was searching for the flowers of gold he heard of gold lying in pebbles upon the mountain slopes but he never found any a few of the apaches he converted the most of them however were prone to be hostile to him and his religion but padre juan prayed and worked on  there came a time when the old apache chief imagining the padre had designs upon his influence with the tribe sought to put him to death by fire the chiefs daughter a beautiful darkeyed maiden secretly loved juan and believed in his mission and she interceded for his life and saved him juan fell in love with her one day she came to him wearing golden flowers in her dark hair and as the wind blew the flowers a golden dust blew upon it juan asked her where to find such flowers and she told him that upon a certain day she would take him to the mountain to look for them and upon the day she led up to the mountaintop from which they could see beautiful valleys and great trees and cool waters there at the top of a wonderful slope that looked down upon the world she showed juan the flowers and juan found gold in such abundance that he thought he would go out of his mind dust of gold grains of gold pebbles of gold rocks of gold he was rich beyond all dreams he remembered the virgin and her words he must return to his people and build their church and the great city that would bear his name  but juan tarried always he was going manana he loved the darkeyed apache girl so well that he could not leave her he hated himself for his infidelity to his virgin to his people he was weak and false a sinner but he could not go and he gave himself up to love of the indian maiden  the old apache chief discovered the secret love of his daughter and the padre and fierce in his anger he took her up into the mountains and burned her alive and cast her ashes upon the wind he did not kill padre juan he was too wise and perhaps too cruel for he saw the strength of juans love besides many of his tribe had learned much from the spaniard  padre juan fell into despair he had no desire to live he faded and wasted away but before he died he went to the old indians who had burned the maiden and he begged them when he was dead to burn his body and to cast his ashes to the wind from that wonderful slope where they would blow away to mingle forever with those of his indian sweetheart  the indians promised and when padre juan died they burned his body and took his ashes to the mountain heights and cast them to the wind where they drifted and fell to mix with the ashes of the indian girl he had loved  years passed more padres traveled across the desert to the home of the apaches and they heard the story of juan among their number was a padre who in his youth had been one of juans people he set forth to find juans grave where he believed he would also find the gold and he came back with pebbles of gold and flowers that shed a golden dust and he told a wonderful story he had climbed and climbed into the mountains and he had come to a wonderful slope under the crags that slope was yellow with golden flowers when he touched them golden ashes drifted from them and blew down among the rocks there the padre found dust of gold grains of gold pebbles of gold rocks of gold  then all the padres went into the mountains but the discoverer of the mine lost his way they searched and searched until they were old and gray but never found the wonderful slope and flowers that marked the grave and the mine of padre juan  in the succeeding years the story was handed down from father to son but of the many who hunted for the lost mine of the padres there was never a mexican or an apache for the apache the mountain slopes were haunted by the spirit of an indian maiden who had been false to her tribe and forever accursed for the mexican the mountain slopes were haunted by the spirit of the false padre who rolled stones upon the heads of those adventurers who sought to find his grave and his accursed gold     xviii bonita  florences story of the lost mine fired madelines guests with the fever for goldhunting but after they had tried it a few times and the glamour of the thing wore off they gave up and remained in camp having exhausted all the resources of the mountain such that had interest for them they settled quietly down for a rest which madeline knew would soon end in a desire for civilized comforts they were almost tired of roughing it helens discontent manifested itself in her remark i guess nothing is going to happen after all  madeline awaited their pleasure in regard to the breaking of camp and meanwhile as none of them cared for more exertion she took her walks without them sometimes accompanied by one of the cowboys always by the staghounds these walks furnished her exceeding pleasure and now that the cowboys would talk to her without reserve she grew fonder of listening to their simple stories the more she knew of them the more she doubted the wisdom of shutin lives companionship with nels and most of the cowboys was in its effect like that of the rugged pines and crags and the untainted wind humor their predominant trait when a person grew to know them saved madeline from finding their hardness trying they were dreamers as all men who lived lonely lives in the wilds were dreamers  the cowboys all had secrets madeline learned some of them she marveled most at the strange way in which they hid emotions except of violence of mirth and temper so easily aroused it was all the more remarkable in view of the fact that they felt intensely over little things to which men of the world were blind and dead madeline had to believe that a hard and perilous life in a barren and wild country developed great principles in men living close to earth under the cold bleak peaks on the dustveiled desert men grew like the nature that developed themhard fierce terrible perhaps but bigbig with elemental force  but one day while out walking alone before she realized it she had gone a long way down a dim trail winding among the rocks it was the middle of a summer afternoon and all about her were shadows of the crags crossing the sunlit patches the quiet was undisturbed she went on and on not blind to the fact that she was perhaps going too far from camp but risking it because she was sure of her way back and enjoying the wild craggy recesses that were new to her finally she came out upon a bank that broke abruptly into a beautiful little glade here she sat down to rest before undertaking the return trip  suddenly russ the keener of the staghounds raised his head and growled madeline feared he might have scented a mountainlion or wildcat she quieted him and carefully looked around to each side was an irregular line of massive blocks of stone that had weathered from the crags the little glade was open and grassy with here a pinetree there a boulder the outlet seemed to go down into a wilderness of canyons and ridges looking in this direction madeline saw the slight dark figure of a woman coming stealthily along under the pines madeline was amazed then a little frightened for that stealthy walk from tree to tree was suggestive of secrecy if nothing worse  presently the woman was joined by a tall man who carried a package which he gave to her they came on up the glade and appeared to be talking earnestly in another moment madeline recognized stewart she had no greater feeling of surprise than had at first been hers but for the next moment she scarcely thought at allmerely watched the couple approaching in a flash came back her former curiosity as to stewarts strange absences from camp and then with the return of her doubt of him the recognition of the woman the small dark head the brown face the big eyesmadeline now saw distinctlybelonged to the mexican girl bonita stewart had met her there this was the secret of his lonely trips taken ever since he had come to work for madeline this secluded glade was a rendezvous he had her hidden there  quietly madeline arose with a gesture to the dogs and went back along the trail toward camp succeeding her surprise was a feeling of sorrow that stewarts regeneration had not been complete sorrow gave place to insufferable distrust that while she had been romancing about this cowboy dreaming of her good influence over him he had been merely base somehow it stung her stewart had been nothing to her she thought yet she had been proud of him she tried to revolve the thing to be fair to him when every instinctive tendency was to expel him and all pertaining to him from her thoughts and her effort at sympathy at extenuation failed utterly before her pride exerting her willpower she dismissed stewart from her mind  madeline did not think of him again till late that afternoon when as she was leaving her tent to join several of her guests stewart appeared suddenly in her path  miss hammond i saw your tracks down the trail he began eagerly but his tone was easy and natural im thinkingwell maybe you sure got the idea  i do not wish for an explanation interrupted madeline  stewart gave a slight start his manner had a semblance of the old cool audacity as he looked down at her it subtly changed  what effrontery madeline thought to face her before her guests with an explanation of his conduct suddenly she felt an inward flash of fire that was pain so strange so incomprehensible that her mind whirled then anger possessed her not at stewart but at herself that anything could rouse in her a raw emotion she stood there outwardly cold serene with level haughty eyes upon stewart but inwardly she was burning with rage and shame  im sure not going to have you think he began passionately but he broke off and a slow dull crimson blotted over the healthy redbrown of his neck and cheeks  what you do or think stewart is no concern of mine  missmiss hammond you dont believe faltered stewart  the crimson receded from his face leaving it pale his eyes were appealing they had a kind of timid look that struck madeline even in her anger there was something boyish about him then he took a step forward and reached out with his hand openpalmed in a gesture that was humble yet held a certain dignity  but listen never mind now what youyou think about me theres a good reason  i have no wish to hear your reason  but you ought to he persisted  sir  stewart underwent another swift change he started violently a dark tide shaded his face and a glitter leaped to his eyes he took two long stridesloomed over her  im not thinking about myself he thundered will you listen  no she replied and there was freezing hauteur in her voice with a slight gesture of dismissal unmistakable in its finality she turned her back upon him then she joined her guests  stewart stood perfectly motionless then slowly he began to lift his right hand in which he held his sombrero he swept it up and up high over his head his tall form towered with fierce suddenness he flung his sombrero down he leaped at his black horse and dragged him to where his saddle lay with one pitch he tossed the saddle upon the horses back his strong hands flashed at girths and straps every action was swift decisive fierce bounding for his bridle which hung over a bush he ran against a cowboy who awkwardly tried to avoid the onslaught  get out of my way he yelled  then with the same savage haste he adjusted the bridle on his horse  mebbe you better hold on a minnit gene ole feller said monty price  monty do you want me to brain you said stewart with the short hard ring in his voice  now considerin the high class of my brains i oughter be real careful to keep em replied monty you can betcher life gene i aint goin to git in front of you but i jest sayslisten  stewart raised his dark face everybody listened and everybody heard the rapid beat of a horses hoofs the sun had set but the park was light nels appeared down the trail and his horse was running in another moment he was in the circle pulling his bay back to a sliding halt he leaped off abreast of stewart  madeline saw and felt a difference in nelss presence  whats up gene he queried sharply  im leaving camp replied stewart thickly his black horse began to stamp as stewart grasped bridle and mane and kicked the stirrup round  nelss long arm shot out and his hand fell upon stewart holding him down  shore im sorry said nels slowly then you was goin to hit the trail  i am going to let go nels  shore you aint goin gene  let go damn you cried stewart as he wrestled free  whats wrong asked nels lifting his hand again  man dont touch me  nels stepped back instantly he seemed to become aware of stewarts white wild passion again stewart moved to mount  nels dont make me forget weve been friends he said  shore i aint fergettin replied nels an i resign my job right here an now  his strange speech checked the mounting cowboy stewart stepped down from the stirrup then their hard faces were still and cold while their eyes locked glances  madeline was as much startled by nelss speech as stewart quick to note a change in these men she now sensed one that was unfathomable  resign questioned stewart  shore what d you think id do under circumstances sich as has come up  but see here nels i wont stand for it  youre not my boss no more an i aint beholdin to miss hammond neither im my own boss an ill do as i please sabe senor  nelss words were at variance with the meaning in his face  gene you sent me on a little scout down in the mountains didnt you he continued  yes i did replied stewart with a new sharpness in his voice  wal shore you was so good an right in your figgerin as opposed to mine that im sick with admirin of you if you hednt sent mewal im reckonin somethin might hev happened as it is were shore up against a hell of a proposition  how significant was the effect of his words upon all the cowboys stewart made a fierce and violent motion terrible where his other motions had been but passionate monty leaped straight up into the air in a singular action as suggestive of surprise as it was of wild acceptance of menace like a stalking giant nick steele strode over to nels and stewart the other cowboys rose silently without a word  madeline and her guests in a little group watched and listened unable to divine what all this strange talk and action meant  hold on nels they dont need to hear it said stewart hoarsely as he waved a hand toward madelines silent group  wal im sorry but i reckon theyd as well know fust as last mebbe thet yearnin wish of miss helens fer somethin to happen will come true shore i  cut out the joshin rang out montys strident voice  it had as decided an effect as any preceding words or action perhaps it was the last thing needed to transform these men doing unaccustomed duty as escorts of beautiful women to their natural state as men of the wild  tell us whats what said stewart cool and grim  don carlos an his guerrillas are campin on the trails thet lead up here theyve got them trails blocked by tomorrer theyd hed us corralled mebbe they meant to surprise us hes got a lot of greasers an outlaws theyre well armed now what do they mean youall can figger it out to suit yourselves mebbe the don

greaser     xix don carlos  stewart took nels monty and nick steele aside out of earshot and they evidently entered upon an earnest colloquy presently the other cowboys were called they all talked more or less but the deep voice of stewart predominated over the others then the consultation broke up and the cowboys scattered  rustle you indians ordered stewart  the ensuing scene of action was not reassuring to madeline and her friends they were quiet awaiting some one to tell them what to do at the offset the cowboys appeared to have forgotten madeline some of them ran off into the woods others into the open grassy places where they rounded up the horses and burros several cowboys spread tarpaulins upon the ground and began to select and roll small packs evidently for hurried travel nels mounted his horse to ride down the trail monty and nick steele went off into the grove leading their horses stewart climbed up a steep jumble of stone between two sections of low cracked cliff back of the camp  castleton offered to help the packers and was curtly told he would be in the way madelines friends all importuned her was there real danger were the guerrillas coming would a start be made at once for the ranch why had the cowboys suddenly become so different madeline answered as best she could but her replies were only conjecture and modified to allay the fears of her guests helen was in a white glow of excitement  soon cowboys appeared riding barebacked horses driving in others and the burros some of these horses were taken away and evidently hidden in deep recesses between the crags the string of burros were packed and sent off down the trail in charge of a cowboy nick steele and monty returned then stewart appeared clambering down the break between the cliffs  his next move was to order all the baggage belonging to madeline and her guests taken up the cliff this was strenuous toil requiring the need of lassoes to haul up the effects  get ready to climb said stewart turning to madelines party  where asked helen  he waved his hand at the ascent to be made exclamations of dismay followed his gesture  mr stewart is there danger asked dorothy and her voice trembled  this was the question madeline had upon her lips to ask stewart but she could not speak it  no theres no danger replied stewart but were taking precautions we all agreed on as best  dorothy whispered that she believed stewart lied castleton asked another question and then harvey followed suit mrs beck made a timid query  please keep quiet and do as youre told said stewart bluntly  at this juncture when the last of the baggage was being hauled up the cliff monty approached madeline and removed his sombrero his black face seemed the same yet this was a vastly changed monty  miss hammond im givin notice i resign my job he said  monty what do you mean what does nels mean now when danger threatens  we jest quit thets all replied monty tersely he was stern and somber he could not stand still his eyes roved everywhere  castleton jumped up from the log where he had been sitting and his face was very red  mr price does all this blooming fuss mean we are to be robbed or attacked or abducted by a lot of ragamuffin guerrillas  youve called the bet  dorothy turned a very pale face toward monty  mr price you wouldntyou couldnt desert us now you and mr nels  desert you asked monty blankly  yes desert us leave us when we may need you so much with something dreadful coming  monty uttered a short hard laugh as he bent a strange look upon the girl  me an nels is purty much scared an were goin to slope miss dorothy bein as weve rustled round so much it sorta hurts us to see nice young girls dragged off by the hair  dorothy uttered a little cry and then became hysterical castleton for once was fully aroused  by gad you and your partner are a couple of blooming cowards where now is that courage you boasted of  montys dark face expressed extreme sarcasm  dook in my time ive seen some bright fellers but you take the cake its most marvelous how bright you are figgern me an nels so correct say dook if you dont git rustled off to mexico an roped to a cactusbush youll hev a swell story fer your english chums bah jove youll tell em how you seen two oldtime gunmen run like scared jackrabbits from a lot of greasers like hell you will unless you lie like the time you told about proddin the lion that there story allus  monty shut up yelled stewart as he came hurriedly up then monty slouched away cursing to himself  madeline and helen assisted by castleton worked over dorothy and with some difficulty quieted her stewart passed several times without noticing them and monty who had been so ridiculously eager to pay every little attention to dorothy did not see her at all rude it seemed in montys ease more than that madeline hardly knew what to make of it  stewart directed cowboys to go to the head of the open place in the cliff and let down lassoes then with little waste of words he urged the women toward this rough ladder of stones  we want to hide you he said when they demurred if the guerrillas come well tell them youve all gone down to the ranch if we have to fight youll be safe up there  helen stepped boldly forward and let stewart put the loop of a lasso round her and tighten it he waved his hand to the cowboys above  just walk up now he directed helen  it proved to the watchers to be an easy safe and rapid means of scaling the steep passage the men climbed up without assistance mrs beck as usual had hysteria she half walked and was half dragged up stewart supported dorothy with one arm while with the other he held to the lasso ambrose had to carry christine the mexican women required no assistance edith wayne and madeline climbed last and once up madeline saw a narrow bench thick with shrubs and overshadowed by huge leaning crags there were holes in the rock and dark fissures leading back it was a rough wild place tarpaulins and bedding were then hauled up and food and water the cowboys spread comfortable beds in several of the caves and told madeline and her friends to be as quiet as possible not to make a light and to sleep dressed ready for travel at a moments notice  after the cowboys had gone down it was not a cheerful group left there in the darkening twilight castleton prevailed upon them to eat  this is simply great whispered helen  oh its awful moaned dorothy its your fault helen you prayed for something to happen  i believe its a horrid trick those cowboys are playing said mrs beck  madeline assured her friends that no trick was being played upon them and that she deplored the discomfort and distress but felt no real alarm she was more inclined to evasive kindness here than to sincerity for she had a decided uneasiness the swift change in the manner and looks of her cowboys had been a shock to her the last glance she had of stewarts face then stern almost sad and haggard with worry remained to augment her foreboding  darkness appeared to drop swiftly down the coyotes began their haunting mournful howls the stars showed and grew brighter the wind moaned through the tips of the pines castleton was restless he walked to and fro before the overhanging shelf of rock where his companions sat lamenting and presently he went out to the ledge of the bench the cowboys below had built a fire and the light from it rose in a huge fanshaped glow castletons little figure stood out black against this light curious and anxious also madeline joined him and peered down from the cliff the distance was short and occasionally she could distinguish a word spoken by the cowboys they were unconcernedly cooking and eating she marked the absence of stewart and mentioned it to castleton silently castleton pointed almost straight down and there in the gloom stood stewart with the two staghounds at his feet  presently nick steele silenced the campfire circle by raising a warning hand the cowboys bent their heads listening madeline listened with all her might she heard one of the hounds whine then the faint beat of horses hoofs nick spoke again and turned to his supper and the other men seemed to slacken in attention the beat of hoofs grew louder entered the grove then the circle of light the rider was nels he dismounted and the sound of his low voice just reached madeline  gene its nels somethin doin madeline heard one of the cowboys call softly  send him over replied stewart  nels stalked away from the fire  see here nels the boys are all right but i dont want them to know everything about this mixup said stewart as nels came up did you find the girl  madeline guessed that stewart referred to the mexican girl bonita  no but i metmadeline did not catch the namean he

shore quick  all right nels old friend and thanks replied stewart nels returned to the campfire and stewart resumed his silent guard  madeline led castleton away from the brink of the wall  by jove cowboys are blooming strange folk he exclaimed they are not what they pretend to be  indeed you are right replied madeline i cannot understand them come let us tell the others that nels and monty were only talking and do not intend to leave us dorothy at least will be less frightened if she knows  dorothy was somewhat comforted the others however complained of the cowboys singular behavior more than once the idea was advanced that an elaborate trick had been concocted upon general discussion this idea gained ground madeline did not combat it because she saw it tended to a less perturbed condition of mind among her guests castleton for once proved that he was not absolutely obtuse and helped along the idea  they sat talking in low voices until a late hour the incident now began to take on the nature of helens longyearnedfor adventure some of the party even grew merry in a subdued way then gradually one by one they tired and went to bed helen vowed she could not sleep in a place where there were bats and crawling things madeline fancied however that they all went to sleep while she lay wideeyed staring up at the black bulge of overhanging rock and beyond the starry sky  to keep from thinking of stewart and the burning anger he had caused her to feel for herself madeline tried to keep her mind on other things but thought of him recurred and each time there was a hot commotion in her breast hard to stifle intelligent reasoning seemed out of her power in the daylight it had been possible for her to be oblivious to stewarts deceit after the moment of its realization at night however in the strange silence and hovering shadows of gloom with the speaking stars seeming to call to her with the moan of the wind in the pines and the melancholy mourn of coyotes in the distance she was not able to govern her thought and emotion the day was practical cold the night was strange and tense in the darkness she had fancies wholly unknown to her in the bright light of the sun she battled with a haunting thought she had inadvertently heard nelss conversation with stewart she had listened hoping to hear some good news or to hear the worst she had learned both and moreover enlightenment on one point of stewarts complex motives he wished to spare her any sight that might offend frighten or disgust her yet this stewart who showed a fineness of feeling that might have been wanting even in boyd harvey maintained a secret rendezvous with that pretty abandoned bonita here always the hot shame like a live stinging internal fire abruptly ended madelines thought it was intolerable and it was the more so because she could neither control nor understand it the hours wore on and at length as the stars began to pale and there was no sound whatever she fell asleep  she was called out of her slumber day had broken bright and cool the sun was still below the eastern crags ambrose with several other cowboys had brought up buckets of springwater and hot coffee and cakes madelines party appeared to be none the worse for the nights experience indeed the meager breakfast might have been as merrily partaken of as it was hungrily had not ambrose enjoined silence  theyre expectin company down below he said  this information and the summary manner in which the cowboys soon led the party higher up among the ruined shelves of rock caused a recurrence of anxiety madeline insisted on not going beyond a projection of cliff from which she could see directly down into the camp as the vantagepoint was one affording concealment ambrose consented but he placed the frightened christine near madeline and remained there himself  ambrose do you really think the guerrillas will come asked madeline  sure we know nels just rode in and said they were on their way up miss hammond can i trust you you wont let out a squeal if theres a fight down there stewart told me to hide you out of sight or keep you from lookin  i promise not to make any noise replied madeline madeline arranged her coat so that she could lie upon it and settled down to wait developments there came a slight rattling of stones in the rear she turned to see helen sliding down a bank with a perplexed and troubled cowboy helen came stooping low to where madeline lay and said i am going to see what happens if i die in the attempt i can stand it if you can she was pale and bigeyed ambrose promptly swore at the cowboy who had let her get away from him take a halfhitch on her yourself an see where you end up replied the fellow and disappeared in the jumble of rocks ambrose finding words useless sternly and heroically prepared to carry helen back to the others he laid hold of her in a fury with eyes blazing helen whispered  let go of me majesty what does this fool mean  madeline laughed she knew helen and had marked the whisper when ordinarily helen would have spoken imperiously and not low madeline explained to her the exigency of the situation i might run but ill never scream said helen with that ambrose had to be content to let her stay however he found her a place somewhat farther back from madelines position where he said there was less danger of her being seen then he sternly bound her to silence tarried a moment to comfort christine and returned to where madeline lay concealed he had been there scarcely a moment when he whispered  i hear hosses the guerrillas are comin  madelines hidingplace was well protected from possible discovery from below she could peep over a kind of parapet through an opening in the tips of the pines that reached up to the cliff and obtain a commanding view of the camp circle and its immediate surroundings she could not however see far either to right or left of the camp owing to the obstructing foliage presently the sound of horses hoofs quickened the beat of her pulse and caused her to turn keener gaze upon the cowboys below  although she had some inkling of the course stewart and his men were to pursue she was not by any means prepared for the indifference she saw frank was asleep or pretended to be three cowboys were lazily and unconcernedly attending to campfire duties such as baking biscuits watching the ovens and washing tins and pots the elaborate set of aluminum plates cups etc together with the other camp fixtures that had done service for madelines party had disappeared nick steele sat with his back to a log smoking his pipe another cowboy had just brought the horses closer into camp where they stood waiting to be saddled nels appeared to be fussing over a pack stewart was rolling a cigarette monty had apparently nothing to do for the present except whistle which he was doing much more loudly than melodiously the whole ensemble gave an impression of careless indifference  the sound of horses hoofs grew louder and slowed its beat one of the cowboys pointed down the trail toward which several of his comrades turned their heads for a moment then went on with their occupations  presently a shaggy dusty horse bearing a lean ragged dark rider rode into camp and halted another followed and another horses with mexican riders came in single file and stopped behind the leader  the cowboys looked up and the guerrillas looked down buenos dias senor ceremoniously said the foremost guerrilla  by straining her ears madeline heard that voice and she recognized it as belonging to don carlos his graceful bow to stewart was also familiar otherwise she would never have recognized the former elegant vaquero in this uncouth roughly dressed mexican  stewart answered the greeting in spanish and waving his hand toward the campfire added in english get down and eat  the guerrillas were anything but slow in complying they crowded to the fire then spread in a little circle and squatted upon the ground laying their weapons beside them in appearance they tallied with the band of guerrillas that had carried madeline up into the foothills only this band was larger and better armed the men moreover were just as hungry and as wild and beggarly the cowboys were not cordial in their reception of this visit but they were hospitable the law of the desert had always been to give food and drink to wayfaring men whether lost or hunted or hunting  theres twentythree in that outfit whispered ambrose includin four white men pretty rummy outfit  they appear to be friendly enough whispered madeline  things down there aint what they seem replied ambrose  ambrose tell meexplain to me this is my opportunity as long as you will let me watch them please let me know thethe real thing  sure but recollect miss hammond that genell give it to me good if he ever knows i let you look and told you whats what well decentlike gene is seen them poor devils get a square meal theyre only a lot of calfthieves in this country across the border theyre bandits some of them the others just riffraff outlaws that rebel bluff doesnt go down with us id have to see first before id believe them greasers would fight theyre a lot of hardridin thieves and theyd steal a fellows blanket or tobacco gene thinks theyre after you ladiesto carry you off but geneoh genes some highfalutin in his ideas lately most of us boys think the guerrillas are out to robthats all  whatever might have been the secret motive of don carlos and his men they did not allow it to interfere with a hearty appreciation of a generous amount of food plainly each individual ate all that he was able to eat at the time they jabbered like a flock of parrots some were even merry in a kind of wild way then as each and every one began to roll and smoke the inevitable cigarette of the mexican there was a subtle change in manner they smoked and looked about the camp off into the woods up at the crags and back at the leisurely cowboys they had the air of men waiting for something  senor began don carlos addressing stewart as he spoke he swept his sombrero to indicate the camp circle  madeline could not distinguish his words but his gesture plainly indicated a question in regard to the rest of the camping party stewarts reply and the wave of his hand down the trail meant that his party had gone home stewart turned to some task and the guerrilla leader quietly smoked he looked cunning and thoughtful his men gradually began to manifest a restlessness noticeable in the absence of former languor and slow puffing of cigarette smoke presently a bigboned man with a bullet head and a blistered red face of evil coarseness got up and threw away his cigarette he was an american  hey cull he called in loud voice aint ye goin to cough up a drink  my boys dont carry liquor on the trail replied stewart he turned now to face the guerrillas  haw haw i heerd over in rodeo thet ye was gittin to be shore some fer temperance said this fellow i hate to drink water but i guess ive gotter do it  he went to the spring sprawled down to drink and all of a sudden he thrust his arm down in the water to bring forth a basket the cowboys in the hurry of packing had neglected to remove this basket and it contained bottles of wine and liquors for madelines guests they had been submerged in the spring to keep them cold the guerrilla fumbled with the lid opened it and then got up uttering a loud roar of delight  stewart made an almost imperceptible motion as if to leap forward but he checked the impulse and after a quick glance at nels he said to the guerrilla  guess my party forgot that youre welcome to it like bees the guerrillas swarmed around the lucky finder of the bottles there was a babel of voices the drink did not last long and it served only to liberate the spirit of recklessness the several white outlaws began to prowl around the camp some of the mexicans did likewise others waited showing by their illconcealed expectancy the nature of their thoughts  it was the demeanor of stewart and his comrades that puzzled madeline apparently they felt no anxiety or even particular interest don carlos who had been covertly watching them now made his scrutiny open even aggressive he looked from stewart to nels and monty and then to the other cowboys while some of his men prowled around the others watched him and the waiting attitude had taken on something sinister the guerrilla leader seemed undecided but not in any sense puzzled when he turned his cunning face upon nels and monty he had the manner of a man in whom decision was lacking  in her growing excitement madeline had not clearly heard ambroses low whispers and she made an effort to distract some of her attention from those below to the cowboy crouching beside her  the quality the note of ambroses whisper had changed it had a slight sibilant sound  dont be mad if suddenlike i clap my hands over your eyes miss hammond he was saying somethins brewin below i never seen gene so cool thats a dangerous sign in him and look see how the boys are workin together oh its slow and accidentlike but i know its sure not accident that foxy greaser knows too but maybe his men dont if they are wise they havent sense enough to care the don thoughhes worried hes not payin so much attention to gene either its nels and monty hes watchin and well he need do it there nick and frank have settled down on that log with booly they dont seem to be packin guns but look how heavy their vests hang a gun in each side those boys can pull a gun and flop over that log quicker than you can think do you notice how nels and monty and gene are square between them guerrillas and the trail up here it doesnt seem on purpose but it is look at nels and monty how quiet they are confabbin together payin no attention to the guerrillas i see monty look at gene then i see nels look at gene well its up to gene and theyre goin to back him i reckon miss hammond thered be dead greasers round that camp long ago if nels and monty were footloose theyre beholdin to gene thats plain and lord how it tickles me to watch them both packin two fortyfives butts swingin clear theres twentyfour shots in them four guns and theres twentythree guerrillas if nels and monty ever throw guns at that close range why before youd know what was up thered be a pile of greasers there stewart said something to the don i wonder what ill gamble it was something to get the dons outfit all close together sure greasers have no sense but them white guerrillas theyre lookin some dubious whatevers comin off will come soon you can bet i wish i was down there but maybe it wont come to a scrap stewarts set on avoidin that hes a wonderful chap to get his way lord though id like to see him go after that overbearin greaser see the don cant stand prosperity all this strange behavior of cowboys is beyond his pulquesoaked brains then hes a greaser if gene doesnt knock him on the head presently hell begin to get over his scare even of nels and monty but genell pick out the right time and im gettin nervous i want somethin to start never saw nels in but one fight then he just shot a greasers arm off for tryin to draw on him but ive heard all about him and monty montys the real oldfashioned gunman why none of them stories them lies he told to entertain the englishman was a marker to what monty has done what i dont understand is how monty keeps so quiet and easy and peacefullike thats not his way with such an outfit lookin for trouble oha now for the grand bluff looks like no fight at all  the guerrilla leader had ceased his restless steps and glances and turned to stewart with something of bold resolution in his aspect  gracias senor he said adios he swept his sombrero in the direction of the trail leading down the mountain to the ranch and as he completed the gesture a smile crafty and jeering crossed his swarthy face  ambrose whispered so low that madeline scarcely heard him if the greaser goes that way hell find our horses and get wise to the trick oh hes wise now but ill gamble he never even starts on that trail  neither hurriedly nor guardedly stewart rose out of his leaning posture and took a couple of long strides toward don carlos  go back the way you came he fairly yelled and his voice had the ring of a bugle  ambrose nudged madeline his whisper was tense and rapid dont miss nothin genes called him whatevers comin off will be here quick as lightnin see i guess maybe that greaser dont savvy good u s lingo look at that dirty yaller face turn green put one eye on nels and monty thats greatjust to see em just as quiet and easy but oh the difference bent and stiffthat means every muscle is like a rawhide riata theyre watchin with eyes that can see the workins of them greasers minds now there aint a hosshair between them greasers and hell  don carlos gave stewart one long malignant stare then he threw back his head swept up the sombrero and his evil smile showed gleaming teeth  senor he began  with magnificent bound stewart was upon him the guerrillas cry was throttled in his throat a fierce wrestling ensued too swift to see clearly then heavy sodden blows and don carlos was beaten to the ground stewart leaped back then crouching with his hands on the butts of guns at his hips he yelled he thundered at the guerrillas he had been quicker than a panther and now his voice was so terrible that it curdled madelines blood and the menace of deadly violence in his crouching position made her shut her eyes but she had to open them in that single instant nels and monty had leaped to stewarts side both were bent down with hands on the butts of guns at their hips nelss piercing yell seemed to divide montys roar of rage then they ceased and echoes clapped from the crags the silence of those three men crouching like tigers about to leap was more menacing than the nerveracking yells  then the guerrillas wavered and broke and ran for their horses don carlos rolled over rose and staggered away to be helped upon his mount he looked back his pale and bloody face that of a thwarted demon the whole band got into action and were gone in a moment  i knew it declared ambrose never seen a greaser who could face gunplay that was some warm and monty price never flashed a gun hell never get over that i reckon miss harnmond were some lucky to avoid trouble gene had his way as you seen well be makin tracks for the ranch in about two shakes  why whispered madeline breathlessly she became conscious that she was weak and shaken  because the guerrillas sure will get their nerve back and come sneakin on our trail or try to head us off by ambushin replied ambrose thats their way otherwise three cowboys couldnt bluff a whole gang like that gene knows the nature of greasers theyre whitelivered but i reckon were in more danger now than before unless we get a good start down the mountain there genes callin come hurry  helen had slipped down from her vantagepoint and therefore had not seen the last act in that little campfire drama it seemed however that her desire for excitement was satisfied for her face was pale and she trembled when she asked if the guerrillas were gone  i didnt see the finish but those horrible yells were enough for me  ambrose hurried the three women over the rough rocks down the cliff the cowboys below were saddling horses in haste evidently all the horses had been brought out of hiding swiftly with regard only for life and limb madeline helen and christine were lowered by lassoes and half carried down to the level by the time they were safely down the other members of the party appeared on the cliff above they were in excellent spirits appearing to treat the matter as a huge joke  ambrose put christine on a horse and rode away through the pines frankie slade did likewise with helen stewart led madelines horse up to her helped her to mount and spoke one stern word wait then as fast as one of the women reached the level she was put upon a horse and taken away by a cowboy escort few words were spoken haste seemed to be the great essential the horses were urged and once in the trail spurred and led into a swift trot one cowboy drove up four packhorses and these were hurriedly loaded with the partys baggage castleton and his companions mounted and galloped off to catch the others in the lead this left madeline behind with stewart and nels and monty  theyre goin to switch off at the holler thet heads near the trail a few miles down nels was saying as he tightened his saddlegirth thet holler heads into a big canyon once in thet itll be every man fer hisself i reckon there wont be anythin wuss than a rough ride  nels smiled reassuringly at madeline but he did not speak to her monty took her canteen and filled it at the spring and hung it over the pommel of her saddle he put a couple of biscuits in the saddlebag  dont fergit to take a drink an a bite as youre ridin along he said an dont worry miss majesty stewartll be with you an me an nels hangin on the backtrail  his somber and sullen face did not change in its strange intensity but the look in his eyes madeline felt she would never forget left alone with these three men now stripped of all pretense she realized how fortune had favored her and what peril still hung in the balance stewart swung astride his big black spurred him and whistled at the whistle majesty jumped and with swift canter followed stewart madeline looked back to see nels already up and monty handing him a rifle then the pines hid her view  once in the trail stewarts horse broke into a gallop majesty changed his gait and kept at the blacks heels stewart called back a warning the low widespreading branches of trees might brush madeline out of the saddle fast riding through the forest along a crooked obstructed trail called forth all her alertness likewise the stirring of her blood always susceptible to the spirit and motion of a ride let alone one of peril now began to throb and burn away the worry the dread the coldness that had weighted her down  before long stewart wheeled at right angles off the trail and entered a hollow between two low bluffs madeline saw tracks in the open patches of ground here stewarts horse took to a brisk walk the hollow deepened narrowed became rocky full of logs and brush madeline exerted all her keenness and needed it to keep close to stewart she did not think of him nor her own safety but of keeping majesty close in the tracks of the black of eluding the sharp spikes in the dead brush of avoiding the treacherous loose stones  at last madeline was brought to a dead halt by stewart and his horse blocking the trail looking up she saw they were at the head of a canyon that yawned beneath and widened its graywalled greenpatched slopes down to a black forest of fir the drab monotony of the foothills made contrast below the forest and away in the distance rosy and smoky lay the desert retracting her gaze madeline saw packhorses cross an open space a mile below and she thought she saw the staghounds stewarts dark eyes searched the slopes high up along the craggy escarpments then he put the black to the descent  if there had been a trail left by the leading cowboys stewart did not follow it he led off to the right zigzagging an intricate course through the roughest ground madeline had ever ridden over he crashed through cedars threaded a tortuous way among boulders made his horse slide down slanting banks of soft earth picked a slow and cautious progress across weathered slopes of loose rock madeline followed finding in this ride a tax on strength and judgment on an ordinary horse she never could have kept in stewarts trail it was dust and heat a parching throat that caused madeline to think of time and she was amazed to see the sun sloping to the west stewart never stopped he never looked back he never spoke he must have heard the horse close behind him madeline remembered montys advice about drinking and eating as she rode along the worst of that rough travel came at the bottom of the canyon dead cedars and brush and logs were easy to pass compared with the miles it seemed of loose boulders the horses slipped and stumbled stewart proceeded here with exceeding care at last when the canyon opened into a level forest of firs the sun was setting red in the west  stewart quickened the gait of his horse after a mile or so of easy travel the ground again began to fall decidedly sloping in numerous ridges with draws between soon night shadowed the deeper gullies madeline was refreshed by the cooling of the air  stewart traveled slowly now the barks of coyotes seemed to startle him often he stopped to listen and during one of those intervals the silence was broken by sharp rifleshots madeline could not tell whether they were near or far to right or left behind or before evidently stewart was both alarmed and baffled he dismounted he went cautiously forward to listen madeline fancied she heard a cry low and far away it was only that of a coyote she convinced herself yet it was so wailing so human that she shuddered stewart came back he slipped the bridles of both horses and he led them every few paces he stopped to listen he changed his direction several times and the last time he got among rough rocky ridges the iron shoes of the horses cracked on the rocks that sound must have penetrated far into the forest it perturbed stewart for he searched for softer ground meanwhile the shadows merged into darkness the stars shone the wind rose madeline believed hours passed  stewart halted again in the gloom madeline discerned a log cabin and beyond it pearpointed dark trees piercing the skyline she could just make out stewarts tall form as he leaned against his horse either he was listening or debating what to doperhaps both presently he went inside the cabin madeline heard the scratching of a match then she saw a faint light the cabin appeared to be deserted probably it was one of the many habitations belonging to prospectors and foresters who lived in the mountains stewart came out again he walked around the horses out into the gloom then back to madeline for a long moment he stood as still as a statue and listened then she heard him mutter if we have to start quick i can ride bareback with that he took the saddle and blanket off his horse and carried them into the cabin  get off he said in a low voice as he stepped out of the door  he helped her down and led her inside where again he struck a match madeline caught a glimpse of a rude fireplace and roughhewn logs stewarts blanket and saddle lay on the hardpacked earthen floor  rest a little he said im going into the woods a piece to listen gone only a minute or so  madeline had to feel round in the dark to locate the saddle and blanket when she lay down it was with a grateful sense of ease and relief as her body rested however her mind became the old thronging maze for sensation and thought all day she had attended to the alert business of helping her horse now what had already happened the night the silence the proximity of stewart and his strange stern caution the possible happenings to her friendsall claimed their due share of her feeling she went over them all with lightning swiftness of thought she believed and she was sure stewart believed that her friends owing to their quicker start down the mountain had not been headed off in their travel by any of the things which had delayed stewart this conviction lifted the suddenly returning dread from her breast and as for herself somehow she had no fear but she could not sleep she did not try to  stewarts soft steps sounded outside his dark form loomed in the door as he sat down madeline heard the thump of a gun that he laid beside him on the sill then the thump of another as he put that down too the sounds thrilled her stewarts wide shoulders filled the door his finely shaped head and strong stern profile showed clearly in outline against the sky the wind waved his hair he turned his ear to that wind and listened motionless he sat for what to her seemed hours  then the stirring memory of the days adventure the feeling of the beauty of the night and a strange deepseated sweetly vague consciousness of happiness portending were all burned out in hot pressing pain at the remembrance of stewarts disgrace in her eyes something had changed within her so that what had been anger at herself was sorrow for him he was such a splendid man she could not feel the same she knew her debt to him yet she could not thank him could not speak to him she fought an unintelligible bitterness  then she rested with closed eyes and time seemed neither short nor long when stewart called her she opened her eyes to see the gray of dawn she rose and stepped outside the horses whinnied in a moment she was in the saddle aware of cramped muscles and a weariness of limbs stewart led off at a sharp trot into the fir forest they came to a trail into which he turned the horses traveled steadily the descent grew less steep the firs thinned out the gray gloom brightened  when madeline rode out of the firs the sun had arisen and the foothills rolled beneath her and at their edge where the gray of valley began she saw a dark patch that she knew was the ranchhouse     xx the sheriff of el cajon  about the middle of the forenoon of that day madeline reached the ranch her guests had all arrived there late the night before and wanted only her presence and the assurance of her wellbeing to consider the last of the camping trip a rare adventure likewise they voted it the cowboys masterpiece of a trick madelines delay they averred had been only a clever coup to give a final effect she did not correct their impression nor think it needful to state that she had been escorted home by only one cowboy  her guests reported an arduous ride down the mountain with only one incident to lend excitement on the descent they had fallen in with sheriff hawe and several of his deputies who were considerably under the influence of drink and very greatly enraged by the escape of the mexican girl bonita hawe had used insulting language to the ladies and according to ambrose would have inconvenienced the party on some pretext or other if he had not been sharply silenced by the cowboys  madelines guests were two days in recovering from the hard ride on the third day they leisurely began to prepare for departure this period was doubly trying for madeline she had her own physical need of rest and moreover had to face a mental conflict that could scarcely be postponed further her sister and friends were kindly and earnestly persistent in their entreaties that she go back east with them she desired to go it was not going that mattered it was how and when and under what circumstances she was to return that roused in her disturbing emotion before she went east she wanted to have fixed in mind her future relation to the ranch and the west when the crucial hour arrived she found that the west had not claimed her yet these old friends had warmed cold ties  it turned out however that there need be no hurry about making the decision madeline would have welcomed any excuse to procrastinate but as it happened a letter from alfred made her departure out of the question for the present he wrote that his trip to california had been very profitable that he had a proposition for madeline from a large cattle company and particularly that he wanted to marry florence soon after his arrival home and would bring a minister from douglas for that purpose  madeline went so far however as to promise helen and her friends that she would go east soon at the very latest by thanksgiving with that promise they were reluctantly content to say goodby to the ranch and to her at the last moment there seemed a great likelihood of a hitch in plans for the first stage of that homeward journey all of madelines guests held up their hands western fashion when link stevens appeared with the big white car link protested innocently solemnly that he would drive slowly and safely but it was necessary for madeline to guarantee links word and to accompany them before they would enter the car at the station goodbys were spoken and repeated and madelines promise was exacted for the hundredth time  dorothy coombss last words were give my love to monty price tell him imim glad he kissed me  helens eyes had a sweet grave yet mocking light as she said  majesty bring stewart with you when you come hell be the rage  madeline treated the remark with the same merry lightness with which it was received by the others but after the train had pulled out and she was on her way home she remembered helens words and looks with something almost amounting to a shock any mention of stewart any thought of him displeased her  what did helen mean mused madeline and she pondered that mocking light in helens eyes had been simply an ironical glint a cynical gleam from that worldly experience so suspicious and tolerant in its wisdom the sweet gravity of helens look had been a deeper and more subtle thing madeline wanted to understand it to divine in it a new relation between helen and herself something fine and sisterly that might lead to love the thought however revolving around a strange suggestion of stewart was poisoned at its inception and she dismissed it  upon the drive in to the ranch as she was passing the lower lake she saw stewart walking listlessly along the shore when he became aware of the approach of the car he suddenly awakened from his aimless sauntering and disappeared quickly in the shade of the shrubbery this was not by any means the first time madeline had seen him avoid a possible meeting with her somehow the act had pained her though affording her a relief she did not want to meet him face to face  it was annoying for her to guess that stillwell had something to say in stewarts defense the old cattleman was evidently distressed several times he had tried to open a conversation with madeline relating to stewart she had evaded him until the last time when his persistence had brought a cold and final refusal to hear another word about the foreman stillwell had been crushed  as days passed stewart remained at the ranch without his old faithfulness to his work madeline was not moved to a kinder frame of mind to see him wandering dejectedly around it hurt her and because it hurt her she grew all the harder then she could not help hearing snatches of conversation which strengthened her suspicions that stewart was losing his grip on himself that he would soon take the downward course again verification of her own suspicion made it a belief and belief brought about a sharp conflict between her generosity and some feeling that she could not name it was not a question of justice or mercy or sympathy if a single word could have saved stewart from sinking his splendid manhood into the brute she had recoiled from at chiricahua she would not have spoken it she could not restore him to his former place in her regard she really did not want him at the ranch at all once considering in wonder her knowledge of men she interrogated herself to see just why she could not overlook stewarts transgression she never wanted to speak to him again or see him or think of him in some way through her interest in stewart she had come to feel for herself an inexplicable thing close to scorn  a telegram from douglas heralding the coming of alfred and a minister put an end to madelines brooding and she shared something of florence kingsleys excitement the cowboys were as eager and gossipy as girls it was arranged to have the wedding ceremony performed in madelines great hallchamber and the dinner in the cool flowerscented patio  alfred and his minister arrived at the ranch in the big white car they appeared considerably windblown in fact the minister was breathless almost sightless and certainly hatless alfred used as he was to wind and speed remarked that he did not wonder at nelss aversion to riding a fleeting cannonball the imperturbable link took off his cap and goggles and consulting his watch made his usual apologetic report to madeline deploring the fact that a teamster and a few stray cattle on the road had held him down to the manana time of only a mile a minute  arrangements for the wedding brought alfreds delighted approval when he had learned all florence and madeline would tell him he expressed a desire to have the cowboys attend and then he went on to talk about california where he was going take florence on a short trip he was curiously interested to find out all about madelines guests and what had happened to them his keen glance at madeline grew softer as she talked  i breathe again he said and laughed i was afraid well i must have missed some sport i can just fancy what monty and nels did to that englishman so you went up to the crags thats a wild place im not surprised at guerrillas falling in with you up there the crags were a famous rendezvous for apachesits near the borderalmost inaccessiblegood water and grass i wonder what the u s cavalry would think if they knew these guerrillas crossed the border right under their noses well its practically impossible to patrol some of that borderline its desert mountain and canyon exceedingly wild and broken im sorry to say that there seems to be more trouble in sight with these guerrillas than at any time heretofore orozco the rebel leader has failed to withstand maderos army the federals are occupying chihuahua now and are driving the rebels north orozco has broken up his army into guerrilla bands they are moving north and west intending to carry on guerrilla warfare in sonora i cant say just how this will affect us here but were too close to the border for comfort these guerrillas are nightriding hawks they can cross the border raid us here and get back the same night fighting i imagine will not be restricted to northern mexico with the revolution a failure the guerrillas will be more numerous bolder and hungrier unfortunately we happen to be favorably situated for them down here in this wilderness corner of the state  on the following day alfred and florence were married florences sister and several friends from el cajon were present besides madeline stillwell and his men it was alfreds express wish that stewart attend the ceremony madeline was amused when she noticed the painfully suppressed excitement of the cowboys for them a wedding must have been an unusual and impressive event she began to have a better understanding of the nature of it when they cast off restraint and pressed forward to kiss the bride in all her life madeline had never seen a bride kissed so much and so heartily nor one so flushed and disheveled and happy this indeed was a joyful occasion there was nothing of the effete east about alfred hammond he might have been a westerner all his days when madeline managed to get through the press of cowboys to offer her congratulations alfred gave her a bear hug and a kiss this appeared to fascinate the cowboys with shining eyes and faces aglow with smiling boyish boldness they made a rush at madeline for one instant her heart leaped to her throat they looked as if they could most shamelessly kiss and maul her that little uglyfaced softeyed rude tenderhearted ruffian monty price was in the lead he resembled a dragon actuated by sentiment all at once madelines instinctive antagonism to being touched by strange hands or lips battled with a real warm and funloving desire to let the cowboys work their will with her but she saw stewart hanging at the back of the crowd and somethingsome fierce dark expression of painamazed her while it froze her desire to be kind then she did not know what change must have come to her face and bearing but she saw monty fall back sheepishly and the other cowboys draw aside to let her lead the way into the patio  the dinner began quietly enough with the cowboys divided between embarrassment and voracious appetites that they evidently feared to indulge wine however loosened their tongues and when stillwell got up to make the speech everybody seemed to expect of him they greeted him with a roar  stillwell was now one huge mountainous smile he was so happy that he appeared on the verge of tears he rambled on ecstatically till he came to raise his glass  an now girls an boys lets all drink to the bride an groom to their sincere an lastin love to their happiness an prosperity to their good health an long life lets drink to the unitin of the east with the west no man full of red blood an the real breath of life could resist a western girl an a good hoss an gods

outside arrested stillwells voice and halted his hand in midair  the patio became as silent as an unoccupied room  through the open doors and windows of madelines chamber burst the sounds of horses stamping to a halt then harsh speech of men and a low cry of a woman in pain  rapid steps crossed the porch entered madelines room nels appeared in the doorway madeline was surprised to see that he had not been at the dinnertable she was disturbed at sight of his face  stewart youre wanted outdoors called nels bluntly monty you slope out here with me you nick an stillwelli reckon the rest of you hed better shut the doors an stay inside  nels disappeared quick as a cat monty glided out madeline heard his soft swift steps pass from her room into her office he had left his guns there madeline trembled she saw stewart get up quietly and without any change of expression on his dark sad face leave the patio nick steele followed him stillwell dropped his wineglass as it broke shivering the silence his huge smile vanished his face set into the old cragginess and the red slowly thickened into black stillwell went out and closed the door behind him  then there was a blank silence the enjoyment of the moment had been rudely disrupted madeline glanced down the lines of brown faces to see the pleasure fade into the old familiar hardness  whats wrong asked alfred rather stupidly the change of mood had been too rapid for him suddenly he awakened thoroughly aroused at the interruption im going to see whos butted in here to spoil our dinner he said and strode out  he returned before any one at the table had spoken or moved and now the dull red of anger mottled his forehead  its the sheriff of el cajon he exclaimed contemptuously pat hawe with some of his tough deputies come to arrest gene stewart theyve got that poor little mexican girl out there tied on a horse confound that sheriff  madeline calmly rose from the table eluding florences entreating hand and started for the door the cowboys jumped up alfred barred her progress  alfred i am going out she said  no i guess not he replied thats no place for you  i am going she looked straight at him  madeline why what is it you lookdear theres pretty sure to be trouble outside maybe therell be a fight you can do nothing you must not go  perhaps i can prevent trouble she replied  as she left the patio she was aware that alfred with florence at his side and the cowboys behind were starting to follow her when she got out of her room upon the porch she heard several men in loud angry discussion then at sight of bonita helplessly and cruelly bound upon a horse pale and disheveled and suffering madeline experienced the thrill that sight or mention of this girl always gave her it yielded to a hot pang in her breastthat live pain which so shamed her but almost instantly as a second glance showed an agony in bonitas face her bruised arms where the rope bit deep into the flesh her little brown hands stained with blood madeline was overcome by pity for the unfortunate girl and a womans righteous passion at such barbarous treatment of one of her own sex  the man holding the bridle of the horse on which bonita had been bound was at once recognized by madeline as the bigbodied bulletheaded guerrilla who had found the basket of wine in the spring at camp redder of face blacker of beard coarser of aspect evidently under the influence of liquor he was as fiercelooking as a gorilla and as repulsive besides him there were three other men present all mounted on weary horses the one in the foreground gaunt sharpfeatured redeyed with a pointed beard she recognized as the sheriff of el cajon  madeline hesitated then stopped in the middle of the porch alfred florence and several others followed her out the rest of the cowboys and guests crowded the windows and doors stillwell saw madeline and throwing up his hands roared to be heard this quieted the gesticulating quarreling men  wal now pat hawe whats drivin you like a locoed steer on the rampage demanded stillwell  keep in the traces bill replied hawe you savvy what i come fer ive been bidin my time but im ready now im hyar to arrest a criminal  the huge frame of the old cattleman jerked as if he had been stabbed his face turned purple  what criminal he shouted hoarsely  the sheriff flicked his quirt against his dirty boot and he twisted his thin lips into a leer the situation was agreeable to him  why bill i knowed you hed a nogood outfit ridin this range but i wasnt wise thet you hed more n one criminal  cut that talk which cowboy are you wantin to arrest  hawes manner altered  gene stewart he replied curtly  on what charge  fer killin a greaser one night last fall  so youre still harpin on that pat youre on the

quivered with his rage yet he made a successful effort to control it  see hyar pat hawe i know whats reasonable law is law but in this country there always has been an is now a safe an sane way to

listen you cheap redeyed coyote of a sheriff you dont care how many enemies you make you know youll never get office again in this county what do you care now its amazin strange how earnest you are to

youre afraid to go near the border an your hate of gene stewart makes you want to hound him an put him where hes never been yetin jail you want to spite his friends wal listen you leanjawed skunkbitten coyote go ahead an try to arrest him  stillwell took one mighty stride off the porch his last words had been cold his rage appeared to have been transferred to hawe the sheriff had begun to stutter and shake a lanky red hand at the cattleman when stewart stepped out  here you fellows give me a chance to say a word  as stewart appeared the mexican girl suddenly seemed vitalized out of her stupor she strained at her bonds as if to lift her hands beseechingly a flush animated her haggard face and her big dark eyes lighted  senor gene she moaned help me i so seek they beat me rope me mos keel me oh help me senor gene  shut up er ill gag you said the man who held bonitas horse  muzzle her sneed if she blabs again called hawe madeline felt something tense and strained working in the short silence was it only a phase of her thrilling excitement her swift glance showed the faces of nels and monty and nick to be brooding cold watchful she wondered why stewart did not look toward bonita he too was now darkfaced cool quiet with something ominous about him  hawe ill submit to arrest without any fuss he said slowly if youll take the ropes off that girl  nope replied the sheriff she got away from me onct shes hawgtied now an shell stay hawgtied  madeline thought she saw stewart give a slight start but an unaccountable dimness came over her eyes at brief intervals obscuring her keen sight vaguely she was conscious of a clogged and beating tumult in her breast  all right lets hurry out of here said stewart youve made annoyance enough ride down to the corral with me ill get my horse and go with you  hold on yelled hawe as stewart turned away not so fast whos doin this you dont come no el capitan stunts on me youll ride one of my packhorses an youll go in irons  you

put the irons on this man  the guerrilla called sneed slid off his horse and began to fumble in his saddlebags  you see bill went on hawe i swore in a new depooty fer this particular job sneed is some handy he rounded up thet little mexican cat fer me  stillwell did not hear the sheriff he was gazing at stewart in a kind of imploring amaze  gene you aint goin to stand fer them handcuffs he pleaded  yes replied the cowboy bill old friend im an outsider here theres no call for miss hammond andand her brother and florence to be worried further about me their happy day has already been spoiled on my account i want to get out quick  wal you might be too damn considerate of miss hammonds sensitive feelins there was now no trace of the courteous kindly old rancher he looked harder than stone how about my feelins i want to know if youre goin to let this sneakin coyote this last gasp of the old rumguzzlin frontier sheriffs put you in irons an hawgtie you an drive you off to jail  yes replied stewart steadily  wal by gawd you gene stewart whats come over you why man go in the house an ill tend to this feller then tomorrow you can ride in an give yourself up like a gentleman  no ill go thanks bill for the way you and the boys would stick to me hurry hawe before my mind changes  his voice broke at the last betraying the wonderful control he had kept over his passions as he ceased speaking he seemed suddenly to become spiritless he dropped his head  madeline saw in him then a semblance to the hopeless shamed stewart of earlier days the vague riot in her breast leaped into conscious furya womans passionate repudiation of stewarts broken spirit it was not that she would have him be a lawbreaker it was that she could not bear to see him deny his manhood once she had entreated him to become her kind of a cowboya man in whom reason tempered passion she had let him see how painful and shocking any violence was to her and the idea had obsessed him softened him had grown like a stultifying lichen upon his will had shorn him of a wild bold spirit she now strangely longed to see him feel when the man sneed came forward jingling the iron fetters madelines blood turned to fire she would have forgiven stewart then for lapsing into the kind of cowboy it had been her blind and sickly sentiment to abhor this was a mans westa mans game what right had a woman reared in a softer mold to use her beauty and her influence to change a man who was bold and free and strong at that moment with her blood hot and racing she would have gloried in the violence which she had so deplored she would have welcomed the action that had characterized stewarts treatment of don carlos she had in her the sudden dawning temper of a woman who had been assimilating the life and nature around her and who would not have turned her eyes away from a harsh and bloody deed  but stewart held forth his hands to be manacled then madeline heard her own voice burst out in a ringing imperious wait  in the time it took her to make the few steps to the edge of the porch facing the men she not only felt her anger and justice and pride summoning forces to her command but there was something else callinga deep passionate mysterious thing not born of the moment  sneed dropped the manacles stewarts face took on a chalky whiteness hawe in a slow stupid embarrassment beyond his control removed his sombrero in a respect that seemed wrenched from him  mr hawe i can prove to you that stewart was not concerned in any way whatever with the crime for which you want to arrest him  the sheriffs stare underwent a blinking change he coughed stammered and tried to speak manifestly he had been thrown completely off his balance astonishment slowly merged into discomfiture  it was absolutely impossible for stewart to have been connected with that assault went on madeline swiftly for he was with me in the waitingroom of the station at the moment the assault was made outside i assure you i have a distinct and vivid recollection the door was open i heard the voices of quarreling men they grew louder the language was spanish evidently these men had left the dancehall opposite and were approaching the station i heard a womans voice mingling with the others it too was spanish and i could not understand but the tone was beseeching then i heard footsteps on the gravel i knew stewart heard them i could see from his face that something dreadful was about to happen just outside the door then there were hoarse furious voices a scuffle a muffled shot a womans cry the thud of a falling body and rapid footsteps of a man running away next the girl bonita staggered into the door she was white trembling terrorstricken she recognized stewart appealed to him stewart supported her and endeavored to calm her he was excited he asked her if danny mains had been shot or if he had done the shooting the girl said no she told stewart that she had danced a little flirted a little with vaqueros and they had quarreled over her then stewart took her outside and put her upon his horse i saw the girl ride that horse down the street to disappear in the darkness  while madeline spoke another change appeared to be working in the man hawe he was not long disconcerted but his discomfiture wore to a sullen fury and his sharp features fixed in an expression of craft  thets mighty interestin miss hammond most as interestin as a storybook he said now since youre so obligin a witness id sure like to put a question or two what time did you arrive at el cajon thet night  it was after eleven oclock replied madeline  nobody there to meet you  no  the station agent an operator both gone  yes  wal how soon did this feller stewart show up hawe continued with a wry smile  very soon after my arrival i thinkperhaps fifteen minutes possibly a little more  some dark an lonesome around thet station wasnt it  indeed yes  an what time was the greaser shot queried hawe with his little eyes gleaming like coals  probably close to half past one it was two oclock when i looked at my watch at florence kingsleys house directly after stewart sent bonita away he took me to miss kingsleys so allowing for the walk and a few minutes conversation with her i can pretty definitely say the shooting took place at about half past one  stillwell heaved his big frame a step closer to the sheriff what re you drivin at he roared his face black again  evidence snapped hawe  madeline marveled at this interruption and as stewart irresistibly drew her glance she saw him grayfaced as ashes shaking utterly unnerved  i thank you miss hammond he said huskily but you neednt answer any more of hawes questions heshesits not necessary ill go with him now under arrest bonita will corroborate your testimony in court and that will save me from thisthis mans spite  madeline looking at stewart seeing a humility she at first took for cowardice suddenly divined that it was not fear for himself which made him dread further disclosures of that night but fear for herfear of shame she might suffer through him  pat hawe cocked his head to one side like a vulture about to strike with his beak and cunningly eyed madeline  considered as testimony what youve said is sure important an conclusive but im calculatin thet the court will want to hev explained why you stayed from eleventhirty till onethirty in thet waitinroom alone with stewart  his deliberate speech met with what madeline imagined a remarkable reception from stewart who gave a tigerish start from stillwell whose big hands tore at the neck of his shirt as if he was choking from alfred who now strode hotly forward to be stopped by the cold and silent nels from monty price who uttered a violent aw which was both a hiss and a roar  in the rush of her thought madeline could not interpret the meaning of these things which seemed so strange at that moment but they were portentous even as she was forming a reply to hawes speech she felt a chill creep over her  stewart detained me in the waitingroom she said clearvoiced as a bell but we were not aloneall the time  for a moment the only sound following her words was a gasp from stewart hawes face became transformed with a hideous amaze and joy  detained he whispered craning his lean and corded neck hows thet  stewart was drunk he  with sudden passionate gesture of despair stewart appealed to her  oh miss hammond dont dont dont  then he seemed to sink down head lowered upon his breast in utter shame stillwells great hand swept to the bowed shoulder and he turned to madeline  miss majesty i reckon youd be wise to tell all said the old cattleman gravely there aint one of us who could misunderstand any motive or act of yours mebbe a stroke of lightnin might clear this murky air whatever gene stewart did that onlucky nightyou tell it  madelines dignity and selfpossession had been disturbed by stewarts importunity she broke into swift disconnected speech  he came into the stationa few minutes after i got there i askedto be shown to a hotel he said there wasnt any that would accommodate married women he grasped my handlooked for a weddingring then i saw he washe was intoxicated he told me he would go for a hotel porter but he came back with a padrepadre marcos the poor priest wasterribly frightened so was i stewart had turned into a devil he fired his gun at the padres feet he pushed me into a bench again he shotright before my face ii nearly fainted but i heard him cursing the padreheard the padre praying or chantingi didnt know what stewart tried to make me say things in spanish all at once he asked my name i told him he jerked at my veil i took it off then he threw his gun downpushed the padre out of the door that was just before the vaqueros approached with bonita padre marcos must have seen themmust have heard them after that stewart grew quickly sober he was mortifieddistressedstricken with shame he told me he had been drinking at a weddingi remember it was ed lintons wedding then he explainedthe boys were always gamblinghe wagered he would marry the first girl who arrived at el cajon i happened to be the first one he tried to force me to marry him the restrelating to the assault on the vaqueroi have already told you  madeline ended out of breath and panting with her hands pressed upon her heaving bosom revelation of that secret liberated emotion those hurried outspoken words had made her throb and tremble and burn strangely then she thought of alfred and his wrath but he stood motionless as if dazed stillwell was trying to holster up the crushed stewart  hawe rolled his red eyes and threw back his head  ho ho ho ho ho ho say sneed you didnt miss any of it did ye haw haw best i ever heerd in all my born days ho ho  then he ceased laughing and with glinting gaze upon madeline insolent and vicious and savage he began to drawl  wal now my lady i reckon your story if it tallies with bonitas an padre marcoss will clear gene stewart in the eyes of the court here he grew slower more biting sharper and harder of face but you neednt expect pat hawe or the court to swaller thet part of your storyabout bein detained unwillin  madeline had not time to grasp the sense of his last words stewart had convulsively sprung upward white as chalk as he leaped at hawe stillwell interposed his huge bulk and wrapped his arms around stewart there was a brief whirling wrestling struggle stewart appeared to be besting the old cattleman  help boys help yelled stillwell i cant hold him hurry or theres goin to be blood spilled  nick steele and several cowboys leaped to stillwells assistance stewart getting free tossed one aside and then another they closed in on him for an instant a furious straining wrestle of powerful bodies made rasp and shock and blow once stewart heaved them from him but they plunged back upon himconquered him  gene why gene panted the old cattleman sure youre locoedto act this way cool down cool down why boy its all right jest stand stillgive us a chance to talk to you its only ole bill you knowyour ole pal whos tried to be a daddy to

onceover in the desert you swore youd never forget boys make him let me go oh i dont care what hawes said or done to me it was that about her are you all a lot of greasers how can you stand it damn

break replied stillwell soothingly but gene why you aint even packin a gun an theres pat lookin nasty with his hand nervouslike he seen you hed no gun hed jump at the chance to plug you now an then holler about opposition to the law cool down son itll all come right  suddenly madeline was transfixed by a terrible sound  her startled glance shifted from the anxious group round stewart to see that monty price had leaped off the porch he crouched down with his bands below his hips where the big guns swung from his distorted lips issued that which was combined roar and bellow and indian warwhoop and more than all a horrible warning cry he resembled a hunchback about to make the leap of a demon he was quivering vibrating his eyes black and hot were fastened with most piercing intentness upon hawe and sneed  git back bill git back he roared git em back with one lunge stillwell shoved stewart and nick and the other cowboys up on the porch then he crowded madeline and alfred and florence to the wall tried to force them farther his motions were rapid and stern but failing to get them through door and windows he planted his wide person between the women and danger madeline grasped his arm held on and peered fearfully from behind his broad shoulder  you hawe you sneed called monty in that same wild voice dont you move a finger or an eyelash  madelines faculties nerved to keen thrilling divination she grasped the relation between montys terrible cry and the strange hunched posture he had assumed stillwells haste and silence too were pregnant of catastrophe  nels git in this yelled monty and all the time he never shifted his intent gaze as much as a hairsbreadth from hawe and his deputy nels chase away them two fellers hangin back there chase em quick  these men the two deputies who had remained in the background with the packhorses did not wait for nels they spurred their mounts wheeled and galloped away  now nels cut the gurl loose ordered monty  nels ran forward jerked the halter out of sneeds hand and pulled bonitas horse in close to the porch as he slit the rope which bound her she fell into his arms  hawe git down went on monty face front an stiff  the sheriff swung his leg and never moving his hands with his face now a deathly sickening white he slid to the ground  line up there beside your guerrilla pard there you two make a damn fine pictoor a damn fine team of pizened coyote an a cross between a wild mule an a greaser now listen  monty made a long pause in which his breathing was plainly audible  madelines eyes were riveted upon monty her mind swift as lightning had gathered the subtleties in action and word succeeding his domination of the men violence terrible violence the thing she had felt the thing she had feared the thing she had sought to eliminate from among her cowboys was after many months about to be enacted before her eyes it had come at last she had softened stillwell she had influenced nels she had changed stewart but this little blackfaced terrible monty price now rose as it were out of his past wild years and no power on earth or in heaven could stay his hand it was the hard life of wild men in a wild country that was about to strike this blow at her she did not shudder she did not wish to blot out from sight this little man terrible in his mood of wild justice she suffered a flash of horror that monty blind and dead to her authority cold as steel toward her presence understood the deeps of a womans soul for in this moment of strife of insult to her of torture to the man she had uplifted and then broken the passion of her reached deep toward primitive hate with eyes slowly hazing red she watched monty price she listened with thrumming ears she waited slowly sagging against stillwell  hawe if you an your dirty pard hev loved the sound of human voice then listen an listen hard said monty fer ive been goin contrary to my ole style jest to hev a talk with you you all but got away on your nerve didnt you

reverence an youyouhells fire  with whistling breath foaming at the mouth monty price crouched lower hands at his hips and he edged inch by inch farther out from the porch closer to hawe and sneed madeline saw them only in the blurred fringe of her sight they resembled specters she heard the shrill whistle of a horse and recognized majesty calling her from the corral  thets all roared monty in a voice now strangling lower and lower he bent a terrible figure of ferocity now both you armed ocifers of the law come on flash your guns throw em an be quick monty price is done therell be daylight through you both before you fan a hammer but im givin you a chanst to sting me you holler law an my way is the ole law  his breath came quicker his voice grew hoarser and he crouched lower all his body except his rigid arms quivered with a wonderful muscular convulsion  dogs skunks buzzards flash them guns er ill flash mine aha  to madeline it seemed the three stiff crouching men leaped into instant and united action she saw streaks of firestreaks of smoke then a crashing volley deafened her it ceased as quickly smoke veiled the scene slowly it drifted away to disclose three fallen men one of whom monty leaned on his left hand a smoking gun in his right he watched for a movement from the other two it did not come then with a terrible smile he slid back and stretched out     xxi unbridled  in waking and sleeping hours madeline hammond could not release herself from the thralling memory of that tragedy she was haunted by monty prices terrible smile only in action of some kind could she escape and to that end she worked she walked and rode she even overcame a strong feeling which she feared was unreasonable disgust for the mexican girl bonita who lay ill at the ranch bruised and feverish in need of skilful nursing  madeline felt there was something inscrutable changing her soul that strifethe struggle to decide her destiny for east or westheld still further aloof she was never spiritually alone there was a step on her trail indoors she was oppressed she required the openthe light and wind the sight of endless slope the sounds of corral and pond and field physical things natural things  one afternoon she rode down to the alfalfafields round them and back up to the spillway of the lower lake where a group of mesquitetrees owing to the water that seeped through the sand to their roots had taken on bloom and beauty of renewed life under these trees there was shade enough to make a pleasant place to linger madeline dismounted desiring to rest a little she liked this quiet lonely spot it was really the only secluded nook near the house if she rode down into the valley or out to the mesa or up on the foothills she could not go alone probably now stillwell or nels knew her whereabouts but as she was comparatively hidden here she imagined a solitude that was not actually hers  her horse majesty tossed his head and flung his mane and switched his tail at the flies he would rather have been cutting the wind down the valley slope madeline sat with her back against a tree and took off her sombrero the soft breeze fanning her hot face blowing strands of her hair was refreshingly cool she heard the slow tramp of cattle going in to drink that sound ceased and the grove of mesquites appeared to be lifeless except for her and her horse it was however only after moments of attention that she found the place was far from being dead keen eyes and ears brought reward desert quail as gray as the bare earth were dusting themselves in a shady spot a bee swift as light hummed by she saw a horned toad the color of stone squatting low hiding fearfully in the sand within reach of her whip she extended the point of the whip and the toad quivered and swelled and hissed it was instinct with fight the wind faintly stirred the thin foliage of the mesquites making a mournful sigh from far up in the foothills barely distinguishable came the scream of an eagle the bray of a burro brought a brief discordant break then a brown bird darted down from an unseen perch and made a swift irregular flight after a fluttering winged insect madeline heard the sharp snapping of a merciless beak indeed there was more than life in the shade of the mesquites  suddenly majesty picked up his long ears and snorted then madeline heard a slow pad of hoofs a horse was approaching from the direction of the lake madeline had learned to be wary and mounting majesty she turned him toward the open a moment later she felt glad of her caution for looking back between the trees she saw stewart leading a horse into the grove she would as lief have met a guerrilla as this cowboy  majesty had broken into a trot when a shrill whistle rent the air the horse leaped and wheeling so swiftly that he nearly unseated madeline he charged back straight for the mesquites madeline spoke to him cried angrily at him pulled with all her strength upon the bridle but was helplessly unable to stop him he whistled a piercing blast madeline realized then that stewart his old master had called him and that nothing could turn him she gave up trying and attended to the urgent need of intercepting mesquite boughs that majesty thrashed into motion the horse thumped into an aisle between the trees and stopping before stewart whinnied eagerly  madeline not knowing what to expect had not time for any feeling but amaze a quick glance showed her stewart in rough garb dressed for the trail and leading a wiry horse saddled and packed when stewart without looking at her put his arm around majestys neck and laid his face against the flowing mane madelines heart suddenly began to beat with unwonted quickness stewart seemed oblivious to her presence his eyes were closed his dark face softened lost its hardness and fierceness and sadness and for an instant became beautiful  madeline instantly divined what his action meant he was leaving the ranch this was his goodby to his horse how strange sad fine was this love between man and beast a dimness confused madelines eyes she hurriedly brushed it away and it came back wet and blurring she averted her face ashamed of the tears stewart might see she was sorry for him he was going away and this time judging from the nature of his farewell to his horse it was to be forever like a stab from a cold blade a pain shot through madelines heart the wonder of it the incomprehensibility of it the utter newness and strangeness of this sharp pain that now left behind a dull pang made her forget stewart her surroundings everything except to search her heart maybe here was the secret that had eluded her she trembled on the brink of something unknown in some strange way the emotion brought back her girlhood her mind revolved swift queries and replies she was living feeling learning happiness mocked at her from behind a barred door and the bar of that door seemed to be an inexplicable pain then like lightning strokes shot the questions why should pain hide her happiness what was her happiness what relation had it to this man why should she feel strangely about his departure and the voices within her were silenced stunned unanswered  i want to talk to you said stewart  madeline started turned to him and now she saw the earlier stewart the man who reminded her of their first meeting at el cajon of that memorable meeting at chiricahua  i want to ask you something he went on ive been wanting to know something thats why ive hung on here you never spoke to me never noticed me never gave me a chance to ask you but now im going overover the border and i want to know why did you refuse to listen to me  at his last words that hot shame tenfold more stifling than when it had before humiliated madeline rushed over her sending the scarlet in a wave to her temples it seemed that his words made her realize she was actually face to face with him that somehow a shame she would rather have died than revealed was being liberated biting her lips to hold back speech she jerked on majestys bridle struck him with her whip spurred him stewarts iron arm held the horse then madeline in a flash of passion struck at stewarts face missed it struck again and hit with one pull almost drawing her from the saddle he tore the whip from her hands it was not that action on his part or the sudden strong masterfulness of his look so much as the livid mark on his face where the whip had lashed that quieted if it did not check her fury  thats nothing he said with something of his old audacity thats nothing to how youve hurt me  madeline battled with herself for control this man would not be denied never before had the hardness of his face the flinty hardness of these desertbred men so struck her with its revelation of the unbridled spirit he looked stern haggard bitter the dark shade was changing to graythe gray to ashcolor of passion about him now there was only the ghost of that finer gentler man she had helped to bring into being the piercing dark eyes he bent upon her burned her went through her as if he were looking into her soul then madelines quick sight caught a fleeting doubt a wistfulness a surprised and saddened certainty in his eyes saw it shade and pass away her womans intuition as keen as her sight told her stewart in that moment had sustained a shock of bitter final truth  for the third time he repeated his question to her madeline did not answer she could not speak  you dont know i love you do you he continued passionately that ever since you stood before me in that hole at chiricahua ive loved you you cant see ive been another man loving you working for you living for you you wont believe ive turned my back on the old wild life that ive been decent and honorable and happy and usefulyour kind of a cowboy you couldnt tell though i loved you that i never wanted you to know it that i never dared to think of you except as my angel my holy virgin what do you know of a mans heart and soul how could you tell of the love the salvation of a man whos lived his life in the silence and loneliness who could teach you the actual truththat a wild cowboy faithless to mother and sister except in memory riding a hard drunken trail straight to hell had looked into the face the eyes of a beautiful woman infinitely beyond him above him and had so loved her that he was savedthat he became faithful againthat he saw her face in every flower and her eyes in the blue heaven who could tell you when at night i stood alone under these western stars how deep in my soul i was glad just to be alive to be able to do something for you to be near you to stand between you and worry trouble danger to feel somehow that i was a part just a little part of the west you had come to love  madeline was mute she heard her heart thundering in her ears  stewart leaped at her his powerful hand closed on her arm she trembled his action presaged the old instinctive violence  no but you think i kept bonita up in the mountains that i went secretly to meet her that all the while i served you i wasoh i know what you think i know now i never knew till i made you look at me now say it speak  whitehot blinded utterly in the fiery grasp of passion powerless to stem the rush of a word both shameful and revealing and fatal madeline cried  yes  he had wrenched that word from her but he was not subtle enough not versed in the mystery of womans motive enough to divine the deep significance of her reply  for him the word had only literal meaning confirming the dishonor in which she held him dropping her arm he shrank back a strange action for the savage and crude man she judged him to be  but that day at chiricahua you spoke of faith he burst out you said the greatest thing in the world was faith in human nature you said the finest men had been those who had fallen low and had risen you said you had faith in me you made me have faith in myself  his reproach without bitterness or scorn was a lash to her old egoistic belief in her fairness she had preached a beautiful principle that she had failed to live up to she understood his rebuke she wondered and wavered but the affront to her pride had been too great the tumult within her breast had been too startlingly fierce she could not speak the moment passed and with it his brief rugged splendor of simplicity  you think i am vile he said you think that about bonita and all the time ive been i could make you ashamedi could tell you  his passionate utterance ceased with a snap of his teeth his lips set in a thin bitter line the agitation of his face preceded a convulsive wrestling of his shoulders all this swift action denoted an inner combat and it nearly overwhelmed him  no no he panted was it his answer to some mighty temptation then like a bent sapling released he sprang erect but ill be the manthe dogyou think me  he laid hold of her arm with rude powerful clutch one pull drew her sliding half out of the saddle into his arms she fell with her breast against his not wholly free of stirrups or horse and there she hung utterly powerless maddened writhing she tore to release herself all she could accomplish was to twist herself raise herself high enough to see his face that almost paralyzed her did he mean to kill her then he wrapped his arms around her and crushed her tighter closer to him she felt the pound of his heart her own seemed to have frozen then he pressed his burning lips to hers it was a long terrible kiss she felt him shake  oh stewart iimploreyouletmego she whispered  his white face loomed over hers she closed her eyes he rained kisses upon her face but no more upon her mouth on her closed eyes her hair her cheeks her neck he pressed swift lipslips that lost their fire and grew cold then he released her and lifting and righting her in the saddle he still held her arm to keep her from falling  for a moment madeline sat on her horse with shut eyes she dreaded the light  now you cant say youve never been kissed stewart said his voice seemed a long way off but that was coming to you so be game here  she felt something hard and cold and metallic thrust into her hand he made her fingers close over it hold it the feel of the thing revived her she opened her eyes stewart had given her his gun he stood with his broad breast against her knee and she looked up to see that old mocking smile on his face  go ahead throw my gun on me be a thoroughbred  madeline did not yet grasp his meaning  you can put me down in that quiet place on the hillbeside monty price  madeline dropped the gun with a shuddering cry of horror the sense of his words the memory of monty the certainty that she would kill stewart if she held the gun an instant longer tortured the selfaccusing cry from her  stewart stooped to pick up the weapon  you might have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble he said with another flash of the mocking smile youre beautiful and sweet and proud but youre no thoroughbred majesty hammond adios  stewart leaped for the saddle of his horse and with the flying mount crashed through the mesquites to disappear     xxii the secret told  in the shaded seclusion of her room buried face down deep among the soft cushions on her couch madeline hammond lay prostrate and quivering under the outrage she had suffered  the afternoon wore away twilight fell night came and then madeline rose to sit by the window to let the cool wind blow upon her hot face she passed through hours of unintelligible shame and impotent rage and futile striving to reason away her defilement  the train of brightening stars seemed to mock her with their unattainable passionless serenity she had loved them and now she imagined she hated them and everything connected with this wild fateful and abrupt west  she would go home  edith wayne had been right the west was no place for madeline hammond the decision to go home came easily naturally she thought as the result of events it caused her no mental strife indeed she fancied she felt relief the great stars blinking white and cold over the dark crags looked down upon her and as always after she had watched them for a while they enthralled her under western stars she mused thinking a little scornfully of the romantic destiny they had blazed for her idle sentiment but they were beautiful they were speaking they were mocking they drew her ah she sighed it will not be so very easy to leave them after all  madeline closed and darkened the window she struck a light it was necessary to tell the anxious servants who knocked that she was well and required nothing a soft step on the walk outside arrested her who was therenels or nick steele or stillwell who shared the guardianship over her now that monty price was dead and that otherthat savage it was monstrous and unfathomable that she regretted him  the light annoyed her complete darkness fitted her strange mood she retired and tried to compose herself to sleep sleep for her was not a matter of will her cheeks burned so hotly that she rose to bathe them cold water would not alleviate this burn and then despairing of forgetfulness she lay down again with a shameful gratitude for the cloak of night stewarts kisses were there scorching her lips her closed eyes her swelling neck they penetrated deeper and deeper into her blood into her heart into her soulthe terrible farewell kisses of a passionate hardened man despite his baseness he had loved her  late in the night madeline fell asleep in the morning she was pale and languid but in a mental condition that promised composure  it was considerably after her regular hour that madeline repaired to her office the door was open and just outside tipped back in a chair sat stillwell  mawnin miss majesty he said as he rose to greet her with his usual courtesy there were signs of trouble in his lined face madeline shrank inwardly fearing his old lamentations about stewart then she saw a dusty ragged pony in the yard and a little burro drooping under a heavy pack both animals bore evidence of long arduous travel  to whom do they belong asked madeline  them critters why danny mains replied stillwell with a cough that betrayed embarrassment  danny mains echoed madeline wonderingly  wal i said so  stillwell was indeed not himself  is danny mains here she asked in sudden curiosity  the old cattleman nodded gloomily  yep hes hyar all right sloped in from the hills an he hollered to see bonita hes locoed too about that little blackeyed hussy why he hardly said howdy bill before he begun to ask wild an eager questions i took him in to see bonita hes been there more n a halfhour now  evidently stillwells sensitive feelings had been ruffled madelines curiosity changed to blank astonishment which left her with a thrilling premonition she caught her breath a thousand thoughts seemed thronging for clear conception in her mind  rapid footsteps with an accompaniment of clinking spurs sounded in the hallway then a young man ran out upon the porch he resembled a cowboy in his lithe build his garb and action in the way he wore his gun but his face instead of being red was clear brown tan his eyes were blue his hair was light and curly he was a handsome frankfaced boy at sight of madeline he slammed down his sombrero and leaping at her he possessed himself of her hands his swift violence not only alarmed her but painfully reminded her of something she wished to forget  this cowboy bent his head and kissed her hands and wrung them and when he straightened up he was crying  miss hammond shes safe an almost well an what i feared most aint so thank god he cried sure ill never be able to pay you for all youve done for her shes told me how she was dragged down here how gene tried to save her how you spoke up for gene an her too how monty at the last throwed his guns poor monty we were good friends monty an i but it wasnt friendship for me that made monty stand in there he would have saved her anyway monty price was the whitest man i ever knew theres nels an nick an gene hes been some friend to me but monty price washe was grand he never knew any more than you or bill here or the boys what bonita was to me  stillwells kind and heavy hand fell upon the cowboys shoulder  danny whats all this queer gab he asked an youre takin some liberty with miss hammond who never seen you before sure im makin allowance fer amazin strange talk i see youre not drinkin mebbe youre plumb locoed come ease up now an talk sense  the cowboys fine frank face broke into a smile he dashed the tears from his eyes then he laughed his laugh had a pleasant boyish ringa happy ring  bill old pal stand bridle down a minute will you then he bowed to madeline i beg your pardon miss hammond for seemin rudeness im danny mains an bonita is my wife im so crazy glad shes safe an unharmedso grateful to you thatwhy sure its a wonder i didnt kiss you outright  bonitas your wife ejaculated stillwell  sure weve been married for months replied danny happily gene stewart did it good old gene hes hell on marryin i guess maybe i havent come to pay him up for all hes done for me you see ive been in love with bonita for two years an geneyou know bill what a way gene has with girlshe waswell he was tryin to get bonita to have me  madelines quick varying emotions were swallowed up in a boundless gladness something dark deep heavy and somber was flooded from her heart she had a sudden rich sense of gratitude toward this smiling cleanfaced cowboy whose blue eyes flashed through tears  danny mains she said tremulously and smilingly if you are as glad as your news has made meif you really think i merit such a rewardyou may kiss me outright  with a bashful wonder but with right hearty will danny mains availed himself of this gracious privilege stillwell snorted the signs of his phenomenal smile were manifest otherwise madeline would have thought that snort an indication of furious disapproval  bill straddle a chair said danny youve gone back a heap these last few months frettin over your bad boys danny an gene youll need support under you while im throwin my yarn story of my life bill he placed a chair for madeline miss hammond beggin your pardon again i want you to listen also youve the face an eyes of a woman who loves to hear of other peoples happiness besides somehow its easy for me to talk lookin at you  his manner subtly changed then possibly it took on a little swagger certainly he lost the dignity that he had shown under stress of feeling he was now more like a cowboy about to boast or affect some stunning maneuver walking off the porch he stood before the weary horse and burro  played out he exclaimed  then with the swift violence so characteristic of men of his class he slipped the pack from the burro and threw saddle and bridle from the horse  there see em take a look at the last doggone weight you ever packed youve been some faithful to danny mains an danny mains pays never a saddle again or a strap or a halter or a hobble so long as you live so long as you live nothin but grass an clover an cool water in shady places an dusty swales to roll in an rest an sleep  then he untied the pack and taking a small heavy sack from it he came back upon the porch deliberately he dumped the contents of the sack at stillwells feet piece after piece of rock thumped upon the floor the pieces were sharp ragged evidently broken from a ledge the body of them was white in color with yellow veins and bars and streaks stillwell grasped up one rock after another stared and stuttered put the rocks to his lips dug into them with his shaking fingers then he lay back in his chair head against the wall and as he gaped at danny the old smile began to transform his face  lord danny if you hevnt been an gone an struck it rich  danny regarded stillwell with lofty condescension  some rich he said now bill whatve we got here say offhand  oh lord danny im afraid to say look miss majesty jest look at the gold ive lived among prospectors an goldmines fer thirty years an i never seen the beat of this  the lost mine of the padres cried danny in stentorian voice an it belongs to me  stillwell made some incoherent sound as he sat up fascinated quite beside himself  bill it was some long time ago since you saw me said danny fact is i know how you felt because gene kept me posted i happened to run across bonita an i wasnt goin to let her ride away alone when she told me she was in trouble we hit the trail for the peloncillos bonita had genes horse an she was to meet him up on the trail we got to the mountains all right an nearly starved for a few days till gene found us he had

doin all i could to drag him out of town a long time after that gene trailed up to the crags an found us gene had stopped drinkin hed changed wonderful was fine an dandy it was then he began to pester the life out of me to make me marry bonita i was happy so was she an i was some scared of spoilin it bonita had been a little flirt an i was afraid shed get shy of a halter so i bucked against gene but i was all locoed as it turned out gene would come up occasionally packin supplies for us an always hed get after me to do the right thing by bonita genes so doggone hard to buck against i had to

wantin to marry bonitamy bein glad to marry herthat made her grow soft an sweet an pretty asas a mountain quail gene fetched up padre marcos an he married us  danny paused in his narrative breathing hard as if the memory of the incident described had stirred strong and thrilling feeling in him stillwells smile was rapturous madeline leaned toward danny with her eyes shining  miss hammond an you bill stillwell now listen for this is strange ive got to tell you the afternoon bonita an i were married when gene an the padre had gone i was happy one minute an lowhearted the next i was miserable because i had a bad name i couldnt buy even a decent dress for my pretty wife bonita heard me an she was some mysterious she told me the story of the lost mine of the padres an she kissed me an made joyful over me in the strangest way i knew marriage went to womens heads an i thought even bonita had a spell  well she left me for a little an when she came back she wore some pretty yellow flowers in her hair her eyes were big an black an beautiful she said some queer things about spirits rollin rocks down the canyon then she said she wanted to show me where she always sat an waited an watched for me when i was away  she led me around under the crags to a long slope it was some pretty thereclear an open with a long sweep an the desert yawnin deep an red there were yellow flowers on that slope the same kind she had in her hairthe same kind that apache girl wore hundreds of years ago when she led the padre to the goldmine  when i thought of that an saw bonitas eyes an then heard the strange crack of rollin rocksheard them rattle down an roll an grow fainti was some out of my head but not for long them rocks were rollin all right only it was the weatherin of the cliffs  an there under the crags was a gold pocket  then i was worse than locoed i went goldcrazy i worked like seventeen burros bill i dug a lot of goldbearin quartz bonita watched the trails for me brought me water that was how she come to get caught by pat hawe an his guerrillas sure pat hawe was so set on doin gene dirt that he mixed up with don carlos bonita will tell you some staggerin news about that outfit just now my story is all gold  danny mains got up and kicked back his chair blue lightning gleamed from his eyes as he thrust a hand toward stillwell  bill old pal put her theregive me your hand he

witnesses well draw up a pardnership go find him bill i want to show him this gold show him how danny mains pays an the only bitter drop in my cup today is that i cant ever pay monty price              madelines lips tremblingly formed to tell danny mains and stillwell that the cowboy they wanted so much had left the ranch but the flame of fine loyalty that burned in dannys eyes the happiness that made the old cattlemans face at once amazing and beautiful stiffened her lips she watched the huge stillwell and the little cowboy both talking wildly as they walked off arm in arm to find stewart she imagined something of what dannys disappointment would be of the elder mans consternation and grief when he learned stewart had left for the border at this juncture she looked up to see a strange yet familiar figure approaching padre marcos certain it was that madeline felt herself trembling what did his presence mean on this day he had always avoided meeting her whenever possible he had been exceedingly grateful for all she had done for his people his church and himself but he had never thanked her in person perhaps he had come for that purpose now but madeline did not believe so  mention of padre marcos sight of him had always occasioned madeline a little indefinable shock and now as he stepped to the porch a shrunken stooped and sadfaced man she was startled  the padre bowed low to her  senora will you grant me audience he asked in perfect english and his voice was lowtoned and grave  certainly padre marcos replied madeline and she led him into her office  may i beg to close the doors he asked it is a matter of great moment which you might not care to have any one hear  wonderingly madeline inclined her head the padre gently closed one door and then the others  senora i have come to disclose a secretmy own sinfulness in keeping itand to implore your pardon do you remember that night senor stewart dragged me before you in the waitingroom at el cajon  yes replied madeline  senora since that night you have been senor stewarts wife  madeline became as motionless as stone she seemed to feel nothing only to hear  you are senor stewarts wife i have kept the secret under fear of death but i could keep it no longer senor stewart may kill me now ah senora it is very strange to you you were so frightened that night you knew not what happened senor stewart threatened me he forced you he made me speak the service he made you speak the spanish yes and i senora knowing the deeds of these sinful cowboys fearing worse than disgrace to one so beautiful and so good as you i could not do less than marry you truly at least you should be his wife so i married you truly in the service of my church  my god cried madeline rising  hear me i implore you senora hear me out do not leave me do not look sosoah senora let me speak a word for senor stewart he was drunk that night he did not know what he was about in the morning he came to me made me swear by my cross that i would not reveal the disgrace he had put upon you if i did he would kill me life is nothing to the american vaquero senora i promised to respect his command but i did not tell him you were his wife he did not dream i had truly married you he went to fight for the freedom of my countrysenora he is one splendid soldierand i brooded over the sin of my secret if he were killed i need never tell you but if he lived i knew that i must some day  strange indeed that senor stewart and padre marcos should both come to this ranch together the great change your goodness wrought in my beloved people was no greater than the change in senor stewart senora i feared you would go away one day go back to your eastern home ignorant of the truth the time came when i confessed to stewartsaid i must tell you senor the man went mad with joy i have never seen so supreme a joy he threatened no more to kill me that strong cruel vaquero begged me not to tell the secretnever to reveal it he confessed his love for youa love something like the desert storm he swore by all that was once sacred to him and by my cross and my church that he would be a good man that he would be worthy to have you secretly his wife for the little time life left him to worship at your shrine you needed never to know so i held my tongue half pitying him half fearing him and praying for some godsent light  senora it was a fools paradise that stewart lived in i saw him often when he took me up into the mountains to have me marry that wayward bonita and her lover i came to have respect for a man whose ideas about nature and life and god were at a variance with mine but the man is a worshiper of god in all material things he is a part of the wind and sun and desert and mountain that have made him i have never heard more beautiful words than those in which he persuaded bonita to accept senor mains to forget her old lovers and henceforth to be happy he is their friend i wish i could tell you what that means it sounds so simple it is really simple all great things are so for senor stewart it was natural to be loyal to his friend to have a fine sense of the honor due to a woman who had loved and given to bring about their marriage to succor them in their need and loneliness it was natural for him never to speak of them it would have been natural for him to give his life in their defense if peril menaced them senora i want you to understand that to me the man has the same stability the same strength the same elements which i am in the habit of attributing to the physical life around me in this wild and rugged desert  madeline listened as one under a spell it was not only that this softvoiced eloquent priest knew how to move the heart stir the soul but his defense his praise of stewart if they had been couched in the crude speech of cowboys would have been a glory to her  senora i pray you do not misunderstand my mission beyond my confession to you i have only a duty to tell you of the man whose wife you are but i am a priest and i can read the soul the ways of god are inscrutable i am only a humble instrument you are a noble woman and senor stewart is a man of desert iron forged anew in the crucible of love quien sabe senor stewart swore he would kill me if i betrayed him but he will not lift his hand against me for the man bears you a very great and pure love and it has changed him i no longer fear his threat but i do fear his anger should he ever know i spoke of his love of his fools paradise i have watched his dark face turned to the sun setting over the desert i have watched him lift it to the light of the stars think my gracious and noble lady think what is his paradise to love you above the spirit of the flesh to know you are his wife his never to be anothers except by his sacrifice to watch you with a secret glory of joy and pride to stand while he might between you and evil to find his happiness in service to wait with never a dream of telling you for the hour to come when to leave you free he must go out and get himself shot senora that is beautiful it is sublime it is terrible it has brought me to you with my confession i repeat senora the ways of god are inscrutable what is the meaning of your influence upon senor stewart once he was merely an animal brutal unquickened now he is a mani have not seen his like so i beseech you in my humble office as priest as a lover of mankind before you send stewart to his death to be sure there is here no mysterious dispensation of god love that mighty and blessed and unknown thing might be at work senora i have heard that somewhere in the rich eastern cities you are a very great lady i know you are good and noble that is all i want to know to me you are only a woman the same as senor stewart is only a man so i pray you senora before you let stewart give you freedom at such cost be sure you do not want his love lest you cast away something sweet and ennobling which you yourself have created     xxiii the light of western stars  blinded like a wild creature madeline hammond ran to her room she felt as if a stroke of lightning had shattered the shadowy substance of the dream she had made of real life the wonder of danny mainss story the strange regret with which she had realized her injustice to stewart the astounding secret as revealed by padre marcosthese were forgotten in the sudden consciousness of her own love  madeline fled as if pursued with trembling hands she locked the doors drew the blinds of the windows that opened on the porch pushed chairs aside so that she could pace the length of her room she was now alone and she walked with soft hurried uneven steps she could be herself here she needed no mask the long habit of serenely hiding the truth from the world and from herself could be broken the seclusion of her darkened chamber made possible that betrayal of herself to which she was impelled  she paused in her swift pacing to and fro she liberated the thought that knocked at the gates of her mind with quivering lips she whispered it then she spoke aloud  i will say ithear it ii love him  i love him she repeated the astounding truth but she doubted her identity  am i still madeline hammond what has happened who am i she stood where the light from one unclosed window fell upon her image in the mirror who is this woman  she expected to see a familiar dignified person a quiet unruffled figure a tranquil face with dark proud eyes and calm proud lips no she did not see madeline hammond she did not see any one she knew were her eyes like her heart playing her false the figure before her was instinct with pulsating life the hands she saw clasped together pressed deep into a swelling bosom that heaved with each panting breath the face she sawwhite rapt strangely glowing with parted quivering lips with great staring tragic eyesthis could not be madeline hammonds face  yet as she looked she knew no fancy could really deceive her that she was only madeline hammond come at last to the end of brooding dreams she swiftly realized the change in her divined its cause and meaning accepted it as inevitable and straightway fell back again into the mood of bewildering amaze  calmness was unattainable the surprise absorbed her she could not go back to count the innumerable imperceptible steps of her undoing her old power of reflecting analyzing even thinking at all seemed to have vanished in a pulsestirring sense of one new emotion she only felt all her instinctive outward action that was a physical relief all her involuntary inner strife that was maddening yet unutterably sweet and they seemed to be just one bewildering effect of surprise  in a nature like hers where strength of feeling had long been inhibited as a matter of training such a transforming surprise as sudden consciousness of passionate love required time for its awakening time for its sway  by and by that last enlightening moment came and madeline hammond faced not only the love in her heart but the thought of the man she loved  suddenly as she raged something in herthis dauntless new personalitytook arms against indictment of gene stewart her mind whirled about him and his life she saw him drunk brutal she saw him abandoned lost then out of the picture she had of him thus slowly grew one of a different manweak sick changed by shock growing strong strangely spiritually altered silent lonely like an eagle secretive tireless faithful soft as a woman hard as iron to endure and at the last noble  she softened in a flash her complex mood changed to one wherein she thought of the truth the beauty the wonder of stewarts uplifting humbly she trusted that she had helped him to climb that influence had been the best she had ever exerted it had wrought magic in her own character by it she had reached some higher nobler plane of trust in man she had received infinitely more than she had given  her swiftly flying memory seemed to assort a vast mine of treasures of the past of that letter stewart had written to her brother she saw vivid words but ah she had known and if it had not made any difference then now it made all in the world she recalled how her loosened hair had blown across his lips that night he had ridden down from the mountains carrying her in his arms she recalled the strange joy of pride in stewarts eyes when he had suddenly come upon her dressed to receive her eastern guests in the white gown with the red roses at her breast  swiftly as they had come these dreamful memories departed there was to be no rest for her mind all she had thought and felt seemed only to presage a tumult  heedless desperate she cast off the last remnant of selfcontrol turned from the old proud pale cold selfcontained ghost of herself to face this strange strong passionate woman then with hands pressed to her beating heart with eyes shut she listened to the ringing triphammer voice of circumstance of truth of fatality the whole story was revealed simple enough in the sum of its complicated details strange and beautiful in part remorseless in its proof of great love on stewarts side in dreaming blindness on her own and from the first fatal moment to the last prophetic of tragedy  madeline like a prisoner in a cell began again to pace to and fro  oh it is all terrible she cried i am his wife his wife that meeting with himthe marriagethen his fall his love his rise his silence his pride and i can never be anything to him could i be anything to him i madeline hammond but i am his wife and i love him his wife i am the wife of a cowboy that might be undone can my love be undone ah do i want anything undone he is gone gone could he have meanti will not dare not think of that he will come back no he never will come back oh what shall i do              for madeline hammond the days following that storm of feeling were leadenfooted endless hopelessa long succession of weary hours sleepless hours passionate hours all haunted by a fear slowly growing into torture a fear that stewart had crossed the border to invite the bullet which would give her freedom the day came when she knew this to be true the spiritual tidings reached her not subtly as so many divinations had come but in a clear vital flash of certainty then she suffered she burned inwardly and the nature of that deep fire showed through her eyes she kept to herself waiting waiting for her fears to be confirmed  at times she broke out in wrath at the circumstances she had failed to control at herself at stewart  he might have learned from ambrose she exclaimed sick with a bitterness she knew was not consistent with her pride she recalled christines trenchant exposition of ambroses wooing he tell me he love me he kees me he hug me he put me on his horse he ride away with me he marry me  then in the next breath madeline denied this insistent clamoring of a love that was gradually breaking her spirit like a somber shadow remorse followed her shading blacker she had been blind to a mans honesty manliness uprightness faith and striving she had been dead to love to nobility that she had herself created padre marcoss grave wise words returned to haunt her she fought her bitterness scorned her intelligence hated her pride and weakening gave up more and more to a yearning hopeless hope  she had shunned the light of the stars as she had violently dismissed every hinting suggestive memory of stewarts kisses but one night she went deliberately to her window there they shone her stars beautiful passionless as always but strangely closer warmer speaking a kinder language helpful as they had never been teaching her now that regret was futile revealing to her in their one grand blazing task the supreme duty of lifeto be true  those shining stars made her yield she whispered to them that they had claimed herthe west claimed herstewart claimed her forever whether he lived or died she gave up to her love and it was as if he was there in person darkfaced fireeyed violent in his action crushing her to his breast in that farewell moment kissing her with one burning kiss of passion then with cold terrible lips of renunciation  i am your wife she whispered to him in that moment throbbing exalted quivering in her first sweet tumultuous surrender to love she would have given her all her life to be in his arms again to meet his lips to put forever out of his power any thought of wild sacrifice              and on the morning of the next day when madeline went out upon the porch stillwell haggard and stern with a husky incoherent word handed her a message from el cajon she read   el capitan stewart captured by rebel soldiers in fight at agua prieta yesterday he was a sharpshooter in the federal ranks sentenced to death thursday at sunset     xxiv the ride  stillwell  madelines cry was more than the utterance of a breaking heart it was full of agony but also it uttered the shattering of a structure built of false pride of old beliefs of bloodless standards of ignorance of self it betrayed the final conquest of her doubts and out of their darkness blazed the unquenchable spirit of a woman who had found herself her love her salvation her duty to a man and who would not be cheated  the old cattleman stood mute before her staring at her white face at her eyes of flame  stillwell i am stewarts wife  my gawd miss majesty he burst out i knowed somethin turrible was wrong aw sure its a pity  do you think ill let him be shot when i know him now when im no longer blind when i love him she asked with passionate swiftness i will save him this is wednesday morning i have thirtysix hours to save his life stillwell send for link and the car  she went into her office her mind worked with extraordinary rapidity and clearness her plan born in one lightninglike flash of thought necessitated the careful wording of telegrams to washington to new york to san antonio these were to senators representatives men high in public and private life men who would remember her and who would serve her to their utmost never before had her position meant anything to her comparable with what it meant now never in all her life had money seemed the power that it was then if she had been poor a shuddering chill froze the thought at its inception she dispelled heartbreaking thoughts she had power she had wealth she would set into operation all the unlimited means these gave herthe wires and pulleys and strings underneath the surface of political and international life the open free purchasing value of money or the deep underground mysterious incalculably powerful influence moved by gold she could save stewart she must await resultsdeadlocked in feeling strained perhaps almost beyond endurance because the suspense would be great but she would allow no possibility of failure to enter her mind  when she went outside the car was there with link helmet in hand a cool bright gleam in his eyes and with stillwell losing his haggard misery beginning to respond to madelines spirit  link drive stillwell to el cajon in time for him to catch the el paso train she said wait there for his return and if any message comes from him telephone it at once to me  then she gave stillwell the telegrams to send from el cajon and drafts to cash in el paso she instructed him to go before the rebel junta then stationed at juarez to explain the situation to bid them expect communications from washington officials requesting and advising stewarts exchange as a prisoner of war to offer to buy his release from the rebel authorities  when stillwell had heard her through his huge bowed form straightened a ghost of his old smile just moved his lips he was no longer young and hope could not at once drive away stern and grim realities as he bent over her hand his manner appeared courtly and reverent but either he was speechless or felt the moment not one for him to break silence  he climbed to a seat beside link who pocketed the watch he had been studying and leaned over the wheel there was a crack a muffled sound bursting into a roar and the big car jerked forward to bound over the edge of the slope to leap down the long incline to shoot out upon the level valley floor and disappear in moving dust  for the first time in days madeline visited the gardens the corrals the lakes the quarters of the cowboys though imagining she was calm she feared she looked strange to nels to nick to frankie slade to those boys best known to her the situation for them must have been one of tormenting pain and bewilderment they acted as if they wanted to say something to her but found themselves spellbound she wondereddid they know she was stewarts wife stillwell had not had time to tell them besides he would not have mentioned the fact these cowboys only knew that stewart was sentenced to be shot they knew if madeline had not been angry with him he would not have gone in desperate fighting mood across the border she spoke of the weather of the horses and cattle asked nels when he was to go on duty and turned away from the wide sunlit adobearched porch where the cowboys stood silent and bareheaded then one of her subtle impulses checked her  nels you and nick need not go on duty today she said i may want you ii  she hesitated paused and stood lingering there her glance had fallen upon stewarts big black horse prancing in a nearby corral  i have sent stillwell to el paso she went on in a low voice she failed to hold steady he will save stewart i have to tell youi am stewarts wife  she felt the stricken amaze that made these men silent and immovable with level gaze averted she left them returning to the house and her room she prepared for somethingfor what to wait  then a great invisible shadow seemed to hover behind her she essayed many tasks to fail of attention to find that her mind held only stewart and his fortunes why had he become a federal she reflected that he had won his title el capitan fighting for madero the rebel but madero was now a federal and stewart was true to him in crossing the border had stewart any other motive than the one he had implied to madeline in his mocking smile and scornful words you might have saved me a hell of a lot of trouble what trouble she felt again the cold shock of contact with the gun she had dropped in horror he meant the trouble of getting himself shot in the only way a man could seek death without cowardice but had he any other motive she recalled don carlos and his guerrillas then the thought leaped up in her mind with gripping power that stewart meant to hunt don carlos to meet him to kill him it would be the deed of a silent vengeful implacable man driven by wild justice such as had been the deadly leaven in monty price it was a deed to expect of nels or nick steeland aye of gene stewart madeline felt regret that stewart as he had climbed so high had not risen above deliberate seeking to kill his enemy however evil that enemy  the local newspapers which came regularly a day late from el paso and douglas had never won any particular interest from madeline now however she took up any copies she could find and read all the information pertaining to the revolution every word seemed vital to her of moving significant force   americans robbed by mexican rebels  madera state of

pearson madera and other localities outside the mormon settlements refugees from mexico continued to pour into el paso about one hundred came last night the majority of whom were men heretofore few men came   madeline read on in feverish absorption it was not a real war but a starving robbing burning hopeless revolution five men executed for alleged offenses of a trivial nature what chance had then a federal prisoner an enemy to be feared an american cowboy in the clutches of those crazed rebels  madeline endured patiently endured for long interminable hours while holding to her hope with indomitable will  no message came at sunset she went outdoors suffering a torment of accumulating suspense she faced the desert hoping praying for strength the desert did not influence her as did the passionless unchangeable stars that had soothed her spirit it was red mutable shrouded in shadows terrible like her mood a dustveiled sunset colored the vast brooding naked waste of rock and sand the grim chiricahua frowned black and sinister the dim blue domes of the guadalupes seemed to whisper to beckon to her beyond them somewhere was stewart awaiting the end of a few brief hourshours that to her were boundless endless insupportable  night fell but now the white pitiless stars failed her then she sought the seclusion and darkness of her room there to lie with wide eyes waiting waiting she had always been susceptible to the somber mystic unrealities of the night and now her mind slowly revolved round a vague and monstrous gloom nevertheless she was acutely sensitive to outside impressions she heard the measured tread of a guard the rustle of wind stirring the windowcurtain the remote mournful wail of a coyote by and by the dead silence of the night insulated her with leaden oppression there was silent darkness for so long that when the window casements showed gray she believed it was only fancy and that dawn would never come she prayed for the sun not to rise not to begin its short twelvehour journey toward what might be a fatal setting for stewart but the dawn did lighten swiftly she thought remorselessly daylight had broken and this was thursday  sharp ringing of the telephone bell startled her roused her into action she ran to answer the call  hellohellomiss majesty came the hurried reply this is link talkin messages for you favorable the operator said im to ride out with them ill come ahummin  that was all madeline heard the bang of the receiver as stevens threw it down she passionately wanted to know more but was immeasurably grateful for so much favorable then stillwell had been successful her heart leaped suddenly she became weak and her hands failed of their accustomed morning deftness it took her what seemed a thousand years to dress breakfast meant nothing to her except that it helped her to pass dragging minutes  finally a low hum mounting swiftly to a roar and ending with a sharp report announced the arrival of the car if her feet had kept pace with her heart she would have raced out to meet link she saw him helmet thrown back watch in hand and he looked up at her with his cool bright smile with his familiar apologetic manner  fiftythree minutes miss majesty he said but i hed to ride round a herd of steers an bump a couple off the trail  he gave her a packet of telegrams madeline tore them open with shaking fingers began to read with swift dim eyes some were from washington assuring her of every possible service some were from new york others written in spanish were from el paso and these she could not wholly translate in a brief glance would she never find stillwells message it was the last it was lengthy it read   bought stewarts release also arranged for his transfer as prisoner of war both matters official hes safe if we can get notice to his captors not sure ive reached them by wire afraid to trust it you go with link to agua prieta take the messages sent you in spanish they will protect you and secure stewarts freedom take nels with you stop for nothing tell link alltrust himlet him drive that car  stillwell              the first few lines of stillwells message lifted madeline to the heights of thanksgiving and happiness then reading on she experienced a check a numb icy sickening pang at the last line she flung off doubt and dread and in white cold passion faced the issue  read she said briefly handing the telegram to link he scanned it and then looked blankly up at her  link do you know the roads the trailsthe desert between here and agua prieta she asked  thets sure my old stampinground an i know sonora too  we must reach agua prieta before sunsetlong before so if stewart is in some nearby camp we can get to it inin time  miss majesty it aint possible he exclaimed stillwells crazy to say thet  link can an automobile be driven from here into northern mexico  sure but it d take time  we must do it in little time she went on in swift eagerness otherwise stewart may beprobably will bebe shot  link stevens appeared suddenly to grow lax shriveled to lose all his peculiar pert brightness to weaken and age  im only aa cowboy miss majesty he almost faltered it was a singular change in him thets an awful ridedown over the border if by some luck i didnt smash the car id turn your hair gray youd never be no good after thet ride  i am stewarts wife she answered him and she looked at him not conscious of any motive to persuade or allure but just to let him know the greatness of her dependence upon him  he started violentlythe old action of stewart the memorable action of monty price this man was of the same wild breed  then madelines words flowed in a torrent i am stewarts wife i love him i have been unjust to him i must save him link i have faith in you i beseech you to do your best for stewarts sakefor my sake ill risk the ride gladlybravely ill not care where or how you drive id far rather plunge into a canyongo to my death on the rocksthan not try to save stewart  how beautiful the response of this rude cowboyto realize his absolute unconsciousness of self to see the haggard shade burn out of his face the old cool devilmaycare spirit return to his eyes and to feel something wonderful about him then it was more than will or daring or sacrifice a bloodtie might have existed between him and madeline she sensed again that indefinable brotherlike quality so fine so almost invisible which seemed to be an inalienable trait in these wild cowboys  miss majesty thet ride figgers impossible but ill do it he replied his cool bright glance thrilled her ill need mebbe half an hour to go over the car an to pack on what ill want  she could not thank him and her reply was merely a request that he tell nels and other cowboys off duty to come up to the house when link had gone madeline gave a moments thought to preparations for the ride she placed what money she had and the telegrams in a satchel the gown she had on was thin and white not suitable for travel but she would not risk the losing of one moment in changing it she put on a long coat and wound veils round her head and neck arranging them in a hood so she could cover her face when necessary she remembered to take an extra pair of goggles for nelss use and then drawing on her gloves she went out ready for the ride  a number of cowboys were waiting she explained the situation and left them in charge of her home with that she asked nels to accompany her down into the desert he turned white to his lips and this occasioned madeline to remember his mortal dread of the car and links driving  nels im sorry to ask you she added i know you hate the car but i need youmay need you oh so much  why miss majesty thets shore all a mistaken idee of yours about me hatin the car he said in his slow soft drawl i was only jealous of link an the boys they made thet joke up on me about bein scared of ridin fast shore im powerful proud to go an i reckon if you hednt asked me my feelins might hev been some hurt because if youre goin down among the greasers you want me  his cool easy speech his familiar swagger the smile with which he regarded her did not in the least deceive madeline the gray was still in his face incomprehensible as it seemed nels had a dread an uncanny fear and it was of that huge white automobile but he lied about it here again was that strange quality of faithfulness  madeline heard the buzz of the car link appeared driving up the slope he made a short sliding turn and stopped before the porch link had tied two long heavy planks upon the car one on each side and in every available space he had strapped extra tires a huge cask occupied one back seat and another seat was full of tools and ropes there was just room in this rear part of the car for nels to squeeze in link put madeline in front beside him then bent over the wheel madeline waved her hand at the silent cowboys on the porch not an audible goodby was spoken  the car glided out of the yard leaped from level to slope and started swiftly down the road out into the open valley each stronger rush of dry wind in madelines face marked the increase of speed she took one glance at the winding cattleroad smooth unobstructed disappearing in the gray of distance she took another at the leathergarbed leatherhelmeted driver beside her and then she drew the hood of veils over her face and fastened it round her neck so there was no possibility of its blowing loose  harder and stronger pressed the wind till it was like sheeted lead forcing her back in her seat there was a ceaseless intense inconceivably rapid vibration under her occasionally she felt a long swing as if she were to be propelled aloft but no jars disturbed the easy celerity of the car the buzz the roar of wheels of heavy body in flight increased to a continuous droning hum the wind became an insupportable body moving toward her crushing her breast making the task of breathing most difficult to madeline the time seemed to fly with the speed of miles a moment came when she detected a faint difference in hum and rush and vibration in the ceaseless sweeping of the invisible weight against her this difference became marked link was reducing speed then came swift change of all sensation and she realized the car had slowed to normal travel  madeline removed her hood and goggles it was a relief to breathe freely to be able to use her eyes to her right not far distant lay the little town of chiricahua sight of it made her remember stewart in a way strange to her constant thought of him to the left inclined the gray valley the red desert was hidden from view but the guadalupe mountains loomed close in the southwest  opposite chiricahua where the road forked link stevens headed the car straight south and gradually increased speed madeline faced another endless gray incline it was the san bernardino valley the singing of the car the stinging of the wind warned her to draw the hood securely down over her face again and then it was as if she was riding at night the car lurched ahead settled into that driving speed which wedged madeline back as in a vise again the moments went by fleet as the miles seemingly there was an acceleration of the car till it reached a certain swiftnessa period of time in which it held that pace and then a diminishing of all motion and sound which contributed to madelines acute sensation uncovering her face she saw link was passing another village could it be bernardino she asked linkrepeated the question  sure he replied eighty miles  link did not this time apologize for the work of his machine madeline marked the omission with her first thrill of the ride leaning over she glanced at links watch which he had fastened upon the wheel in front of his eyes a quarter to ten link had indeed made short work of the valley miles  beyond bernardino link sheered off the road and put the car to a long lowrising slope here the valley appeared to run south under the dark brows of the guadalupes link was heading southwest madeline observed that the grass began to fail as they climbed the ridge bare white dusty spots appeared there were patches of mesquite and cactus and scattering areas of broken rock  she might have been prepared for what she saw from the ridgetop beneath them the desert blazed seen from afar it was striking enough but riding down into its red jaws gave madeline the first affront to her imperious confidence all about her ranch had been desert the valleys were desert but this was different here began the red desert extending far into mexico far across arizona and california to the pacific she saw a bare hummocky ridge down which the car was gliding bounding swinging and this long slant seemed to merge into a corrugated world of rock and sand patched by flats and basins streaked with canyons and ranges of ragged sawtoothed stone the distant sierra madres were clearer bluer less smoky and suggestive of mirage than she had ever seen them madelines sustaining faith upheld her in the face of this appalling obstacle then the desert that had rolled its immensity beneath her gradually began to rise to lose its distant margins to condense its varying lights and shades at last to hide its yawning depths and looming heights behind red ridges which were only little steps little outposts little landmarks at its gates  the bouncing of the huge car throwing madeline up directed her attention and fastened it upon the way link stevens was driving and upon the immediate foreground then she discovered that he was following an old wagonroad at the foot of that long slope they struck into rougher ground and here link took to a cautious zigzag course the wagonroad disappeared and then presently reappeared but link did not always hold to it he made cuts detours crosses and all the time seemed to be getting deeper into a maze of low red dunes of flat canyonbeds lined by banks of gravel of ridges mounting higher yet link stevens kept on and never turned back he never headed into a place that he could not pass up to this point of travel he had not been compelled to back the car and madeline began to realize that it was the cowboys wonderful judgment of ground that made advance possible he knew the country he was never at a loss after making a choice of direction he never hesitated  then at the bottom of a wide canyon he entered a wash where the wheels just barely turned in dragging sand the sun beat down whitehot the dust arose there was not a breath of wind and no sound save the slide of a rock now and then down the weathered slopes and the labored chugging of the machine the snail pace like the sand at the wheels began to drag at madelines faith link gave over the wheel to madeline and leaping out he called nels when they untied the long planks and laid them straight in front for the wheels to pass over madeline saw how wise had been links forethought with the aid of those planks they worked the car through sand and gravel otherwise impossible to pass  this canyon widened and opened into space affording an unobstructed view for miles the desert sloped up in steps and in the morning light with the sun bright on the mesas and escarpments it was gray drab stone slate yellow pink and dominating all a dull rustred there was level ground ahead a windswept floor as hard as rock link rushed the car over this free distance madelines ears filled with a droning hum like the sound of a monstrous hungry bee and with a strange incessant crinkle which she at length guessed to be the spreading of sheets of gravel from under the wheels the giant car attained such a speed that madeline could only distinguish the colored landmarks to the fore and these faded as the wind stung her eyes  then link began the ascent of the first step a long sweeping barren waste with dunes of wonderful violet and heliotrope hues here were welldefined marks of an old wagonroad lately traversed by cattle the car climbed steadily surmounted the height faced another long bench that had been cleaned smooth by desert winds the sky was an intense light steely blue hard on the eyes madeline veiled her face and did not uncover it until link had reduced the racing speed from the summit of the next ridge she saw more red ruin of desert  a deep wash crossing the road caused link stevens to turn due south there was a narrow space along the wash just wide enough for the car link seemed oblivious to the fact that the outside wheels were perilously close to the edge madeline heard the rattle of loosened gravel and earth sliding into the gully the wash widened and opened out into a sandy flat link crossed this and turned up on the opposite side rocks impeded the progress of the car and these had to be rolled out of the way the shelves of silt apparently ready to slide with the slightest weight the little tributary washes the boulderstrewn stretches of slope the narrow spaces allowing no more than a foot for the outside wheels the spearpointed cactus that had to be avoidedall these obstacles were as nothing to the cowboy driver he kept on and when he came to the road again he made up for the lost time by speed  another height was reached and here madeline fancied that link had driven the car to the summit of a high pass between two mountain ranges the western slope of that pass appeared to be exceedingly rough and broken below it spread out another gray valley at the extreme end of which glistened a white spot that link grimly called douglas part of that white spot was agua prieta the sister town across the line madeline looked with eyes that would fain have pierced the intervening distance  the descent of the pass began under difficulties sharp stones and cactus spikes penetrated the front tires bursting them with ripping reports it took time to replace them the planks were called into requisition to cross soft places a jagged point of projecting rock had to be broken with a sledge at length a huge stone appeared to hinder any further advance madeline caught her breath there was no room to turn the car but link stevens had no intention of such a thing he backed the car to a considerable distance then walked forward he appeared to be busy around the boulder for a moment and returned down the road on the run a heavy explosion a cloud of dust and a rattle of falling fragments told madeline that her indomitable driver had cleared a passage with dynamite he seemed to be prepared for every emergency madeline looked to see what effect the discovery of link carrying dynamite would have upon the silent nels  shore now miss majesty there aint nothin goin to stop link said nels with a reassuring smile the significance of the incident had not dawned upon nels or else he was heedless of it after all he was afraid only of the car and link and that fear was an idiosyncrasy madeline began to see her cowboy driver with clearer eyes and his spirit awoke something in her that made danger of no moment nels likewise subtly responded and though he was grayfaced tightlipped his eyes took on the cool bright gleam of links  cactus barred the way rocks barred the way gullies barred the way and these nels addressed in the grim humor with which he was wont to view tragic things a mistake on links part a slip of a wheel a bursting of a tire at a critical moment an instant of the bad luck which might happen a hundred times on a less perilous rideany one of these might spell disaster for the car perhaps death to the occupants again and again link used the planks to cross washes in sand sometimes the wheels ran all the length of the planks sometimes slipped off presently link came to a ditch where water had worn deep into the road without hesitation he placed them measuring distance carefully and then started across the danger was in ditching the machine one of the planks split sagged a little but link made the crossing without a slip  the road led round under an overhanging cliff and was narrow rocky and slightly downhill bidding madeline and nels walk round this hazardous corner link drove the car madeline expected to hear it crash down into the canyon but presently she saw link waiting to take them aboard again then came steeper parts of the road places that link could run down if he had space below to control the car and on the other hand places where the little inclines ended in abrupt ledges upon one side or a declivity upon the other here the cowboy with ropes on the wheels and halfhitches upon the spurs of rock let the car slide down  once at a particularly bad spot madeline exclaimed involuntarily oh time is flying link stevens looked up at her as if he had been reproved for his care his eyes shone like the glint of steel on ice perhaps that utterance of madelines was needed to liberate his recklessness to its utmost certainly he put the car to seemingly impossible feats he rimmed gullies he hurdled rising ground he leaped little breaks in the even road he made his machine cling like a goat to steep inclines he rounded corners with the inside wheels higher than the outside he passed over banks of soft earth that caved in the instant he crossed weak places he kept on and on threading tortuous passages through rockstrewn patches keeping to the old road where it was clear abandoning it for open spaces and always going down  at length a mile of clean brown slope ridged and grooved like a washboard led gently down to meet the floor of the valley where the scant gramagrass struggled to give a tinge of gray the road appeared to become more clearly defined and could be seen striking straight across the valley  to madelines dismay that road led down to a deep narrow wash it plunged on one side ascended on the other at a still steeper angle the crossing would have been laborsome for a horse for an automobile it was unpassable link turned the car to the right along the rim and drove as far along the wash as the ground permitted the gully widened deepened all the way then he took the other direction when he made this turn madeline observed that the sun had perceptibly begun its slant westward it shone in her face glaring and wrathful link drove back to the road crossed it and kept on down the line of the wash it was a deep cut in red earth worn straight down by swift water in the rainy seasons it narrowed in some places it was only five feet wide link studied these points and looked up the slope and seemed to be making deductions the valley was level now and there were nothing but little breaks in the rim of the wash link drove mile after mile looking for a place to cross and there was none finally progress to the south was obstructed by impassable gullies where the wash plunged into the head of a canyon it was necessary to back the car a distance before there was room to turn madeline looked at the imperturbable driver his face revealed no more than the same old hard immutable character when he reached the narrowest points which had so interested him he got out of the car and walked from place to place once with a little jump he cleared the wash then madeline noted that the farther rim was somewhat lower in a flash she divined links intention he was hunting a place to jump the car over the crack in the ground  soon he found one that seemed to suit him for he tied his red scarf upon a greasewoodbush then returning to the car he clambered in and muttering broke his long silence this aint no airship but ive outfiggered thet damn wash he backed up the gentle slope and halted just short of steeper ground his red scarf waved in the wind hunching low over the wheel he started slowly at first then faster and then faster the great car gave a spring like a huge tiger the impact of suddenly formed wind almost tore madeline out of her seat she felt nelss powerful hands on her shoulders she closed her eyes the jolting headway of the car gave place to a gliding rush this was broken by a slight jar and then above the hum and roar rose a cowboy yell madeline waited with strained nerves for the expected crash it did not come opening her eyes she saw the level valley floor without a break she had not even noticed the instant when the car had shot over the wash  a strange breathlessness attacked her and she attributed it to the celerity with which she was being carried along pulling the hood down over her face she sank low in the seat the whir of the car now seemed to be a worldfilling sound again the feeling of excitement the poignancy of emotional heights the everpresent impending sense of catastrophe became held in abeyance to the sheer intensity of physical sensations there came a time when all her strength seemed to unite in an effort to lift her breast against the terrific force of the windto draw air into her flattened lungs she became partly dazed the darkness before her eyes was not all occasioned by the blood that pressed like a stone mask on her face she had a sense that she was floating sailing drifting reeling even while being borne swiftly as a thunderbolt her hands and arms were immovable under the weight of mountains there was a long blank period from which she awakened to feel an arm supporting her then she rallied the velocity of the car had been cut to the speed to which she was accustomed throwing back the hood she breathed freely again recovered fully  the car was bowling along a wide road upon the outskirts of a city madeline asked what place it could be  douglas replied link an jest around is agua prieta  that last name seemed to stun madeline she heard no more and saw little until the car stopped nels spoke to some one then sight of khakiclad soldiers quickened madelines faculties she was on the boundaryline between the united states and mexico and agua prieta with its white and blue walled houses its browntiled roofs lay before her a soldier evidently despatched by nels returned and said an officer would come at once madelines attention was centered in the foreground upon the guard over the road upon the dry dusty town beyond but she was aware of noise and people in the rear a cavalry officer approached the car stared and removed his sombrero  can you tell me anything about stewart the american cowboy who was captured by rebels a few days ago asked madeline  yes replied the officer there was a skirmish over the line between a company of federals and a large force of guerrillas and rebels the federals were driven west along the line stewart is reported to have done reckless fighting and was captured he got a mexican sentence he is known here along the border and the news of his capture stirred up excitement we did all we could to get his release the guerrillas feared to execute him here and believed he might be aided to escape so a detachment departed with him for mezquital  he was sentenced to be shot thursday at sunsettonight  yes it was rumored there was a personal resentment against stewart i regret that i cant give you definite information if you are friends of stewartrelativesi might find  i am his wife interrupted madeline will you please read these she handed him the telegrams advise mehelp me if you can  with a wondering glance at her the officer received the telegrams he read several and whistled low in amaze his manner became quick alert serious  i cant read these written in spanish but i know the names signed swiftly he ran through the others  why these mean stewarts release has been authorized they explain mysterious rumors we have heard here greaser treachery for some strange reason messages from the rebel junta have failed to reach their destination we heard reports of an exchange for stewart but nothing came of it no one departed for mezquital with authority what an outrage come ill go with you to general salazar the rebel chief in command i know him perhaps we can find out something  nels made room for the officer link sent the car whirring across the line into mexican territory madelines sensibilities were now exquisitely alive the white road led into agua prieta a town of colored walls and roofs goats and pigs and buzzards scattered before the roar of the machine native women wearing black mantles peeped through ironbarred windows men wearing huge sombreros cotton shirts and trousers bright sashes round their waists and sandals stood motionless watching the car go by the road ended in an immense plaza in the center of which was a circular structure that in some measure resembled a corral it was a bullring where the national sport of bullfighting was carried on just now it appeared to be quarters for a considerable army ragged unkempt rebels were everywhere and the whole square was littered with tents packs wagons arms there were horses mules burros and oxen  the place was so crowded that link was compelled to drive slowly up to the entrance to the bullring madeline caught a glimpse of tents inside then her view was obstructed by a curious pressing throng the cavalry officer leaped from the car and pushed his way into the entrance  link do you know the road to this mezquital asked madeline  yes ive been there  how far is it  aw not so very far he mumbled  link how many miles she implored  i reckon only a few  madeline knew that he lied she asked him no more nor looked at him nor at nels how stifling was this crowded illsmelling plaza the sun red and lowering had sloped far down in the west but still burned with furnace heat a swarm of flies whirled over the car the shadows of lowsailing buzzards crossed madelines sight then she saw a row of the huge uncanny black birds sitting upon the tiled roof of a house they had neither an air of sleeping nor resting they were waiting she fought off a horrible ghastly idea before its full realization these rebels and guerrillaswhat lean yellow bearded wretches they curiously watched link as he went working over the car no two were alike and all were ragged they had glittering eyes sunk deep in their heads they wore huge sombreros of brown and black felt of straw of cloth every man wore a belt or sash into which was thrust some kind of weapon some wore boots some shoes some moccasins some sandals and many were barefooted they were an excited jabbering gesticulating mob madeline shuddered to think how a frenzy to spill blood could run through these poor revolutionists if it was liberty they fought for they did not show the intelligence in their faces they were like wolves upon a scent they affronted her shocked her she wondered if their officers were men of the same class what struck her at last and stirred pity in her was the fact that every man of the horde her swift glance roamed over however dirty and bedraggled he was wore upon him some ornament some tassel or fringe or lace some ensign some band bracelet badge or belt some twist of scarf something that betrayed the vanity which was the poor jewel of their souls it was in the race  suddenly the crowd parted to let the cavalry officer and a rebel of striking presence get to the car  madam it is as i suspected said the officer quickly the messages directing stewarts release never reached salazar they were intercepted but even without them we might have secured stewarts exchange if it had not been for the fact that one of his captors wanted him shot this guerrilla intercepted the orders and then was instrumental in taking stewart to mezquital it is exceedingly sad why he should be a free man this instant i regret  who did thisthis thing cried madeline cold and sick who is the guerrilla  senor don carlos martinez he has been a bandit a man of influence in sonora he is more of a secret agent in the affairs of the revolution than an active participator but he has seen guerrilla service  don carlos stewart in his power o god madeline sank down almost overcome then two great hands powerful thrilling clasped her shoulders and nels bent over her  miss majesty shore were wastin time here he said his voice like his hands was uplifting she wheeled to him in trembling importunity how cold bright blue the flash of his eyes they told madeline she must not weaken but she could not speak her thought to nelscould only look at link  it figgers impossible but ill do it said link stevens in answer to her voiceless query the cold grim wild something about her cowboys blanched madelines face steeled her nerve called to the depths of her for that last supreme courage of a woman the spirit of the moment was nature with link and nels with her it must be passion  can i get a permit to go into the interiorto mezquital asked madeline of the officer  you are going on madam its a forlorn hope mezquital is a hundred miles away but theres a chancethe barest chance if your man can drive this car the mexicans are either murderous or ceremonious in their executions the arrangements for stewarts will be elaborate but barring unusual circumstances it will take place precisely at the hour designated you need no permit your messages are official papers but to save time perhaps delay i suggest you take this mexican senor montes with you he outranks don carlos and knows the captain of the mezquital detachment  ah then don carlos is not in command of the forces holding stewart  no  i thank you sir i shall not forget your kindness concluded madeline  she bowed to senor montes and requested him to enter the car nels stowed some of the paraphernalia away making room in the rear seat link bent over the wheel the start was so sudden with such crack and roar that the crowd split in wild disorder out of the plaza the car ran gathering headway down a street lined by white and blue walls across a square where rebels were building barricades along a railroad track full of iron flatcars that carried mounted pieces of artillery through the outlying guards who waved to the officer montes  madeline bound her glasses tightly over her eyes and wound veils round the lower part of her face she was all in a strange glow she had begun to burn to throb to thrill to expand and she meant to see all that was possible the sullen sun red as fire hung over the mountain range in the west how low it had sunk before her stretched a narrow white road dusty hard as stonea highway that had been used for centuries if it had been wide enough to permit passing a vehicle it would have been a magnificent course for automobiles but the weeds and the dusty flowers and the mesquite boughs and arms of cactus brushed the car as it sped by  faster faster faster that old resistless weight began to press madeline back the old incessant bellow of wind filled her ears link stevens hunched low over the wheel his eyes were hidden under leather helmet and goggles but the lower part of his face was unprotected he resembled a demon so dark and stonehard and strangely grinning was he all at once madeline realized how matchless how wonderful a driver was this cowboy she divined that weakening could not have been possible to link stevens he was a cowboy and he really was riding that car making it answer to his will as it had been born in him to master a horse he had never driven to suit himself had never reached an allsatisfying speed until now beyond that his motive was to save stewartto make madeline happy life was nothing to him that fact gave him the superhuman nerve to face the peril of this ride because of his disregard of self he was able to operate the machine to choose the power the speed the guidance the going with the best judgment and highest efficiency possible madeline knew he would get her to mezquital in time to save stewart or he would kill her in the attempt  the white narrow road flashed out of the foreground slipped with inconceivable rapidity under the car when she marked a clump of cactus far ahead it seemed to shoot at her to speed behind her even the instant she noticed it nevertheless madeline knew link was not putting the car to its limit swiftly as he was flying he held something in reserve but he took the turns of the road as if he knew the way was cleared before him he trusted to a cowboys luck a wagon in one of those curves a herd of cattle even a frightened steer meant a wreck madeline never closed her eyes at these fateful moments if link could stake himself the others and her upon such chance what could not she stake with her motive so while the great car hummed and thrummed and darted round the curves on two wheels and sped on like a bullet madeline lived that ride meant to feel it to the uttermost  but it was not all swift going a stretch of softer ground delayed link made the car labor and pant and pound and grind through gravel moreover the cactus plants assumed an alarming ability to impede progress long slender arms of the ocotillo encroached upon the road broad round leaves did likewise fluted columns fallen like timbers in a forest lay along the narrow margins the bayonet cactus and the bisnagi leaned threateningly clusters of maguey shadowed by the huge looming saguaro infringed upon the highway to mezquital and every leaf and blade and branch of cactus bore wicked thorns any one of which would be fatal to a tire  it came at length the bursting report the car lurched went on like a crippled thing and halted obedient to the master hand at the wheel swift as link was in replacing the tire he lost time the red sun more sullen duskier as it neared the black bold horizon appeared to mock madeline to eye her in derision  link leaped in and the car sprang ahead the roadbed changed the trees changedall the surroundings changed except the cactus there were miles of rolling ridges rough in the hollows and short rocky bits of road and washes to cross and a low sandy swale where mesquites grouped a forest along a trickling inchdeep sheet of water green things softened the hard dry aspect of the desert there were birds and parrots and deer and wild boars all these madeline remarked with clear eyes with remarkable susceptibility of attention but what she strained to see what she yearned for prayed for was straight unobstructed road  but the road began to wind up it turned and twisted in tantalizing lazy curves it was in no hurry to surmount a hill that began to assume proportions of a mountain it was leisurely as were all things in mexico except strife that was quick fierce bloodyit was spanish  the descent from that elevation was difficult extremely hazardous yet link stevens drove fast at the base of the hill rocks and sand all but halted him for good then in taking an abrupt curve a grasping spear ruined another tire this time the car rasped across the road into the cactus bursting the second frontwheel tire like demons indeed link and nels worked shuddering madeline felt the declining heat of the sun saw with gloomy eyes the shading of the red light over the desert she did not look back to see how near the sun was to the horizon she wanted to ask nels strange as anything on this terrible ride was the absence of speech as yet no word had been spoken madeline wanted to shriek to link to hurry but he was more than humanly swift in all his actions so with mute lips with the fire in her beginning to chill with a lifelessness menacing her spirit she watched hoped against hope prayed for a long straight smooth road  quite suddenly she saw it seemingly miles of clear narrow lane disappearing like a thin white streak in distant green perhaps link stevenss heart leaped like madelines the huge car with a roar and a jerk seemed to answer madelines call a cry no less poignant because it was silent  faster faster faster the roar became a whining hum then for madeline sound ceased to be anythingshe could not hear the wind was now heavy imponderable no longer a swift plastic thing but solid like an onrushing wall it bore down upon madeline with such resistless weight that she could not move the green of desert plants along the road merged in two shapeless fences sliding at her from the distance objects ahead began to blur the white road to grow streaky like rays of light the sky to take on more of a reddening haze  madeline realizing her sight was failing her turned for one more look at link stevens it had come to be his ride almost as much as it was hers he hunched lower than ever rigid strained to the last degree a terrible implacable driver this was his hour and he was great if he so much as brushed a flying tire against one of the millions of spikes clutching out striking out from the cactus there would be a shock a splitting wave of airan end madeline thought she saw that links bulging cheek and jaw were gray that his tightshut lips were white that the smile was gone then he really was humannot a demon she felt a strange sense of brotherhood he understood a womans soul as monty price had understood it link was the lightningforged automaton the driving relentless unconquerable instrument of a womans will he was a man whose force was directed by a womans passion he reached up to her height felt her love understood the nature of her agony these made him heroic but it was the hard life the wild years of danger on the desert the companionship of ruthless men the elemental that made possible his physical achievement madeline loved his spirit then and gloried in the man  she had pictured upon her heart never to be forgotten this little hunched deformed figure of links hanging with dauntless with deathless grip over the wheel his gray face like a marble mask  that was madelines last clear sensation upon the ride blinded dazed she succumbed to the demands upon her strength she reeled fell back only vaguely aware of a helping hand confusion seized her senses all about her was a dark chaos through which she was rushing rushing rushing under the wrathful red eye of a setting sun then as there was no more sound or sight for her she felt there was no color but the rush never slackeneda rush through opaque limitless space for moments hours ages she was propelled with the velocity of a shootingstar the earth seemed a huge automobile and it sped with her down an endless white track through the universe looming ghostly ghastly spectral forms of cacti plants large as pinetrees stabbed her with giant spikes she became an unstable being in a shapeless colorless soundless cosmos of unrelated things but always rushing even to meet the darkness that haunted her and never reached her  but at an end of infinite time that rush ceased madeline lost the queer feeling of being disembodied by a frightfully swift careening through boundless distance she distinguished voices low at first apparently far away then she opened her eyes to blurred but conscious sight  the car had come to a stop link was lying face down over the wheel nels was rubbing her hands calling to her she saw a house with clean whitewashed wall and browntiled roof beyond over a dark mountain range peeped the last red curve the last beautiful ray of the setting sun     xxv at the end of the road  madeline saw that the car was surrounded by armed mexicans they presented a contrast to the others she had seen that day she wondered a little at their silence at their respectful front  suddenly a sharp spoken order opened up the ranks next to the house senor montes appeared in the break coming swiftly his dark face wore a smile his manner was courteous important authoritative  senora it is not too late  he spoke her language with an accent strange to her so that it seemed to hinder understanding  senora you got here in time he went on el capitan stewart will be free  free she whispered  she rose reeling  come replied montes taking her arm perdoneme senora  without his assistance she would have fallen wholly upon nels who supported her on the other side they helped her alight from the car for a moment the white walls the hazy red sky the dark figures of the rebels whirled before madelines eyes she took a few steps swaying between her escorts then the confusion of her sight and mind passed away it was as if she quickened with a thousand vivifying currents as if she could see and hear and feel everything in the world as if nothing could be overlooked forgotten neglected  she turned back remembering link he was lurching from the car helmet and goggles thrust back the gray shade gone from his face the cool bright gleam of his eyes disappearing for something warmer  senor montes led madeline and her cowboys through a hall to a patio and on through a large room with flooring of rough bare boards that rattled into a smaller room full of armed quiet rebels facing an open window  madeline scanned the faces of these men expecting to see don carlos but he was not present a soldier addressed her in spanish too swiftly uttered too voluble for her to translate but like senor montes he was gracious and despite his ragged garb and uncouth appearance he bore the unmistakable stamp of authority  montes directed madelines attention to a man by the window a loose scarf of vivid red hung from his hand  senora they were waiting for the sun to set when we arrived said montes the signal was about to be given for senor stewarts walk to death  stewarts walk echoed madeline  ah senora let me tell you his sentencethe sentence i have had the honor and happiness to revoke for you  stewart had been courtmartialed and sentenced according to a mexican custom observed in cases of brave soldiers to whom honorable and fitting executions were due his hour had been set for thursday when the sun had sunk upon signal he was to be liberated and was free to walk out into the road to take any direction he pleased he knew his sentence knew that death awaited him that every possible avenue of escape was blocked by men with rifles ready but he had not the slightest idea at what moment or from what direction the bullets were to come  senora we have sent messengers to every squad of waiting soldiersan order that el capitan is not to be shot he is ignorant of his release i shall give the signal for his freedom  montes was ceremonious gallant emotional madeline saw his pride and divined that the situation was one which brought out the vanity the ostentation as well as the cruelty of his race he would keep her in an agony of suspense let stewart start upon that terrible walk in ignorance of his freedom it was the motive of a spaniard suddenly madeline had a horrible quaking fear that montes lied that he meant her to be a witness of stewarts execution but no the man was honest he was only barbarous he would satisfy certain instincts of his naturesentiment romance crueltyby starting stewart upon that walk by watching stewarts actions in the face of seeming death by seeing madelines agony of doubt fear pity love almost madeline felt that she could not endure the situation she was weak and tottering  senora ah it will be one beautiful thing montes caught the scarf from the rebels hand he was glowing passionate his eyes had a strange soft cold flash his voice was low intense he was living something splendid to him ill wave the scarf senora that will be the signal it will be seen down at the other end of the road senor stewarts jailer will see the signal take off stewarts irons release him open the door for his walk stewart will be free but he will not know he will expect death as he is a brave man he will face it he will walk this way every step of that walk he will expect to be shot from some unknown quarter but he will not be afraid senora i have seen el captain fighting in the field what is death to him ah will it not be magnificent to see him come forthto walk down senora you will see what a man he is all the way he will expect cold swift death here at this end of the road he will meet his beautiful lady  is there nono possibility of a mistake faltered madeline  none my order included unloading of rifles  don carlos  he is in irons and must answer to general salazar replied montes  madeline looked down the deserted road how strange to see the last ruddy glow of the sun over the brow of the mountain range the thought of that sunset had been torture for her yet it had passed and now the afterlights were luminous beautiful prophetic  with a heart stricken by both joy and agony she saw montes wave the scarf  then she waited no change manifested itself down the length of that lonely road there was absolute silence in the room behind her how terribly infinitely long seemed the waiting never in all her future life would she forget the quaint pink blue and white walled houses with their colored roofs that dusty bare road resembled one of the uncovered streets of pompeii with its look of centuries of solitude  suddenly a door opened and a tall man stepped out  madeline recognized stewart she had to place both hands on the windowsill for support while a storm of emotion swayed her like a retreating wave it rushed away stewart lived he was free he had stepped out into the light she had saved him life changed for her in that instant of realization and became sweet full strange  stewart shook hands with some one in the doorway then he looked up and down the road the door closed behind him leisurely he rolled a cigarette stood close to the wall while he scratched a match even at that distance madelines keen eyes caught the small flame the first little puff of smoke  stewart then took to the middle of the road and leisurely began his walk  to madeline he appeared natural walked as unconcernedly as if he were strolling for pleasure but the absence of any other living thing the silence the red haze the surcharged atmospherethese were all unnatural from time to time stewart stopped to turn face forward toward houses and corners only silence greeted these significant moves of his once he halted to roll and light another cigarette after that his step quickened  madeline watched him with pride love pain glory combating for a mastery over her this walk of his seemingly took longer than all her hours of awakening of strife of remorse longer than the ride to find him she felt that it would be impossible for her to wait till he reached the end of the road yet in the hurry and riot of her feelings she had fleeting panics what could she say to him how meet him well she remembered the tall powerful form now growing close enough to distinguish its dress stewarts face was yet only a dark gleam soon she would see itlong before he could know she was there she wanted to run to meet him nevertheless she stood rooted to her covert behind the window living that terrible walk with him to the uttermost thought of home sister mother sweetheart wife life itselfevery thought that could come to a man stalking to meet his executioners with all that tumult in her mind and heart madeline still fell prey to the incomprehensible variations of emotion possible to a woman every step stewart took thrilled her she had some strange subtle intuition that he was not unhappy and that he believed beyond shadow of doubt that he was walking to his death his steps dragged a little though they had begun to be swift the old hard physical wild nerve of the cowboy was perhaps in conflict with spiritual growth of the finer man realizing too late that life ought not to be sacrificed  then the dark gleam that was his face took shape grew sharper and clearer he was stalking now and there was a suggestion of impatience in his stride it took these hidden mexicans a long time to kill him at a point in the middle of the road even with the corner of a house and opposite to madelines position stewart halted stockstill he presented a fair bold mark to his executioners and he stood there motionless a full moment  only silence greeted him plain it was to madeline and she thought to all who had eyes to see that to stewart since for some reason he had been spared all along his walk this was the moment when he ought to be mercifully shot but as no shots came a rugged dignity left him for a reckless scorn manifest in the way he strolled across to the corner of the house rolled yet another cigarette and presenting a broad breast to the window smoked and waited  that wait was almost unendurable for madeline perhaps it was only a moment several moments at the longest but the time seemed a year stewarts face was scornful hard did he suspect treachery on the part of his captors that they meant to play with him as a cat with a mouse to murder him at leisure madeline was sure she caught the old inscrutable mocking smile fleeting across his lips he held that position for what must have been a reasonable time to his mind then with a laugh and a shrug he threw the cigarette into the road he shook his head as if at the incomprehensible motives of men who could have no fair reasons now for delay  he made a sudden violent action that was more than a straightening of his powerful frame it was the old instinctive violence then he faced north madeline read his thought knew he was thinking of her calling her a last silent farewell he would serve her to his last breath leave her free keep his secret that picture of him darkbrowed fireeyed strangely sad and strong sank indelibly into madelines heart of hearts  the next instant he was striding forward to force by bold and scornful presence a speedy fulfilment of his sentence  madeline stepped into the door crossed the threshold stewart staggered as if indeed the bullets he expected had pierced him in mortal wound his dark face turned white his eyes had the rapt stare the wild fear of a man who saw an apparition yet who doubted his sight perhaps he had called to her as the mexicans called to their virgin perhaps he imagined sudden death had come unawares and this was her image appearing to him in some other life  whoareyou he whispered hoarsely  she tried to lift her hands failed tried again and held them out trembling  it is i majesty your wife
