chapter i  his youth   harold was about ten years of age when his father the rev mr excell took the pastorate of the first church in rock river many of the people in his first congregation remarked upon the handsome lad the clear brown of his face his big yellowbrown eyes his slender hands and the grace of his movements gave him distinction quite aside from that arising from his connection with the minister  rev john excell was a personable man himself he was tall and broad shouldered with abundant brown hair and beard and a winning smile his eyes were dark and introspective but they could glow like sunlit topaz or grow dim with tears as his congregation had opportunity to observe during this first sermonbut they were essentially sad eyes  mrs excell a colorless little woman who retained only the dim outline of her girlhoods beauty sat gracelessly in her pew but her stepdaughter maud by her side was carrying to early maturity a dainty grace united with something strong and fine drawn from her father she had his proud lift of the head  what a fine family whispered the women from pew to pew under cover of the creaking fans  in the midst of the first sermon a boy seated in front of harold gave a shrill whoop of agony and glared back at the ministers son with distorted face and only the prompt action on the part of both mothers prevented a clamorous encounter over the pew harold had stuck the head of a pin in the toe of his boot and jabbed his neighbor in the calf of the leg it was an old trick but it served well  the minister did not interrupt his reading but a deep flush of hot blood arose to his face and the lids of his eyes dropped to shut out the searching gaze of his parishioners as well as to close in a red glare of anger from that moment harold was known as that preachers boy the intention being to convey by significant inflections and a meaning smile that he filled the usual description of a ministers graceless son  harold soon became renowned in his own world he had no hardfought battles though he had scores of quarrels for he scared his opponents by the suddenness and the intensity of his rage which was fairly demoniacal in fury  you touch me and ill kill you he said in a low voice to the fat boy whose leg he had jabbed and his bloodless face and blazing eyes caused the boy to leap frenziedly away he carried a big knife his playmates discovered and no one not even youths grown to mans stature cared to attempt violence with him one lad struck with a stone from his cunning right hand was carried home in a carriage another being thrown by one convulsive effort fell upon his arm breaking it at the elbow in less than a week every boy in rock river knew something of harry excells furious temper and had learned that it was safer to be friend than enemy to him  he had his partisans too for his was a singularly attractive nature when not enraged he was a hearty buoyant playmate and a good scholar five days out of six but he demanded a certain consideration at all times an accidental harm he bore easily but an intentional injurythat was flame to powder  the teachers in the public school each had him in turn as he ran rapidly up the grades they all admired him unreservedly but most of them were afraid of him so that he received no more decisive check than at home he was subject to no will but his own  the principal was a kind and scholarly old man who could make a boy cry with remorse and shame by his christlike gentleness and harold also wept in his presence but that did not prevent him from fairly knocking out the brains of the next boy who annoyed him in his furious fickle way he often defended his chums or smaller boys so that it was not easy to condemn him entirely  there were rumors from the first monday after harolds pinsticking exploit that the minister had lively sessions with his boy the old sexton privately declared that he heard muffled curses and shrieks and the sound of blows rising from the cellar of the parsonagebut this story was hushed on his lips the boy admittedly needed thrashing but the deacons of the church would rather not have it known that the minister used the rod himself  the rumors of the preachers stern measures softened the judgment of some of the townspeople who shifted some of the blame of the son to the shoulders of the sire harry called his father the minister and seemed to have no regard for him beyond a certain respect for his physical strength when boys came by and raised the swimming sign he replied wait till i ask the minister this was considered queer in him  he ignored his stepmother completely but tormented his sister maud in a thousand impish ways he disarranged her neatly combed hair he threw mud on her dress and put carriage grease on her white stockings on picnic day he called her chinything in allusion to her pretty round cheeks and clear complexion and yet he loved her and would instantly fight for her and no one else dared tease her or utter a word to annoy her she was fourteen years of age when mr excell came to town and at sixteen considered herself a young lady as suitors began to gather about her they each had a vigorous trial to undergo with harold it was indeed equivalent to running the gantlet maud was always in terror of him on the evenings when she had callers  one day he threw a handful of small garter snakes into the parlor where his sister sat with young mr norton maud sprang to a chair screaming wildly while her suitor caught the snakes and threw them from the window just as the ministers tall form darkened the doorway  what is the matter he asked  maud eager to shield harry said oh nothing much papaonly one of harrys jokes  tell me said the minister to the young man who with a painful smile on his face stammeringly replied  harry thought hed scare me thats all it didnt amount to much  i insist on knowing the truth mr norton the minister sternly insisted  as norton described the boys action mr excells face paled and his lips set close his eyes became terrible to meet and the beaded sweat of his furious anger stood thick on his face thank you he said with ominous calmness and turning without another word went to his study  his wife stealing up found the door locked and her husband walking the floor like a roused tiger white and shaking with a sort of awe mrs excell ran down to the kitchen where harold crouched and said  harold dear youd better go out to mr burns right away  harold understood perfectly what she meant and fled for hours neither mrs excell nor maud spoke above a whisper when the minister came down to tea he made no comment on harrys absence he had worn out his whitehot rage but was not yet in full control of himself  he remained silent and kept his eyes on his plate during the meal  the last time he had punished harold the scene narrowly escaped a tragic ending when the struggle ended harold lay on the floor choked into insensibility  when he had become calm and harold was sleeping naturally in his own bed the father knelt at his wifes knee and prayed god for grace to bear his burden and said  mary keep us apart when we are angry he is like me he has my fiendish temper no matter what i say or do keep us apart till i am calm by gods grace i will never touch his flesh again in anger  nevertheless he dared not trust himself to refer to the battles which shamed them all the boy was deeply repentant but uttered no word of it and so they grew ever more silent and vengeful in their intercourse  harold early developed remarkable skill with horses and once rode in the races at the county fair to the scandal of the first church he not only won the race but was at once offered a great deal of money to go with the victor to other races to his plea the father with deeplaid diplomacy replied  very well study hard this year and next year you may go but the boy was just at the age to take on weight rapidly and by the end of the year was too heavy and the owner of the horse refused to repeat his offer harold did not fail to remark how he had been cheated but said nothing more of his wish to be a jockey  he was also fond of firearms and during his boyhood his father tried in every way to keep weapons from him and a box in his study contained a contraband collection of his sons weapons there was a certain pathos in this little arsenal for it gave evidence of considerable labor on the boys part and expressed much of buoyant hope and restless energy  there were a halfdozen fourth of july pistols as many cannons for crackers and three attempts at real guns intended to explode powder and throw a bullet some of them were toggled up with twine and one or two had handles rudely carved out of wood two of them were genuine revolvers which he had managed to earn by working in the harvest field on the burns farm  from his fifteenth year he was never without a shotgun and revolver the shotgun was allowed but the revolver was still contraband and kept carefully concealed on fourth of july he always helped to fire the anvil and fireworks for he was deft and sure and quite at home with explosives he had acquired great skill with both gun and pistol as early as his thirteenth year and his feats of marksmanship came now and then to the ears of his father  the father and son were in open warfare harold submitted to every command outwardly but inwardly vowed to break all restraint which he considered useless or unjust  his great ambition was to acquire a mustang pony for all the adventurous spirits of the dime novels he had known carried revolvers and rode mustangs he did not read much but when he did it was always some tale of fighting he was too restless and active to continue at a book of his own accord for any length of time but he listened delightedly to any one who consented to read for him when his sister maud wished to do him a great favor and to enjoy his company for she loved him dearly she read daredevil dan or some similar story while he lay out on his stomach in the grass under the trees with restless feet swinging like pendulums at such times his face was beautiful with longing and his eyes became dark and dreamy im going there beauty he would say as maud rolled out the word colorado or brazos im going there i wont stay here and rot ill go youll see and ill have a big herd of cattle too  his gentlest moments were those spent with his sister in the fields or under the trees as he grew older he became curiously tender and watchful of her it pleased him to go ahead of her through the woods to pilot the way and to help her over ditches or fences he loved to lead her into dense thickets and to look around and say there isnt this wild though you couldnt find your way out if it wasnt for me could you and she to carry out the spirit of the story always shuddered and said dont leave me to perish here  once as he lay with his head in the grass he suddenly said cant you hear the colorado roar  the wind was sweeping over the trees and maud eager to keep him in this gentle mood cried i hear it it is a wonderful river isnt it  he did not speak again for a moment  oh i want to be where there is nobody west of me he said a look of singular beauty on his face dont you  nno i dont answered maud but then im a girl you know were afraid of wild things most of us  dot burland isnt  oh she only pretends she wants you to think shes brave  thats a lie he said it so savagely that maud hastened to apologize     chapter ii  his love affairs   naturally a lad of this temper had his loves he made no secret of them and all the young people in the town knew his sweethearts and the precise time when his passion changed its course if a girl pleased him he courted her with the utmost directness but he was by no interpretation a lovesick youth his likings were more in the nature of proprietary comradeship and were expressed without caresses or ordinary words of endearment  his courtship amounted to service he waited about to meet and help his love he hastened to defend her and to guide her and if the favored one knew her rôle she humored his fancies permitting him to aid her in finding her way across a weedy pasture lot or over a tiny little brook which he was pleased to call a torrent a smile of derision was fatal he would not submit to ridicule or joking at the first jocular word his hands clinched and his eyes flamed with anger his was not a face of laughter for the most part it was serious in expression and his eyes were rapt with dreams of great deeds  he had one mate to whom he talked freely and him he chose often to be his companion in the woods or on the prairies this was john burns son of a farmer who lived near the town harry spent nearly every saturday and sunday during the summer months on the burns farm he helped jack during haying and harvest and when their tasks were done the two boys wandered away to the bank of the river and there under some great basswood tree on delicious sward they lay and talked of wild animals and indians and the west at this time the great chieftains of the sioux sitting bull and gall were becoming famous to the world and the first reports of the findings of gold in the black hills were being made a commission appointed by president grant had made a treaty with the sioux wherein sitting bull was told if you go to this new reservation and leave dakota to the settlers you shall be unmolested so long as grass grows and water runs  but the very guard sent in to protect this commission reported gold in the grass roots and the insatiate greed of the white man broke all boundsthe treaty was ignored and sitting bull the last chieftain of the sioux calling his people together withdrew deeper into the wilderness of wyoming the soldiers were sent on the trail and the press teemed for months with news of battles and speeches and campaigns  all these exciting events harry and his friend jack read and discussed hotly jack was eager to own a mine id like to pick up a nugget he said but harold was not interested i dont care to mine id like to be with general custer id like to be one of the scouts id like to have a coat like that he pointed at one of the pictures wherein two or three men in fringed buckskin shirts and wide hats were galloping across a rocky plain  many times as the two boys met to talk over these alluring matters the little town and the dusty lanes became exceedingly tame and commonplace  harolds eyes glowed with passion as he talked to his sweetheart of these wild scenes and she listened because he was so alluring as he lay at her feet pouring out a vivid recital of his plans  im not going to stay here much longer he said its too dull i cant stand much more school if it wasnt for you id run away right now  dot only smiled back at him and laid her hand on his hair she was his latest sweetheart he loved her for her vivid color her abundant and beautiful hair and also because she was a sympathetic listener she on her part enjoyed the sound of his eager voice and the glow of his deep brown eyes they were both pupils in the little seminary in the town and he saw her every day walking to and from the recitation halls he often carried her books for her and in many other little ways insisted on serving her  almost without definable reason the wild west came to be a land of wonder lit as by some magical light its cañons arroyos and mesquite its bronchos cowboys indians and scouts filled the boys mind with thoughts of daring not much unlike the fancies of a boy in the days of knight errantry  of the indians he held mixed opinions at times he thought of them as a noble race at otherswhen he dreamed of famehe wished to kill a great many of them and be very famous most of the books he read were based upon the slaughter of the redskins and yet at heart he wished to be one of them and to taste the wild joy of their poetic life filled with hunting and warfare sitting bull chief gall rainintheface spotted tail starinthebrow and black buffalo became wonderworking names in his mind every line in the newspapers which related to the life of the cowboys or indians he read and remembered for his plan was to become a part of it as soon as he had money enough to start  there were those who would have contributed five dollars each to send him for he was considered a dangerous influence among the village boys if a window were broken by hoodlums at night it was counted against the ministers son if a melon patch were raided and the fruit scattered and broken harold was considered the ringleader of the judgments of their elders the rough lads were well aware and they took pains that no word of theirs should shift blame from harolds shoulders to their own by hints and sly remarks they fixed unalterably in the minds of their fathers and mothers the conception that harold was a desperately bad and reckless boy in his strength skill and courage they really believed and being afraid of him they told stories of his exploits even among themselves which bordered on the marvelous  in reality he was not a leader of these raids his temperament was not of that kind he did not care to assume direction of an expedition because it carried too much trouble and some responsibility his mind was wayward and liable to shift to some other thing at any moment besides mischief for its own sake did not appeal to him the real leaders were the two sons of the village shoemaker they were undersized weazened shrewd sly little scamps and appeared not to have the resolution of chickadees but had a singular genius for getting others into trouble they knew how to handle spirits like harold they dared him to do evil deeds taunted him as openly as they felt it safe to do with cowardice and so spurred him to attempt some trifling depredation merely as a piece of adventure almost invariably when they touched him on this nerve harold responded with a rush and when discovery came was nearly always among the culprits taken and branded for his pride would not permit him to sneak and run so it fell out that time after time he was found among the grape stealers or the melon raiders and escaped prosecution only because the men of the town laid it to boyish deviltry and not to any deliberate intent to commit a crime  after his daughter married mr excell made another effort to win the love of his son and failed harold cared nothing for his fathers scholarship or oratorical powers and never went to church after he was sixteen but he sometimes boasted of his father among the boys  if father wasnt a minister hed be one of the strongest men in this town he said once to jack look at his shoulders his arms are hard too of course he cant show his muscle but i tell you he can box and swing dumbbells  if the father had known it in the direction of athletics lay the road to the sons heart but the members of the first church were not sufficiently advanced to approve of a muscular minister and so mr excell kept silent on such subjects and swung his dumbbells in private as a matter of fact he had been a good hunter in his youth in michigan and might have won his sons love by tales of the wood but he did not  for the most part harold ignored his fathers occasional moments of tenderness and spent the larger part of his time with his sister or at the burns farm  mr and mrs burns saw all that was manly and good in the boy and they stoutly defended him on all occasions  the boy is put upon mrs burns always argued a quieter more peaceabler boy i never knew except my own jack theyre good helpful boys both of em and i dont care what anybody says  jack being slower of thought and limb worshiped his chum whose alertness and resource humbled him though he was much the better scholar in all routine work he read more than harold but harold seized upon the facts and transmitted them instantly into something vivid and dramatic he assumed all leadership in the hunting and upon jack fell all the drudgery he always did the reading also while harold listened and dreamed with eyes that seemed to look across miles of peaks his was the eagles heart wild reaches allured him minute beauties of garden or flower were not for him the groves along the river had long since lost their charm because he knew their limitsthey no longer appealed to his imagination  a hundred times he said come lets go west and kill buffalo tomorrow we will see the snow on pikes peak the wild country was so near its pressure day by day molded his mind he had no care or thought of cities or the east he dreamed of the plains and horses and herds of buffalo and troops of indians filing down the distant slopes every poem of the range every word which carried flavor of the wild country every picture of a hunter remained in his mind  the feel of a gun in his hands gave him the keenest delight and to stalk geese in a pond or crows in the cornfield enabled him to imagine the joy of hunting the bear and the buffalo he had the hunters patience and was capable of creeping on his knees in the mud for hours in the attempt to kill a duck he could imitate almost all the birds and animals he knew his whistle would call the mother grouse to him he could stop the whooping of cranes in their steady flight and his honking deceived the wary geese when complimented for his skill in hunting he scornfully said  oh thats nothing anyone can kill small game but buffaloes and grizzliesthey are the boys  during the winter of his sixteenth year a brother of mr burns returned from kansas which was then a strange and faroff land and from him harold drew vast streams of talk the boy was insatiate when the plains were under discussion from this veritable cattleman he secured many new words with great joy he listened while mr burns spoke of cinches ropes corrals buttes arroyos and other spanishmexican words which the boys had observed in their dime novels but which they had never before heard anyone use in common speech mr burns alluded to an aparejo or an arroyo as casually as jack would say singletree or furrow and his stories brought the distant plains country very near  harold sought opportunity to say mr burns take me back with you i wish you would  the cattleman looked at him can you ride a horse  jack spoke up you bet he can uncle he rode in the races  burns smiled as a king might upon a young knight seeking an errant  well if your folks dont object when you get done with school and jacks mother says he can come you make a break for abilene well see what i can do with you on the long trail  harold took this offer very seriously much more so than mr burns intended he should do although he was pleased with the boy  harold well knew that his father and mother would not consent and very naturally said nothing to them about his plan but thereafter he laid by every cent of money he could earn until his thrift became a source of comment to jack he talked for hours of the journey they were to make jack unimaginative and engrossed with his studies at the seminary took the whole matter very calmly it seemed a long way off at best and his studies were pleasant and needed his whole mind harold was thrown back upon the company of his sweetheart who was the only one else to whom he could talk freely  dot indolent smiling creature of cozy corners that she was listened without emotion while harold with eyes ablaze with visions of the great splendid plains said im going west sure im tired of school im going to kansas and im going to be a great cattle king in a few years dot and then ill come back and get you and well go live on the banks of a big river and well have plenty of horses and go riding and hunting antelope every day how will you like that  her unresponsiveness hurt him and he said you dont seem to care whether i go or not  she turned and looked at him vacantly still smiling and he saw that she had not heard a single word of his passionate speech he sprang up hot with anger and pain  if you dont care to listen to me you neednt he said speaking through his clinched teeth  she smiled showing her little white teeth prettily now dont get mad harry i was thinking of something else please tell me again  i wont im done with you a big lump arose in his throat and he turned away to hide tears of mortified pride he could not have put it into words but he perceived the painful truth dot had considered him a boy all along and had only half listened to his stories and plans in the past deceiving him for some purpose of her own she was a smiling careless hypocrite  youve lied to me he said turning and speaking with the bluntness of a boy without subtlety of speech i neverll speak to you again goodby  dot kept swinging her foot goodby she said in her sweet softbreathing voice  he walked away slowly but his heart was hot with rage and wounded pride and every time he thought of the tone in which she said goodby his flesh quivered he was seventeen and considered himself a man she was eighteen and thought him only a boy she had never listened to him that he now understood maud had been right dot had only pretended and now for some reason she ceased to pretend  there was just one comfort in all this it made it easier for him to go to the sunset country and his wounded heart healed a little at the thought of riding a horse behind a roaring herd of buffaloes     chapter iii  the young eagle strikes   a farming village like rock river is one of the quietest most humdrum communities in the world till some sudden upheaval of primitive passion reveals the tiger the ram and the wolf which decent and orderly procedure has hidden cases of murder arise from the dead level of everyday village routine like volcanic mountain peaks in the midst of a flowering plain  the citizens of rock river were amazed and horrified one monday morning to learn that dot burland had eloped with the clerk in the principal bank in the town a married man and the leader of the choir in the first church some of the people when they heard of it said i do not believe it and when they were convinced the tears came to their eyes she was such a pretty girl and think of mrs willardand then samwho would have supposed sam willard could do such a thing  to most of the citizens it was drama it broke the tedious monotony of everyday life it was more productive of interesting conversation than a case of embezzlement or the burning of the county courthouse there were those who smiled while they said too bad too bad any pticlers  some of the women recalled their dislike of the lazy pinkandwhite creature whom they had often seen loitering on the streets or lying day after day in a hammock reading domestic novels the young girls drew together and conveyed the news in whispers it seemed to overturn the whole social world so far as they knew it and some of them hastened to disclaim any friendship with the dreadful thing  of course the related persons came into the talk poor mrs willard and harry excell yes there was harry for a moment for the first time he was regarded with pity what will he do he must take it very hard  at about eleven oclock just as the discussion had reached this secondary stage where new particulars were necessary a youth pale and breathless with his right hand convulsively clasping his bloody shoulder rushed into the central drug store and fell to the floor with inarticulate cries of fear and pain out of his mouth at last came an astonishing charge of murderous assault on the part of harold excell his wounds were dressed and the authorities notified to arrest his assailant  when the officers found harold he was pacing up and down the narrow alley where the encounter had taken place he was white as the dead and his eyes were ablaze under his knitted brows  well what do you want of me he demanded as the officer rushed up and laid hands upon him  youve killed clint slocum replied the constable drawing a pair of handcuffs from his pocket  oh drop those things replied harold im not going to run you never knew me to run  half ashamed the constable replaced the irons in his pocket and seized his prisoner by the arm harold walked along quietly but his face was terrible to see especially in one so young in every street excited men women and children were running to see him pass he had suddenly become alien and far separated from them all he perceived them as if through a lurid smoke cloud  on most of these faces lay a smile a ghastly excited pleased grin which enraged him more than any curse would have done he had suddenly become their dramatic entertainment the constable gripped him tighter and the sheriff running up seized his other arm  harold shook himself free let me alone im going along all right  the officers only held him the closer and his rage broke bounds he struggled till his captors swayed about on the walk and the little boys screamed with laughter to see the slender youth shake the big men  in the midst of this struggle a tall man without hat or coat and wearing slippers came running down the walk with great strides his voice rang deep and clear  let the boy alone  it was the minister with one sweep of his right hand he tore the hands of the sheriff from the boys arms the gesture was bearlike in power whats the meaning of all this mr sawyer he said addressing the sheriff  your boy has killed a man  you lie  its trueanyhow he has stabbed clint slocum he aint dead but hes hurt bad  is that true harold  harold did not lift his sullen glance he struck me with a whip  there was a silence during which the minister choked with emotion and his lips moved as if in silent prayer then he turned free the boys arm ill guarantee he will not try to escape no son of mine will run to escape punishmentleave him to me  the constable being a member of the ministers congregation and a profound admirer of his pastor fell back the sheriff took a place by his side and the father and son walked on toward the jail after a few moments the minister began to speak in a low voice  my son you have reached a momentous point in your lifes history much depends on the words you use i will not tell you to conceal the truth but you need not incriminate yourselfthat is the lawhis voice was almost inaudible but harold heard it if slocum diesoh my god my god  his voice failed him utterly but he walked erect and martial the sun blazing on his white forehead his hands clinched at his sides there were many of his parishioners in the streets and several of the women broke into bitter weeping as he passed and many of the men imprecated the boy who was bringing white lines of sorrow into his fathers hair this is the logical end of his lawless bringing up said one  the father went on tell me my boytell me the truthdid you strike to kill was murder in your heart  harold did not reply the minister laid a broad gentle hand on his sons shoulder tell me harold  no i struck to hurt him he was striking me i struck back the boy sullenly answered  the father sighed with relief i believe you harold he is older and stronger too that will count in your favor  they reached the jail yard gate and there in the face of a crowd of curious people the minister bowed his proud head and put his arm about his son and kissed his hair then with tears upon his face he addressed the sheriff  mr sheriff i resign my boy to your care remember he is but a lad and he is my only son deal gently with himharold submit to the law and all will end well i will bring mother and maud to see you at once  as the gate closed on his son the minister drew a deep breath and a cry of bitter agony broke from his clinched lips o god o god my son is lost  the story of the encounter even as it dribbled forth from slocum developed extenuating circumstances slocum was man grown a big muscular fellow rather given to bullying a heavy carriage whip was found lying in the alley and this also supported harolds story to his father as told by slocum the struggle took place just where the alley from behind the parsonage came out upon the cross street  i was leading a horse said slocum and i met harry and we got to talking and something i said made him mad and he jerked out his knife and jumped at me the horse got scared and yanked me around and just then harry got his knife into me i saw he was in for my life and i threw down the whip and run the blood aspurting out o me hot as bilin water i was scared i admit that i thought hed opened a big artery in me and i guess he did  when this story amplified and made dramatic reached the ears of the minister he said that is clintons side of the case my son must have been provoked beyond his control wait till we hear his story  but the shadow of the prison was on harolds face and he sullenly refused to make any statement even to his sister who had more influence over him than mrs excell  a singular and sinister change came over him as the days passed he became silent and secretive and suspicious and the sheriff spoke to mr excell about it i dont understand that boy of yours he seems to be in training for a contest of some kind hes quiet enough in daytime or when im around but when he thinks hes alone he races up and down like a lynx and jumps and turns handsprings and all sorts of things the only person he asks to see is young burns i cant fathom him  the father lowered his eyes he knew well that harry did not ask for him  if it wasnt for these suspicious actions doctor id let him have the full run of the jail yard but i dassent let him have any liberties why he can go up the side of the cells like a squirrel hed go over our wall like a catno doubt of it  the minister spoke with some effort i think you misread my son he is not one to flee from punishment he has some other idea in his mind  to jack burns alone plain plodding and slow harold showed a smiling face he met him with a boyish wordhello jack how goes itand was eager to talk he reached out and touched him with his hands wistfully im glad youve come youre the only friend ive got now jack this was one of the morbid fancies jail life had developed he thought everybody had turned against him now i want to tell you somethingwere chums and you mustnt give me away these fools think im going to try to escape but i aint you see they cant hang me for stabbing that coward but theyll shut me up for a year or two and ive got to keep healthy dont you see when i get out o this i strike for the west dont you see and ive got to be able to do a days work look at this arm he stripped his strong white arm for inspection  in the midst of the excitement attending harolds arrest dots elopement was temporarily diminished in value but some shrewd gossip connected the two events and said i believe clint gibed harry excell about doti just believe thats what the fight was about  this being repeated not as an opinion but as the inside facts in the case sentiment turned swiftly in harolds favor clinton was shrewd enough to say very little about the quarrel i was just givin him a little guff and he up and lit into me with a big claspknife such was his story constantly repeated  fortunately for harold the case came to trial early in the autumn session it was the most dramatic event of the year and it was seriously suggested that it would be a good thing to hold the trial in the opera house in order that all the townspeople should be able to enjoy it a cynical young editor made a counter suggestion i move we charge one dollar per ticket and apply the funds to buying a fire engine naturally the judge of the district went the calm way of the law regardless of the towns ferment of interest in the case  the county attorney appeared for the prosecution and old judge brown and young bradley talcott defended harold  bradley knew harold very well and the boy had a high regard for him lawyer brown believed the boy to be a restless and dangerous spirit but he said to bradley  ive no doubt the boy was provoked by clint who is a worthless bully but we must face the fact that young excell bears a bad name he has been in trouble a great many times and the prosecution will make much of that our business is to show the extent of the provocation and secondly to disprove so far as we can the popular conception of the youth i can get nothing out of him which will aid in his defense he refuses to talk unless we can wring the truth out of slocum on the stand it will go hard with the boy i wish youd see what you can do  bradley went down to see harold and the two spent a couple of hours together bradley talked to him in plain and simple words without any assumption his voice was kind and sincere and harold nearly wept under its music but he added very little to bradleys knowledge of the situation  he struck me with the whip and then ii cant remember much about it my mind was a kind of a red blur harold said at last desperately  why did he strike you with the whip  i told him he was a blackhearted liar  what made you say that to him persevered bradley  because thats what he was  did he say something to you which you resented  yeshe did  what was it  right there harold closed his lips and bradley took another tack  harry i want you to tell me something did you have anything to do with killing brownlows dog  no replied harold disdainfully  did you have any hand in the raid on brownlows orchard a week later  no i was at home  did your folks see you during the evening  no i was with jack up in the attic reading  youve taken a hand in some of these thingsraidshavent you  yes but i never tried to destroy things it was all in fun  i understand well now harold youve got a worse name than belongs to you and i wish youd just tell me the whole truth about this fight and we will do what we can to help you  harolds face grew sullen i dont care what they do with me theyre all down on me anyway he slowly said and bradley arose and went out with a feeling of discouragement     chapter iv  the trial   the day of his trial came as a welcome change to harold he had no fear of punishment and he hated delay every day before his sentence began was a loss of timekept him just that much longer from the alluring lands to the west his father called often to see him but the boy remained inexorably silent in all these meetings and the minister went away white with pain even to his sister harold was abrupt and harsh but jacks devotion produced in him the most exalted emotion and he turned upon his loyal chum the whole force of his affectionate nature he did not look up to jack he loved him more as a man loves his younger brother and yet even to him he would not utter the words young slocum had flung at him lawyer talcott had asked young burns to get at this if possible for purpose of defense but it was not possible  the court met on the first tuesday in september the day was windless and warm and as harold walked across the yard with the sheriff he looked around at the maple leaves just touched with crimson and gold and russet and his heart ached with desire to be free the scent of the open air made his nostrils quiver like those of a deer  jack met them on the patheager to share his heros trouble  please sheriff let me walk with harry  fall in behind the sheriff gruffly replied and so out of all the town people jack alone associated himself with the prisoner up the stairs whereon he had romped when a lad harold climbed spiritlessly a boy no longer  the halls were lined with faces everyone as familiar as the scarred and scratched wall of the court room and yet all were now alienno one recognized him by a frank and friendly nod and he moved past his old companions with sullen and rigid face his father met him at the door and walked beside him down the aisle to a seat  the benches were crowded and every foot of standing space was soon filled the members of the first church were present in mass to see the minister enter pale and haggard with the disgrace of his son  the judge an untidy old man of great ability and probity was in his seat looking out absently over the spectators the next case to him was only a case he had grown gray in dealing with infractions of the law and though kindly disposed he had grown indifferentuse had dulled his sympathies his beard yellow with tobacco stain was still venerable and his voice deep and melodious was impressive and commanding  he was disposed to cut short all useless forms and soon brought the case to vital questions naturally the prosecution made a great deal of harolds bad character drawing from ready witnesses the story of his misdeeds to do this was easy for the current set that way and those who had only thought harold a bad boy now knew that he was concerned in all the mischief of the village  in rebuttal mr talcott drew out contradictory statements from these witnesses and proved several alibis at points where harold had been accused he produced jack burns and several others to prove that harold liked fun but that he was not inclined to lead in any of the mischief of the townin fact that he had not the quality of leadership  he pushed young burns hard to get him to say that he knew the words of insult which slocum had used i think he used some girls name he finally admitted  i object shouted the prosecution as if touched on a hidden spring  go on said the judge to talcott he had become interested in the case at last  when the lawyer for the prosecution crossexamined young burns he became terrible he leaned across the table and shook his lean bigjointed finger in jacks face we dont want what you think sir we want what you know do you know that slocum brought a girls name into this  no sir i dont replied jack red and perspiring  thats all cried the attorney leaning back in his chair with dramatic complacency  others of harolds companions were browbeaten into declaring that he led them into all kinds of raids and when talcott tried to stem this tide by objection the prosecution rose to say that the testimony was competent that it was designed to show the dangerous character of the prisoner he is no gentle and guileless youth yr honor but a reckless young devil given to violence no one will go further than i in admiration of the reverend mr excell but the fact of the sons lawless life can not be gainsaid  slocum repeated his story on the stand and was unshaken by bradleys crossexamination suddenly the defense said stand please  slocum arosea powerful fullgrown man  bradley nodded at harold stand also  i object shrieked the prosecution  state the objection said the judge  keep your position said bradley sternly i want the jury to compare you  as the prisoner and the witness faced each other the court room blossomed with smiles harold looked very pale and delicate beside the coarse muscular hostler who turned red and looked foolish  ultimately the judge sustained the objection but the work was done a dramatic contrast had been drawn and the jury perceived the pusillanimity of slocums story this was the position of the defense harold was a boy the hostler had insulted him had indeed struck him with a whip mad with rage and realizing the greater strength of his assailant the prisoner had drawn a knife  in rebuttal the prosecution made much of harolds fierce words he meant to kill he was a dangerous boy speaking with due reverence for his parents the lawyer said the boy has been a scourge again and again he has threatened his playmates with death these facts must stand the state is willing to admit the disparity of strength so artfully set forth by the defense but it must not be forgotten that the boy was known to carry deadly weapons and that he was subject to blind rages it was not therefore so much a question of punishing the boy as of checking his assaults upon society to properly punish him here would have a most salutary effect upon his action in future the jury must consider the case without sentiment  old brown arose after the state had finished everyone knew his power before a jury and the room was painfully silent as he walked with stately tread to a spittoon and cleared his mouth of a big wad of tobacco he was the oldfashioned lawyer formal deliberate and though everybody enjoyed bradley talcotts powerful speech they looked for drama from brown the judge waited patiently while the famous old lawyer played his introductory part at last after silently pacing to and fro for a full minute he turned and began in a hard dry nasal voice  your honor im not so sure of the reforming effect of a penitentiary i question the salutary quality of herding this delicate and highspirited youth with the hardened criminals of the state his strident monotonous tone and the cynical inflections of his voice made the spectators shiver with emotion as under the power of a great actor he paced before the judge twice before speaking again your honor there is more in this case than has yet appeared everyone in this room knows that the elopement of dorothy burland is at the bottom of this affair everyone but yourself judge this lad was the accepted sweetheart of that wayward miss this man slocum is one of the rough loudspoken men of the village schooled in vice and fisticuffery you can well imagine gentlemen of the jury he turned to them abruptly you can well imagine the kind of a greeting this town loafer would give this highspirited boy on that morning after the night when his inamorata disappeared with a married man the boy has in him somewhat of the knight of the old time your honor he has never opened his lips in dispraise of his faithless love he has refused to repeat the insulting words of his assailant he stands today at a turning point of his life gentlemen of the jury and it depends on you whether he goes downward or upward he has had his faith in women shaken dont let him lose faith in law and earthly justice his first gesture was on the word downward and it was superb  again he paused and when he looked up again a twinkle was in his eyes and his voice was softer as for all this chicken roasting and melon lifting you well know the spirit that is in that we all had a hand in such business once every man jack of us the boy is no more culpable now than you were then moreover excell has had too much of the mischief of the town laid on his shouldersmore than he deserves give a dog a bad name and every dead sheep is laid at the door of his kennel  however i dont intend to review the case yr honor my colleague has made the main and vital points entirely clear i intend merely to add a word here and there i want you to take another look at that pale handsome poetic youth and then at that burly bully and consider the folly the idiocy and the cowardice of the charge brought against our client he waited while the contrast which his dramatic utterance made enormously effective was being felt then in a deep melodious voice touched with sadness he addressed the judge  and to you your honor i want to say we are old men you on the bench and i here in the forum have faced each other many times i have defended many criminals as it was my duty to do and you have punished many who deserved their sentences i have seen innocent men unable to prove their freedom from guilt and i have known men who are grossly criminal because of lack of evidencethese things are beyond our cure we are old your honor we must soon give place to younger men we can not afford to leave bench and bar with the stain of injustice on our garments we can not afford to start this boy on the road to hell at seventeen years of age  he stopped as abruptly as he had begun and the room was silent for a long time after he had taken his seat to harold it seemed as though he and all the people of the room were deadthat only his brain was alive then mrs excell burst into sobbing the judge looked away into space his dim eyes seeing nothing that was near his face an impassive mask of colorless flesh the old lawyers words had stirred his blood sluggish and cold with age but his brain absorbed the larger part of his roused vitality and when he spoke his voice had an unwontedly flat and dry sound  the question for you to decide he said instructing the jury is whether the boy struck the blow in selfdefense or whether he assaulted with intent to do great bodily injury the fact that he was provoked by a man older and stronger than himself naturally militates in his favor but the next question is upon the boys previous character did he carry deadly weapons is he at heart dangerous to his fellows his youth should be in mind but it should also be remembered that he is a lad of high intellectual power older than most men of his age i will not dwell upon the case you have heard the testimony the verdict is in your keeping  during all this period of severe mental strain mr excell sat beside lawyer brown motionless as a statue save when now and again he leaned forward to whisper a suggestion he did not look at his son and harold seldom looked at him jack burns sat as near the prisoner as the sheriff would permit and his homely good face and the face of the judge were to harold the only spots of light in the otherwise dark room outside the voices of children could be heard and the sound of the rising wind in the rustling trees once a breeze sent a shower of yellow and crimson leaves fluttering in at the open window and the boys heart swelled high in his throat and he bowed his head and sobbed those leaves represented the splendor of the open spaces to him they were like messages from the crimson sunsets of the golden west and his heart thrilled at the sight of them  it was long after twelve oclock and an adjournment for dinner was ordered harold was about to be led away when his father came to him and said  harold would you like to have your mother and me go to dinner with you  with that same unrelenting stubborn frown on his face the boy replied nolet me alone  a hot flush swept over the preachers face very well he said and turned away his lips twitching  the jury was not long out they were ready to report at three oclock every seat was filled as before the lawyers came in picking their teeth or smoking the ladies were in sunday dress the young men were accompanied by their girls as if the trial were a dramatic entertainment those who failed of regaining their seats were much annoyed others more thrifty had hired boys to keep their places for them during the noon hour and others still more determined having brought lunches had remained in their seats throughout the intermission and were serene and satisfied  harold was brought back to his seat looking less haggard he was not afraid of sentence on the contrary he longed to have the suspense end  i dont care what they do with me if they dont use up too much of my life he said to jack ill pound rock or live in a dungeon if it will only shorten my sentence i hate to think of losing time oh if i had only gone last year  the reverend excell came in looming high above the crowd his face still white and set he paid no heed to his parishioners but made his way to the side of lawyer brown the judge mounted his bench and the court room came to order instantly  is the jury ready to report on the case of the state vs excell he asked in a low voice he was informed that they were agreed after the jury had taken their seats he said blandly mechanically gentlemen we are ready for your verdict  harold knew the foreman very well he was a carpenter and joiner in whose shop he had often playeda big bluff goodhearted man whom any public speaking appalled and who stammered badly as he read from a little slip of paper guilty of assault with intent to commit great bodily injury but recommended to the mercy of the judge then with one hand in his breeches pocket he added be easy on him judge i believe id a done the same  the spectators tittered at his abrupt change of tone and some of the young people applauded he sat down very hot and red  the judge did not smile or frown his expressionless face seemed more like a mask than ever when he began to speak it was as though he were reading something writ in huge letters on a distant wall  the court is quite sensible of the extenuating circumstances attending this sad case but there are farreaching considerations which the court can not forget here is a youth of good family who elects to take up a life filled with mischief from the start discipline has been lacking here at last he so far oversteps the law that he appears before a jury it seems to the court necessary for this young mans own good that he feel the harsh hand of the law according to the evidence adduced here today he has been for years beyond the control of his parents and must now know the inflexible purpose of law i have in mind all that can be said in his favor his youth the disparity of age and physical power between himself and his accuser the provocation and the possession of the whip by the accuserbut all these are more than counterbalanced by the record of mischief and violence which stands against the prisoner  there was a solemn pause and the judge sternly said prisoner stand up harold arose for an assault committed upon the person of one clinton slocum i now sentence you harold excell to one year in the penitentiary and may you there learn to respect the life and property of your fellowcitizens  judge i beg the tall form of mr excell arose seeking to speak  the judge motioned him to silence  brown interposed i hope the court will not refuse to hear the father of the prisoner it would be scant justice if  mr excells voice arose harsh stern and quick he spoke like the big man he was firm and decided harold looked up at him in surprise  i claim the right to be heard will the court refuse me the privilege of a word his voice was a challenge i am known in this community for seven years as a minister of the gospel i have lived among these citizens my son is about to be condemned to states prison and before he goes i want to make a statement here before him and before the judge and before the world i understand this boy better than any of you better than the mother who bore him for i have given him the disposition which he bears i have had from my youth the same murderous rages i have them yet i love my son your honor and i would take him in my arms if i could but he has too much of my own spirit he literally can not meet me as an affectionate son for i sacrificed his goodwill by harsh measures while he was yet a babe i make this confession in order that the court may understand my relation to my son he was born with my own temper mingled with the poetic nature of his mother while he was yet a lad i beat him till he was discolored by bruises twice i would have killed him only for the intervention of my wife i have tried to live down my infirmity your honor and i have at last secured control of myself and i believe this boy will do the same but do not send him to be an associate with criminals my god do not treat him as i would not do even in my worst moments give him a chance to reform outside states prison dont fix on him that stain i will not say send methat would be foolish trickerybut i beg you to make some other disposition of this boy of mine if he goes to the penitentiary i shall strip from my shoulders the dress of the clergyman and go with him to be near to aid and comfort him during the term of his sentence let the father in you speak for me judge be merciful as we all hope for mercy on the great day for jesus sake  the judge looked out over the audience of weeping women and his face warmed into life he turned to the minister who still stood before him with hand outstretched and when he spoke his voice was softened and his eyes kindly  the court has listened to the words of the father with peculiar interest the court is a father and has been at a loss to understand the relations existing between father and son in this case the court thinks he understands them better now as counsel for the defense has said i am an old man soon to leave my seat upon the bench and i do not intend to let foolish pride or dry legal formalities stand between me and the doing of justice the jury has decided that the boy is guilty but has recommended him to the mercy of the court the plea of the father has enlightened the court on one or two most vital points nothing is further from the mind of the court than the desire to do injury to a handsome and talented boy believing that the father and son are about to become more closely united the court here transmutes the sentence to one hundred dollars fine and six months in the county jail this will make it possible for the son and father to meet often and the father can continue his duties to the church this the court decides upon as the final disposition of the accused the case is closed call the next case     chapter v  the eagles eyes grow dim   the county jail in cedar county was a plain brick structure set in the midst of the court house square connected with it was the official residence of the sheriff and brick walks ran diagonally from corner to corner for the convenience of citizens over these walks magnificent maples flung gorgeous banners in autumn and it was a favorite promenade for the young people of the town at all seasons even in winter  at times when the jail was filled with disorderly inmates these innocent lovers could hear the wild yells and see the insulting gestures of the men at the windows but ordinarily the grounds were quiet and peaceful the robins nested in the maples the squirrels scampered from tree to tree and little children tumbled about on the grass unmindful of the sullen captives within the walls  for seven years harold himself had played about this yard hearing the wild voices of the prisoners and seeing men come and go in irons over these walks he had loitered with dotnow he was one of those who clawed at the window bars like monkeys in a cage in order to look out at the sunshine of the world the jail pallor was already on his face and a savage look was in his eyes he refused to see anyone but jack who came often and whose coming saved him from despair  in one respect the county jail was worse than the states prison it had nothing for its captives to do they ate amused themselves as best they could through the long day and slept most of them brooded like harold on the sunshine lost to them and paced their cells like wild animals it had however the advantage of giving to each man a separate bed at night though during the day they occupied a common corridor some of them sang indecent songs and cursed their fellows for their stupidity and fights were not uncommon  the jailer was inclined to allow harold more liberty after his trial but the boy said im not asking any favors from you im working out a sentence  he continued his systematic exercise eating regularly and with care in order that he should keep his health he spent several hours each day leaping up the stairway which led from the lower cells to the upper and his limbs were like bundles of steel rods he could spring from the floor catch the hand rail of the runway above and swing himself with a single effort to the upper cells every possible combination of strength and agility which the slender variety of means allowed he used and not one of all the prisoners cared to try muscular conclusions with him occasionally a new prisoner would experiment but those who held over knew better than to bother the kid when a rash and doubting man tried it he repented it in cotton cloth and arnica  the only way in which harold could be enticed into the residence part of the jail was by sending jack to call upon him  at such times the jailer gave him plenty of time and harold poured forth his latest plans in a swift torrent he talked of nothing but the west my sentence will be out in april he said just the right time to go you must make all arrangements for me old man you take my money and get these things for me i want a sixshooter the best you can find the kind they use out on the plains and a belt and ammunition i want a valisea good strong one and i want you to put all my clothes in iti mean my underclothesi wont need cuffs and collars and such knickknacks out there i shall never enter fathers door again then i want you to be on the lookout for a chance to drive cattle for somebody going west well find chances enough and well strike for abilene and your uncles place i havent money enough to carry me out there on the train oh wont it be good fun when we have a good horse apiece and go riding across the plains herding the longhorns thats life that is if id only gone last year out where the buffalo and the antelope are  at such times the eagles heart in the youth could scarcely endure the pale cold light of the prison for an hour after one of these talks with jack he tore around his cell like a crazed wolf till his weary muscles absorbed the ache in his heart  during the winter the young mens christian association of the town organized what they called a prison rescue band which held services in the jail each sunday afternoon they were a great bore to harold who knew the members of the band and disliked most of them he considered them a little off their nutthat is to say fanatic he kept his cell closely and the devoted ones seldom caught a glimpse of him though he was the chief object of their care they sang pull for the shore trust it all with jesus and other wellworn moody and sankey hymns and the leader prayed resoundingly and then one by one the others made little talks to the prison walls there was seldom a face to be seen muttered curses occasionally rumbled from the cells where the prisoners were trying to sleep  but the leader was a shrewd young man and not many sundays after his initial attempt the prisoners were amazed to hear female voices joining in the songs heads appeared at every door to see the girls who stood timidly behind the men and sang in quavering voices the songs that persuaded to grace  some of these girlish messengers of mercy harold knew but others were strange to him the seminary was in session again and new pupils had entered for the most part they were colorless and plain and the prisoners ceased to show themselves during the singing harold lay on his iron bed dreaming of the wild lands whose mountains he could see shining through his prison walls jack had purchased for him some photographs of the rocky mountains and when he desired to forget his surroundings he had but to look on the seamless dome of sierra blanca or the san francisco peaks or at the image of the limpid waters of trappers lake and like the conjurers magic crystal sphere it cured him of all his mental maladies set him free and ahorse  but one sabbath afternoon he heard a new voice a girls voice so sweet and tender and true he could not forbear to look out upon the singer she was small and looked very pale under the white light of the high windows she was singing alone a wonderful thing in itself and in her eyes was neither fear nor maidenly shrinking she was indeed thrillingly absorbed and selfforgetful there was something singular and arresting in the poise of her head her eyes seemed to look through and beyond the prison walls far into some finer purer land than any earthly feet had trod and her song had a touch of genuine poetry in it      if i were a voice a persuasive voice     that could travel the whole earth through     i would fly on the wings of the morning light     and speak to men with a gentle might     and tell them to be true     if i were a voice  the heart of the boy expanded music and poetry and love were waked in him by the voice of this singing girl to others she was merely simple and sweet to him she was a messenger the vibrant wistful cadence of her voice when she uttered the words and tell them to be true dropped down into the boys sullen and lonely heart he did not look at her but all the week he wondered about her he thought of her almost constantly and the words she sang lay in his ears soothing and healing like some subtle oriental balm on the wings of the morning light was one haunting phrasethe other was and tell them to be true  the other prisoners had been touched only one or two ventured coarse remarks about her and they were speedily silenced by their neighbors harold was eager to seek jack in order to learn the girls name but jack was at home sick of a cold and did not visit him during the week  on the following sunday she did not come and the singing seemed suddenly a bitter mockery to harold who sought to solace himself with his pictures the second week wore away and jack came but by that time the image of the girl had taken such aloofness of position in harolds mind that he dared not ask about her even of his loyal chum  at last she came again and when she had finished singing not half has ever been told some prisoner started hand clapping and a volley of applause made the cells resound the girl started in dismay and then as she understood the meaning of this noise a beautiful flush swept over her face and she shrank swiftly into shadow  but a man from an upper cell bawled sing the voice miss sing the voice  the leader of the band said sing for them miss yardwell  again she sang if i were a voice and out of the cells the prisoners crept one by one and at last harold she did not see him till she had finished the last verse and then he stood so close to her he could have touched her and his solemn dark eyes burned so strangely into her face that she shrank away from him in awe and terror she knew himno one else but the ministers son could be so handsome and so refined of feature  youre that voice miss one of the men called out  thats right replied the others in chorus  the girl was abashed but the belief that she was leading these sinners to a merciful saviour exalted her and she sang again harold crept as near as he couldso near he could see her large gray eyes into which the light fell as into a mountain lake every man there perceived the girls divine purity of purpose she was stainless as a summer clouda passionless serene child with the religious impulse strong within her she could not have been more than seventeen years of age and yet so dignified and composed was her attitude she seemed a mature woman she was not large but she was by no means slight and though colorless her pallor was not that of ill health  her body resembled that of a sturdy child straight in the back wide in the waist and meager of bosom  her voice and her eyes subdued the beast in the men an indefinable personal quality ran through her utterance a sadness a sympathy and an intuitive comprehension of the sin of the world unusual in one so young she had been carefully reared that was evident in every gesture and utterance her dress was a studiously plain gray gown not without a little girlish ornament at the neck and bosom every detail of her lovely personality entered harolds mind and remained there he had hardly reached the analytic stage in matters of this kind but he knew very well that this girl was like her song she could die but never deceive he wondered what her first name could be no girl like that would be called dot or cad it ought to be lily or marguerite he was glad to hear one of the girls call her mary  he gazed at her almost without ceasing but as the other convicts did the same he was not observably devoted and whenever she raised her big clear eyes toward him both shrank he from a sense of unworthiness she from the instinctive fear of men which a young girl of her type has deepplanted within her she studied him shyly when she dared and after the first song sang only for him she prayed for him when the band knelt on the stone floor and at night in her room she plead for him before god  the boy was smitten with a sudden sense of his crime not in the way of a repentant sinner but as one who loves a sweet and gentle woman all that his fathers preaching and precept could not do all that the judge jury and prison could not do this slip of a girl did with a glance of her big gray eyes and the tremor of her voice in song all his misdeeds arose up suddenly as a wall between him and the girl singer his hard heart melted the ugly lines went out of his face and it grew boyish once more but sadder than ever  his was not a nature to rest inactive he poured out a hundred questions to jack who could not answer half a dozen of them who is she where does she live do you know her is she a good scholar does she go to church i hope she dont talk religion does she go to parties does she dance  jack replied as well as he was able shes a queer kind of a girl she dont dance or go to parties at all shes an awful fine scholar she sings in the choir most of the boys are afraid to speak to her shes so distant she just says yes or no when you ask her anything shes religiousgoes to prayer meeting and sunday school about a dozen boys go to prayer meeting just because she goes and sings her folks live in waverly but she boards with her aunt mrs brown now thats all i can tell you about her shes in some of my classes but i dassent talk to her  jack shes the best and grandest girl i ever saw im going to write to her  jack wistfully replied i wish you was out o here old man  harold became suddenly optimistic never you mind jack it wont be long till i am im going to write to her today you get a pencil and paper for me quick  jacks admiration of harold was too great to admit of any question of his design he would have said no one else was worthy to tie marys shoe for he too worshiped herbut afar off he was one of those whom women recognize only as gentle and useful beings plain and unobtrusive  he brought the pad and pencil and sat by while the letter was written harolds was not a nature of finedrawn distinctions he wrote as he fought swift and determined and the letter was soon finished read and approved by jack  now dont you let anybody see you give that to her harold said in parting  trust me jack stanchly replied and both felt that here was business of greatest importance jack proceeded at once to walk on the street which led past marys boarding place and hung about the corner in the hope of meeting mary on her return from school he knew very exactly her hours of recitation and at last she came her arms filled with books moving with such stately step she seemed a woman tall and sedate she perceived jack waiting but was not alarmed for she comprehended something of his goodness and timidity  he took off his cap with awkward formality miss yardwell may i speak with you a moment  certainly mr burns she replied quite as formally as he  he fell into step with her and walked on  you knowmy chum he began breathing hard my chum harry excell is in jail you see he had a fight with a great big chap clint slocum and clint struck harry with a whip of course harry couldnt stand that and he cut clint with his knife of course he had to do it for you see clint was big as two of him and hed just badgered the life out of harry for a month and so they jugged harry and hes therein jailand i suppose youve seen him hes a finelooking chap dark hair well built hes a dandy ball player and skates bully i wish you could see him shoot were going out west together when he gets out o jail well he saw you and he liked you and he wrote you a letter and wanted me to hand it to you when no one was looking here it is hide it quick  she took the letter mechanically moved to do so by his imperative voice and action and slipped it into her algebra when she turned to speak jack was gone and she walked on flushed with excitement her breath shortened and quickened she had a fair share of womans love of romance and of letters and she hurried a little in order that she might the sooner read the message of the darkeyed pale boy in the jail  it was well she did not meet mrs brown as she entered for the limpid gray of her eyes was clouded with emotion she climbed the stairs to her room and quickly opened the note it began abruptly      dear friend it is mighty good of you to come and sing to us poor     cusses in jail i hope youll come every sunday i like you you     are the best girl i ever saw dont go to my

with my knife too anyhow they     jugged me for it i dont care id do it again id cut his head     off if he said anything about you well now im in here and im     sorry because i dont want you to think im a tough ive done a     whole lot of things i had not ought to have done but i never meant     to do anyone any harm      now im going west when i get out im going into the cattle     business on the great plains and im going to be a rich man and     then im going to come back i hope you wont get married before     that time for ill have something to say to you if you run across     any pictures of the mountains or the plains i wisht youd send them     on to me next to you i like the life in the plains better than     anything      i hope youll come every sunday till i get out yours respecfly      harold excell      jack will give this to you jack is my chum id trust him with my     life hes all wool  the girl sat a long time with the letter in her hand she was but a child after all and the lads words alarmed and burdened her for the meaning of the letter was plain it was a message of love and admiration and though it contained no subtleties it came from one who was in jail and she had been taught to regard people in jail as lost souls aliens with whom it was dangerous to hold any intercourse save in prayer and scripture the handsome boy with the sad face had appealed to her very deeply and she bore him in her thoughts a great deal but now he came in a new guiseas a lover bold outspoken and persuasive  what shall i do shall i tell aunt lida she asked herself and ended by kneeling down and praying to jesus to give the young man a new heart  in this fashion the courtship went on no one knew of it but jack for mary could not bring herself to confide in anyone not even her mother it all seemed too strange and beautiful it was gods grace working through her and her devoutness was not without its human mixture of girlish pride and exaltation she worshiped him in her natural moments and in her moments of religious fervor she prayed for him with impersonal anguish as for a lost soul she did not consider him a criminal but she thought him godless and rebellious toward his saviour  she wrote him quaint formal little notes which began abruptly my friend they contained much matter which was hortatory but at times she became girlish and very charming gradually she dropped the tone which she had caught from revivalists and wrote of her studies and of the doings of each member of the class and all other subjects which a young girl finds valuable material of conversation she was just becoming acquainted with victor hugo and his resounding antithetic phrases and his humanitarian outcries filled her mind with commotion her heart swelled high with resolution to do something to help the world in general and harold in particular  she was not one in whom passion ruled the intellectual dominated the passional in her and besides she was only a child she was by no means as mature as harold although about the same age naturally reverent she had been raised in a family where religious observances never remitted where grace was always spoken in this home her looks were seldom alluded to in any way and vanity was not in her she had her lovelinesses her hair was long and fair her eyes were beautiful and her skin was of exquisite purity like her eyes her charm lay in her modesty and quaint dignity her grave and gentle gaze and in her glorious voice  the reverend excell was pleased to hear that his son was bearing confinement very well and made another effort to see him simply because mary wished it harold consented to see his father and they held a long conversation at least the father talked and the boy listened in effect the minister said  my son i have forfeited your good willthat i knowbut i think you do me an injustice i know you think i am a liar and a hypocrite because you have seen me in rages and because i have profaned god in your presence my boy let me tell you in every man there are two natures when one is uppermost actions impossible to the other nature become easy you will know this you should know it now for in you there is the same murderous madman that is in me you must fight him down i love you my son he said and his voice was deep and tremulous and it hurts me to have you stand aloof from me i have tried to do my duty i have almost succeeded in putting my worst self under my feet and i think if you were to come to understand me you would not be so hard toward me it is not a little thing to me that you my only son turn your face away from me on the day of your trial i thought we came nearer to an understanding than in many years  harold felt the justice of his fathers plea and his heart swelled with emotion but something arose up between his heart and his lips and he remained silent  mr excell bent his great handsome head and plead as a lover pleads but the pale lad with bitter and sullen mien listened in silence at last the father ended there was a pause  i want you to come home when your term ends he said will you promise that  harold said no i cant do that im going out west  i shall not prevent you my son but i want you to come and take your place at the table just once there is a special reason for this will you come for a single day  harold forced himself to answer yes  mr excell raised his head  let us shake hands over your promise my boy  harold arose and they shook hands the fathers eyes were wet with tears i cant afford to forfeit your good opinion mr excell went on especially now when you are leaving me perhaps forever i think you are right in going there is no chance for you here perhaps out there in the great west you may get a start of my shortcomings as a father you know and i suppose you can never love me as a son should but i think you will see some day that i am not a hypocrite and that i failed as a father more through neglect and passion than through any deliberate injustice  the boy struggled for words to express himself at last he burst forth i dont blame you at all only let me go where i can do something worth while you bother me so  the minister dropped his sons hand and a look of the deepest sadness came over his face he had failedharold was farther away from him than ever he turned and went out without another word  that he had hurt his father harold knew but in exactly what other way he could have acted he could not tell the overanxiety on the fathers part irritated the boy had he been less morbid less selfaccusing he would have won harold passionately loved strength and decision especially in a big man like his father who looked like a soldier and a man of action and who ought not to cry like a woman if only he would act all the time as he did when he threw the sheriff across the walk that day on the street i wish hed stop preaching and go to work at something he said to jack the psychology of the fathers attitude toward him was incomprehensible he could get along very well without a father why could not his father get along without him he hated all this fuss anyway it only made him feel sorry and perplexed and he wished sincerely that his father would let him alone  jack brought a letter from mary which troubled him  i am going home in march a week before the term ends mother isnt very well and just as soon as i can i must go if i do you must not forget me      of course he wrote in reply saying      dont you go till i see you you must come in and see     me cant you come in when jack does he knows all about us     come sure i cant go without a goodby kiss dont you go     back on me now  come  im afraid to come she replied people would find out  everything and talk besides you mustnt kiss me we are not  regularly engaged and so it would not be right      well be engaged in about two minutes if youll meet me with     jack he replied youre the best girl in the world and im     going to marry you when i get rich enough to come back and     build you a house to be in im going out where the cattle     are thick as grasshoppers and im going to be a cattle king     and then you can be a cattle queen and ride around with me on     our ranch thats what they call a farm out there now     youre my girl and you must wait for me to come back dont     you get impatient sometimes a chap has a hard time just to     get a start after that its easy jack will go with me he     will be my friend and share everything      now you come and call me sweetheart and ill call you angel     for thats what you are get to be a great singer and go     about the country singing to make men like me good you can     do it only dont let them fall in love with you they do     that too just the way i did but dont let em do it for you     are mine youre my sweetheart from your sweetheart      harry excell cattle king     chapter vi  the cage opens   before harolds day of freedom came mary was called home by a telegram from her father she longed to see harold before she left but she was too much hurried to seek out jack the loyal gobetween and dared not send a letter by any other hands she went away without sending him a word of goodby  so it happened that the last week of harolds captivity was spent in loneliness and bitter sorrow and even when jack came he brought very little information concerning marys flight and harold was bitter and accusing  why didnt she write to me why didnt she come to see me  jack pleaded for her as well as he was able she hadnt time maybe  harold refused to accept this explanation if she had cared for me shed have sent me wordshe could take time for that  no letter came in the days which followed and at last he put her out of his heart and turned his face to the sunset land which now called to the sad heart within him with imperious voice out there he could forget all his hurts  on the morning when the jailer opened the door for him to leave the iron corridor in which he had spent so many months his father met him and the white face of the boy made the fathers heart contract harolds cheeks were plump and boyish but there was a look in his face which made him seem a youth of twenty  the family stood in the jailers parlor to receive him and he submitted to their caresses with cold dignity his manner plainly expressed this feeling you are all strangers to me but he turned to jack and gripped his hand hard now for the plains  side by side the father and son passed out into the sunshine the boy drew an audible breath as if in sudden keen pain around him lay the bare brown earth of march the sun was warm and a subtle odor of lately uncovered sward was in the air the wind soft warm and steady blew from the west here and there a patch of grass faintly green showed where sullen snow banks had lately lain and the sky filled with clouds almost as fleecy and as white as june the sky covered him and when he raised his eyes to it he saw a triangular flock of geese sweeping to the northwest serene and apparently effortless  he could not speakdid not wish to hear any speech but that of nature and the father seemed to comprehend his sons mood for he too walked in silence  the people of the village knew that harold was to return to freedom that day and with one excuse or another they came to the doors to see him pass some of them were genuinely sympathetic and bowed and smiled intending to say let bygones be bygones but to their greetings harold remained blankly unresponsive jack would gladly have walked with harold but out of consideration for the father fell into step behind  the girlssome of themhad the grace to weep when they saw harolds sad face others tittered and said aint he awful pale for the most part the citizens considered his punishment sufficient and were disposed to give him another chance to them harold by his manner intended to reply i dont want any favors i wont accept any chance from you i despise you and i dont want to see you again  he looked upon the earth and the sky rather than upon the faces of his fellows his natural love of nature had been intensified by his captivity while a bitter contempt and suspicion of all men and women had grown up in his mind he entered his fathers house with reluctance and loathing  the day was one of preparation jack had carried out so far as he well could the captives wishes his gun his clothing and his valise were ready for him and mrs excell had washed and ironed all his linen with scrupulous care his sister maud had made a little housewife for him and filled it with buttons and needles and thread a gift he did not value even from her  im going out west to herd cattle not to cobble trousers he said contemptuously  jack had a report to make harry ive found a chance for you he said when they were alone there was a man moving to colorado here on saturday he said he could use you but of course i had to tell him you couldnt go for a few days hes just about to roseville now ill tell you what you do you get on the train and go to rosevilleill let you have the moneyand you strike him when he comes through his name is pratt hes a tall old chap talks queer of course he may have a hand now but anyway you must get out o here he wouldnt take you if he knew youd been in jail  arent you going asked harold sharply  jack looked uneasy not now harry you see i want to graduate im so near through it wouldnt do to quit now ill stay till fall ill get to uncle johns place about the time you do  harold said no more but his face darkened with disappointment  the call to dinner brought them all together once more and the ministers grace became a short prayer for the safety of his son broken again and again by the weakness of his own voice and by the sobs of maud and mrs excell harold sat with rigid face fixed in a frown the meal proceeded in sad silence for each member of the family felt that harold was leaving them never to return  jacks plan was determined upon and after dinner he went to hitch up his horse to take harry out to the farm the family sat in painful suspense for a few moments after jack went out and then mr excell said  my son we have never been friends and the time is past when i can expect to win your love and confidence but i hope you will not go away with any bitterness in your heart toward me he waited a moment for his son to speak but harold continued silent which again confused and pained the father but he went on in proof of what i say i want to offer you some money to buy a horse and saddle when you need them  i dont need any money said harold a little touched by the affection in his fathers voice i can earn all the money i need  perhaps so but a little money might be useful at the start you will need a horse if you herd cattle  ill get my own horseyoull need all you can earn said harold in reply  mr excells tone changed what makes you say that harold what do you mean  oh i didnt mean anything in particular  have you heard of the faction which is growing up in the church against me  harold hesitated yesbut i wasnt thinking of that particularly he betrayed a little interest whats the matter with em  there has been an element in the church hostile to me from the first and during your trial and sentence these persons have used every effort to spread a feeling against me how wide it is i can not tell but i know it is strong it may end my work here for i will not cringe to them they will find me iron  harolds heart warmed suddenly without knowing it the father had again struck the right note to win his son thats right the boy said dont let em tramp on you  a lump arose in the ministers throat there was something very sweet in harolds sympathy his eyes smiled even while they were dim with tears he held out his hand and harold took it  well now my son its time for you to start dont you worry about me i am a fighter when i am aroused  harold smiled back into his face and so it was that the two men parted for the father in a flash of insight understood that no more than this could be gained but his heart was lighter than it had been for many months as he saw his son ride away from his door  write often harold he called after them  all right you let me know how the fight comes out if they whip you come out west was harolds reply then he turned in his seat drive ahead jack theres no one now but your folks for whom i care  as they drove out along the muddy lanes the hearts of the two boys became very tender harold filled with exaltation by every familiar thingby the flights of ground sparrows by the patches of green grass by the smell of the wind by the infrequent boom of the prairie chickenstalked incessantly  what makes me maddest he broke out is to think theyve cheated me out of seeing one fall and one winter i didnt see the geese fly south and now here they are all going north again some time i mean to find out where they go to he took off his hat this wind will mighty soon take the white out o me wont it he was very gay he slapped his chum on the shoulder and shouted with excitement we must keep going old man till we strike the buffalo they are the sign of wild country that is wild i want to get where there aint any fences  jack smiled sadly in reply harold knew he listened and so talked on i must work up a big case of sunburn before i strike mr pratt for a job did he have extra horses  bout a dozen his girl was driving the cattle but he said  girl what kind of a girl  oh a kind of a tomboy freckledchews gum and says darn it that kind of a girl  harolds face darkened i dont like the idea of that girl she might have heard something and then it would go hard with me  dont you worry the pratts aint the kind of people that read newspapers they didnt stop here but a day anyhow  the sight of mr burns and his wife at the gate moved harold deeply mrs burns came hurrying out you blessed boy get right down and let me hug you and as he leaped down she put her arms around him as if he were her own son and harolds eyes smarted with tears  i declare said mr burns you look like a fightin cock must feed you well down there  no note of doubt hesitation concealment or shame was in their greetings and the boy knew it they all sat around the kitchen and chatted and laughed as if no ill thing had ever happened to him burns uttered the only doubtful word when he said i dont know about this running away from things here id be inclined to stay here and fight it out  but it isnt running away dad said jack harry has always wanted to go west and now is the first time he has really had the chance  thats so admitted the father still im sorry to see him look like he was running away  mrs burns was determined to feed harry into complete torpor she put up enough food in a basket to last him to san francisco at the shortest even when the boys had entered the buggy she ordered them to wait while she brought out some sweet melon pickles in a jar to add to the collection  well now goodby said harold reaching down his hand to mrs burns who seized it in both hers  you poor thing dont let the indians scalp ye  no danger o that he called back  be good to yourself shouted burns and the buggy rolled through the gate into the west as the red sun was setting and the prairie cocks were crowing  the boys talked their plans all over again while the strong young horse spattered through the mud slowly the night fell and as they rode under the branches of the oaks jack took courage to say  i wish miss yardwell had been here harry  its no use talking about her she dont care two straws for me if she had she would have written to me at least  her mother may have been dying  even that neednt keep her from letting me know or sending some word she didnt care for meshe was just trying to convert me  she wasnt the kind of a girl who flirts by jinks you should see her look right through the boys that used to try to walk home with her after prayer meeting they never tried it a second time shes a wonder that way one strange thing about her she never acts like other girls you know what i mean shes different shes going to be a singer and travel around giving concertsshe told me so once  harold was disposed to be fair i dont want anybody to feel sorry for me i suppose she felt that way and tried to help me here he paused and his voice changed but when im a cattle king out west and can buy her the best home in des moinesmaybe she wont pity me so much anyhow theres nothing left for me but to emigrate theres no use stayin around here out there is the place for me now  jack put harold down at the station and turned over to him all the money he had in the world harold took it saying  now youll get this back with interest old man i need it now but i wont six months from now im going to strike a job before longdont you worry  their goodby was awkward and constrained and harold felt the parting more keenly than he dared to show jack rode away cryinga brother could not have been more troubled it seemed that the bitterness of death was in this goodby     chapter vii  on the wing   when harold arose the next morning his cheeks were still red with the touch of the wind and sun and he looked like a college student just entering upon a vacation his grace and dignity of bearing set him apart from the rough workmen with whom he ate and he did not exchange a single word with anyone but the landlord as soon as breakfast was over he went out into the town  roseville had only one street and it was not difficult to learn that pratt had not yet appeared upon the scene it was essentially a prairie village no tree broke the smooth horizon line a great many emigrants were in motion and their whitetopped wagons suggested the sails of minute craft on the broad ocean as they came slowly up the curve to the east and fell away down the slope to the west to all of these harold applied during the days that followed but received no offer which seemed to promise so well as that of mr pratt so he waited at last he came a tall sandybearded fellow who walked beside a fourhorse team drawing two covered wagons tandem behind him straggled a bunch of bony cattle and some horses herded by a girl and a small boy the girl rode a mettlesome little pony sitting sidewise on a mans saddle  wali dn know the old man replied in answer to harolds question i did low fer to get some help but jinnie she said shed bring em along fer fifty cents a day an shes boss stranger if shes sick o the job why ill make out with ye jinnie come here  jinnie rode up eyeing the stranger sharply whats up dad  heres another young fellow after your job  well if hell work cheap he can have it replied the girl promptly i dont admire to ride in this mud any longer  pratt smiled i reckon that lets you in stranger ef we can come to terms we aint got any money to throw away but well do the best we kin  ill tell you what you do you turn that pony and saddle over to me when we get through and ill call it square  well i reckon you wont said the girl throwing back her sunbonnet as if in challenge thats my pony and nobody gets him without blood and dont you forget it sonny  she was a largefeatured girl so blonde as to be strawcolored even to the lashes of her eyes but her teeth were very white and her lips a vivid pink she had her fathers humorous smile and though her words were bluff her eyes betrayed that she liked harold at once  harold smiled back at her well ill take the next best that roan there  the boy burst into wild clamor not by a darn sight you dont thats my horse an no sucker like you aint goin to ride him nuther  why dont you ride him asked harold  the boy looked foolish im goin to some day  he cant said the girl and i dont think you can  pratt grinned wal you see how it is youngster you an me has got to get down to a money basis them young uns claim all my stawk  harold said pay me what you can and pratt replied wal throw your duds into that hind wagon weve got to camp somewhere fore them durn critters eat up all the fences  as harold was helping to unhitch the team the girl came around and studied him with care  say whats your name  moses he instantly replied  moses what  oh let it go at mose  haint you got no other name  i did have but the wind blew it away  what was it  moses n hardluck  youre terrible cute aint you  not so very or i wouldnt be working for my board  you haint never killed yourself with hard work by the looks o them hands  oh ive been going to school  ahuh i thought you had you talk pretty hifalutin fer a real workin man i tell ye what i thinkyoure a rich mans son and youve run away  come gal get that coffee bilin called the mother mrs pratt was a wizened little woman so humped by labor and chills and fever that she seemed deformed her querulousness was not so much illnatured as plaintive  he says his name is mose hardluck harold heard the girl say and that ended all further inquiry he became simply mose to them  there was a satisfying charm to the business of camping out which now came to be the regular order of living to him by day the cattle thin and poor crawled along patiently waiting for feeding time to come catching at such bunches of dry grass as came within their reach and at their heels rode harold on an old black mare his clear voice urging the herd forward at noon and again at night pratt halted the wagons beside the road and while the women got supper or dinner harold helped pratt take care of the stock which he was obliged to feed i started a little airly he said at least a score of times in the first week but i wanted to get a good start agin grass come  harold was naturally handy at camping and his ready and skillful hands became very valuable around the camp fire he was quick and cheerful and apparently tireless and before the end of the week jennie said  say mose you can ride my horse if you want to  much obliged but i guess ill hang on to the black mare  at this point dannie not to be outdone chirped shrilly you can break my horse if you want to  so a few days later harold with intent to check the girl in her growing friendliness as well as to please himself replied i guess ill break dans colt  he began by caressing the horse at every opportunity leaning against him or putting one arm over his back to let him feel the weight of his body at last he leaped softly up and hung partly over his back naturally the colt shied and reared but harold dropped off instantly and renewed his petting and soothing it was not long before the pony allowed him to mount and nothing remained but to teach him to endure the saddle and the bridle this was done by belting him and checking him to a pad strapped upon his back he struggled fiercely to rid himself of these fetters he leaped in the air fell rolled over backing and wheeling around and around till dan grew dizzy watching him  a bystander once said why dont you climb onto him and stay with him till he gets sick o pitchin thats what a broncho buster would do  because i dont want him busted i want him taught that im his friend said harold  in the end jack as harold called the roan walked up to his master and rubbed his nose against his shoulder harold then stripped away the bridle and pad at once and when he put them on next day jack winced but did not plunge and harold mounted him a day or two later the colt worked under the saddle like an old horse thereafter it was a matter of making him a horse of finished education he was taught not to trot but to go directly from the walk to the lope he acquired a swift walk and a sort of running trotthat is he trotted behind and rose in front with a wolflike action of the fore feet he was guided by the touch of the rein on the neck or by the pressure of his riders knee on his shoulder  he was taught to stand without hitching and to allow his rider to mount on either side this was a trick which harold learned of a man who had been with the indians you see he said an injun cant afford to have a horse that will only let him climb on from the nigh side he has to get there in a hurry sometimes and any side at all will do him  it was well that jack was trained early for as they drew out on the open prairie and the feed became better the horses and cattle were less easy to drive each day the interest grew the land became wilder and the sky brighter the grass came on swiftly and crocuses and dandelions broke from the sod on the sunny side of smooth hills the cranes with their splendid challenging cries swept in wide circles through the sky ducks and geese moved by in myriads straight on delaying not foxes barked on the hills at sunset and the splendid chorus of the prairie chickens thickened day by day  it was magnificent and harold was happy true it was not all play there were muddy roads to plod through and treacherous sloughs to cross there were nights when camp had to be pitched in rain and mornings when he was obliged to rise stiff and sore to find the cattle strayed away and everything wet and grimy but the sunshine soon warmed his back and dried up the mud under his feet each day the way grew drier and the flowers more abundant each day signs of the wild life thickened antlers of elk horns of the buffalo crates of bones set around shallow water holes and especially the everthickening game trails furrowing the hills filled the boys heart with delight this was the kind of life he wished to see they were now beyond towns and only occasionally small settlements relieved the houseless rolling plains soon the missouri that storied and muddy old stream would offer itself to view  mose was now indispensable to the pratt outfit he built fires shot game herded the cattle greased the wagons curried horses and mended harness he never complained and never grew sullen although he talked but little the family were fond of him but considered him a singular critter he had lost his pallor his skin was a clear brown and being dressed in rough clothing wide hat and gauntlet gloves he made a bold and dashing herder showing just the right kind of wear and tear occasionally when a chance to earn a few dollars offered pratt camped and took a job and harold shared in the wages  he spent a great deal of his pocket money in buying cartridges for his revolver he shot at everything which offered a taking mark and became so expert that dan bowed down before him and mrs pratt considered him dangerous  it aint natural fer to be so durned surepop on game she said one day doggone it id want o miss em once in a while just fer to be aigged on fer to try again first you know youll be obliged fer to shoot standin on your haid like these yere champin shooters that go round the kentry givin shows you shorely will mose  mose only laughed i want to be just as good a shot as anybody he said turning to pratt  youll be it ef you dont wear out your gun adoin of it replied the boss  these were splendid days each sundown they camped nearer to the land of the buffalo and when the work was done and the supper eaten mose took his pipe and his gun and walked away to some ridge there to sit while the yellow light faded out of the sky he was as happy as one of his restless nature could properly hope to be but sometimes when he thought of mary his heart ached a little he forgot her only when his imagination set wing into the sunset sky  one other thing troubled him a little rude plain jennie was in love with him daily intercourse with a youngster half as attractive as mose would have had the same effect upon her for she was at that age when propinquity makes sentiment inevitable she could scarcely keep her eyes from him during hours in camp and on the drive she rode with him four times as long as he wished for she bothered him and yet she was so good and generous he could not rebuff her he could only endure  she had one accomplishment she could ride like a sioux either astride or womanwise with a saddle or without and many a race they had as the roads grew firm and dry she was scrawny and flatchested but agile as a boy when occasion demanded she was fearless too of man or beast and once when her father became crazy with liquor which was his weakness she went with mose to bring him from a saloon where he stood boasting of his powers as a fighter with the bowie knife  as they entered jennie walked straight up to him dad you come home come right out o yere  he looked at her for a moment until his benumbed brain took in her words and all their meaning then he said all right jinnie just wait a second till i have another horn with these yer gents  horn nawthin she said in reply and seized him by the arm you come along  he submitted without a struggle and on the way out grew plaintive jinnie gal he kept saying im liable to get dry before mornin i shore am ef youd only jest let me had one more gill  oh shet up dad ef you git dry ill bring the hull crick in fer ye to drink was her scornful reply  after he was safe in bed jennie came over to the wagon where mose was smoking  men are the blamedest fools she began abruptly pears like they aint got the sense of a grayback louse leastways some of em now theres dad filled up on stuff they call whisky out yer and consequence is he cant eat any grub for two days or more doggone it it makes me huffy it plum does mam has put up with it fer twenty years which is just twenty more than id stand it and dont you forget it when i marry a man it will be a man with sense nough not to pizen hisself on rotgut whisky  without waiting for a reply she turned away and went to bed in the bottom of the hinder wagon mose smoked his pipe out and rolled himself in his blanket near the smoldering camp fire  pratt was feeble and very long faced and repentant at breakfast his appetite was gone mrs pratt said nothing but pressed him to eat come paw a gill or two o cawfee will do ye good she said cawfee is a great heatoner she said to mose when im so misorified of a moarnin i cant eat a mossel o bacon or pork i kin take a gill o cawfee an it shore helps me much  pratt looked around sheepishly i do reckon i made a plum ejot of myself last night  as ushll snapped jennie you wanted to go slicin every man in sight up just fer to show you could swing a bowie knife when you was on airth the first time  now thats the quare thing mose a peacebbler man than me dont live jinnie says i couldnt lick a hearty bedbug but when i git red liquor into my insides im a terror to near neighbours so they say i cant well remember just what do take place long towards the foth drink  durn lucky you cant youd never hole up your head again a plummer fool you never see said jennie determined to drive his shame home to him  pratt sighed understood perfectly the meaning of all this vituperation well mam well try again i think im doin pretty good when i go two munce dont you  its moren that paw said mrs pratt eager to encourage him at the right moment its sixtyfour days you gained four days on it this time  pratt straightened up and smiled that so mam wal that shorely is a big gain  he took mose aside after breakfast and solemnly said  wimernfolk is a heap bettern menfolks now me or you couldnt stand in wimernfolks what they put up with in menfolks pears like they air finer built someway after a pause he said with great earnestness dont you drink red liquor mose it shore makes a man no account  dont you worry cap im not drinkin liquor of any color     chapter viii  the upward trail   once across the missouri the trail began to mount here is the true buffalo country thought mose as they came to the treeless hills of the great muddy water on these smooth buttes indian sentinels had stood morning and evening through a thousand years to signal the movement of the wild herds and from other distant hills columns of smoke by day or the flare of signal fires at night had warned the chieftains of the approach of enemies down these grassy gulches around these sugarloaf mesas the giant brown cattle of the plains had crawled in long dark knobby lines on the green bottoms they had mated and fed and fought in thousands roaring like lions their huge hoofs flinging the alkaline earth in showers above their heads their tongues curling their tails waving like banners  mose was already deeply learned in all these dramas all that he had ever heard or read of the wild country remained in his mind he cared nothing about the towns or the fame of cities but these deepworn trails of shaggy beasts filled him with joy their histories were more to him than were the wars of cyrus and hannibal he questioned all the men he met and their wisdom became his  slowly the movers wound their way up the broad sandy river which came from the wilder spaces of the west the prairie was gone the tiger lily the sweet williams the pinks together with the luxuriant meadows and the bobolinks were left behind in their stead a limitless upward shelving plain outspread covered with a short surly hairlike grass and certain sturdy resinous plants supporting flowers of an unpleasant odor sticky and weedy bristling cacti bulged from the sod small quakergray sparrows and larks were the only birds in the swales blue joint grew rank the only trees were cottonwoods and cutleaf willow scattered scantily along the elbows in the river  at last they came to the home of the prairie dog and the antelopethe buffalo could not be far away so wide was the earth so allembracing the sky they seemed to blend at the horizon line and lakes of water sprang into view filling a swale in the sodmystic and beautiful only to vanish like cloud shadows  the cattle country was soon at hand cowboys in sombreros and longheeled boots with kerchiefs knotted about their necks careered on swift ponies in and out of the little towns or met the newcomers on the river road they rode in a fashion new to mose with toes pointed straight down the weight of their bodies a little on one side they skimmed the ground like swallows forcing their ponies mercilessly their saddles were very heavy with high pommels and leathercovered stirrups and mose determined to have one at once some of them carried rifles under their legs in a long holster  realizing that those were the real cowpunchers the youth studied their outfits as keenly as a country girl scrutinizes the new gown of a visiting city cousin he changed his manner of riding which was more nearly that of the cavalry to theirs he slung a red kerchief around his neck and bought a pair of chaps a sort of fringed leather leggings he had been wearing his pistol at his side he now slewed it around to his hip he purchased also a pair of highheeled boots and a rope no one called it a lariat and began to acquire the technicalities of the range a horse that reared and leaped to fling its rider was said to pitch any firearm was a gun and any bull steer or heifer a cow in a few days all these distinctions had been mastered and only the closest observer was able to cut out mose as a tenderfoot  pratt was bound for his brothers ranch on the big sandy river and so pushed on steadily although it was evident that he was not looked upon with favor he had reached a section of country where the cattlemen eyed his small outfit with contempt and suspicion he came under the head of a nester or truck farmer who was likely to fence in the river somewhere and homestead some land he was another menace to the range and was to be discouraged the mutter of war was soon heard  one day a couple of whiskyheated cowboys rode furiously up behind mose and called out  where in hl ye think yere goin you dam cow milker  mose was angry on the instant and sullenly said none of your business  after threatening to blow his liver into bits they rode on and repeated their question to pratt who significantly replied im agoin to the mouth o the cannon ball ef i dont miss it any objection  you bet we have you rowdy baggage puller you better keep out o here the climates purty severe  pratt smiled grimly im usen to that boys he replied and the cowboys rode on cursing him for a fool  at last late in july the mouth of the cannon ball was reached one afternoon they cut across a peninsular body of high land and came in sight of a wide green flat between two sluggish percolating streams whereon a cluster of gray log buildings stood  i reckon thats jakes said pratt as they halted to let the horses breathe a minute zigzag line of deep green disclosed the course of the cannon ball deep sunk in the gravelly soil as it came down to join the big sandy all about stood domed and pyramidal and hawkheaded buttes on the river bank huge old cottonwoods worn and leaning offered the only shadow in a land flooded with vehement devouring light the long journey was at an end  daniel raised a peculiar halloo which brought a horseman hurrying out to meet him the brother had not forgotten their boyish signal he rode up swiftly and slid from his horse without speaking  jake resembled his brother in appearance but his face was sterner and his eyes keener he had been made a bold determined man by the pressure of harsher circumstances he shook his brother by the hand in selfcontained fashion  wal danl im right glad you got hyer safe i reckon this is miss jinnieshes a right hearty girl aint she mrs pratt im heartily glad to see ye this yer little man must be the titman whats your name sonny  dan h pratt piped the boy  ahhah wal sir i reckon youll make a right smart of a cowboy yet whats this he said turning to mose this aint no soninlaw i reckon  at this question all laughed jennie most immoderately of all  not yit uncle jake  mose turned red being much more embarrassed than jennie he was indeed enraged for it hurt his pride to be counted a suitor of this ungainly and ignorant girl right there he resolved to flee at the first opportunity distressful days were at hand  youve been a long time gettin here dan  wal weve had some bad luck mam was sick for a spell and then we had to lay by an airn a little money once in a while im glad im herepeared like wed wear the hoofs offn our stawk purty soon jake sobered down first wal now i reckon you best unhook right hyer for a day or two till we get a minute to look around and see where were at so clucking to the tired horses the train entered upon its last half mile of a long journey  jakes wife a somber and very reticent woman with a slender figure and a girlish head met them at the door of the cabin her features were unusually small for a woman of her height and as she shook hands silently mose looked into her sad dark eyes and liked her very much she had no children the two in which she had once taken a mothers joy slept in two little mounds on the hill just above the house she seemed glad of the coming of her sisterinlaw though she did not stop to say so but returned to the house to hurry supper forward  after the meal was eaten the brothers lit their pipes and sauntered out to the stables where they sat down for a long talk mose followed them silently and sat near to listen  now danl jake began im mighty glad youve come and brought this yer young feller we need ye both bad its like thishe paused and looked around i dont want the wimern folks to hear he explained times is goin to be lively here shore theys a big fight on twixt us truck farmers and the cattle ranchers you see the cattlemen has had the free range so long they naturally low they own it and they have the nerve to tell us fellers to keep off they explain smooth enough that they aint got nawthin agin me pussonallyyou understandonly they low me settlin hyer will bring others which is shore about right fer hyer you be kit an caboodle now you comin in will set things awhoopin an it aint no sundayschool picnic were afacin were goin to plant some o these men before this is settled the hull cattle business is built up on robbing the government ive said so an theyre down on me already  as jake talked the night fell and the boys hair began to stir a wolf was yapping on a swell and a faroff heron was uttering his booming cry over the ridges which cut sharply into the fleckless dullyellow sky lay unknown lands out of which almost any variety of fierce marauder might ride surely this was the wild country of which he had read where men could talk so glibly of murder and violent death  when i moved in here three years ago continued jake they met me and told me to get out i told em i werent takin a back track that year one night they rode down awhoopin and ashoutin and i natcherly poked my gun outn the winder and handed out a few to eman they rode off next year quite a little squad o truck farmers moved into the bend just below an we got together and talked it over and agreed to stand by we planted two more o them and they got one on us they control the courts and so we have got to fight theyve got a judge that suits em now and this year will be hotit will sure  danl pratt smoked for a full minute before he said you didnt write nothin of this jake  jake grinned i didnt want to disappoint you dan i knew your heart was set on comin  wal i didnt low fer to hunt up no furss dan slowly said but the feller that tramps on me is liable to sickness  jake chuckled i know that dan but how about this young feller  hes all right he kin shoot like a circus feller and i reckon hell stay right by  mose with big heart said you bet i will  thats the talk well now lets go to bed ive sent word to jennisonhes our captainand tomorrow well settle you on the mouth o the creek just above here its a monstrous fine piece o ground i know youll like it  mose slept very little that night he found himself holding his breath in order to be sure that the clamor of a coyote was not a cowboy signal of attack there was something vastly convincing in jake pratts quiet drawl as he set forth the cause for war  early the next morning jennison the leader of the settlers came riding into the yard he was tall grim lipped and curt spoken he had been a captain in the union army of volunteers and was plainly a man of inflexible purpose and resolution  how de do gentlemen he called pleasantly as he reined in his foaming broncho nice day  mighty purty light off capn an shake hands with my brother danl  jennison dismounted calmly and easily dropping the rein over the head of his wild broncho and after shaking hands all around said  well neighbor im right glad to see ye jake your brother has been savin up a homestead for yeand i reckon hes told you that a mighty purty fight goes with it you see its this way the man that has the water has the grass and the circle for by fencing in the river here controls the grass for twenty miles they can range the whole country nobody else can touch em williams of the circle bar controls the river for twenty miles here and has fenced it in of course he has no legal right to more than a section or two of itall the rest is a stealthe v t outfit joins him on the west and so on they all stand to keep out settlementany kindand theyll make a fight on youthe thing for you to do is move right in on the flat jake has picked out for you and meet all comers  to this pratt said pears to me captain that id better see if i cant make some peaceabler arrangement  weve tried all peaceable means replied jennison impatiently the fact is the whole cattle business as now constituted is a steal it rests on a monopoly of government land its got to go settlement is creeping in and these big ranges which these cattle kings have held must be free there is a war due between the sheepmen and the cattlemen too and our lay is to side in with the sheepmen they are mainly mexicans but their fight is our feast  as day advanced men came riding in from the cannon ball and from far below on the big sandy and under jennisons leadership the wires of the williams fence were cut and daniel pratt moved to the creek flat just above his brothers ranch axes rang in the cottonwoods and when darkness came the building of a rude farmlike cabin went on by the light of big fires mose in the thick of it was aquiver with excitement the secrecy the haste the glory of flaring fires the almost silent swarming of black figures filled his heart to the brim with exultation he was satisfied rapt with it as one in the presence of heroic music  but the stars paled before the dawn the coyotes changed their barking to a solemn wail as though day came to rob them of some irredeemable joy a belated prairie cock began to boom and then tired sleepy and grimy the men sat down to breakfast at jacob pratts house the deed had been done daniel had entered the lions den  now said jennison grimly well just camp down here in jakes barn to sleep and if you need any help let us know  the pratts continued their work and by noon a habitable shack was ready for mrs pratt and the children in the afternoon mose and daniel slept for a few hours while jake kept watch the day ended peacefully but jennison and one or two others remained to see the newcomer through a second night  they sat around a fire not far from the cabin and talked quietly of the most exciting things the question of indian outbreaks came up and jennison said we wont have any more trouble with the indians the regulars has broken their backs they cant do anything now but die  they hated to give up this land here said a small dark man i used to hear em talk it a whole lot they made out a case  hank lived with em four years jennison explained to daniel pratt  the indians are a good deal better than we give em credit for bein said another man i lived next em in minnesota and i never had no trouble  jennison said decisively oh i guess if you treat em right they treat you right aint that their way hank  well you see its like this said the hairy little man theyre kind o suspicious nacherly of the white manthey cant understand what he says and they dont get his drift always they make mistakes that way but they mean all right of course they have young pluguglies amongst em jest the same as mongst any other cmunity but the majority of em druther be peaceful with their neighbors what makes em wildest is seein the buffalo killed off its like you havin your water right cut off  as the talk went on mose squatted there silently receiving instruction his eyes burned through the dusk as he listened to the dark little man who spoke with a note of authority and decision in his voice his words conveyed to mose a conception of the indian new to him these red devils were people in this mans talk they were husbands and fathers and sons and brothers they loved these lands for which the cattlemen and sheepmen were now about to battle and they had been dispossessed by the power of the united states army not by law and justice a desire to know more of them to see them in their homes to understand their way of thinking sprang up in the boys brain  he edged over close to the plainsman and in a pause in the talk whispered to him i want you to tell me more about the indians  the other man turned quickly and said boy theyre my friends in a showdown im on their side my father was a halfbreed  the night passed quietly and nearly all the men went home leaving the pratts to meet the storm alone but jennison had a final word you send your boy to yon butte and wave a hat any time during the day and well come side arms ready ill keep an eye on the butte all day and come up and see you tonight dont let em get the drop on ye  it was not until the third day that williams riding the line in person came upon the new settler he sat upon his horse and swore his face was dark with passion but after a few minutes pause he drew rein and rode away  another butter maker he said to his men as he slipped from the saddle at his own door some ten miles up the river  where  next to pratts i reckon its that brother o his hes been talking about they cut my wires and squatted on the rosebud flat  give the word and well run em out said one of his men every sonofagun of em  williams shook his head no that wont do wve got to go slow in rippin these squatters out o their holes they anchor right down to the roots of the tree of life i reckon weve got to let em creep in well scare em all we can before they settle but when they settle weve got to go around em if the man was a stranger we might do something but jake pratt dont bluffbesides boys ive got worse news for you  whats that  a couple of mexicans with five thousand sheep crossed lizard creek yesterday  the boys leaped to their feet variously crying out oh come off it cant be true  it is truei saw em myself insisted williams  well that means war does the v t outfit know it  i dont think so weve got to stand together now or well be overrun with sheep the truck farmers are a small matter compared to these cursed greasers  i guess wed better send word up the river hadnt we asked his partner  yes we want to let the whole county know it  cheyenne county was an enormous expanse of hilly plain if the two words may be used together low heights of sharp ascent pyramidshaped buttes and wide benches cut here and there by small creek valleys made up its surface which broadly considered was only the vast treeless slowlyrising eastern slope of the rocky mountains at long distances on the flat sandy river groups of squat and squalid ranch buildings huddled as if to escape the wind for years it has been a superb range for cattle and up till the coming of the first settlements on the cannon ball it had been parceled out among a few big firms who cut government timber dug government stone and pastured on government grass when the wolves took a few ponies the ranchers seized the opportunity to make furious outcry and bring in the government troops to keep the indians in awe and so possessed the land in serenity nothing could be more perfect more commodious  but for several years before the coming of the pratts certain other ominous events were taking place over the mountains from the west or up the slope from new mexico enormous herds of small greasy sheep began to appear they were walking for better pasture and where they went they destroyed the grasses and poisoned the ground with foul odors cattle and horses would not touch any grass which had been even touched by these illsmelling woolly creatures there had been illfeeling between sheepmen and cattlemen from the first but as water became scarcer and the range more fully stocked bitterness developed into hatred and warfare sheep herders were considered outcasts and of no social account to kill one was by some considered a kindness for it ended the misery of a man who would go crazy watching the shifting crawling maggots anyway it was bad enough to be a cow milker but to be a sheep herder was living death  these herds thickened from year to year they followed the feed were clipped once sometimes twice and then were headed back to winter in the south dying in myriads on the wayonly to reappear augmented in numbers the succeeding year they were worthless as mutton and at first were never shipped but as the flocks were graded up the best were culled and sent to eastern markets they menaced the cattlemen in the west and south while the rancher made slow but inexorable advance on the east as the cattleman came to understand this his face grew dark and sullen but thus far no herd had entered the big sandy range though williams feared their coming and was ready to do battle  at the precise time that daniel pratt was entering cheyenne county from the east a mexican sheepman was moving toward the cannon ball from the southwest walking behind ten thousand sheep leaving a dusty bare and stinking trail behind him williams report drew the attention of the cattlemen and the pratts were for the time forgotten  a few days after daniels assault on the fences of the big ranch a conference of cattlemen met and appointed a committee to wait upon the owner of the approaching flock of sheep the pratts heard of this and for reasons of their own determined to be present mose eager to see the outcome of these exciting movements accompanied the pratts on their ride over the hills  they found the man and his herders encamped on the bank of a little stream in a smooth and beautiful valley he had a covered wagon and a small tent and a team of hobbled horses was feeding near before the farmers had time to cross the stream the cattlemen came in sight riding rapidly and the pratts waited for them to come up as they halted on the opposite bank of the stream the sheep owner came out of his tent with a rifle in his arm and advanced calmly to meet them  good evening gentlemen he called pleasantly but the slant of his chin was significant he was a tall thin man with a long beard he wore an ordinary sombrero with wide stiff brim a gray shirt and loose gray trousers at his belt and significantly in front and buttoned down hung two splendid revolvers aside from these weapons he looked like a clergyman camping for the summer  hitching their horses to the stunted willow and cottonwood trees the committee approached the tent and williams of circle bar became spokesman we have come he said to make a statement we are peaceably disposed but would like to state our side of the case the range into which you are walking your sheep is already overstocked with cattle and horses and we are going to suffer for you know very well cattle will not follow sheep the coming of your flock is likely to bring others and we cant stand it we have come to ask you to keep off our range we have been to big expense to build sheds and fences and we cant afford to have sheep thrown in on us  to this the sheepman made calm reply he said gentlemen all that you have said is true but it does not interest me this land belongs as much to me as to you by law you can hold only one quarter section each by squatters right that right i shall respect but no more i shall drive my sheep anywhere on grounds not actually occupied by your feeding cattle neither you nor i have much more time to do this kind of thing the small settler is coming westward until he comes i propose to have my share of government grass  the meeting grew stormy williams of circle bar counselled moderation others were for beginning war at once if this man is looking for trouble he can easily find it one of them said  the sheepman grimly replied i have the reputation in my country of taking care of myself he drew a revolver and laid it affectionately in the hollow of his folded left arm i have two of these and in a mixup with me somebody generally gets hurt  there was deadly serenity in the strangers utterance and the cowboys allowed themselves to be persuaded into peace measures though some went so far as to handle guns also they withdrew for a conference and jake said stranger were with you in this fight were truck farmers at the mouth o the cannon ball my name is pratt  the sheepman smiled pleasantly mighty glad to know you mr pratt my name is delmar  this is my brother dan said jake and this is his herder  when mose took the small firm hand of the sheepman and looked into his face he liked him and the stranger returned his liking your fight is mine gentlemen he said these cattlemen are holding back settlement for their own selfish purposes  williams returning at this point began speaking but with effort and without looking at delmar we dont want any fuss so i want to make this proposition you take the north side of the cannon ball above the main trail and well keep the south side and all the grass up to the trail thatll give you range enough for your herd and will save trouble weve had all the trouble we want i dont want any gunwork myself  to this the stranger said very well ill go look at the ground if it will support my sheep ill keep them on it i claim to be a reasonable man also and ive had troubles in my time and now with a family growing up on my hands im just as anxious to live peaceable with my fellowcitizens as any man but i want to say to you that im a mean man when you try to drive me  thereupon he shook hands with williams and several others of the older men after most of the cattlemen had ridden away jake said well now well be glad to see you over at our shack at the mouth o the cannon ball he held out his hand and the sheepman shook it heartily as he was saying goodby the sheep owners eyes dwelt keenly on mose youngster youre a good ways from home and mother  mose blushed as became a youth and said im camping in my hat these days  the sheepman smiled so am i but ive got a wife and two daughters back in santy fay come and see me i like your build well gentlemen just call on me at any time you need me ill see that my sheep dont trouble you  all right you do the same replied the pratts  you fellows hold the winning hand said delmar the small rancher will sure wipe the sheepman out in time ive got sense enough to see that you cant fight the progress of events youngster you belong to the winning side he ended turning to mose but its the unpopular side just now  all this was epic business into which to plunge a boy of eighteen whose hot blood tingled with electric fire at sight of a weapon in the hands of roused and resolute men he redoubled his revolver practice and through daniels gossip and especially through the boasting of jennie his skill with the revolver soon became known to delmar who invited him to visit him for a trial of skill i used to shoot a little myself he said come over and well try conclusions  out of this friendly contest the youth emerged very humble the old sheepman dazzled him with his cunning he shot equally well from either hand he could walk by a tree wheel suddenly and fire both revolvers over his shoulders putting the two bullets within an inch of each other thats for use when a man is sneaking onto you from behind he explained i never used it but once but it saved my life he could fire two shots before mose could get his pistol from his holster a gun is of no use youngster unless you can get it into action before the other man sling your holster in front and tie it down when youre going to war and never let a man come to close quarters with you the secret of success is to be just a half second ahead of the other man it saves blood too  his hands were quick and sure as the rattlesnakes black forked tongue he seemed not to aimhe appeared to shoot from his fist rather than from the extended weapon and when he had finished mose said  im much obliged mr delmar i see i didnt know the a b csbut you try me again in six months  the sheepman smiled youve got the stuff in you youngster if you ever get in a serious place and im in reaching distance let me know and ill open a way out for you meanwhile i can make use of you as you are i need another man my mexicans are no company for me come over and help me ill pay you well and you can have the same fare that i eat myself i get lonesome as the old boy  thus it came about that mose without realizing it became that despised forlorn thing a sheep herder he made a serious social mistake when he lined up with the truck farmers the tenderfeet and the greaser sheep herders and cut out a great gob of trouble for himself in cheyenne county  he admired delmar most fervidly and liked him there was a quality in his speech which appealed to the eagles heart in the boy the pratts no longer interested him they had settled down into farmers they had nothing for him to do but plow and dig roots for which he had no love he had not ridden into this wild and splendid country to bend his back over a spade one day he accepted delmars offer and rode home to get his few little trinkets and to say goodby  another reason why he had accepted delmars offer lay in the growing annoyance of jennies courtship she made no effort to conceal her growing passion she put herself in his way and laid hands on him with unblushing frankness her love chatter wearied him beyond measure and he became cruelly short and evasive her speech grew sillier as she lost her tomboy interests and mose avoided her studiously  that night as he rode up daniel was at the barn to him mose repeated delmars offer  pratt at once said i dont blame ye fer pullin out mose i done the best i could considerin cose i cant begin fer to pay ye the wages delmar can but be keerful trouble is comin shore pop and id hate to have ye killed on the wimmens account they pear to think more o you than they do o me  jennies eyes filled with tears when mose told her of his new job she looked very sad and wistful and more interesting than ever before in her life as she came out to say goodby  well mose i reckon youre goin for good  not so very far he said in generous wish to ease her over the parting  youll come round once in a while wont ye  why sure its only twenty miles over to the camp  come over sundays an well have potpie and soda biscuits fer ye she said with a feminine reliance on the power of food  all right he replied with a smile and abruptly galloped away  his heart was light with the freedom of his new condition he considered himself a man now his wages were definite and no distinction was drawn between him and delmar himself besides the immense flock of sheep interested him at first  his duties were simple by day he helped to guide the sheep gently to their feeding and in their search for water by night he took his turn at guarding from wolves his sleep was broken often even when not on guard they were such timid folk these sheep their fears passed easily into destructive precipitances  but the night watch had its joys as the sunlight died out of the sky and the blazing stars filled the deep blue air above his head the world grew mysterious and majestic as well as menacing the wolves clamored from the buttes which arose on all sides like domes of a sleeping city crickets cried in the grass drowsily and out of the dimness and dusk something vast like a passion too great for words fell upon the boy he turned his face to the unknown west there the wild creatures dwelt there were the beings who knew nothing of books or towns and toil there life was governed by the ways of the wind the curve of the streams the height of the treestherejust over the edge of the plain the mountains dwelt waiting for him  then his heart ached like that of a young eagle looking from his natal rock into the dim valley miles below at such times the youth knew he had not yet reached the land his heart desired all this was only resting by the way  at such times too in spite of all he thought of mary and of jack they alone formed his attachments to the east all else was valueless to have had them with him in this land would have put his heart entirely at rest     chapter ix  war on the cannon ball   the autumn was very dry and as the feed grew short on his side of the cannon ball delmar said to his boss herder drive the herd over the trail keeping as close to the boundary as you can the valley through which the road runs will keep us till november i reckon  of this mose knew nothing and when he saw the sheep drifting across the line he set forth to turn them the herder shouted hold on mose let em go  mose did as he was ordered but looked around nervously expecting a charge of cattlemen delmar laughed dont worry they wont make any trouble  a couple of days later a squad of cowboys came riding furiously over the hill see here they called to mose you turn that stinkin river of sheep back over the line  mose shouted a reply im not the boss go talk to him and say youd better change your tune when you whistle into his ear  oh hell said one contemptuously its that tenderfoot of pratts they rode to the older herder who laughed at them settle with the old man he said im under orders to feed these sheep and im goin to do it  you take them sheep back on your range or you wont have any to feed said one of the cowboys  the herder blew a whiff from his lips as if blowing away thistle down run away little ones you disturb my siesta  with blistering curses on him and his sheep the cowboys rode to the top of the hill and there turning fired twice at the herder wounding him in the arm the mexican returned the fire but to no effect  when mose reported this delmars eyebrows drew down over his hawklike eyes thats all right he said ominously if they want war theyll get it  a few days later he rode over toward the circle bar ranch house on the way he overtook williams riding along alone williams did not hear delmar till he called sharply throw up your hands  williams quickly complied dont shootfor gods sake he called with his hands quivering above his head he had heard of delmars skill with weapons  mr williams delmar began with sinister formality your men have been shooting my herders  not by my orders mr delmar i never sanction  see here williams you are responsible for your cowboys just as i am for my mexicans its lowdown business for you to shoot my men who are working for me at fifteen dollars a month im the responsible partyim the man to kill i want to say right here that i hold you accountable and if your men maim one of my herders or open fire on em again ill hunt you down and kill you like a wolf now ride on and if you look back before you top that divide ill put a bullet through you goodday  williams rode away furiously and was not curious at all he topped the divide without stopping delmar smiled grimly as he wheeled his horse and started homeward  on the same day as mose was lying on the point of a grassy mesa watching the sheep swarming about a water hole in the valley below he saw a cloud of dust rising far up to the north while he wondered he heard a wild rumbling trampling sound could it be a herd of buffalo his blood thrilled with the hope of it his sheep were forgotten as the roar increased and wild yells came faintly to his ears as he jerked his revolver from its holder around the end of the mesa a herd of wild horses swept swift as antelope with tails streaming with eyes flashing and behind them urging them on whooping yelling shooting came a band of cowboys their arms flopping their kerchiefs streaming  a gasping shout arose from below the sheep the sheep mose turned and saw the other herders rushing for their horses he realized then the danger to the flock the horses were sweeping like a railway train straight down upon the gray dusty hot river of woolly flesh mose shuddered with horror and pitya moment later and the drove led by a powerful and vicious brown mare drove like a wedge straight into the helpless herd and leaping plunging kicking stumbling the powerful and swift little bronchos crossed careering on down the valley leaving hundreds of dead wounded and mangled sheep in their path the cowboys swept on after them with exultant whooping firing their revolvers at the mexican herders who stood in a daze over their torn and mangled herd  when mose recovered from his stupefaction his own horse was galloping in circles his picket rope dragging and the boss herder was swearing with a belated malignity which was ludicrous he swept together into one steady outpour all the native and alien oaths he had ever heard in a long and eventful career among profane persons when mose recovered his horse and rode up to him jose was still swearing he was walking among the wounded sheep shooting those which he considered helplessly injured his mouth was dry his voice husky and on his lips foam lay in yellow flecks he ceased to imprecate only when by repetition his oaths became too inexpressive to be worth while  moses heart was boyishly tender for any animal and to see the gentle creatures mangled writhing and tumbling uttering most piteous cries touched him so deeply that he wept he had no inclination to swear until afterward when the full knowledge that it was a trick and not an accident came to him he started at once for the camp to carry the black news  delmar did not swear when mose told him what had happened he saddled his horse and buckling his revolvers about him said come on youngster im going over to see about this  mose felt the blood of his heart thicken and grow cold there was a deadly resolution in delmars deliberate action prevision of a bloody fray filled the boys mind but he could not retreat he could not let his boss go alone into an enemys country therefore he rode silently after  delmar galloped steadily on toward the circle bar ranch house mile after mile was traversed at steady gallop till the powerful little ponies streamed with salty sweat at last delmar drew rein and allowed mose to ride by his side  you neednt be alarmed he said in a kindly tone these hounds wont shoot theyre going to evade it but i shall hold em to ittrust me my boy  as they topped a ridge and looked down into willow creek where the ranch house stood several horsemen could be seen riding in from the opposite side and quite a group of men waited delmars approach and every man was armed each face wore a look of constraint though one man advanced hospitably good afternoon gentlemen ride your horses right into the corral and the boysll take the saddles off  where is williams asked delmar as he slid from his horse  gone to town anything i can do for you im his boss  you tell mr williams said delmar with menacing calm i came to tell him that a drove of horses belonging partly to you and partly to hartley of the horseshoe were stampeded through my sheep yesterday killing over two hundred of them  conrad replied softly i know i know i just heard of it too bad but you understand how it is herds get going that way and you cant stop em nor head em off  your men didnt try to head em off  how about that boys inquired conrad turning to the younger men  a long freckled grinning ape stepped forward  well it was this way we was atryin to head the herd off and we didnt see the sheep till we was right into em  thats a lie said mose you drove the horses right down the valley into the sheep i saw you do it  you call me a liar and ill blow your heart out shouted the cowboy dropping his hand to his revolver  halt said delmar easy now you young cockalorum it aint useful to start shooting where andrew delmar is  conrad spoke sharply jim shut up turning to mose where did it happen  in boulder creek just south of the road  conrad turned to delmar in mock surprise south of the road your sheep must o strayed over the line mr delmar as they was on our side of the range i dont see that i can do anything for you if theyd been on the north side  thatll do interrupted delmar i told you that so long as the north side fed my sheep i would keep them there to accommodate your stockmen i give notice now that i shall feed where i please and i shall be with my sheep night and day and the next man that crosses my sheep will leave his bones in the grass with the dead sheep and likely a horse or two besides he stepped toward conrad williams has had his warning i give you yours i hold you responsible for every shot fired at my men if one of my men is shot ill kill you and williams at sight goodday  whatll we do called one of the cowboys  delmar turned and his eyes took on a wild glare  ill send you to hell so quick you wont be able to open your mouth throw up your hands the mans hands went up why id earmark ye and slit each nostril for a leather button  conrad strove for peace be easy on him delmar hes a crazy fool anyway he dont know you  he will after this said delmar ill trouble you mr conrad to collect all the guns from your men mose drew his revolver my boy here is handy too i dont care to be shot in the back as i ride away drop your guns every scab of ye  ill be dd if i do  drop it snapped out delmar and the tone of his voice was terrible to hear moses heart stopped beating he held his breath expecting the shooting to begin  conrad was white with fear as he said give em up boys hes a desperate man dont shoot you fools  one by one with a certain amount of bluster on the part of two the cowboys dropped their guns and delmar said gather em in mose  mose leaped from his horse and gathered the weapons up delmar thrust the revolvers into his pockets and handed one winchester to mose  youll find your guns on that rise beside yon rock said delmar and when we meet again it will be merry war goodday  an angry man knows no line of moderation delmar having declared war carried it to the door of the enemy accompanying the sheep himself he drove them into the fairest feedingplaces beside the clearest streams he spared no pains to irritate the cattlemen and mose who alone of all the outsiders realized to the full his terrible skill with weapons looked forward with profound dread to the fight which was sure to follow  he dreaded the encounter for another reason he had no definite plan of action to follow in his own case a dozen times a day he said to himself am i a coward his stomach failed him and he ate so sparingly that it was commented upon by the more hardened men he was the greater troubled because a letter from jack came during this stormy time wherein occurred this paragraph mary came back to the autumn term her mother is dead and she looks very pale and sad she asked where you were and said please tell him that i hope he will come home safe and that i am sorry i could not see him before he went away  all the bitterness in his heart long stored up against her passed away in a moment and sitting there on the wide plain under the burning sun he closed his eyes in order to see once more in the cold gray light of the prison that pale grave girl with the glorious eyes he saw her too as jack saw her her gravity turned into sadness her pallor into the paleness of grief and ill health he admitted now that no reason existed why she should write to him while her mother lay dying all cause for hardness of heart was passed away the tears came to his eyes and he longed for the sight of her face for a moment the boys wild heart grew tender  he wrote her a letter that night and it ran as well as he could hope for as he reread it next day on his way to the post office twenty miles away      dear mary jack has just sent me a long letter and has told     me what you said i hope you will forgive me i thought you     didnt want to see me or write to me i didnt know your     mother was sick i thought you ought to have written to me     but of course i understand now i hope you will write in     answer to this and send your picture to me you see i never     saw you in daylight and im afraid ill forget how you look      well im out in the wild country but it aint what i     want i dont like it here the cowboys are all the time     rowin there aint much game here neither i kill an     antelope once in a while or a deer down on the bottoms but     i havent seen a bear or a buffalo yet i want to go to the     mountains now this country is too tame for me they say you     can see the rockies from a place about one hundred miles from     here some day im going to ride over there and take a     look i havent seen any indians yet we are likely to have     shooting soon      if you write address to running bear cheyenne county and     ill get it ill go down again in two weeks since jack     wrote i want to see you awful bad but of course it cant be     done so write me a long letter                                      yours respectfully                                                     harold excell      address your letter to mose harding they dont know my real     name out here ill try to keep out of trouble  he arrived in running bear just at dusk and went straight to the post office which was in an illsmelling grocery nothing more forlornly disreputable than the beast as the cowboys called the town existed in the state it was built on the low flat of the big sandy and was composed of log huts beginning already to rot at the corners and unpainted shanties of pine gray as granite under wind and sun there were two hotels where for two bits one could secure a dish of evilsmelling ham and eggs and some fried potatoes and there were six saloons where one could secure equally evilminded whisky at ten cents a glass a couple of rude groceries completed the necessary equipment of a cowtown  there was no allurement to vice in such a place as this so far as mose was concerned but a bunch of cowboys had just ridden in for a good time and to reach the post office he was forced to pass them they studied him narrowly in the dusk and one fellow said  thats delmars sheep herder lets have some fun with him lets convert him  oh let him alone hes only a kid  kid hes big as hell ever be im goin to string him a few when he comes out  moses breath was very short as he posted his letter for trouble was in the air he tried his revolvers to see that they were free in their holsters and wiped the sweat from his hands and face with his big bandanna he entered into conversation with the storekeeper hoping the belligerent gang would ride away they had no such intention but went into a saloon next door to drink keeping watch for mose one of them a slim consumptivechested man grew drunk first he was entirely harmless when sober and served as the butt of all jokes but the evil liquor paralyzed the small knot of gray matter over his eyes and set loose his irresponsible lower centers he threw his hat on the ground and defied the world in a voice absurdly large and strenuous  his thin arms swung aimlessly and his roaring voice had no more heart in it than the blare of a tin horn his eyes wandered from face to face in the circle of his grinning companions who egged him on  his insane reeling capers vastly amused them one or two almost as drunk as he occasionally wrestled with him and they rolled in the dust like dirty bear cubs they were helpless so far as physical struggle went but unfortunately shooting was a second nature to them and their hands were deadly  as mose came out to mount his horse the crowd saw him and one vicious voice called out  here bill heres a sheep walker can do you up  the crowd whooped with keen delight and streaming over surrounded mose who stood at bay not far from his horse in the darknessa sudden numbness in his limbs  what do you want o me he asked ive nothing to do with you he knew that this crowd would have no mercy on him and his heart almost failed him  heres a man wants to lick you replied one of the herders  the drunken man was calling somewhere in the crowd where is he lemme get at him the ring opened and he reeled through and up to mose who was standing ominously quiet beside his horse bill seized him by the collar and said you want o fight  no said mose too angry at the crowd to humor the drunken fool you take him away or hell get hurt  oh he will will he  go for him bill yelled the crowd in glee  the drunken fool gave mose a tug come ere he said with an oath  let go o me said mose his heart swelling with wrath  the drunken one aimlessly cuffed him then the bloodred film dropped over the young eagles eyes he struck out and his assailant went down then his revolvers began to speak and the crowd fell back they rolled leaped or crawled to shelter and when the bloody mist cleared away from his brain mose found himself in his saddle his swift pony galloping hard up the street with pistols cracking behind him his blood was still hot with the murderous rage which had blinded his eyes he did not know whether he had begun to shoot first or not he did not know whether he had killed any of the ruffians or not but he had a smarting wound in the shoulder from which he could feel the wet warm blood trickling down  once he drew his horse to a walk and half turned him to go back and face the mob which he could hear shouting behind him but the thought of his wound and the fear that his horse had also been hit led him to ride on he made a detour on the plain and entered a ravine which concealed him from the town and there alighted to feel of his horses limbs fearing each moment to come upon a wound but he was unhurt and as the blood had ceased to flow from his own wound the youth swung into his saddle and made off into the darkness  he heard no sound of his pursuers but nevertheless rode on rapidly keeping the west wind in his face and watching sharply for fences at length he found his way back to the river trail and the horse galloped steadily homeward as he rode the boy grew very sad and discouraged he had again given away to the spirit of murder again he had intended to kill and he seemed to see two falling figures one the man he had smitten with his fist the other one whose revolver was flashing fire as he fell  then he thought of mary and the sad look in her eyes when she should hear of his fighting again she would not be able to get at the true story she would not know that these men attacked him first and that he fought in selfdefense he thought of his father also with a certain tenderness remembering how he had stood by him in his trial who will stand by me now he asked himself and the thought of the pratts helped him delmar he felt sure would defend him but he knew the customs of the cattle country too well to think the matter ended there he must hereafter shoot or be shot if these men met him again he must disable them instantly or die hadnt i better just keep right on riding he kept asking some sense within him but decided at last to return to delmar  it was deep night when he reached the camp and his horse was covered with foam delmar was sitting by the camp fire as he came in from the dark  hello boy whats up  mose told him the whole story in a few incoherent phrases the old man examined and dressed his wound but remained curiously silent throughout the story at last he said see here my lad let me tell you this is serious business i dont mean this scratch of a bulletdont you be uneasy about that but this whole row is mine they havent any grudge against you but youre a sheep herder for me and that is bad business just now if youve killed a man theyll come arippin up here about daylight with a warrant you cant get justice in this country youll face a cowboy jury and itll go hard with you theres just one thing to do youve got to git right close to where the west winds come from and do it quick throw the saddles on bone and rusty and well hit the trail i know a man wholl take care of you  he whistled a signal and one of the herders came in send pablo here he said now roll up any little trinkets that you want to take with you he said a few minutes later as they were saddling the two bronchos you cant afford to stay here and face this thing i had no business to set you on the wrong side i knew better all the time but i liked you and  the herder came in pablo im going across country on a little business if anybody comes asking for me or mose here say you dont know where we went but that you expect us back about noon be ready to shoot today some of these cowboys may try to stampede you again while im gone  you better stay and look after the sheep began mose as they started away you cant afford  oh to hell with the sheep i got you into this scrape and ill see you out of it  as they galloped away leading moses worn pony delmar continued youre too young to start in as a killer youve got somebody back in the states who thinks youre out here making a man of yourself and i like you too well to see you done up by these dirty cowcountry lawyers im going to quit the country myself after this fall shipment and i want you to come down my way some time you better stay up here till spring  they rode steadily till daylight and then delmar said now i think youre perfectly safe for this reason these cusses know you came into the country with pratt and theyll likely ride over and search the cannon ball settlement ill ride around that way and detain em awhile and make em think youre hiding out while you make tracks for upper country you keep this river trail dont ride too hard as if you was runnin away but keep a steady gait and give your horse one hour out o four to feed heres a little snack dont waste time but slide along without sleeping as long as you can  youll come in sight of the mountains about noon and youll see a big bunch o snowpeaks off to the left make straight for that and after you go about one day bear sharp to the left begin to inquire for bob reynolds on the arickareeeverybody knows bob just give him this note and tell him the whole business hell look out for you now goodby boy im sorrybut my intentions were good  mose opened his heart at last i dont like to desert you this way mr delmar he said it aint right id rather stay and fight it out  i wont have it replied delmar  youre going to have a lot of trouble  dont you worry about me and dont you feel streaked about pulling your freight you started wrong on the cannon ball bob will put you right the cattlemen will rule there for some years yet and you keep on their side now goodby lad and take care of yourself  moses voice trembled as he took delmars hand and said goodby mr delmar im awfully obliged to you  thats all rightnow git  mose once more on his own horse galloped off to the west his heart big with love for his stern benefactor delmar sat on his horse and watched the boy till he was diminished to a minute spot on the dim swells of the plain then he wiped a little moisture from his eye with the back of his brown small hand and turned his horses head to the east     chapter x  the young eagle mounts   after the momentary sorrow of parting from his good friend delmar the youths heart began to expand with joy he lifted his arms and shook them as the young eagle exults he was alone on the wide swells of plain enacting a part of the wild life of which he had read and for which he had longed he was riding a swift horse straight toward the mystic mountains of the west leaving behind him the miserable wars of the sheep herders and the cattlemen every leap of his sturdy pony carried him deeper into the storied land and farther from the tumult and shame of the night at running bear  he was not one to morbidly analyze not even to feel remorse he put the past behind him easily before him small grasshoppers arose in clapping buzzing clouds prairie dogs squeaked and frisked and dived needlessly into their dens hawks sailed like kites in the glorious golden hazy air and on the firm sod the feet of his pony steadily drummed once a band of antelope crossed a swale running in silence jerkily like a train of some singular automatons moved by sudden uneven impulses of power the deepworn buffalo trails seemed so fresh the boys heart quickened with the thought that he might by chance come suddenly upon a stray bunch of them feeding in some deep swale  he had passed beyond fences and his course was still substantially westward his eyes constantly searched the misty purpleblue horizon for a first glimpse of the mountains though he knew he could not possibly come in sight of them so soon he rode steadily till the sun was overhead when he stopped to let the pony rest and feed he had a scanty lunch in his pocket which he ate without water saddling up an hour or two later he continued his steady onward shack toward the west  once or twice he passed in sight of cattle ranches but he rode on without stopping though he was hungry and weary once he met a couple of cowboys who reined out and rode by one on either side of him to see what brands were on his horse he was sufficiently waywise to know what this meant the riders remained studiously polite in their inquiries  where ye from stranger  upper cannon ball  ehhah hows the feed there this year  pretty good  where ye aimin at now if its a fair question  bob reynolds ranch  hes over on the head water of the south fork aint he  yes  well its a good piece yet so long they said in change of manner  so long  they rode away still filled with curiosity concerning the boy whose horse plainly showed hard riding he shore wants to git there said one to the other  late in the afternoon the youth pulled in his horse and studied with the closest care a big cloud looming in the sky all day snowy thunderheads had been emerging into view near the horizon blooming like gigantic roses out of the deep purple of the sky but this particular cloud had not changed its sharp cleancut outline for an hour and as he looked a veil of vapor suddenly drifted away from it and moses heart leaped with exultation as though a womans hand had been laid on his shoulder that cloudlike form was a mountain it could be nothing else for while all around it other domes shifted line and mass this one remained constant riding through the mist as the moon endures in the midst of the flying vapor of the night  thereafter he rode with his eyes on that sunlit mass the land grew wilder sharp hills broke the smooth expanses and on these hills groves of dwarf pine appeared in irregular clumps like herds of cattle he began to look for a camping place for he was very tired for an hour he led his spent horse still moving toward the faroff shining peak which glowed long after darkness had fallen on the plains at last it grew too dim to guide him farther and slipping the saddle from his horse he turned him loose to feed upon the bunch grass  as the light faded from the sky so the exultation and sense of freedom went out of the boys heart his mind went back to the struggle in the street he felt no remorse no pity for the drunken fools but he was angry and discouraged and disgusted with himself he had ended in failure and in flight where he should have won success and respect he did not directly accuse himself he had done as well as he could he blamed things and said to himself its my luck by which he meant to express a profound feeling of dejection and weakness as of one in the grasp of inimical powers by the working of unfriendly forces he was lying there under the pines hungry tired chilled and lone as a wolf jack was far away mary lost forever to him and the officers of the law again on his trail it was a time to make a boy a man a bitter and revengeful man  the night grew chill and he was forced to walk up and down wrapped in his saddle blanket to keep warm fuel was scarce and his small fire sufficed only to warm him in minute sections and hunger had thinned his blood he was tired and sleepy too but dared not lie down for fear of being chilled it would not do to be ill here alone in this land  it was the loneliest night he had ever known in his life on the hills near by the coyotes kept up ventriloquistic clamor and from far off the bawling of great bulls and the bleating of the calves brought news of a huge herd of cattle but these sounds only made his solitary vigil the more impressive the sleepy chirp of the crickets and the sound of his horse nipping the grass calmly careless of the wolves were the only aids to sleep all else had the effect to keep his tense nerves vibrating as the cold intensified the crickets ceased to cry and the pony having filled his stomach turned tail to the wind and humped his back in drowse at last no friendly sounds were left in all the world and shivering sore and sullen the youth faced the east waiting for the dawn  as the first faint light came into the east he turned his face to the west anxiously waiting till the beautiful mountain should blossom from the dark at last it came stealing forth timid delicate blushing like a bride from nuptial chamber ethereal as an angels wing persistent as a glacial wall as it broadened and bloomed the boy threw off his depression like a garment briskly saddling his shivery but wellfed horse he set off keeping more and more to the left as his instructions ran but no matter in which direction he rode his eyes were on the mountain there is where i end was his constantly repeated thought it would have been easy for him to have turned aside  shortly after sunrise he came upon a ranch set deep in a gully and sheltered by piñons smoke was curling from the stovepipe but no other sign of life could be detected he rode directly up to the door being now too hungry and cold to pass by food and shelter no matter what should follow  a couple of cowboys armed and armored came out lazily but with menace in their glances  good morning said mose  howdy stranger howdy they repeated with instant heartiness git off your hoss and come in  thanks i believe i will can you tell me whichaway is bob reynolds ranch he asked  both men broke into grins well youve putt nigh hit it right hyer this is one o his line camps the ranch house is about ten miles furder onbut slide off and eat a few  one man took his horse while the other showed him into a big room where a huge stack of coals on a rude hearth gave out a cheerful heat it was an ordinary slab shack with three rooms a slatternly woman was busy cooking breakfast in a little leanto at the back of the larger room a child was wailing in a crib and before the fire two big wolfish dogs were sleeping they arose slowly to sniff lazily at moses garments and then returned to their drowse before the fire  stranger you look putt nigh beat out said the man who acted as host you look pale around the gills  i am said mose i got off my course last night and had to make down under a piñon i havent had anything to eat since yesterday noon  wal well have some taters and sowbelly in a giff or two want o wash  mose gladly took advantage of the opportunity to clean the dust and grime from his skin though his head was dizzy with hunger the food was bacon eggs and potatoes but it was fairly well cooked and he ate with great satisfaction  the men were very much interested in him and tried to get at the heart of his relation to reynolds but he evaded them they were lanky missourians types already familiar to him and he did not care to make confidants of them the woman was a graceless figure a silent household drudge sullenly sad and gaunt and sickly  mose offered to pay for his breakfast but the boss waved it aside and said oh thats all right we dont see enough people pass to charge for a breakfast besides were part o the reynolds outfit anyway  as mose swung into the saddle his heart was light away to the south a long low cloud of smoke hung what is that he asked  thats the bullgine on the great western we got two railroads now  which is two too many said the other man first you know the cattle business will be wiped out o rickaree county just as it is bein wiped out in cheyenne and runnin bear nesters and cow milkers are comin in and will be buildin fences yet  not in my day said the host  well so long said mose and rode away  the reynolds ranch house was built close beside a small creek which had cut deep into the bottom of a narrow valley between two piñoncovered hills it squat in the valley like a tortoise but was much more comfortable than most ranch houses of the county it was surrounded by long sheds and circular corrals of pine logs and looked to be what it was a den in which to seek shelter a blacksmiths forge was sending up a shower of sparks as mose rode through the gate and up to the main stable  a longbearded old man tinkering at some repairs to a plow nodded at the youth without speaking  is mr reynolds at home asked mose  no but hell be here in a secondjest rode over the hill to look at a sick colt git off an make yuself comfortable  mose slipped off his horse and stood watching the queer old fellow as he squinted and hammered upon a piece of iron chewing furiously meanwhile at his tobacco it was plain his skill was severely taxed by the complexity of the task in hand  as he stood waiting mose saw a pretty young woman come out of the house and take a babe from the ground with matronly impatience of the dirt upon its dress  the old man followed the direction of the young mans eyes and mumbled old mans girl her child  mose asked no questions but it gave a new and powerful interest to the graceful figure of the girl  occasionally the old man lifted his eyes toward the ridge as if looking for some one and at last said old mancomin  a horseman came into view on the ridge sitting his horse with the grace and ease of one who lives in the saddle as he zigzagged down the steep bank his pony a vicious and powerful roan grade was on its haunches half the time sliding leaping trotting the rider a smallish man with a brown beard was dressed in plain clothing much the worse for wind and sun he seemed not to observe the steepness and roughness of the trail  as he rode up and slipped from his horse mose felt much drawn to him for his was a kindly and sad face his voice as he spoke was low and soft only his eyes keen and searching betrayed the resolute plainsman  howdy stranger he said in southern fashion glad to see you sir  mose presented his note from delmar  from old delmar eh how did you leave him in good health and spirits i hope  he spoke in the rhythmical way of tennesseans emphasizing the auxiliary verbs beyond their usual value after reading the letter he extended his hand i am very glad to meet you sir i am indeed bill take care of mr he paused and looked at the latter  mosemose harding interpolated mose  put in hardings horse come right in mr harding i reckon dinner is in process of simmering by this time  call me mose said the youth thats what delmar called me  reynolds smiled very good sir mose it shall be  they entered the front door into the lowceiled small sitting room where a young girl was sitting sewing with a babe at her feet  my daughter mrs craig said reynolds gently daughter this young man is mr mose harding who comes from my old friend delmar he is going to stay with us for a time sit down mose and make yourself at home  the girl blushed painfully and mose flushed sympathetically he could not understand the mystery and ignored her confusion as far as possible the room was shabby and well worn a rag carpet covered the floor the white plastered walls had pictures cut from newspapers and magazines pinned upon them to break the monotony the floor was littered also with toys clothing and tools which the baby had pulled about but the room wrought powerfully upon the boys heart giving him the first real touch of homesickness he had felt since leaving the burns farm that bright march day now so far away it seemed that it was deep in the past for a few moments he could not speak and the girl was equally silent she gathered up the babys clothes and playthings and passed into another room leaving the young man alone  his heart was very tender with memories he thought of mary and of his sister maud and his throat ached the wings of the young eagle were weary and here was safety and rest he felt that intuitively and when reynolds returned with his wife a pleasantfeatured woman of large frame tears were in the boys eyes  mrs reynolds wiped her fingers on her apron and shook hands with him cordially i spose youre hungry as a wolf wal ill hurry up dinner mebbe youd like a biscuit  mose professed to be able to wait and at last convinced the hospitable soul wal ill hurry things up a little she said as she went out reynolds as he took a seat said delmar writes that you just got mixed up in some kind o fuss down there i reckon you had better tell me how it was  mose was glad to unburden his heart as the story proceeded reynolds sat silently looking at the stove hearth glancing at the youth only now and again as he reached some dramatic point the girl came back into the room and as she listened her timidity grew less painful the boys troubles made a bond of sympathy between them and at last mose found himself telling his story to her her beautiful brown eyes grew very deep and tender as he described his flight his hunger and his weariness  when he ended she drew a sigh of sympathetic relief and reynolds said mm you have no certain knowledge i reckon whether you killed your man or not  i cant remember it was dark we fired a dozen shots i am afraid i hit i am too handy with the revolver to miss  mm so delmar says well youre out of the state and i have no belief they will take the trouble to look you up anyhow i reckon you better stay with us till we see how the fuss ends you certainly are a likely young rider an i can use you right hyere till you feel like goin farther  a wave of grateful emotion rushed over the boy blinding his eyes with tears and before he could speak to thank his benefactor dinner was called the girl perceived the tears in his eyes and as they went out to dinner she looked at him with a comradeship born of the knowledge that he too had suffered  he returned her glance with one equally frank and friendly and all through the meal he addressed himself to her more often than to her parents she was of the most gentle and patient and yielding type her beautiful lips and eyes expressed only sweetness and feminine charm and her body though thin and bent was of girlish slimness  reynolds warmed to the boy wondrously as they arose from the table he said  well ride over to the roundup tomorrow and ill introduce you to the cow boss and you can go right into the mess ill turn my horse over to you im getting mighty near too old to enjoy rustlin cattle together and ill just naturally let you take my place     chapter xi  on the roundup   mose was awakened next morning by the whirring of the coffee mill a vigorous and cheerful sound mrs reynolds and cora were busily preparing breakfast and their housewifely movements about the kitchen below gave the boy a singular pleasure the smell of meat in the pan rose to his nostrils and the cooing laughter of the baby added a final strand in a homely skein of noises no household so homelike and secure had opened to him since he said goodby to his foster parents in rock river  he dressed and hurried down and out to the barn frost lay white on the grass cattle were bawling somewhere in the distance the smoke of the kitchen went up into the sky straight as a poplar tree the beautiful plain hushed and rapt lay waiting for the sun  as he entered the stable mose found reynolds looking carefully at jack that looks a gentle horse i cant see a mean thing about him i dont reckon hes a cow hoss is he  no i dont suppose he is a regular cow horse but hell soon learn  i must trade you outen that hoss i certainly am blieged to do so im growin old boy i dont take the pleasu in a broncho that i once did i certainly am tired of hosses i cant touch with my hand fo foty yeahs i have handled these locoed hossesthey ah all locoed in my judgmentand i am plum tired of such i shall send to missouri aw tennessee and get me a hoss i can trust meanwhile you leave me yo hoss an take my baldface pinto there he is the fastest hoss on the range an a plum devil but that wont mattah to you for you ah young an frisky  mose hated to yield up his gentle and faithful horse even for a short time but could not decently refuse he shifted his saddle to the pinto with reynolds help  whoa there wild cat called the rancher as the wicked eyes began to roll hell get usen to ye after a day or two he said reassuringly  moses horsemanship was on trial and though nervous and white he led the pinto out and prepared to mount  if he wants to gambol a little just let him go only keep his head up said reynolds with careless glance  cora came out of the house and stood looking on while mose tightened the cinch again and grasping the pommel with both hands put his toe in the stirrup the pinto leaped away sidewise swift as a cat but before he could fairly get into motion mose was astride with both feet in the stirrups with a series of savage sidewise bounds the horse made off at a tearing pace thrusting his head upon the bit in the hope to jerk his rider out of his seat failing of this he began to leap like a sheep just as he was about to let up on this mose sank the rowels into him with a wild yell and hotly lashed him from side to side with the end of his rope for a few rods the horse continued to leap with stiffened legs and upraised back then abandoned all tricks and ran up the hill like a scared antelope  when reynolds caught up with his new hand he smiled and said i reckon you can be trusted to look out fo yosef and the heart of the youth glowed with pleasure  again he felt the majesty and splendor of the life into which he had penetrated the measureless plain dimpled and wrinkled swept downward toward the flaming eastern sky unmarked of man to the west cut close across their snow tops by the plains edge three enormous and snowarmored peaks arose the sunlight already glittering on the thin newfallen snows  coyotes still at vigil on the hills slid out of sight at the coming of the horsemen the prairie dogs peered sleepily from their burrows cattle in scattered bands snuffed and stared or started away hulking yet swift the bulls sullen and ferocious the calves wild as deer there were no fences no furrows no wagon tracks no sign of sheep it was the cow country in very truth  on the way reynolds said very little occasionally as they drew their ponies to a walk he remarked upon the kindliness of the horse and said i hope youll like my horse as well as i like youahs  it was nearly twelve oclock when they topped a treeless ridge and came in sight of the roundup below them in the midst of a wide grassy river flat stood several tents and a covered wagon nearby lay a strong circular corral of poplar logs filled with steers at some distance from the corral a dense mass of slowly revolving cattle moved surrounded by watching horsemen down from the hills and up the valley came other horsemen hurrying forward irregular bands of cows and calves a small fire near the corral was sending up a pale strand of smoke and at the tail of the wagon a stovepipe emitting a darker column told that dinner was in preparation over the scene the cloudless september sky arched dust arose under the heels of the herds and the bawling roar of bulls the call of agonized cows and the answering bleat of calves formed the base of the shrill whoopings and laughter of the men nothing could be wilder more stirring more picturesque except a camp of sioux or cheyennes in the days of the buffalo  in a few minutes mose was in the midst of the turmoil everyone greeted reynolds with affection and he replied in the stately phrases which had made him famous how do you do gentlemen i certainly am glad to see you enjoyin this fine fall day captain charlesworth allow me to present my young friend moses harding  captain charlesworth a tall man with a squint eye and a humorous glance came up to shake hands as mose slipped from his broncho  reynolds went on captain charlesworth is cow boss an will see that you earn yo bod capn this young man comes from my good friend capn delmar of sante fe you know delmar  i should think so said the boss it seems this youngster kin ride seems hes on wild cat  reynolds smiled i reckon you can consider him both able and willin captain  well slip off an eat ill take care o the cayuses  on the ground scattered among the tents and in the shade of the cook wagon were some twenty or thirty herders for the most part they were slender bronzed and active of twentyfive or thirty with broad white hats faded and flapping in the brim gray or blue woolen shirts once gay with red lacing and dark pantaloons tucked into tall boots with long heels spurs jingled at the heels of their tall boots and most of them wore bandannas of silk or cotton looped gracefully about their necks a few of the younger ones wore a sort of rude outside trouser of leather called chaps and each of them carried a revolver slung at the hip they were superb examples of adaptation to environment alert bold and graceful of movement  a relay of them were already at dinner with a tin plate full of grub and a big tin cup steaming with coffee before each man they sat almost anywhere to eat on saddles wagon tonguesany convenient place some of them more orderly were squatted along a sort of table made of folded blankets piled through the center of a tent here reynolds took a seat and mose followed shrinking a little from the keen scrutiny of the men the fact that reynolds vouched for him however was introduction and the cook made a place for him readily enough and brought him a plate and a cup  boys said reynolds this young feller is just come to town his name is mose harding and he can ride a hoss all right all right hes agoin to make a hand here in my place treat him fair  there was a moments awkward pause and then mose said im going to try to do my share  as he had time to look around he began to individualize the men one of the first to catch his eye was an indian who sat near the door of the tent he was dressed like the other men but was evidently a fullblood his skin was very dark not at all red or copper colored and mose inferred that he was a ute his eyes were fixed on mose with intent scrutiny and when the boy smiled the indians teeth gleamed white in ready good nature and they were friends at once the talk was all about the work on hand the tussles with steers the number of unbranded calves the queries concerning shipment etc  dinner was soon over and charley as the cow boss was called by his men walked out with mose toward the corral kin ye rope he asked  no not for a cent  let him hold the herd foh a day or two suggested reynolds give him time to work in  all right spose you look after him this afternoon  together reynolds and mose rode out toward the slowly milling herd a hungry hot and restless mob of broadhorns which required careful treatment as he approached the dull roar of their movement their snuffling and moaning thrilled the boy he saw the gleaming clashing horns of the great animals uplift and mass and change and it seemed to him there were acres and acres of them  reynolds called out to two sweating dusty hoarse young fellows go to grub boys  without a word they wheeled their horses and silently withdrew while reynolds became as instantly active  his voice arose to a shout now lively mose keep an eye on the herd and if any cow starts to break outlively nowturn him in  a big bay steer lifting his head suddenly started to leave the herd mose spurred his horse straight at him with a yell and turned him back  thats right shouted reynolds  mose understood more of it than reynolds realized he took his place in the cordon and aided in the work with very few blunders the work was twofold in character fat cattle were to be cut out of the herd for shipment unbranded calves were to be branded and strays tallied and thrown back to their own feeding grounds into the crush of great dusty steaming bodies among tossing cruel curving horns the men rode to cut out the beeves and to rope the calves it was a furious scene yet there was less excitement than mose at first imagined occasionally as a roper returned he paused on the edge of the herd long enough to eat a piece of tobacco and pass a quiet word with a fellow then spurring his horse reentered the herd again no matter how swift his action his eyes were quiet  it was hard work dusty hot and dangerous also to be unhorsed in that struggling mass meant serious injury if not death the youth was glad of heart to think that he was not required to enter the herd  that night when the horse herd came tearing down the mesa reynolds said now mose you fall heir to my shift of horses too let me show them to you each man has four extra horses that walleyed roan is mine so is the sorrel mare with the star face that big allover bay the finest hoss in the whole outfit is mine too but he is unbroken he shore is a hard problem ill give him to you if you can break him or ill trade him for your jack  ill do it cried mose catching his breath in excitement as he studied the splendid beast his lithe tigerlike body glittered in the sun though his uplifted head bore a tangled dusty mat of mane he was neglected wary and unkempt but he was magnificent every movement of his powerful limbs made the boy ache to be his master  thus mose took his place among the cowboys he started right socially this time no one knew that he had been a sheep herder but reynolds and reynolds did not lay it up against him he was the equal of any of them in general horsemanship they admitted that at the end of the second day though he was not so successful in handling cattle as they thought he should be it was the sense of inefficiency in these matters which led him to give an exhibition of his skill with the revolver one evening when the chance offered he shot from his horse in all conceivable positions at all kinds of marks and with all degrees of speed till one of the boys accustomed to good shooting said  you kin jest about shoot  thats right said the cow boss id hate to have him get a grutch agin me  mose warmed with pardonable pride he was taking high place in their ranks and was entirely happy during these pleasant autumn days on his swift and wise little ponies he tore across the sod in pursuit of swift steers or came rattling down a hillside hot at the heels of a wildeyed cow and calf followed by a cataract of pebbles each day he bestrode his saddle till his bones cried out for weariness and his stomach walls ground together for want of food but when he sat among his fellows to eat with keenest pleasure the beef and beans of the pot wrestlers providing he was content he had no time to think of jack or mary except on the nights when he took his trick at watching the night herd then sometimes in the crisp and fragrant dusk with millions of stars blazing overhead he experienced a sweet and powerful longing for a glimpse of the beautiful girlish face which had lightened his days and nights in prison  the herders were rough hearty souls for the most part often obscene and rowdy as they sat and sang around the camp fire mose had never been a rude boy on the contrary he had always spoken in rather elevated diction due no doubt to the influence of his father whose speech was always serious and well ordered therefore when the songs became coarse he walked away and smoked his pipe alone or talked with jim the ute whose serious and dignified silence was in vivid contrast  some way coarse speech and ribald song brought up by the power of contrast the pure sweet faces of mary and his sister maud two or three times in his boyhood he had come near to slaying pert lads who had dared to utter coarse words in his sisters presence there was in him too much of the essence of the highest chivalry to permit such things  it happened therefore that he spent much time with ute jim who was a simple and loyal soul thoughtful and possessing a sense of humor withal mose took great pleasure in sitting beside the camp fire with this son of the plains while he talked of the wild and splendid life of the days before the white man came his speech was broken but mose pieced it out by means of the sign language so graceful so dignified and so dramatic that he was seized with the fervid wish to acquire a knowledge of it this he soon did and thereafter they might be seen at any time of day signaling from side to side of the herd the indian smiling and shaking his head when the youth made a mistake  jim believed in his new friend and when questions brought out the history of the dispossession of his people he grew very sorrowful his round cheeks became rigid and his eyes were turned away injun no like fight white man all time injun gotta fight white man crowd injun back back no game no rain no corn injun heap like rivers trees all samewhite man no like um go on hot plain no trees no mountains no game  but he threw off these somber moods quickly and resumed his stories of himself of long trips to the snowpeaks which he seemed to regard in the light of highest daring the high mountains were not merely far from the land of his people they were mythic places inhabited by monstrous animals that could change from beast to fowl and talkgreat conjuring creatures whose powers were infinite in scope as the red man struggled forward in his story attempting to define these conceptions the heart of the prairie youth swelled with a poignant sense of drawing near a great mystery the conviction of jims faith for the moment made him more than half believe in the powers of the mountain people day by day his longing for the high country grew  at the first favorable moment he turned to the task of subduing the splendid bay horse for which he had traded his gentle jack one sunday when he had a few hours off mose went to alf the chief roper and asked him to help him catch kintuck as reynolds called the bay  all right said alf ill tie him up in a jiffy  can you get him without marking him all up  i dont believe it hes going to thrash around like hl ablazin well have to choke him down  mose shook his head i cant stand that i spose itll skin his fetlocks if you get him by the feet  oh it may may not depends on how he struggles  mose refused to allow his shining proudnecked stallion to be roped and thrown and asked the boys to help drive him into a strong corral together with five or six other horses this was done and stripping himself as for a race mose entered the coral and began walking rapidly round and round following the excited animals hour after hour he kept this steady circling walk till the other horses were weary till kintuck ceased to snort till the blaze of excitement passed out of his eyes till he walked with a wondering backward glance as if to ask twolegged creature why do you so persistently follow me  the cowboys jeered at first but after a time they began to marvel at the dogged walk of the youth they gathered about the walls of the corral and laid bets on the outcome at the end of the third hour kintuck walked with a mechanical air all the fire and fury gone out of him he began to allow his pursuer to approach him closely almost near enough to be touched at the end of the four hours he allowed mose to lay his hand on his nose and mose petted him and went to dinner odds stood in moses favor as he returned to the corral he was covered with dust and sweat but he was confident he began to speak to the horse in a gentle firm voice at times the stallion faced him with head lifted a singular look in his eyes as though he meditated leaping upon his captor at first mose took no notice of these actions did not slacken his pace but continued to press the bay on and on at last he began to approach the horse with his hand lifted looking him in the eyes and speaking to him snorting as if with terror the splendid animal faced him again and again only to wheel at the last moment  the cowboys were profanely contemptuous think of taking all that trouble  rope him and put a saddle on him and bust him they called resoundingly  mose kept on steadily at last when all the other horses had been turned loose kintuck trembling and with a curious stare in his eyes again allowed mose to lay his hand on his nose he shrank away but did not wheel it was sunset and the horse was not merely bewildered he was physically tired the touch of his masters hand over his eyes seemed to subjugate him to take away his will when mose turned to walk away the horse followed him as though drawn by some magnetic force and the herders looked at each other in amazement thereafter he had but to be accustomed to the bridle and saddle and to be taught the duties of a cow horse he had come to love his master  this exploit increased the fame of dandy mose as the cowboys came to call him because of the nature of his dress he was bronzed now and a very creditable brown mustache added to the maturity of his face he was gaunt with hard riding and somber and reticent in manner so that he seemed to be much older than his years before the beef roundup was ended he could rope a steer fairly well could cut out or hold the herd as well as the best and in pistol practice he had no equal  he was well pleased with himself he loved the swift riding the night watches the voices of wolves the turmoil of the camp the rush of the wild widehorned herd and the pounding roar of the relay horses as they came flying into camp of a morning it all suited well with the leaping blood of his heart and the restless vigor of his limbs he thought of his old home very littleeven mary was receding into the mist of distance  when the beef herd was ready to be driven to the shipping point reynolds asked him if he wished to go he shook his head no ill stay here he did not say so but he was still a little afraid of being called to account for his actions in running bear he saw the herd move off with regret for he would have enjoyed the ride exceedingly he cared little for the town though he would have liked the opportunity to make some purchases he returned to the reynolds ranch to spend the autumn and the winter in such duties as the stock required  as the great peaks to the west grew whiter and whiter looming ever larger at dawn the heart of the boy grew restless the dark cañons allured him the stream babbled strange stories to himtales of the rocky spaces from which it cameuntil the boy dreamed of great white doors that opened on wondrous green parks  one morning when cora called the men to breakfast mose and jim did not respond a scrawl from mose said weve gone to the mountains ill be back in the spring keep my outfit for me and dont worry     part ii  chapter xii  the young eagle flutters the dovecote   the little town of marmion was built on the high grassy parklike bank of the cedar river at least the main part of the residences and stores stood on the upper level while below beside the roaring water only a couple of mills and some miserable shacks straggled along a road which ran close to the sheer walls of waterworn limestone  the town was considered picturesque by citizens of the smaller farm villages standing bleakly where the prairie lanes intersected to be able to live in marmion was held to be eminent good fortune by the people roundabout and the notion was worth working for if things turn out well we will buy a lot in marmion and build a house there husbands occasionally said to their wives and daughters to console them for the mud or dirt or heat or cold of the farm life one by one some of those who had come into the country early and whose land had grown steadily in value as population increased were able to rent their farms to advantage and move into town thus the streets gradually lengthened out into the lanes and brick blocks slowly replaced the battlemented wooden stores of earlier frontier construction  to harold excell fresh from the wide spaces of the plains the town appeared smothered in leaves and the air was oppressively stagnant he came into the railway station early one july morning tired and dusty with a ride of two days and a night in an ordinary coach as he walked slowly up the street toward the center of the sleeping village the odor of ripe grain and the familiar smell of poplar and maple trees went to his heart his blood leaped with remembered joys under such trees in the midst of such fragrance he had once walked with his sister and with jack his heart swelled with the thought of the burns farm and the hearty greeting they would give him could he but ride up to the door  and mary how would she seem to him now four years was a long time at that period of a girls life but he was certain he would recognize her he had not written to her of his coming for he wished to announce himself there were elements of adventure and surprise in the plan which pleased him he had not heard from her for nearly a year and that troubled him a little perhaps she had moved away or was married the thought of losing her made him shiver with sudden doubt of the good sense of his action anyhow he would soon know  the clerk of the principal hotel was sleeping on a cot behind the counter and mose considerately decided not to wake him taking a seat by the window he resumed his thinking while the morning light infiltrated the sky he was only twentytwo years of age but in his own thought he had left boyhood far behind as a matter of fact he looked to be five years older than he was his face was set in lines indicating resolution and daring his drooping mustache hid the boyish curves of his lips and he carried himself with a singular grace selfconfident decisive but not assertive the swing of his shoulders had charm and he walked well the cowboys painful hobble had not yet been fastened upon him  sitting there waiting the dawn his face became tired somber almost haggard with selfaccusing thought he was not yet a cattle king he was in fact still a cowboy the time had gone by when a hired hand could easily acquire a bunch of cattle and start in for himselfand yet though he had little beyond his saddle and a couple of horses he was in marmion to look upon the face of the girl who had helped him to keep square and clean in a land where dishonesty and vice were common as sage brush he had sworn never to set foot in rock river again and no one but jack knew of his visit to marmion  now that he was actually in the town where mary lived he was puzzled to know how to proceed he had wit enough to know that in marmion a girl could not receive visits from a strange young man and escape the fire of infuriate gossip he feared to expose her to such comment and yet having traveled six hundred miles to see her he was not to be deterred by any other considerations especially by any affecting himself  he knew something but not all of the evil fame his name conveyed to the citizens in his native state as harry excell alias black mose he had figured in the great newspapers of chicago and denver and omaha imaginative and secretly admiring young reporters had heaped alliterative words together to characterize his daring his skill as a marksman and horseman and had also darkly hinted of his part in desperate stage and railway robbery in the farther west to all thisup to the time of his returnharold had replied these chaps must earn a living some way i reckon he was said to have shot down six men in his first scrimmage no one presumes to any impertinent inquiries when black mose rides into town  another enterprising newspaper youth had worked out the secret history of black mose he began his career of crime early at sixteen years of age he served in states prison for knifing a rival back in the states this report enabled the rock river call to identify harold excell with black mose to the pain and humiliation of pastor excell  harold paid very little heed to all this till his longing to see mary grew intolerableeven now waiting for the sabbath day to dawn he did not fully realize the black shadow which streamed from his name and his supposititious violences he divined enough of it to know that he must remain unknown to others and he registered as m harding omaha  he was somewhat startled to find himself without appetite and pushing away his tough steak and fried potatoes he arose and returned to the street the problem before him required delicacy of handling and he was not one to assume a tactful manner the closer he came to the meeting the more difficult it became he must see her without causing comment and without jacks aid he saw no way of doing it he had written to jack asking him to meet him and so he waited  he was a perilously notable figure in spite of his neat black suit and quiet ways his wide hat sat upon his head with a negligence which stopped short of swagger and his coat revealed the splendid lines of his muscular shoulders he had grown to a physical manhood which had the leopards lithe grace and the lions gravity his dimpled and cleanshaven chin was strong and the line of his lips firm his eyes were steady and penetrating giving an impression of reticence his hands were slender and brown and soft in the palms as those of a girl the citizens marveled over him as he moved slowly through the streets thinking himself quite indistinguishable among the other young men in dark suits and linen collars  waiting was most difficult and to remain indoors was impossible so he walked steadily about the town as he returned from the river road for the fifth time the bells began to ring for church filling him with other memories of his youth of his father and his pulpit and brought to his mind also the sudden recollection of one of jacks letters wherein he mentioned marys singing in the choir if she were at home she would be singing yet he argued and set forth definitely to find her  to inquire was out of the questionso he started in at the largest church with intent to make the rounds after waiting till the choir was about to begin the first hymn he slipped in and took a seat near the door his heart beating loudly and his breath much quickened  the interior was so familiar it seemed for the moment to be his fathers church in rock river the odors sounds movements were quite the same the same deaf old men led by determined sturdy old women were going up the aisle to the front pews the pretty girls taking their seats in the middle pews where their new hats could be enjoyed by the young men at the rear became dot and alice and nettieand for the moment the cowboy was very boyish and tender the choir assembling above the pulpit made him shiver with emotion perhaps one of them will be mary and i wont know her he said to himself i will know her voice he added  but as the soprano took her place his heart ceased to poundshe was small and dark and thin he arose and slipped out to continue his search  they were singing as he entered the next chapel and it required but a moments listening to convince himself that mary was not there the third church was a small stone building of odd structure and while he hesitated before its door a womans voice took up a solo strain powerful exultant and so piercingly sweet that the plainsman shivered as if with sudden cold around him the softly moving maples threw dappling shadows on the walk the birds in the orchards the insects in the grass the clouds overhead seemed somehow involved in the poetry and joy of that song the wild heart of the young trailer became like that of a child made sweet and tender by the sovereign power of a voice  he did not move till the clear melody sank into the harmony of the organ then with bent head and limbs unwontedly infirm he entered the lovely little audience room he stumbled into the first seat in the corner his eyes piercing the colored dusk which lay between him and the singer it was mary and it seemed to him that she had become a princess sitting upon a throne accustomed to see only the slatternly women of the cow towns or the thin hardworked and poorlydressed wives and daughters of the ranchers he humbled himself before the beauty and dignity and refinement of this young singer  she was a mature woman fullbosomed grave of feature introspective of glance her graceful hat her daintily gloved hands her tasteful dress impressed the cowboy with a feeling that all art and poetry and refinement were represented by her for the moment his own serenity and selfcommand were shaken he cowered in his seat like a dustcovered plowman in a parlor and when mary looked in his direction his breath quickened and he shrank he was not yet ready to have her recognize him  the preacher a handsome and scholarly young fellow arose to speak and harold was interested in him at once the service had nothing of the oldtime chant or drawl or drone in calm unhesitating speech the young man proceeded from a text of hebrew scripture to argue points of right and wrong among men and to urge upon his congregation right thinking and right action he used a great many of the technical phrases of carpenters and stonemasons and sailors he showed familiarity also with the phrases of the cattle country several times a low laugh rippled over his congregation as he uttered some peculiarly apt phrase or made use of some witty illustration to the cowboy this sort of preaching came with surprise he thought the boys would kieto to this chap all right he was not eager to have them listen to mary singing  sitting there amid the little audience of thoughtful people his brain filled with new conceptions of the world and of human life nothing was clearly defined in the tumult of opposing pictures at one moment he thought of his sister and his family but before he could imagine her home or decide on how to see her a picture of his father or jack or the peaceful burns farm came whirling like another cloud before his brain and all the time his eyes searched marys calm and beautiful face he saw her smile too when the preacher made a telling application of a story how would she receive him after so many years she had not answered his last letter perhaps she was married again the chilly wind from the cañon of doubt blew upon him if she was why that ended it he would go back to the mountains and never return  the minister finished at last and mary arose again to sing she was taller harold perceived and more matronly in all ways as she sang the lonely soul of the plainsman was moved to an ecstasy which filled his throat and made his eyes misty with tears he thought of his days in the gray prison and of this girlish voice singing like an angel to comfort him she did not seem to be singing to him now she sang as a bird sings out of abounding health and happiness and as she sang the mountains retreated into vast distances the rush of the cattle on the drive was fainter than the sigh of the wind and the fluting of the ute lover was of another world for the moment he felt the majesty and the irrevocableness of human life  he stood in a shadowed corner at the close of the service and watched her come down the aisle as she drew near his breath left him and the desire to lay his hand on her arm became so intense that his fingers locked upon the back of his pewbut he let her pass she glanced at him casually then turned to smile at some word of the preacher walking just behind her her passing was like music and the fragrance of her garments was sweeter than any mountain flower the grace of her walk the exquisite fairness of her skin subdued him who acknowledged no master and no mistress she walked on out into the sabbath sunshine and he followed only to see her turn up the sidewalk close to the shoulder of the handsome young minister  the lonely youth walked back to his hotel with manner so changed his mountain companions would have marveled at it a visit which had seemed so simple on the arickaree became each moment more complicated in civilization the refined young minister with the brown pointed beard so kindly and thoughtful and wholesome of manner was a new sort of man to such as harold excell he feared no rivalry among the youth of the village but this scholar  jack met him at the hotelfaithful old jack whose freckled face beamed and whose spectacled eyes were dim with gladness they shook hands again and again crying out confused phrases old man how are you im all right how are you you look it whered you find the red whiskers they came in a box your mustache is a wonder  ultimately they took seats and looked at each other narrowly and quietly then harold said im mr harding here  jack replied i understand your father knows too he wants to come up and see you i said id wire shall i  of courseif he wants to see mebut i want to talk to you first ive seen mary  have you how did you manage  i trailed her went to all the churches in town she sings in a little stone church over here  i know ive been up here to see her once or twice myself  harold seized him by the arm see here jacki must talk with her how can i manage it without doing her harm  thats the question if these people should connect you with black mose theyd form a procession behind you harry you dont know you cant imagine the stories theyve got up about you theyve made you into a regular oklahoma billy the kid and train robber the first great spread was that fight you had at running bear that got into the omaha papers in three solid columns about six months after it happened of course i knew all about it from your lettersno one had laid it to you then but now everybody knows you are black mose and if you should be recognized you couldnt see mary without doing her an awful lot of harm you must be careful  i know all that replied harold gloomily but you must arrange for me to see her right away this afternoon or tonight  ill manage it they know me here and i can call on her and take a friend an old classmate you see without attracting much attentionbut it isnt safe for you to stay here long somebody is deadsure to identify you theyve had two or three pictures of you going around that really looked like you and then your father coming up may let the secret out we must be careful ill call on mary immediately after dinner and tell her you are here  is she married some way she seemed like a married woman  no shes not married but the young preacher you heard this morning is after her they say and hes a mighty nice chap  there was no more laughter on the gentle redbearded face of young burns had harold glanced at him sharply at that moment he would have seen a tremor in jacks lips and a singular shadow in his eyes his voice indeed did affect harold though he took it to be sympathetic sadness only  jack brightened up suddenly i cant really believe it is you harry youve grown so big and burly and you look so old he smiled i wish i could see some of that shooting they all tell about but that would let the cat out  harold could not be drawn off to discuss such matters  come out to the ranch and ill show you but how are we to meet father if he is seen talking with me it may start people off  ill tell you well have him come up and join you on the train and go down to rock river together i dont mean for you to get off you can keep right on now you mustnt wear that broad hat you wear a grapebox straw hat while youre here take mine and ill wear a cap  he took charge of harolds affairs with ready and tactful hand he was eager to hear his story but harold refused to talk on any other subject than mary at dinner he sat in gloomy silence disregarding his friends pleasant lowvoiced gossip concerning old friends in rock river  after jack left the hotel harold went to his room and took a look at himself in the glass he was concerned to see of what manner of man he really was he was not wellsatisfied with himself his face and hands were too brown and leathery and when he thought of his failure as a rancher his brow darkened he was as far from being a cattle king as when he wrote that boyish letter four years before and he had sense enough to know that a girl of marys grace and charm does not lack for suitors probably she is engaged or married he thought life seemed a confusion and weariness at the moment  as soon as he heard jack on the stairs he hurried to meet him  what luck have you seen her  jack closed the door before replying yes  what did she say  she turned a little paler and just sat still for a minute or two you know she isnt much of a talker then she said was he at church today i said yes then she said i think i saw him i saw a stranger and was attracted by his face but of course i never thought it could be harold she was completely helpless for a while but as i talked she began to see her way she finally said he has come a long way and i must see him i must talk with him but people must not know who he is i told her we were going to be very careful for her sake  thats right we must harold interrupted  she didnt seem scared about herself it wont harm me she said but father is hard to manage when anything displeases him we must be careful on harolds account  harolds throat again contracted with emotion she never thinks of herself thats her way  now weve just got to walk boldly up the walk the two of us together and call on her ill introduce you to her father or she will he knows me we will talk about our school days while the old gentleman is around he will drift away after a time naturally if he doesnt ill take him out for a walk  this they did made less of a cowboy by jacks straw hat harold went forth on a trail whose course was not welldefined in his mind though now that jack had arranged details so deftly that mary was not in danger of being put to shame his native courage and resolution came back to him in the full springtide of his powerful manhood marys name and face had come at last to stand for everything worth having in the world and like a bold gambler he was staking all he had on a single whirl of the wheel  their meeting was so selfcontained that only a close observer could have detected the tension mary was no more given to externalizing her emotions than he she met him with a pale sweet dignified mask of face she put out her hand and said i am glad to see you mr harding but his eyes burned down into hers with such intensity that she turned to escape his glance father you know mr burns and this is his friend mr harding whom i used to know  jack came gallantly to the rescue he talked crops politics weather church affairs and mining he chattered and laughed in a way which would have amazed harold had he not been much preoccupied he was unprepared for the change in mary he had carried her in his mind all these years as a little slip of a maiden wrapt in expression somber of mood something half angel and half child and always she walked in a gray half light never in the sun now here she faced him a dignified woman with deep serene eyes and he could not comprehend how the pale girl had become the magnetic selfcontained woman he was thrown into doubt and confusion but so far from showing this he sat in absolute silence gazing at her with eyes which made her shiver with emotion  talk was purposeless and commonplace at first a painful waiting suddenly they missed jack and the father they were alone and free to speak their most important words harold seized upon the opportunity with most disconcerting directness  ive come for you mary he said as if he had not hitherto uttered a word and his voice aroused some mysterious vibration within her bosom im not a cattle king i have nothing but two horses a couple of guns and a saddlebut all the same here i am i got lonesome for you and at last i took the back trail to find out whether you had forgot me or not  his pause seemed to require an answer and her lips were dry as she said in a low voice no i did not forget but i thought you had forgotten me  a man dont forget such a girl as you are mary you were in my mind all the time your singing did more for me than anything else ive tried to keep out of trouble for your sake i havent succeeded very well as you knowbut most of the stories about me are lies ive only had two fights and they were both in selfdefense and i dont think i killed anybody i never know exactly what im doing when i get into a scrap but ive kept out of the way of it on your account i never go after a man its pretty hard not to shoot out there where men go on the rampage so often its easier now than it used to be for they are afraid of me  he seemed to come to a halt in that direction and after a moments pause took a new start i saw you at church today and i saw you walk off with the minister and that gave me a sudden jolt it seemed to me youliked him mighty well  she was sitting in silence and apparent calmness but she flushed and her lips set close together it was evident that no halfexplanations would suffice this soul of the mountain land  he arose finally and stood for an instant looking at her with piercing intentness his deep excitement had forced him to physical action  i could see he was the man for you not me right there i felt like quitting i went back to my hotel doing more thinking to the square minute than ever before in my life i reckon i ought to have pulled out for the mountains right then but you see i had caught a glimpse of you again and i couldnt the smell of your dress he paused a moment you are the finest girl god ever made and i just couldnt go without seeing you at least once more  he was tense almost rigid with the stress of his sudden passion she remained silent with eyes fixed upon him musing and somber she was slower to utter emotion than he and could not speak even when he had finished  he began to walk up and down just before her his brows moodily knitted im not fit to ask a girl like you to marry me i know that ive served time in jail and im under indictment by the courts this very minute in two states im no good on earth but to rope cattle i cant bring myself to farm or sell goods back here and if i could you oughtnt to have anything to do with mebut all the same youre worth more to me than anything else i dont suppose there has been an hour of my life since i met you first that i havent thought of you i dreamed of youwhen im riding at nighti try to think  he stopped abruptly and caught up her left hand youve got a ring on your fingeris that from the minister  her eyes fled from his and she said yes  he dropped her hand i dont blame you any ive made a failure of it his tone was that of a bankrupt at fifty i dont know enough to write a letterim only a rough tough fool i thought youd be thinking of me just the way i was thinking of you and there was nothing to write about because i wasnt getting ahead as i expected so i kept waiting till something turned up to encourage me nothing did and now im paid for it  his voice had a quality which made her weep she tried to think of some words of comfort but could not she was indeed too deeply concerned with her own contending emotions there was marvelous appeal in this powerful bronzed undisciplined youth his lack of tact and gallantry his disconcerting directness of look and speech shook her troubled her and rendered her weak she was but a year younger than he and her life had been almost as simple exteriorly but at center she was of far finer development she had always been introspective and she had grown selfanalytic she knew that the touch of this young desperados hand had changed her relation toward the world as he talked she listened without formulating a reply  when at last she began to speak she hesitated and her sentences were broken i am very sorrybut you see i had not heard from you for a long timeit would be impossiblefor me to live on the plains so far awayeven ifeven if i had not promised mr king  well that ends it he said harshly and his voice brought tears again i go back to my cow punching the only business i know as you say the cow country is no place for a girl like you its a mighty hard place for women of any kind and you  besides youre a singer you cant afford to go with me its all a part of my luck things have gone against me from the start  he paused to get a secure hold on his voice well now im going but i dont want you to forget me dont pray for me just sing for me ill hear you and itll help keep me out of mischief will you do that  yesif youif it will help  jacks voice unusually loud interrupted her and when the father entered there was little outward sign of the passionate drama just enacted  wont you sing for us mary asked jack a few minutes later  mary looked at harold significantly and arose to comply harold sat with head propped on his palm and eyes fixed immovably upon her face while she sang if i were a voice the voice was stronger sweeter and the phrasing was more mature but it was after all the same soul singing through the prison gloom straight to his heart she charged the words with a special intimate tender meaning she conveyed to him the message she dared not speak be true in spite of all my heart is sore for you let me comfort you  he on his part realized that one who could sing like that had a wider mission in the world than to accompany a cowboy to the bleak plains of the west to comfort him was a small part of her work in the world it was her mission to go on singing solace and pleasure to thousands all over the nation  when she had finished he arose and offered his hand with a singular calmness which moved the girl more deeply than any word he had said when you sing that song think of me sometimes will you  yesalways she replied  goodby he said abruptly dropping herhand he went out without speaking another word  jack taking her hand in parting found it cold and nerveless  may i see you again before we go he asked  her eyes lighted a little and her hand tightened in his yesi want to speak with you she said and ended in a whisper about him  jack overtook harold but remained silent when they reached their room harold dropped into a chair like one exhausted by a fierce race  this ends it jack ill never set foot in the states again from this time on i keep to the mountains     chapter xiii  the young eagle dreams of a mate   as the young men sat at supper that night a note was handed to jack by the clerk upon opening it he found a smaller envelope addressed to mr harding harold took it but did not open it though it promised well being quite thick with leaves jack read his note at a glance and passed it across the table it was simple      dear mr burns wont you please see that the inclosed note     reaches harold i wish you could persuade him to come and see me     once more before he goes i shall expect to see you anyhow     father does not suspect anything out of the ordinary as yet and     it will be quite safe                                      your friend                                               mary yardwell  as soon as he decently could harold went to his room and opened the important letter in it the reticentgirl had uttered herself with unusual freedom it was a long letter and its writer must have gone to its composition at once after the door had closed upon her visitors it began abruptly too      dear friend my heart aches for you from the time i first     saw you in the jail i have carried your face in my mind i     cant quite analyze my feeling for you now you are so     different from the boy i knew i think i am a little afraid     of you you scare me a little  you are of another world a     strange world of which i would like to hear i have a womans     curiosity i cant let you go away until you tell me all your     story i would like to say something on my own side     also cant you come and see me once more my father is going     to be away at his farm all day tomorrow cant you come with     mr  burns and take dinner with me and tell me all about     yourselfyour life is so strange      there will be no one there i mean at dinner but mr burns     and you and we can talk freely does being under     indictment mean that you are in danger of arrest i want to     understand all about that you cant know how strange and     exciting all these things are to me my life is so humdrum     here you come into it like a great mountain wind you take     my words away as well as my breath i am not like most women     words are not easy to me even when i write though i write     better than i talki think      mr king asked me to be his wife some months ago and i     promised to do so but that is no reason why we should not be     good friends  you have been too much in my life to go out of     it altogether though i had given up seeing you again and     then we always think of our friends as we last saw them we     cant imagine their development dont you find this so you     said you found me changed      i have little to tell you about myself i graduated and then     i spent one winter in chicago to continue my music studies i     am teaching here summers to get pin money it is so quiet     here one grows to think all the world very far away and the     wild things among which you have lived and worked are almost     unimaginable even when the newspapers describe them with the     greatest minuteness      this letter is very rambling i know but i am writing as     rapidly as i can for i want to send it to you before you     take the train  please come to see me tomorrow tonight i     sing in the song service at the church i hope you will be     there the more i think about your story the more eager to     listen i become there must be some basis of stirring deeds     for all the tales they tell of you  my friends say i have a     touch of the literary poison in my veins anyhow i like a     story above all things and to hear the hero tell his own     adventures will be the keenest delight      i am sorry i could not do more to make things easier for you     today but i come of men and women who are silent when they     mean most i am never facile of speech and today i was     dumb perhaps if we meet on a clear understanding we will get     along better come anyhow and let me know you as you     are perhaps i have never really known you perhaps i only     imagined you                                      your friend                                               mary yardwell      ps the reason for the postscript is that i have reread     the foregoing letter and find it unsatisfactory in everything     except the expression of my wish to see you i had meant to     say so much and i have said so little i am afraid now that i     shall not see you at all so i add my promise i shall always     remember you and i will think of you when i sing and i     will sing if i were a voice every sunday for you especially     when i am all alone and ill send it out to you by thought     waves you shall never fail of the best wishes of                                                mary yardwell  not being trained in psychologic subtleties harold took this letter to mean only what it said he was not as profoundly moved by it as he would have been could he have read beneath the lines the tumult he had produced in the tranquil life of its writer one skilled in perception of a womans moods could have detected a sense of weakness or irresolution or longing in a girl whose nature had not yet been tried by conflicting emotions  jack perceived something of this when harold gave him the letter to read his admiration of harolds grace and power his love for every gesture and every lineament of his boyish hero made it possible for him to understand how deeply mary had been moved when brought face to face with a handsome and powerful man who loved as lions love he handed the letter back with a smile i think youd better stay over and see her  i intend to replied harold wire father to come up  lets go walk we may happen by the church where she sings suggested jack  it was a very beautiful hour of the day the west was filled with cool purplegray clouds and a fresh wind had swept away all memory of the heat of the day insects filled the air with quavering song children were romping on the lawns lovers sauntered by in pairs or swung under the trees in hammocks old people sat reading or listlessly talking beside their cottage doors a few carriages were astir it was a day of rest and peace and lovemaking to this busy little community the mills were still and even the water seemed to run less swiftly only the fishes below the dam had cause to regret the days release from toil for on every rock a fisherman was poised  the tension being a little relieved harold was able to listen to jacks news of rock river his father was still preaching in the first church but several influential men had split off and were actively antagonizing the majority of the congregation the fight was at its bitterest maud had now three children and her husband was doing well in hardware this old schoolmate was married that one was dead many had moved west bradley talcott was running for state legislator radbourn was in washington  talking on quietly the two young men walked out of the village into a lane bordered with lombardy poplars harold threw himself down on the grass beneath them and said  now i can imagine i am back on the old farm tell me all about your folks  oh theyre just the same they dont change much father scraped some money together and built a new bedroom on the west side mother calls it the boys room by boys they mean you and me they expect us to sleep there when you come back on a visit theyll be terribly disappointed at not seeing you mother seems to think as much of you as she does of me  there was charm in the thought of the burns farm and mrs burns coming and going about the big kitchen stove the smell of wholesome cooking about her clothing and for the moment the desperados brain became as a childs there was sadness in the thought that he never again could see his loyal friends or the old walks and lanes  jack aroused him and they walked briskly back toward the little church which they found already quite filled with young people the choir including mary smiled at the audience and at each other for the spirit of the little church was humanly cheerful  the strangers found seats in a corner pew together with a pale young man and a very pretty little girl jack was not imaginative but he could not help thinking of the commotion which would follow if those around him should learn that black mose was at that moment seated among them mary seeing the dark stern face of the plainsman had some such thought also there was something gloriously unfettered compelling and powerful in his presence he made the other young men appear commonplace and feeble in her eyes and threw the minister into pale relief emphasizing his serenity his scholarship and his security of position  harold gave close attention to the young minister who as marys lover became important as a man of action he put a low valuation on a mere scholar but king was by no means contemptible physically jack also perceived the charm of such a man to mary and acknowledged the good sense of her choice king could give her a pleasant home among people she liked while harold could only ask her to go to the wild country to a log ranch in a cottonwood gulch there to live month after month without seeing a woman or a child  a bitter and desperate melancholy fell upon the plainsman what was the use such a woman was not for him he had only the pleasure of the wild country he would go back to his horses his guns and the hills and never again come under the disturbing influence of this beautiful singer she was not of his world her smiles were not for him when the others arose in song he remained seated his sullen face set toward the floor denying himself the pleasure of even seeing marys face as she sang  her voice arose above the chorus guiding directing uplifting the less confident ones when she sang she was certain of herself powerful selfcontained that night she sang with such power and sweetness that the minister turned and smiled upon her at the end he spoke over the low railing which separated them you surpass yourself tonight  looking across the heads of the audience as they began to take seats harold saw this smile and action and his face darkened again  for her solo mary selected one which expressed in simple words the capabilities each humble soul had for doing good if one could not storm the stars in song one could bathe a weary brow if one could not write a mighty poem one could speak a word of cheer to the toiler by the way  it was all poor stuff enough but the singer filled it with significance and appeal at the moment it seemed as if such things were really worth doing each word came from her lips as though it had never been uttered by human lips before so simple so musical so finely enunciated so well valued was it to harold so long separated from any approach to womanly art it appealed with enormous power he was not only sensitive he was just come to the passion and impressionability of fullblooded young manhood powers converged upon him and simple and direct as he was the effects were confusion and deepest dejection he heard nothing but marys voice saw nothing but her radiant beauty to him she was more wonderful than any words could express  at the end of the singing he refused to wait till she came down the aisle but hurried out into the open air away from the crowd as jack caught up with him he said you go to bed ive got to take a run out into the country or i cant sleep at all father will be up in the morning i suppose ill get off in the six oclock train tomorrow night  jack said nothing not even in assent and mose set off up the lane with more of mental torment than had ever been his experience before hitherto all had been simple he loved horses the wild things the trail the mountains the ranch duties and the perfect freedom of a man of action since the door of his prison opened to allow him to escape into the west he had encountered no doubts had endured no remorse and had felt but little fear all that he did was forthright manly singlepurposed and unhesitating  now all seemed changed his horses his guns the joys of free spaces were met by a counter allurement which was the voice of a woman strong as he was stern as he looked he was still a boy in certain ways and this mental tumult so new and strange to him wearied him almost to tears it was a fatigue an ache which he could not shake off and when he returned to the hotel he had settled nothing and was ready to flee from it all without one backward look however he slept soundlier than he thought himself capable of doing  he was awakened early by jack harry your father is here and very anxious to see you  mose arose slowly and reluctantly he had nothing to say to his father and dreaded the interview which he feared would be unpleasantly emotional the father met him with face pale and hands trembling with emotion my son my son he whispered mose stood silently wondering why his father should make so much fuss over him  mr excell soon recovered his selfcommand and his voice cleared i had almost given up seeing you harold i recognize you with difficultyyou have changed much you seem well and strongalmost as tall as i was at your age  i hold my own said harold and they all sat down more at ease i got into rough gangs out there but i reckon they got as good as they sent  i suppose the newspapers have greatly exaggerated about your conflicts  harold was a little disposed to shock his father oh yes i dont think i really killed as many men as they tell about i dont know that i killed any  i hope you did not lightly resort to the use of deadly weapons said mr excell sadly  it was kill or be killed said harold grimly it was like shooting a pack of howling wolves i made up my mind to be just one shot ahead of anybody there are certain counties out there where the name black mose means something  im sorry for that my son i hope you dont drink  dont you worry about that i cant afford to drink and if i could i wouldnt oh i take a glass of beer with the boys once in a while on a hot day but its my lay to keep sober a drunken man is a soft mark he changed the subject seems to me youre a good deal grayer  mr excell ran his fingers through the tumbled heap of his grizzled hair yes things are troubling me a little the mcphails are fighting me in the church and intend to throw me out and ruin me if they can but i shall fight them till the bitter end i am not to be whipped out like a dog  thats the talk dont let em run you out i got run out of cheyenne but ill never run again i was only a kid then after you throw em down come out west and round up the cowboys they wont play any underhanded games on you and mebbe you can do them some goodespecially on gambling they are sure enough idiots about cards  they went down to breakfast together but did not sit together  jack and harold talked in low voices about mr excell  the old man looks pretty well run down dont he said harold  he worries a whole lot about you  he neednt to when does he go back  he wants to stay all dayjust as long as he can  hed better pull right out on that ten oclock train his being here is sure to give me away sooner or later  it was hard for the father to say goodby he had a feeling that it was the last time he should ever see him and his face was gray with suffering as he faced his son for the last time harold became not merely unresponsive he grew harsher of voice each moment his fathers tremulous and repeated words seemed to him foolish and absurdand also inconsiderate after he was gone he burst out in wrath  why cant he act like a man i dont want anybody to snivel over me suppose i am to be shot this fall what of it  this disgust and bitterness prepared him strange to say for his call upon mary he entered the house master of himself and the situation his nerves were like steel and his stern face did not quiver in its minutest muscle though she met him in most gracious mood dressed as for conquest and very beautiful  im so glad you stayed over she said i have been so eager to hear all about your life out there she led the way to the little parlor once more and drew a chair near him  well he began it isnt exactly the kind of life your mr king leads  there was a vengeful sneer in his voice which mary felt as if he had struck her but she said gently  i suppose our life does seem very tame to you now  its sure death i couldnt stand it for a year id rot  mary was aware that some sinister change had come over him and she paused to study him keenly the tremulous quality of his voice and action had passed away he was hard stern selfcontained and she without being a coquette determined that his mood should give way to hers he set himself hard against the charm of her lovely presence and the dainty room mary ceased to smile but her brows remained level  you men seem to think that all women are fond only of the quiet things but it isnt true we like the big deeds in the open air too id like to see a cattle ranch and take a look at a roundup though i dont know exactly what that means  well were not on the roundup all the time he said relaxing a little its pretty quiet part of the time that is quiet for our country but then youre always on a horse and youre out in the air on the plains with the mountains in sight theres a lot of hard work about it too and its lonesome sometimes when yourre ridin the lines but i like it when it gets a little too tame for me i hit the trail for the mountains with an indian the ogallalahs are my friends and im going to spend the winter with them and then go into the west elk country im due to kill a grizzly this year and some mountain sheep he was started now and mary had only to listen before i stop im going to know all there is to know of the rocky mountains with ol kintuck and my winchester im goin to hit the sunset trail and hit it hard theres nothing to keep me now he said with a sudden glance at her it dont matter where i turn up or pitch camp i reckon id better not try to be a cattle king he smiled bitterly and pitilessly at the poor figure he cut i reckon im a kind of a mounted hobo from this on  but your father and sister  oh she isnt worryin any about me i havent had a letter from her for two years all ive got now is jack and hed be no earthly good on the trail hed sure lose his glasses in a fight and then he couldnt tell a grizzly from a twoyearold cow so you see theres nothing to hinder me from going anywhere im footloose i want to spend one summer in the flat top country ute jim tells me its fine then i want to go into the wind river mountains for elk old talfeather chief of the ogallalahs has promised to take me into the big horn range after that im going down into the southwest down through the uncompagre country reynolds says theyre the biggest yet and im going to keep right down into the navajo reservation ive got a bid from old silver arrow and then im going to walpi and see the mokis dance they say they carry live rattlesnakes in their mouths i dont believe it im going to see then i swing round to the grand cañon of the colorado they say thats the sorriest gash in the ground that ever happened reynolds gave me a letter to old hance hes the man that watches to see that no one carries the hole away then im going to take a turn over the mohave desert into southern california im due at the yosemite valley about a year from next fall ill come back over the divide by way of salt lake  he was on his feet and his eyes were glowing he seemed to have forgotten all women in the sweep of his imaginative journey  oh that will be grand how will you do it  on old kintuck if his legs dont wear off  how will you live  forage where i can turn to and help on a roundup or drive where i canshoot and fishoh ill make it if it takes ten years  then what mary asked with a curious intonation  then ill start for the northwest he replied after a little hesitationif i live of course the chances are ill turn up my toes somewhere on the trail a man is liable to make a misslick somewhere but thats all in the game a man had better die on the trail than in a dead furrow  mary looked at him with dreaming eyes his strange moods filled her with new and powerful emotions the charm of the wild life he depicted appealed to her as well as to him it was all a fearsome venture but after all it was glorious the placid round of her own life seemed for the moment intolerably commonplace there was epic largeness in the circuit of the plainsmans daring plans the wonders of nature which he catalogued loomed large in the misty knowledge she held of the west she cried out  oh i wish i could see those wonderful scenes  he turned swiftly you can ill take you  she shrank back oh no i didnt mean thati meantsome time  his face darkened in a sleeping car i reckon that timell never come  then a silence fell on them harold knew that his plans could not be carried out with a woman for companionand he had sense enough to know that marys words were born of a momentary enthusiasm when he spoke it was with characteristic blunt honesty  no right here our trails fork mary ever since i saw you in the jail the first time youve been worth more to me than anything else in the world but i can see now that things never can go right with you and me i couldnt live back here and you couldnt live with me out there im a kind of an outlaw anyway i made up my mind last night that id hit the trail alone i wont even ask jack to go with me theres something in me herehe laid his hand on his breastthat kind o chimes in with the wind in the piñons and the yap of the kyote the rooster and the church bells are too tame for me thats all there is about it maybe when i get old and feeble in the knees ill feel like pitchin a permanent camp but just now i dont i want to be on the move if i had a nice ranch and you i might settle down now but then you couldnt stand even a ranch with nearest neighbors ten miles away he turned to take his hat i wanted to see youi didnt plan for anything elseive seen you and so  oh youre not going now she cried you havent told me your story  oh yes i have all that youd care to hear it dont amount to much except the murder charges and they are wrong it wasnt my fault they crowded me too hard and i had to defend myself what is a man to do when its kill or be killed thats all over and past anyway from this time on i camp high the roosters and church bells are getting too thick on the arickaree  he crushed his hat in his hand as he turned to her and tears were in her eyes as she said  please dont go i expected you to stay to dinner with me  the quicker i get out o here the better he replied hoarsely and she saw that he was trembling whats the good of it im out of it  she looked up at him in silence her mind filled with the confused struggle between her passion and her reason he allured her this grave and stern outlaw appealing to some primitive longing within her  i hate to see you go she said slowly butisuppose it is best i dont like to have you forget mei shall not forget you and i will sing for you every sunday afternoon and no matter where you are in a deep cañon or anywhere or among the indians you just stop and listen and think of me and maybe youll hear my voice  tears were in her eyes as she spoke and he took a mans advantage of her emotion  perhaps if i come backif i make a strike somewhereif youd say so  she shook her head sadly but conclusively no no i cant promise anything  all rightthat settles it goodby  and she had nothing better to say than just goodby goodby     chapter xiv  the young eagle returns to his eyrie   it was good to face the west again the wild heart of the youth flung off all doubt all regret not for him were the quiet joys of village life no lane or street could measure his flight his were the gleaming immeasurable walls of the sangre de cristo range his the grassy mountain parks and the silent cañons and the peaks to hell with the east and all it owns was his mood and in that mood he renounced all claim to mary  he sat with meditative head against the windowpane listless as a caged and sullen eagle but his soul was far ahead swooping above the swells that cut into the murky sky his eyes studied every rod of soil as he retraced his way up that great windswept slope noting every change in vegetation or settlement five years before he had crept like a lizard now he was rushing straight on like the homing eagle who sees his home crag gleam in the setting sun  the cactus looked up at him with spiney face the first prairie dog sitting erect uttered a greeting to which he smiled the first mirage filled his heart with a rush of memories of wild rides and the grease wood recalled a hundred odorous camp fires he was getting home  the people at the stations grew more unkempt untamed the broad hats and long mustaches of the men proclaimed the cow country at last it seemed as though he might at any moment recognize some of them at a certain risk to himself he got off the train at one or two points to talk with the boys as it grew dark he took advantage of every wait to stretch his legs and enjoy the fresh air so different in its clarity and crisp dryness from the leafburdened mistfilled atmosphere of marmion he lifted his eyes to the west with longing too great for words eager to see the great peaks peer above the plains rim  the night was far spent when the brakeman called the name of the little town in which he had left his outfit and he rose up stiff and sore from his cramped position  kintuck restless from long confinement in a stall chuckled with joy when his master entered and called to him it was still dark but that mattered little to such as mose he flung the saddle on and cinched it tight he rolled his extra clothes in his blanket and tied it behind his saddle and then with one hand on his pommel he said to the hostler moved by a bitter recklessness of mind  well that squares us stranger if anybody asks you whichaway black mose rode jist say ye didnt notice a leap a rush of hoofs and the darkness had eaten both horse and man  it was a long ride and as he rode the dawn came over the plains swift silent majestic with color his blood warmed in his limbs and his head lifted he was at home in the wild once more all ties were cut between him and the east mary was not for him maud had grown indifferent jack would never come west and mr and mrs burns were merely cheery memories there was nothing now to look backward uponnothing to check his career as hunter and explorer all that he had done up to this moment was but careful preparation for great journeys he resolved to fling himself into unknown trailsto know the mountains as no other man knew them  again he rode down into the valley of the arickaree and as the boys came rolling out with cordial shouts of welcome his eyes smarted a little he slipped from his horse and shook hands all around and ended by snatching pink and pressing her soft cheek against his lipssomething he had never done before  they bustled to get his breakfast while reynolds took care of kintuck cora blushing prettily as she set the table for him said were mighty glad to see you back mose daddy said youd never turn up again but i held out you would  oh i couldnt stay away from kintuck and little pink he replied  howd they feed ye back there inquired mrs reynolds  oh fair to middlinbut of course they couldnt cook like ma reynolds  oh you go hark cried mrs reynolds vastly delighted theyve got so much more to do with  it was good to sit there in the familiar kitchen and watch these simple hearty women working with joy to feed him his heart was very tender and he answered most of their questions with unusual spirit fending off however any reference to old sweethearts his talk was all of absorbing interest to the women they were hungry to know how people were living and dressing back there it was so sweet and fine to be able to return to the eastand mrs reynolds hoped to do so before she died cora drew from mose the information that the lawns were beautifully green in marmion and that all kinds of flowers were in blossom and that the birds were singing in the maples even his meagre descriptions brought back to the girl the green freshness of june  oh im so tired of these bare hills she said wistfully i wish i could go east again back to our old home in missouri  i wish now id stayed here and sent you said mose  she turned in surprise why so mose  because i had so little fun out of it while to you it would have been a picnic  youre mighty good mose was all she said in reply but her eyes lingered upon his face which seemed handsomer than ever before for it was softened by his love his good friends and the cheerful home  in the days that followed cora took on new youth and beauty her head lifted and the swell of her bosom had more of pride and grace than ever before in her life she no longer shrank from the gaze of men even of strangers for mose seemed her lover and protector before his visit to the east she had doubted but now she let her starved heart feed on dreams of him  mose had little time to give to her for at his own request reynolds was making the highest use of his power i want to earn every cent i can for the next three months mose explained and he often did double duty he was very expert now with the rope and could throw and tie a steer with the best of the men his muscles seemed never to tire nor his nerves to fail him rain allnight rides sleeping on the ground beneath frosty blankets nothing seemed to trouble him he was never cheery but he was never sullen  one day in november he rode up to the home ranch leading a mule with a pack saddle fully rigged  what are you doing with that mule asked reynolds as he came out of the house followed by pink  im going to pack him  pack him what do you mean  im going to hit the long trail  cora came hurrying forward good evening mose  good evening cory hows my little pink  what did you say about hittin the trail mose  now i reckon youll give an account of yourself said reynolds with a wink  mose was anxious to avoid an emotional moment he cautiously replied oh im off on a little hunting excursion dont get excited about it im hungry as a coyote can i eat  cora was silenced but not convinced and after supper when the old people withdrew from the kitchen she returned to the subject again  how long are you going to be gone this time  mose saw the storm coming but would not lie to avoid it  i dont know mebbe all winter  she dropped into a chair facing him white and still when she spoke her voice was a wail o mose i cant live here all winter without you  oh yes you can youve got pink and the old folks  but i want you ill die here without you mose i cant endure it  his face darkened youd better forget me im a hoodoo cory nobody is ever in luck when im around i make everybody miserable  i was never really happy till you come she softly replied  there are a lot of better men than i am jest ahonein to marry you he interrupted her to say  i dont want themi dont want anybody but you and now you go off and leave me  the situation was beyond any subtlety of the man and he sat in silence while she wept when he could command himself he said  im mighty sorry cory but i reckon the best way out of it is to just take myself off in the hills where i cant interfere with any ones fun but my own seems to me im fated to make trouble all along the line and im going to pull out where theres nobody but wolves and grizzlies and fight it out with them  she was filled with a new terror what do you mean i dont believe you intend to come back at all she looked at him piteously the tears on her cheeks  oh yes ill round the circle some time  she flung herself down on the chair arm and sobbed unrestrainedly dont goplease  mose felt a sudden touch of the same disgust which came upon him in the presence of his fathers enforcing affection he arose now cory see here dont you waste any time on me im no good under the sun i like you and i like pinkie but i dont want you to cry over me i aint worth it now thats the gods truth im a black hoodoo and youll never prosper till i skip im not fit to marry any woman  singularly enough this gave the girl almost instant comfort and she lifted her head and dried her eyes and before he left she smiled a little though her face was haggard and tear stained  mose was up early and had his packs ready and kintuck saddled when mrs reynolds called him to breakfast coras pale face and piteous eyes moved him more deeply than her sobbing the night before but there was a certain inexorable fixedness in his resolution and he did not falter at bottom the deciding cause was mary she had passed out of his life but no other woman could take her placetherefore he was ready to cut loose from all things feminine  well mose im sorry to see you go i certainly am so said reynolds but you ah you own master all i can say is this old ranch is open to you and shall be so long as we stay hyerthough i am mighty uncertain how long we shall be able to hold out agin this new landboom you had better not stay away too long or you may miss us i reckon we ah all to be driven to the mountains very soon  i may be back in the spring im likely to need money and be obliged to come back to you for a job  on this tiny crumb of comfort coras hungry heart seized greedily the little pinkcheeked one helped out the sad meal she knew nothing of the long trail upon which her hero was about to set foot and took possession of the conversation by telling of a little antelope which one of the cowboys had brought her  the mule was packed and mose was about to say goodby the sun was still low in the eastern sky frost was on the grass but the air was crisp and pleasant all the family stood beside him as he packed his outfit on the mule and threw over it the diamond hitch as he straightened up he turned to the waiting ones and said do you see that gap in the range  they all looked where he pointed down in the west but lighted into unearthly splendor by the morning light arose the great range of snowy peaks in the midst of this impassable wall a purple notch could be seen  ever sence ive been here said mose with singular emotion ive looked away at that range and ive been waiting my chance to see what that cañon is like there runs my trailgoodby  he shook hands hastily with cora heartily with mrs reynolds and kissed pink who said bring me a little bear or a fox  all right honey you shall have a grizzly  he swung into the saddle here i hit the trail for yon blue notch and the land where the sun goes down so long  take care o yourself boy  come back soon called cora and covered her face with her shawl in a worldold gesture of grief  in the days that followed she thought of him as she saw him last a minute fleck on the plain she thought of him when the rains fell and prayed that he might not fall ill of fever or be whelmed by a stream he seemed so little and weak when measured against that mighty and merciless wall of snow then when the cold white storms came and the plain was hid in the fury of wind and sleet she shuddered and thought of him camped beside a rock cold and hungry she thought of him lying with a broken leg helpless while his faithful beasts pawed the ground and whinnied their distress she spoke of these things once or twice but her father merely smiled  mose can take care of himself daughter dont you worry  months passed before they had a letter from him and when it came it bore the postmark of durango      dear friends i should awritten before but the fact is i     hate to write and then ive been on the move all the time i     struck through the gap and angled down to taos a pueblo     indian town where i stayed for a whilethen went on down     the valley to sante fee  then i hunted up delmar he was     glad to see me but he looks old he had a hell of a time     after i left it wasnt the way the papers had itbut he won     out all right he sold his sheep and quit he said he got     tired of shooting men i stayed with himhes got a nice     familytwo girlsand then i struck out into the pueblo     country  these little brown chaps interest me but theyre a     different breed o cats from the ogallalahs everybody talks     about the snake dance at moki so im angling out that     way im going to do a little cow punchin for a man in     apache county and go on to the dance im going through the     navajoe reservation i stand in with them theyve heard of     me some waythrough the utes i reckon  the accounts of the snake dance contained mention of black mose who kept a band of toughs from interfering with the dance his wonderful marksmanship was spoken of he did not write till he reached flagstaff his letter was very brief im going into the grand cañon for a few days then i go to work on a ranch south of here for the winter in the spring im going over the range into california  when they heard of him next he was deputy marshal of a mining town and the denver papers contained long despatches about his work in clearing the town of desperadoes after that they lost track of him altogetherbut cora never gave him up hell round the big circle one o these daysand when he does hell find us all waiting wont he pet and she drew little pink close to her hungry heart     part iii  chapter xv  the eagle completes his circle   all days were sunday in the great mining camp of wagon wheel so far as legal enactment ran but on saturday night in following ancient habit the men came out of their prospect holes on the high grassy hills or threw down the pick in their overland tunnels or deep shafts and rabbitlike burrows and came to camp to buy provisions to get their mail and to look upon if not to share the vice and tumult of the town  the streets were filled from curb to curb with thousands of men in mudstained coats and stoutlaced boots they stood in the gutters and in the middle of the street to talk in subdued voices of their claims there was little noise the slowlymoving streams of shoppers or amusement seekers gave out no sudden shouting a deep murmur filled the air but no angry curse was heard no whooping in a land where the revolver is readier than the fist men are wary of quarrel careful of abuse and studiously regardful of others  there were those who sought vice and it was easily found the saloons were packed with thirsty souls and from every third door issued the click of dice and whiz of whirling balls in games of chance  every hotel barroom swarmed with persuasive salesmen bearing lumps of ore with which to entice unwary capital all the talk was of paystreaks leads float whins and upraises while in the midst of it battling to save souls the zealous salvation army band paraded to and fro with frenzied beating of drums around and through all this listening with confused ears gazing with wide solemn eyes were hundreds of young men from the middle east farmers sons cowboys mountaineers and miners to them it was an awesome city this lurid camp a wonder and an allurement to dissipation  to mose fresh from the long trail it was irritating and wearying he stood at the door of a saloon superbly unconscious of his physical beauty a somber dream in his eyes a statuesque quality in his pose he wore the wide hat of the west but his neat dark coat though badly wrinkled was well cut and his crimson tie and dark blue shirt were handsomely decorative his face was older sterner and sadder than when he faced mary three years before no trace of boyhood was in his manner seven years of life on the long trail and among the mountain peaks had taught him silence selfrestraint and had also deepened his native melancholy he had ridden into wagon wheel from the west eager to see the great mining camp whose fame had filled the world  as he stood so with the light of the setting sun in his face the melancholy of a tiger in his eyes a woman in an open barouche rode by her roving glance lighted upon his figure and rested there wait she called to her driver and from the shadow of her silken parasol she studied the young mans absorbed and motionless figure he on his part perceived only a handsomely dressed woman looking out over the crowd the carriage interested him more than the woman it was a magnificent vehicle the finest he had ever seen and he wondered how it happened to be there on the mountain top  a small man with a large head stepped from the crowd and greeted the woman with a military salute in answer to a question the small man turned and glanced toward mose the woman bowed and drove on and mose walked slowly up the street lonely and irresolute at the door of a gambling house he halted and looked in a young lad and an old man were seated together at a roulette table and around them a ring of excited and amused spectators stood mose entered and took a place in the circle the boy wore a look of excitement quite painful to see and he placed his red and white chips with nervous blundering and ineffectual gestures whereas the older man smiled benignly over his glasses and placed his single dollar chip each time with humorous decision each time he won this is for a new hat he said and the next time this is for a box at the theater the boy with his gains in the circle of his left arm was desperately absorbed no smile no jest was possible to him  mose felt a hand on his shoulder and turning found himself face to face with the small man who had touched his hat to the woman in the carriage the strangers countenance was stern in its outlines and his military cut of beard added to his grimness but his eyes were surrounded by fine lines of good humour  stranger id like a word with you  mose followed him to a corner supposing him to be a man with mines to sell or possibly a confidence man  stranger where you from  from the snake country replied mose  whats your little game here  mose was angered at his tone none of your business  the older man flushed and the laugh went out of his eyes ill make it my business he said grimly ive seen you somewhere before but i cant place you you want to get out o town tonight youre here for no mans goodyouve got a graft  mose struck him with the flat of his left hand and swift as a rattlesnakes stroke covered him with his revolver wait right where you are he said and the man became rigid i came here as peaceable as any man mose went on but i dont intend to be ridden out of town by a jackass like you  the other man remained calm if youll kindly let me unbutton my coat ill show you my star im the city marshal  be quiet commanded mose put up your hands  mose was aware of an outcry then a silence then a rush  from beneath his coat quick as a flash of light from a mirror he drew a second revolver his eyes flashed around the room for a moment all was silent then a voice called whats all this haney  keep them quiet said mose still menacing the officer  boys keep back pleaded the marshal  the man that starts this ball rolling will be sorry said mose searching the crowd with sinister eyes if youre the marshal order these men back to the other end of the room  boys get back commanded the marshal with shuffling feet the crowd retreated shut the door somebody and keep the crowd out  the doors were shut and the room became as silent as a tomb  now said mose is it war or peace  peace said the marshal  all right mose dropped the point of his revolver  the marshal breathed easier stranger youre a little the swiftest man ive met since harvest would you mind telling me your name  not a bit my friends call me mose harding  black mose exclaimed the marshal and a mutter of low words and a laugh broke from the listening crowd haney reached out his hand i hope you wont lay it up against me mose shook his hand and the marshal went on to tell the honest truth i thought you were one of lightfoots gang i couldnt place you of course i see nowi have your picture at the officethe drinks are on me he turned with a smile to the crowd come boysirrigate and get done with it its a horse on me sure  taking the mildest liquor at the bar mose drank to further friendly relations while the marshal continued to apologize you see weve been overrun with rollers and skingame men and lately three expresses have been held up by lightfoots gang and so ive been facing up every suspicious immigrant ive had to do itin your case i was too brashill admit thatbut come lets get away from the mob come over to my office i want to talk with you  mose was glad to escape the curious eyes of the throng while his life was in the balance he saw and heard everything hostile nothing morenow he perceived the crowd to be disgustingly inquisitive their winks and grins and muttered words annoyed him  open the doormuch obliged kelly said the marshal to the man who kept the door kelly was a powerfully built man dressed like a miner in broad hat loose gray shirt and laced boots and mose admiringly studied him  this is not rocky mountain kelly he asked  kelly smiled the same old man kelly they call me now  mose put out his hand im glad to know ye ive heard tom gavin speak of you  kelly shook heartily oh do ye know tom hes a rare lump of a by is tom weve seen great times together on the plains and on the hills its all gone now its tame as a garden since the buffalo went theyve made it another world by  come along kelly and well have it out at my office  as the three went out into the street they confronted a closepacked throng the word had passed along that the marshal was being done and now singularly silent the miners waited the opening of the door  the marshal called from the doorstep its all right dont block the street break away boys break away the crowd opened to let them pass fixing curious eyes upon mose  as the three men crossed the street the woman in the carriage came driving slowly along kelly and the marshal saluted gallantly but mose did not even bow  she leaned from her carriage and called  whats that i hear marshal about your getting shot  all a mistake madam i thought i recognized this young man and was politely ordering him out of town when he pulled his gun and nailed me to the cross  the woman turned a smiling face toward mose he must be a wonder introduce me please  certain sure this is mrs raimon mose princess raimon this is my friend mose harding otherwise known as black mose  black mose she cried are you that terrible man  she reached out her little gloved hand and as mose took it her eyes searched his face i think we are going to be friends her voice was affectedly musical as she added come and see me wont you  she did not wait for his reply but drove on with a sudden assumption of reserve which became her very well  the three men walked on in silence at last with a curious look at kelly the marshal said young man youre in luck anything you want in town is yours now how about it kelly  thats the thrue word of it  what do you mean asked mose  just thiswhat the princess asks for she generally gets shes taken a fancy to you and if youre keen as i think you are youll call on her without much delay  who is she how does she happen to be here  she came out here with her husbandand stays for love of men and mines i reckon anyhow she always has a man hangin on and has managed to secure some of the best mines in the camp she works em too shes a pretty high roller as they call em back in the states but she helps the poor and pays her debts like a man and its no call o mine to pass judgment on her  the marshals office was an old log shanty one of the first to be built on the trail and passing through the big front room in which two or three men were lounging the marshal led his guests to his inner office and sleeping room a fire was blazing in a big stone fireplace skins and dingy blankets were scattered about and on the mantle stood a bottle and some dirty glasses  sit down gentlemen said the marshal and have some liquor  after they were served and cigars lighted the marshal began  mose i want you to serve as my deputy  mose was taken by surprise and did not speak for a few moments the marshal went on  i dont know that youre after a job but im sure i need you theres no use hemming and hawingive made a cussed fool of myself this evenin and the boys are just about going to drink up my salary for me this coming week i cant afford not to have you my deputy because you unlimbered your gun a grain of a second before mebeat me at my own trick i need younow what do you say  mose took time to reply i sure need a job for the winter he admitted but i dont believe i want to do this  the marshal urged him to accept ill call in the newspaper men and let them tell the whole story of your life and of our little jamboree todaytheyll fix up a yarn thatll paralyze the holdup gang together well swoop down on the town ive been planning a cleanout for some weeks and i need you to help me turn em loose  mose arose i guess not im trying to keep clear of gunplay these days ive never hunted that kind of thing and i wont start in on a game thats sure to give me trouble  the marshal argued set down listen thats the point exactly the minute the boys know who you are we wont need to shoot thats the reason i want youthe reporters will prepare the way wherever we go the bad men will scatter  but mose was inexorable no i cant do it i took just such a job oncei dont want another  haney was deeply disappointed but shook hands pleasantly well goodnight drop in any time  mose went out into the street once more he was hungry and so turned in at the principal hotel in the city for a good square meal an italian playing the violin and his boy accompanying him on the harp made up a little orchestra some palms in pots six mirrors set between the windows together with tall very new oak chairs gave the dining room a magnificence which abashed the bold heart of the trailer for a moment  however his was not a nature to show timidity and taking a seat he calmly spread his damp napkin on his knee and gave his order to the colored waiter the palace hotel had the only two colored waiters in wagon wheel with such grace as he could command after long years upon the trail  as he lifted his eyes he became aware of the princess seated at another table and facing him she seemed older than when he saw her in the carriage her face was highcolored and her hair a redbrown her eyes were half closed and her mouth drooped at the corners her chin supported on her left hand glittering with jewels was pushed forward aggressively and she listened with indifference to the talk of her companion a dark smoothfeatured man with a bitter and menacing smile  mose was oppressed by her glance she seemed to be looking at him from the shadow as a tigress might glare from her den and he ate awkwardly and his food tasted dry and bitter ultimately he became angry why should this woman or any woman stare at him like that he would have understood her better had she smiled at himhe was not without experience of that sort but this unwavering glance puzzled and annoyed him  putting her companion aside with a single gesture the princess arose and came over to moses table and reached her hand to him she smiled radiantly of a sudden and said how do you do mr harding i didnt recognize you at first  mose took her hand but did not invite her to join him however she needed no invitation and taking a seat opposite leaned her elbows on the table and looked at him with eyes more inscrutable than everdespite their nearness they were a mottled yellow and brown he noticed unusual and interesting eyes but by contrast with the clear deeps of marys eyes they seemed like those of some beautiful wild beast he could not penetrate a thousandth part of a hair line beyond the exterior shine of her glance the womans soul was in the unfathomable shadow beneath  i know all about you she said i read a long article about you in the papers some months ago you stood off a lot of bogus game wardens who were going to butcher some shoshonees i liked that the article said you killed a couple of them i hope you did  mose was very short i dont think any of them died at my hands but they deserved it sure enough  she smiled again after seeing you on the street i went home and looked up that slipi saved it you see ive wanted to see you for a long time youve had a wonderful life for one so young this article raked up a whole lot of stuff about yousaid you were the son of a preacheris that so  yes that part of it was true  same old story isnt it im the daughter of a college professorsectarian college at that she smiled a moment then became as suddenly grave i like men i like men who face danger and think nothing of it the article said you came west when a mere boy and got mixed up in some funny business on the plains and had to take a sneak to the mountains what have you been doing since i wish youd tell me the whole story come to my house its just around the corner  as she talked her voice became more subtly pleasing and the lines of her mouth took on a touch of girlish grace  i havent time to do that mose said and besides my story dont amount to much you dont want to believe all they say of me ive just knocked around a little like a thousand other fellows thats all i pull out tonight im looking up an old friend down here on a ranch  she saw her mistake all right she said and smiled radiantly but come some other time wont you she was so winning so frank and kindly that mose experienced a sudden revulsion of feeling a powerful charm came from her superb physique her radiant color and from her beautiful flexile lips and sound white teeth he hesitated and she pressed her advantage  you neednt be afraid of me the boys often drop in to see me of an evening if i can be of any use to you let me know ill tell you what you do you take supper with me here tomorrow night what say  mose looked across at the scowling face of the womans companion and said hesitatingly  well ill see if i have timemaybe i will  she smiled again and impulsively reached her hand to him and as he took it he was nearly won by her friendliness this she did not know and he was able to go out into the street alone he could not but observe that the attendants treated him with added respect by reason of his acquaintance with the wealthiest and most powerful woman in the camp she had made his loneliness very keen and hard to bear  as he walked down the street he thought of maryshe seemed to be a sister to the distant calm and glorious moon just launching into the sky above the serrate wall of snowy peaks to the east there was a powerful appeal in the vivid and changeful woman he had just met for her like had never touched his life before  as he climbed back up the hill toward the corral where he had left his horse he was filled with a wordless disgust of the town and its people the night was still and cool almost frosty the air so clear and so rare filled his lungs with wholesomely sweet and reanimating breath his head cleared and his heart grew regular in its beating the moon was sailing in midocean between the great divide and the christo range cold and sharp of outline as a boat of silver lizard head to the south loomed up ethereal as a cloud so high it seemed to crash among the stars the youth drew a deep breath and said to hell with the town  kintuck whinnied caressingly as he heard his masters voice after putting some grain before the horse mose rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep with only a passing thought of the princess her luxurious home and her radiant and inscrutable personality     chapter xvi  again on the roundup   it was good to hear again the bawling of the bulls and the shouts of the cowboys and to see the swirling herd and the flying guarding checking horsemen mose wearied weatherbeaten and sombervisaged looked down upon the scene with musing eyes the action was quite like that on the arickaree the setting alone was different here the valley was a wide deliciously green bowl with knobby hills pinecovered and abrupt rising on all sides farther back great snowcovered peaks rose to enormous heights in the center of this superb basin the camps were pitched and the roping and branding went on like the action of a prodigious drama the sun setting in orangecolored clouds brought out the velvet green of the sward with marvelous radiance the tents gleamed in the midst of the valley like flakes of pearl  the heart of the wanderer warmed within him and with a feeling that he was almost home he called to his pack horse hyakboy and started down the hill as he drew near the herd he noted the great changes which had come over the cattle they were now nearly all grades of hereford or holstein they were larger of body heavier of limb and less active than the range cattle of the plains but were sufficiently speedy to make handling them a fine art  as he drew near the camp a musical shout arose and reynolds spurred his horse out to meet him its mose he shouted boy im glad to see ye i certainly am shake hearty where ye from  the wind river  what have you been doing up there  oh knocking around with some shoshones on a hunting trip  well by mighty i certainly am glad to see ye you look thin as a spring steer  my looks dont deceive me then my two sides are rubbin together how are the folks  they ah very well thank you cora and pink will certainly go plumb crazy when they see you acomin  wheres your house  just over that dividebut slip your packs off old kintuck looks well i knew him when you topped the hill  yes hes still with me and considerable of a horse yet  they drew up to the door of one of the main tents and slipped the saddles from the weary horses  do ye hobble  nothey stay with me said mose slapping kintuck go on boy heres grass worth while for ye  by mighty mose said reynolds looking at the trailer tenderly it certainly is good for sore eyes to see ye i didnt know but youd got mixed up an done for in some of them squabbles i heard the state authorities had gone out to round up that band of reds you was with  we did have one brush with the sheriff and some game wardens but i stood him off while my friends made tracks for the reservation the sheriff was for fight but i argued him out of it it looked like hot weather for a while  while they were talking the cook set up a couple of precarious benches and laid a wide board thereon mose remarked it  a table seems to me thats a little hifalutin  so it is but times are changing  i reckon the range on the arickaree is about wiped out  yes we had a couple of years with rain aplenty and that brought a boom in settlement everything along the river was homesteaded and so i retreatedthe range was overstocked anyhow this time i climbed high i reckon im all right now while i live they cant raise con in this high country and not much of anything but grass they wont bother us no mo its a good cattle country but a mighty tough range to ride as youll find i thought i knew what rough riding was but when it comes to racin over these granite knobs im jest a little too old im getting heavy too you notice  grubpile all down for grub yelled the cook and the boys came trooping in they were all strangers but not strange to mose they conformed to types he already knew some were young lads and the word having passed around that black mose was in camp they approached with awe the man whose sinister fame had spread throughout three states was a very great personage to them  did you come by way of wagon wheel inquired a tall youth whom the others called brindle bill  yes camped there one night  aint it a caution to yaller snakes must be nigh onto fifteen thousand people there now the hills is plumb measly with prospect holes and you cant look at a rock fr lessn a thousand dollars it shore is the craziest town that ever went anywhere  bills got the fever said another he just about wears hisself out apickin up and atotein round likely lookin rocks seems like he was lookin fer gold mines stid o cattle most of the time  youre just in time for the turnament mose  for the howmany  the turnament and bullfight joe grassie has been gettin up a bullfight and a kind of a show he lows to bring up some regular fighters from mexico and have a real surenough bullfight then hes offered a prize of fifty dollars for the best roper and fifty dollars for the best shooter  i didnt happen to hear of it but im due to take that fifty i need it said mose  he lows to have some racespony races and broncho busting  when does it come off asked mose with interest  on the fourth  ill be there  after supper was over reynolds said are you too tired to ride over to the ranch  oh no im all right now  well ill just naturally throw the saddles on a couple of bronchos and well go see the folks  mose felt a warm glow around his heart as he trotted away beside reynolds across the smooth sod his affection for the reynolds family was scarcely second to his boyish love for mr and mrs burns  it was dark before they came in sight of the light in the narrow valley of the mink theres the camp said reynolds no i didnt build it its an old ranch in fact i bought the whole outfit  mrs reynolds had not changed at all in the three years but cora had grown handsomer and seemed much less timid though she blushed vividly as mose shook her hand  im glad to see you back she said  moved by an unusual emotion mose replied you havent pined away any  pined exclaimed her mother well i should say not you should see her when jim haynes  mother called the girl sharply and pink now a beautiful child of eight came opportunely into the room and drew the conversation to herself  as mose with pink at his knee sat watching the two women moving about the table a halfformed resolution arose in his brain he was weary of wandering weary of loneliness this comfortable homely room this tender little form in his arms made an appeal to him which was as powerful as it was unexpected he had lived so long in his blanket with only kintuck for company that at this moment it seemed as if these were the best things to doto stay with reynolds to make cora happy and to rest he had seen all phases of wild life and had carried out his plans to see the wonders of america he had crossed the painted desert and camped beside the colorado in the greatest cañon in the world he had watched the mokis while they danced with live rattlesnakes held between their lips he had explored the cliffdwellings of the navajo country and had looked upon the sea of peaks which tumbles away in measureless majesty from uncompahgres eaglecrested dome he had peered into the boiling springs of the yellowstone and had lifted his eyes to the white tetons whose feet are set in a mystic lake around which the loons laugh all the summer long he knew the chiefs of a dozen tribes and was a welcome guest among them in his own mind he was no longer younghis youth was passing perhaps the time had come to settle down  cora turned suddenly from the table where she stood arranging the plates and knives and forks with a pleasant bustle and said  o mose weve got two or three letters for you weve had em ever so longi dont suppose they will be of much good to you now ill get them for you  they look old he said as he took them from her hand they look as if theyd been through the war the first was from his father the second from jack and the third in a womans handcould only be marys he stared at italmost afraid to open it in the presence of the family he read the one from his father first because he conceived it less important and because he feared the other      my dear son i am writing to you through jack although he     does not feel sure we can reach you i want to let you know     of the death of mrs excell she died very suddenly of acute     pneumonia she was always careless of her footwear and went     out in the snow to hang out some linen without her rubber     shoes we did everything that could be done but she only     lived six days after the exposure life is very hard for me     now i write also to say that as i am now alone and in bad     health i shall accept a call to sweetwater springs colorado     for two reasons one is that my health may be regained and     for the reason also my dear son that i may be nearer     you if this reaches you and you can come to see me i hope     you will do so  i am lonely now and i long for you the     parish is small and the pay meager but that will not matter     if i can see you occasionally  maud and her little family     are well i go to my new church in april                                          your father                                                   samuel excell  for a moment this letter made mose feel his fathers loneliness and had he not held in his hand two other and more important letters he would have replied with greater tenderness than ever before in his life  well mose set up said mrs reynolds lettersll keep  he was distracted all through the meal in spite of the incessant questioning of his good friends they were determined to uncover every act of his long years of wandering  yes he said ive been hungry and cold but i always looked after my horse and so when i struck a cow country i could whirl in and earn some money it dont take much to keep me when im on the trail  whats the good of seein so much asked mrs reynolds  he smiled a slow musing smile oh i dont know the more you see the more you want to see just now i feel like taking a little rest  cora smiled at him i wish you would you look like a starved catyou oughto let us feed you up for a while  spoil me for the trail he said but his eyes conveyed a message of gratitude for her sympathy and she flushed again  after supper mrs reynolds said now if you want to read your letters by yourself you can she opened a door and he looked in  a bed i havent slept in a bed for two years  well it wont kill ye not for one night i reckon she said  he looked around the little room at the dainty lace curtains tied with little bows of ribbon at the pictures and lambrequins and it filled his heart with a sudden stress of longing it made him remember the pretty parlor in which mary had received him four years before and he opened her letter with a tremor in his hands it was dated the christmas day of the year of his visit it was more than three years belated but he read it as if it were written the day before and it moved him quite as powerfully      my dear friend the impulse to write to you has grown     stronger day by day since you left your wonderful life and     your words appealed to my imagination with such power that i     have been unable to put them out of my mind without     intending to do so you have filled me with a great desire to     see the west which is able to make you forget your family and     friends and calls you on long journeys i have sung for you     every sunday as i promised to do your friend jack called to     see me last night and we had a long talk about you  he is to     write you also and gave me your probable address you said     you were not a good writer but i wish you would let me know     where you are and what you are doing for i feel a deep     interest in you although i can not make myself believe that     you are not the harold excell i saw in rock river in reality     you are not he any more than i am the little prig who sang     those songs to save your soul  however i was not so bad as     i seemed even then for i wanted you to admire my voice      i hope this christmas day finds you in a warm and sheltered     place  it would be a great comfort to me if i could know you     were not cold and hungry jack brought me a beautiful     presenta set of george eliot i ought not to have accepted     it but he seemed so sure it would please me i had not the     heart to refuse i would send something to you only i cant     feel sure of reaching you and neither does jack      it may be of interest to you to know that mr king the     pastor in whose church i sang has resigned his pastorate to     go abroad for a year his successor is a man with a familyi     dont see how he will manage to live on the salary mr king     had independent means and was a bachelor  right there the youth stopped something told him that he had reached the heart of the womans message king had resigned to go abroad why the tone of the letter was studiedly cold why there were a few more lines to say that jack was coming in to eat christmas dinner with her and that she would sing if i were a voice he was not supersubtle and yet something in this letter made his throat fill and his head a little dizzy if it did not mean that she had broken with king then truth could not be conveyed in lines of black ink  he tore open jacks letter it was short and to the point      dear harry if you can get away come back to marmion and see     mary again she wants to see you bad i dont know what has     happened but i think she has given king his walking     papersand all on account of you i know it it cant be     anybody else she talked of you the entire evening o man     but she was beautiful she sang for me but her mind was away     in the mountains i could see that it was her interest in     you made her so nice to me now thats the gods truth come     back and get her                                      yours in haste                                               jack  mose tingled with the sudden joy of it jacks letter so unlike his usual calm was convincing he sprang up a smile on his face his eyes shining with happiness his blood surging through his heart and then he remembered the letters were three years old the gray cloud settled down upon himhis limbs grew cold and the light went out of his eyes  three years while he was camping in the grand cañon with the lizards and skunks she was waiting to hear from him while he sat in the shade of the walls of walpi surrounded by hungry dogs and potbellied children she was singing for him and wondering whether her letter had ever reached him three years a thousand things could happen in three years she may have dieda cold shudder touched himshe might tire of waiting and marry some one elseor she might have gone away to the east that unknown and dangerous jungle of cities  he sprang up again i will go to see her he said to himself then he remembered his horse was worn he had no money and no suitable clothing then he thought i will write it did not occur to him to telegraph for he had never done such a thing in his life  he walked out into the sittingroom his letters in his hands  how far do you call it to wagon wheel  about thirty miles and all up hill  will you loan me one of your bronchos  certain sure my boy  i want to ride up there and send a couple of letters  better wait till morning said reynolds your letters have waited three yearsi reckon theyll keep over night  thats so said mose with a smile  sleep came to him swiftly in spite of his letters for he was very tired but he found the room close and oppressive when he arose in the morning the women were already preparing breakfast and reynolds sat by the fire pulling on his boots  as they were walking out to the barn reynolds plucked him by the sleeve and said  i reckon ive lost my chance to kill craig  why  a mexican took the job off my hands his face expressed a sort of gloomy dissatisfaction then without looking at mose he went on thats one reason daughter looks so pert shes free of that skunks clutches nowand can hold up her head shes free to marry a decent man  mose was silent marys letter had thrust itself between his lips and coras shapely head and all thought of marriage with her was gone  as they galloped up to the camp the boys were at work finishing the last bunch of calves the camp wagon was packed and ready to start across the divide but the cook flourished a newspaper and came running up  here you are posted like a circus  mose took the paper and on the front page read in big letters                               black mose                          mysterious as ever                       the celebrated dead shot              visits wagon wheel and swiftly disappears  damn em said mose cant they let me alone seems like they cant rest till they crowd me into trouble     chapter xvii  mose returns to wagon wheel   as mose threw the rope over the baldfaced pinto the boys all chuckled and drew near for they knew the character of the horse reynolds had said take your pick o the bunch and mose with the eye of a horseman had roped the pinto because of his size depth of chest and splendid limbs  as he was leading his captive out of the bunch the cook said to mose better not take that pinto hes mean as a hornet  is his wind all right  hes one o the best horses on the range all right but he shore is mean all the way through he always pitches at the start like he was fair crazy  does he go when he gets through asked mose of reynolds  yes hes a good traveler  i dont want to be delayed thats all if hell go ill stay by him  the boys nudged elbows while mose threw the saddle on the cringing brute and cinched it till the pinto full of suffering drew great quiet gulps of breath and groaned swift practiced relentless mose dragged at the latigo till the wide hair web embedded itself in the ponys hide having coiled the rope neatly out of the way while the broncho stood with drooping head but with a dull red flame in his eyes mose flung the rein over the ponys head then pinto woke up with a mighty sidewise bound he attempted to leave his rider but mose studiedly imperturbable with left hand holding the reins and right hand grasping the pommel went with him as if that were the ordinary way of mounting immense power was in the stifflegged leaping of the beast his body seemed a ball of coiled steel springs his watcheye rolled in frenzy it seemed he wished to beat his head against his riders face and kill him he rushed away with a rearing jerking motion in a series of jarring bounds snapping his rider like the lash of a whip then stopped suddenly poised on his fore feet with devilish intent to discharge mose over his head with the spurs set deep into the quivering painted hide of his mount mose began plying the quirt like a flail the boys cheered and yelled with delight it was one of their chief recreations this battle with a pitching broncho  suddenly the desperate beast paused and rearing recklessly high in the air fell backward hoping to crush his rider under his saddle in the instant while he towered poised in the air mose shook his right foot free of the stirrup and swung to the left and alighted on his feet while the fallen horse stunned by his own fall lay for an instant groaning and coughing under the sting of the quirt he scrambled to his feet only to find his inexorable rider again on his back with merciless spurs set deep in the quick of his quivering sides with a despairing squeal he set off in a low swift sidewise gallop and for nearly an hour drummed along the trail up hill and down the foam mingling with the yellow dust on his heaving flanks  when the bronchos hot anger had cooled mose gave him his head and fell to thinking upon the future he had been more than eight years in the range and on the trail and all he owned in the world was a saddle a gun a rope and a horse the sight of cora the caressing of little pink and marys letter had roused in him a longing for a wife and a shanty of his own  the grass was getting sere there was newfallen snow on lizard head and winter was coming he had the animals instinct to den up to seek winter quarters certain ties other than those of marys love combined to draw him back to marmion for the winter if he could only shake off his burdening notoriety and go back to see herto ask her adviceperhaps she could aid him but to sneak back againto crawl about in dark cornersthat was impossible  he was no longer the frank and boyish lover of adventure life troubled him now conduct was become less simple actions each day less easily determined these women now made him ponder cora who was accustomed to the range and whose interests were his own in many ways the princess whose money and influence could get him something to do in wagon wheel and mary whose very name made him shudder with remembered adorationeach one now made him think mary of all the group was most certainly unfitted to share his mode of life and yet the thought of her made the others impossible to him  the marshal saw him ride up the street and throw himself from his horse before the post office and hastened toward him with his hand extended hello mose ive got a telegram for you from sweetwater  mose took it without a word and opened it it was from his father wait for me in wagon wheel i am coming  the marshal was grinning did you see the writeup in yesterdays mother lode  yesi saw it and cussed you for it  i knowd you would but i couldnt help it billy the editor got hold of me and pumped the whole story out of me before i knew it i dont think it does you any harm  it didnt do me any good replied mose shortly  say the princess wants to see you shes on the street somewhere now looking for you  wheres the telegraph office he abruptly asked  the telegram from his father had put the idea into his head to communicate in that way with mary and jack  the marshal led the way to a stage office wherein stood a counter and a row of clicking machines  what is the cost of a telegram to marmion iowa asked mose  one dollar ten words each ad  mose thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out all his money a handful of small change his face grew bitter his last dollar was broken into bits  make it night rates for sixty said the operator be delivered tomorrow morning  go ahead said mose and set to work to compose a message the marshal with unexpected delicacy sauntered out into the street  now that he was actually face to face with the problem of answering marys letter in ten words the youths hand refused to write and he stood looking at the yellow slip of paper with an intensity that was comical to the clerk plainly this cowboy was not accustomed to telegraphing  mose felt the waiting presence of the clerk and said  can i set down here and think it over  why sure take a seat at that table over there  under the pressure of his emotion mose wrote dear mary and stopped the chap at the other end of the line would read that and comment on it he struck that out then it occurred to him that if he signed it harry this operator would marvel and if he signed mose the other end of the line would wonder he rose crushing the paper in his hand and went out into the street there was only one wayto write  this he did standing at the inkbespattered shelf which served as writing desk in the post office      dear mary i have just received your letter its a little     late but perhaps it aint too late anyhow im banking on     this finding you just the same as when you wrote i wish i     could visit you again but im afraid i couldnt do it a     second time without being recognized but write to me at     once and if you say come ill come i am poorer than i was     four years ago but ive been on the trail i know the     mountains now theres no other place for me but i get     lonesome sometimes when i think of you im no good at     writing letterscant write as well as i could when i was     twenty so dont mind my short letter but if i could see     you write at once and ill borrow or steal enough money to     pay my way to youi dont expect to ever see you out here in     the west  while still pondering over his letter he heard the rustle of a womans dress and turned to face the princess in magnificent attire her gloved hand extended toward him her face radiant with pleasure  why my dear boy where have you been  mose shook hands his letter to mary still unsealed in his left hand been down on the range he mumbled in profound embarrassment  she assumed a girlish part but you promised to come and see me  he turned away to seal his letter and she studied him with admiring eyes he was so interesting in his boyish confusiongraceful in spite of his irrelevant movements for he was as supple as properly poised and as sinewy as a panther  youre a great boy she said to him when he came back i like you i want to do something for you get into my carriage and let me tell you of some plans  he looked down at his faded woolen shirt and lifted his hand to his greasy sombrero oh no i cant do that  she laughed you ought to be able to stand it if i can id be rather proud of having black mose in my carriage  i guess not he said there was a cadence in these three words to which she bowed her head she surrendered her notion quickly  come down to the palace with me  all right ill do that he replied without interest  meet me there in half an hour  all right  goodby till then  he did not reply but took her extended hand while the young fellow in the postal cage grinned with profound appreciation after the princess went out this clerk said pard youve struck it rich  mose turned and his eyebrows lowered dangerously keep to your letter punchin young feller and youll enjoy better health  those who happened to be standing in the room held their breath for in that menacing steady glare they recognized battle  the clerk gasped and stammered i didnt mean anything  thats all right youre lately from the east or you wouldnt get gay with strangers in this country see if there is any mail for mose hardingor harry excell  sorry sirnothing for mr harding nothing for mr excell  mose turned back to the desk and scrawled a short letter to jack burns asking him to let him know at once where mary was and whether it would be safe for him to visit her  as he went out in the street to mount his horse the marshal met him again and mose irritated and hungry said sharply  see here pardner you act most cussedly like a man keeping watch on me  the marshal hastened to say nothing of the kind i like you thats all i want to talk with youin fact im under orders from the princess to help you get a job if you want one ive got an offer now the express company want you to act as guard between here and cañon city pay is one hundred dollars a month ammunition furnished  mose threw out his hand ill do ittake it all back  the marshal shook hands without resentment considering the apology ample and together they sauntered down the street  now pardner let me tell you how i size up the princess shes a goodhearted woman as ever lived but shes a little off color with the women who run the church socials here shes a rippin good business woman and her luck beats hl why last week she bought a fellers claim in fer ten thousand dollars and yesterday they tapped a vein of eighty dollar ore runnin three feet wide she dont haff to live hereshes worth a half million dollarsbut she likes mining and she likes men she knows how to handle em tooas youll find out shes hailfellow with us allbut i tell ye shes got to like a feller all through before he sees the inside of her parlor shes stuck on you were good friendsshe come to call on my wife yesterday and she talked about you pretty much the hull time i never saw her worse bent up over a man i believe shed marry you mose i do  takes two for a bargain of that kind said mose  the marshal turned but my boy that means making you a half owner of all she haswhy that last mine may go to a million within six months  thats all right mose replied feeling the intended good will of the older man but i expect to find or earn my own money i cant marry a woman fifteen years oldern i am for her money it aint right and it aint decent and youll oblige me by shutting up all such talk  the sheriff humbly sighed she is a good deal older thats a factbut shes took care of herself still as you say its none o my business if she cant persuade you i cant come in and ill introduce you to the managers of the national  cant now i will later  all right so long come in any time  mose stepped into a barber shop to brush up a little for he had acquired a higher estimate of the princess and when he entered the dining room of the palace he made a handsome figure whatever he wore acquired distinction from his beauty his hat no matter how stained possessed charm his dark shirt displayed the splendid shape of his shoulders and his cartridge belt slanted across his hip at just the right angle  the woman waiting for him smiled with an exultant glint in her halfconcealed eyes  sit there she commanded pointing at a chair two beers she said to the waiter  mose took the chair opposite and looked at her smilelessly he waited for her to move  ever been eastchicago washington  no  want to go  no  she smiled again know anything about mining  not a thing  she looked at him with a musing admiring glance ive got a big cattle ranchwill you superintend it for me  where is it  she laughed and stammered a little welli mean ive been thinking of buying one im kind o tired of these mining towns i believe id like to live on a ranch with you to superintend it  his face darkened again and she hastened to say the cattle business is going to boom again soon theyre all dropping out of it fast but now is the time to get in and buy  the beer came and interrupted her heres to good luck she said they drank and as she daintily touched her lips with her handkerchief she lifted her eyes to him againstrange eyes with lovely green and yellow and pink lights in them not unlike some semiprecious stones  you dont like me she said why wont you let me help you  you want a squaretoed answer he asked grimly looking her steadily in the eyes  she paled a little yes  there is a girl in iowai make it my business to work for her  her eyes fell and her right hand slowly turned the mug around and around when she looked up she seemed older and her eyes were sadder that need make no difference  but it does he said slowly it makes all the difference there is  she became suddenly very humble you misunderstand mei mean ill help you both how do you expect to live  his eyes fell now he flushed and shifted uneasily in his chair i dont know then he unbent a little in saying thats whats bothering me right now  she pursued her advantage if you marry youve got to quit all this trail business  dead sure thing and that scares me too i dont know how id stand being tied down to a stake  she laid a hand on his arm now see here mose you let me help you you know all about cattle and the trail you can shoot and throw a rope but youre a babe at lots of other things youve got to get to work at something settle right down and dig up some dust now isnt that so  i reckon thats the size of it  it was singular how friendly she now seemed in his eyes there was something so frank and gentle in her voice though her eyes remained sinister that he began almost to trust her  well now i tell you what you can do you take the job i got for you with the express company and ill look around and corral something else for you  he could not refuse to take her hand upon this compact then she said with an attempt to be careless have you a picture of this girl id like to see how she looks  his face darkened again no he said shortly i never had one of her  she recognized his unwillingness to say more  well goodby come and see me  he parted from her with a sense of having been unnecessarily harsh with a woman who wished to be his good friend  he was hungry and that made him think of his horse which he returned to at once after watering and feeding his tired beast he turned in at a coffeehouse and bought a lunchnot being able to afford a meal everywhere he went men pointed a timid or admiring thumb at him they were unobtrusive about it but it annoyed him at the moment his mind was too entirely filled with perplexities to welcome strangers greetings i must earn some money was the thought which brought with it each time the offer of the express company he determined each time to take it although it involved riding the same trail over and over again which made him shudder to think of but it was three times the pay of a cowboy and a single month of it would enable him to make his trip to the east  after his luncheon he turned in at the office and sullenly accepted the job youre just the man we need said the manager weve had two or three holdups here but with you on the seat i shall feel entirely at ease marshal haney has recommended youand i know your record as a daring man can you go out tomorrow morning  quicker the better  id like to have you sleep here in the office ill see that you have a good bed  anywhere  after mose went out the manager winked at the marshal and said  its a good thing to have him retained on our side hed make a bad man on the holdup side  sure thing replied haney  while loitering on a street corner still busy with his problems mose saw a tall man on a fine black horse coming down the street the rider slouched in his saddle like a tired man but with the grace of a true horseman on his bushy head sat a wide soft hat creased in the middle his suit was brown corduroy  mose thought if that bushy head was not so white i should say it was fathers it is father  he let him pass staring in astonishment at the transformation in the minister well well the old man has woke up he looks the real thing sure  a drum struck up suddenly and the broncho never too tired to shy gave a frenzied leap the rider went with him reins in hand heels set well in knees grasping the saddle  mose smiled with genuine pleasure i didnt know he could ride like that and he turned to follow with a genuine interest  he came up to mr excell just as the marshal stepped out of the crowd and accosted him for the first time in his life mose was moved to joke his father  marshal that man is a dangerous character i know him put him out  the father turned and a smile lit his darkly tanned face harry  mose made a swift sign old man how are ye the ministers manner pleased his son he grasped his fathers hand with a heartiness that checked speech for the moment then he said i was looking for you where you from  ive got a summer camp between here and the springs i saw the notice of you in yesterdays paper ive been watching the newspapers for a long time hoping to get some word of you i seized the first chance and came on  mose turned marshal ill vouch for this man hes an old neighbor of mine  mr excell slipped to the ground and mose took the rein on his arm come lets put the horse with mine they walked away elbow to elbow a wonderful change had swept over mr excell he was brown alert and vigorousbut more than all his eyes were keen and cheerful and his smile ready and manly  youre looking well said the son  i am well since i struck the high altitudes im a new man i dont wonder you love this life  are you preaching  yes i speak once a week in the springs i ride down the trail from my cabin and back again the same day the fact is i stayed in rock river till i was nearly broken i lost my health and became morbid trying to preach to the needs of the old men and women of my congregation now i am free i am back to the wild country of course so long as my wife lived i couldnt break away but now i have no one but myself and my needs are small i am happier than i have been for years  as they walked and talked together the two men approached an understanding mr excell felt sure of his sons interest for the first time in many years and avoided all terms of affection in his return to the more primitive bolder life he unconsciously left behind him all the soft phrases which had disgusted his son he struck the right note almost without knowing it and the son precisely as he perceived in his father a return to rugged manliness opened his hand to him  together they took care of the horse together they walked the streets they sat at supper together and the fathers joy was very great when at night they camped together and mose so far unbent as to tell of his adventures he did not confide his feeling for maryhis love was far too deep for that a strange woman had reached it by craft a fathers affection failed of it     chapter xviii  the eagle guards the sheep   mose did not enter upon his duties as guard with joy it seemed like small business and not exactly creditable employment for a trailer and cow puncher it was in his judgment a foolish expenditure of money but as there was nothing better to do and his need of funds was imperative he accepted it  the papers made a great deal of it complimenting the company upon its shrewdness and freely predicted that no more holdups would take place along that route mose rode out of town on the seat with the driver a winchester between his knees and a belt of cartridges for both rifle and revolvers showing beneath his coat he left the stable each morning at four a m and rode to the halfway house where he slept over night returning the following day from the halfway house to the springs there were settlers and less danger  he was conscious of being an object of curious inquiry meeting stage coaches was equivalent to being fired at by fifty pistols low words echoed from lip to lip black mose bad man graveyard of his own good fellow when sober etc sometimes irritated and reckless he lived up to his sinister reputation and when some eastern gentleman in brown corduroy timidly approached to say fine weather mose turned upon him a baleful glare under which the questioner shriveled to the delight of the driver who vastly admired the new guard  at times he was unnecessarily savage wellmeaning men who knew nothing about him except that he was a guard were rebuffed in quite the same way he was indeed becoming selfconscious as if on exhibition somehowand this feeling deepened as the days passed for nothing happened no lurking forms showed in the shadow of the pines no voice called halt it became more and more like a stage play  he was much disturbed by jacks letter which was waiting for him one night when he returned to wagon wheel      dear harry i went up to see mary a few weeks ago and found     she had gone to chicago her father died over a year ago and     she decided soon after to go to the city and go on with her     music  shes in some conservatory there i dont know which     one i tried hard to keep her on my own account but she     wouldnt listen to me  well yes she listened but she shook     her head she dropped king soon after your visitwhether you     had anything to do with that or not i dont knowi think you     did but as you didnt write she gave you up as a bad     job she always used to talk of you and wonder where you     were and every time i called she used to sing if i were a     voice she never said she was singing it for you but there     were tears in her eyesand in mine too old man you     oughtnt to be throwing yourself away in that wild     godforsaken country we discussed you most of the time once     in a while shed see a little note in the paper about you     and cut it out and send it to me i did the same we heard of     you at flagstaff arizona then that row you had with the     mormons was the next we knew but we couldnt write she said     it was pretty tough to hear of you only in some scrape but i     told her your side hadnt been heard from and that gave her a     lot of comfort the setto you had about the indians right     to hunt pleased us both that was a straight case she said     it was like a knight of the olden time      she was uneasy about you and once she said i wish i could     reach him that rough life terrifies me hes in constant     danger i think she was afraid youd take to drinking and i     own up old man that worries me if you only had somebody     to look after yousomebody to work forlike i have im     going to be married in september you know heronly she was     a little girl when you lived here her name is lily     blanchard      i wish i could help you about mary im going to write to     one or two parties who may know her address if shes in     chicago you could visit her without any trouble they     wouldnt get on to you there at all if you go be sure and     come this way your father went to denver from herehave you     heard from him  there was deep commotion in the trailers brain that night the hope he had was too sacredly sweet to put into wordsthe hope that she still thought of him and longed for him if jack were right then she had waited and watched for him through all those years of wandering while he bitter and unrelenting and believing that she was kings wife had refused to listen for her voice on sunday evenings if she had kept her promise then on the trail in cañons dark and deathly still on the moonlit sand of the painted desert on the high divides of the needle range her thought had been winged toward him in songand he had not listened  his thought turned now for the first time toward the great city which was to him a savage jungle of unknown things a web of wire a maze of streets a swirling flood of human beings of interest now merely and solely because mary had gone to live therein im due to make another trip east he said to himself with a grim straightening of the lips  it was mighty serious business to take kintuck and hit the trail for the kalispels over a thousand miles of mountain and plain was simple but to thrust himself amid the mad rush of a great city made his bold heart quail money was a minor consideration in the hills but in the city it was a matter of life and death money he must now have and as he could not borrow or steal it it must be earned in a month his wages would amount to one hundred dollars but that was too slow he saw no other way however so set his teeth and prepared to go on with the fool business of guarding the treasure wagon of the express company  his mind reverted often to the cowboy tournament which was about to come off after hanging fire for a month during which grassi wrestled with the problem of how to hold a bullfight in opposition to the laws of the state if i could whirl in and catch one of those purses thought mose i could leave at the end of august if i dont i must hang on till the first of october  he determined to enter for the roping contest and for the cowboy race and the revolver practice marshal haney was delighted ill attend to the business but the entrance fees will be about twenty dollars  this staggered mose it meant an expenditure of nearly one fourth his months pay in entrance fees not to speak of the expense of keeping kintuck for the old horse had to go into training and be grainfed as well however he was too confident of winning to hesitate he drew on his wages and took a day off to fetch kintuck whom he found fat and hearty and very dirty  the boys at the reynolds ranch were willing to bet on mose and every soul determined to be there cora said quietly i know youll win  well i dont expect to sweep the board but ill get a lunch while the rest are getting a full meal he replied and returned to his duties  the weather did not change for the tournament each morning the sun arose flashing with white undimmed fire at ten oclock great dazzling white clouds developed from hidden places behind huge peaks and as they expanded each let fall a veil of shimmering white storms that were hail on the heights and sleet on the paths in the valleys these clouds passed swiftly the sun came out the dandelions shone vividly through their coverlet of snow the eaves dripped the air was like march and the sunsets like november  naturally sunday was the day fixed upon for the tournament and early on that day miners in clean check shirts and bright new blue overalls began to stream away up the road which led to the race track some two miles away on the only level ground for a hundred miles swift horses hitched to light open buggies whirled along loaded down with men horsemen galloped down the slopes in squadronsand such horsemencowboys from lost park and the animas prospectors like casey and kelly who were quite as much at home on a horse as with a pick in a ditch and men like marshal haney and grassi who were allround plainsmen and by that same token born horsemen haney and kelly rode with reynolds and mose while cora and mrs reynolds followed in a rusty buggy drawn by a fleabitten gray cow pony sedate with age  kintuck was as alert as a fouryearold his rest had filled him to bursting with ambition to do and to serve his muscles played under his shining skin like those of a trained athlete obedient to the lightest touch or word of his master with ears in restless motion he curvetted like a racer under the wire  wouldnt know that horse was twelve years old would you gentlemen said reynolds well so he is and he has covered fifteen thousand miles o trail  mose was at his best with vivid tie flowing from the collar of his blue shirt with a new hat properly crushed in on the crown in four places with shining revolver at his hip and his rope coiled at his right knee he sat his splendid horse haughty and impassive of countenance responding to the greetings of the crowd only with a slight nod or a wave of the hand  it seemed to him that the population of the whole stateat least its menwas assembled within the big stockade there were a few womenjust enough to add decorum to the crowd they were for the most part the wives or sisters or sweethearts of those who were to contest for prizes but as mose rode around the course he passed the princess sitting in her shining barouche and waving a handkerchief he pretended not to see her though it gave him pleasure to think that the most brilliantlydressed woman on the grounds took such interest in him another man would have ridden up to her carriage but mose kept on steadily to the judges stand where he found a group of cowboys discussing the programme with haney the marshal of the day  mose already knew his dangerous rivala powerful and handsome fellow called denver dan whose face was not unlike his own his nose was straight and strong his chin finely modeled and his head graceful but he was heavier and a persistent flush on his nose and in his eyelids betrayed the effects of liquor his hands were small and graceful and he wore his hat with a certain attractive insolence but his mouth was cruel and his eyes menacing when in liquor he was known to be ferocious he was mounted on a superbly pointed grade broncho and all his hangings were of costly mexican workmanship and betrayed use  the first thing is a packing contest read haney  oh to hl with that im no packer growled dan  i try that said mose i let nothing get away today  entrance fee one dollar  here you are mose tossed a dollar  then roping and holding contest  now youre talking my business exclaimed dan  there are others said mose  dan turned a contemptuous look on the speakerbut changed his expression as he met moses eyes  howdy mose  sos to sit a horse mose replied in a tone which cut he was not used to being patronized by men of dans set  the crowd perceived the growing rivalry between the two men and winked joyously at each other  at last all was arranged the spectators were assembled on the rude seats the wind sweet clear and cool came over the smooth grassy slopes to the west while to the east gorgeous as sunlit marble rose the great snowy peaks with huge cumulus cloudsapparently standing on edgepeeping over their shoulders from behind mose observed them and mentally calculated that it would not shower till three in the afternoon  in the track before the judges stand six piles of truck each pile precisely like the others lay in a row each consisted of a sack of flour a bundle of bacon a bag of beans a box a camp stove a pick a shovel and a tent these were to be packed covered with a mantle and caught by the diamond hitch  mose laid aside hat and coat and as the six pack horses approached seized the one intended for him catching the saddle blanket up by the corners he shook it straight folded it once twiceand threw it to the horse the sawbuck followed it the cinch flying high so that it should go clear a tug a grunt from the horse and the saddle was on unwinding the sling ropes he made his loops and endpacked the box against it he put both flour and beans folding the tent square he laid it between on this he set the stove and packing the smaller bags around it threw on the mantle as he laid the hitch and began to go around the pack the crowd began to cheer  go it mose  hes been there before  well i guess said another  mose set his foot to the pack and pinched the hitch in front nothing remained now but the pick shovel and coffee can the tools he crowded under the ropes on either side tied the cans under the pack at the back and called kintuck come on boy the old horse with shining eyes drew near catching his mane mose swung to the saddle kintuck nipped the laden cayuse and they were off while the next best man was still worrying over the hitch  nine dollars to the good on that transaction muttered mose as the marshal handed him a ten dollar gold piece  the next exercise on the programme announced haney will be the roping contest the crowd will please be as quiet as possible while this is going on bring on your cows  down the track in a cloud of dust came a bunch of cattle of all shapes and sizes they came snuffing and bawling urged on by a band of cowboys while a cordon of older men down the track stopped and held them before the judges stand  first exerciserope and hold called the marshal denver dan comes first  dan spurred into the arena his rope swinging gracefully in his supple upraised wrist  which one you want he asked  the lineback yearling called haney  with careless cast dan picked up both hind feet of the calfhis horse set his hoofs and held the bawling brute  all right called the judge the rope was slackened and the calf leaped up dan then successively picked up any foot designated by the marshal left hind foot right fore foot and so on with almost unerring accuracy his horse calm and swift obeyed every word and every shift of his riders body the crowd cheered and those who came after added nothing to the contest  mose rode into the inclosure with impassive face he could only duplicate the deeds of those who had gone before so long as his work was governed by the marshalbut when as in the case of others he was free to put on frills he did so tackling the heaviest and wildest steer he dropped his rope over one horn and caught up one foot then taking a loose turn about his pommel he spoke to kintuck the steer reached the end of the rope with terrible force it seemed as if the saddle must give waybut the strain was cunningly met and the brute tumbled and laid flat with a wild bawl while kintuck held him mose took a cigar from his pocket bit the end off struck a match and puffed carelessly and lazily it was an old trick but well done and the spectators cheered heartily  after a few casts of almost equal brilliancy mose leaped to the ground with the rope in his hand and while kintuck looked on curiously he began a series of movements which one of delmars mexicans had taught him with the noose spread wide he kept it whirling in the air as if it were a hoop he threw it into the air and sprang through it he lowered it to the ground and leaping into it flung it far above his head in his hand this inert thing developed snakelike action it took on loops and scallops and retained them apparently in defiance of all known laws of physicscontrolled and governed by the easy almost imperceptible motions of his steellike wrist  fortyfive dollars more to the good said mose grimly as the decision came in his favor  see heregoing to take all the prizes asked one of the judges  so long as you keep to my line of business replied he  the races came next kintuck took first money on the straightaway dash but lost on the long race around the pole it nearly broke his heart but he came in second to denver dans sorrel twice in succession  mose patted the old horse and said never mind old boy you pulled in forty dollars more for me  reynolds had tears in his eyes as he came up  the old hoss caint compete on the long stretches hes like a middleaged manall right for a short dashbut the youngsters have the best windthey get him on the mile course  in the trained pony contest the old horse redeemed himself he knelt at command laid out flat while mose crouched behind and at the word up sprang to his feet and waitedthen with his master clinging to his mane he ran in a circle or turned to right or left at signal all the tricks which the cavalry had taught their horses mose in years on the trail had taught kintuck he galloped on three legs and waltzed like a circus horse he seemed to know exactly what his master said to him  a man with a big red beard came up to mose as he rode off the track and said  whatll you take for that horse  mose gave him a savage glance he aint for sale  the bronchobusting contest mose declined  hows that inquired haney who hated to see his favorite gig back at a point where his courage could be tested  ive busted all the bronchos for fun im going to mose replied  dan called in a sneering tone bring on your varmints im not dodgin mean cayuses today  mose could not explain that for marys sake he was avoiding all danger there was risk in the contest and he knew it and he couldnt afford to take it  thats all right he sullenly replied ill be with you later in the game  a walleyed roan pony looking dull and stupid was led before the stand saddled and bridled he stood dozing while the crowd hooted with derision  dont make no mistake shouted haney hes the meanest critter on the upper fork  a young lad named jimmy kincaid first tackled the job and as he ran alongside and tried the cinch the roan dropped an ear backthe ear toward jimmy and the knowing ones giggled with glee hes wakinup look out jim  the lad gathered the reins in his left hand seized the pommel with his right and then the roan disclosed his true nature he was an old rebel he did not waste his energies on common means he plunged at once into the most complicated furious and effective bucking he could devise almost without moving out of his tracksand when the boy stunned and bleeding at the nose sprawled in the dust the roan moved away a few steps and dozed panting and tense apparently neither angry nor frightened  one of the reynolds gang tried him next and stayed with him till he threw himself when he arose the rider failed to secure his stirrups and was thrown after having sat the beast superbly the miners were warming to the old roan many of them had never seen a pitching broncho before and their delight led to loud whoops and jovial outcries  bully boy roan shake em off  denver dan tried him next and sat him haughtily contemptuous till he stopped quivering with fatigue and reeking with sweat  oh well yelled a big miner that aint a fair shake for the pony you should have took him when he was fresh and the crowd sustained him in it  here comes one that is fresh called the marshal and into the arena came a wickedeyed superblyfashioned black roan horse plainly wild and unbroken led by two cowboys one on either side  joe grassi shook a handfull of bills down at the crowd heres a hundred dollars to the man wholl set that pony three minutes by the watch  this is no place to tackle such a brute as that said reynolds  mose was looking straight ahead with a musing look in his eyes  denver dan walked out i need that hundred dollars nail it to a post for a few minutes will ye  this was no tricky old cow pony but a natively vicious powerful and cunning young horse while the cowboys held him dan threw off his coat and hat and bound a bandanna over the bronchoss head and pulled it down over his eyes laying the saddle on swiftly but gently he cinched it strongly with determined and vigorous movement he thrust the bit into his mouth  slack away he called to the ropers the horse nearly dead for lack of breath drew a deep sigh  haney called out stand clear everybody clear the road  and casting one rope to the ground dan swung into the saddle  for just an instant the horse crouched low and waitedthen shot into the air with a tigerish bound and fell stifflegged again and again he flung his head down humped his back and sprang into the air grunting and squealing with rage and fear dan sat him but the punishment made him swear suddenly the horse dropped and rolled hoping to catch his rider unawares dan escaped by stepping to the ground but he was white and the blood was oozing slowly from his nose as the brute arose dan was in the saddle with two or three tremendous bounds the horse flung himself into the air like a highvaulting acrobat landing so near the fence that dan swerving far to the left was unseated and sprawled low in the dust while the squealing broncho went down the track bucking and lashing out with undiminished vigor  dan staggered to his feet stunned and bleeding he swore most terrible oaths that he would ride that walleyed brute if it took a year  youve had your turn it was a fair fight called kelly  whos the next ambitious man shouted haney  i dont want no truck with that said the cowboys among themselves  not in a place like this said jimmy a fellers liable to get mashed agin a fence  mose stood with hands gripping a post his eyes thoughtful suddenly he threw off his coat  ill try him he said  oh i dont think youd better itll bung you all up cautioned reynolds  mose said in a low voice im good for him and i need that money  let him breathe awhile called the crowd as the broncho was brought back lariated as before give him a show for his life  mose muttered to reynolds hes due to bolt and im going to quirt him aplenty  the spectators tense with joy filled the air with advice and warning dont let him get started keep him away from the fence  mose wore a set and serious look as he approached the frenzied beast there was danger in this tricka broken leg or collar bone might make his foolhardiness costly in his minds eye he could foresee the bronchos action he had escaped down the track once and would do the same again after a few desperate boundsnevertheless mose dreaded the terrible concussion of those stifflegged leapings  standing beside the animals shoulder he slipped off the ropes and swung to the saddle the beast went off as before with three or four terrible buck jumps but mose plied the quirt with wild shouting and suddenly abandoning his pitching the horse set off at a tearing pace around the track for nearly half way he ran steadilythen began once more to hump his back and leap into the air  hes down yelled some one  no hes up againand mose is there said haney  the crowd not to be cheated of their fun raced across the oval where the battle was still going on  the princess was white with anxiety and ordered her coachman to get there quick as godll let ye when she came in sight the horse was tearing at moses foot with his teeth  times up called haney  make it ten said mose whose blood was hot  the beast dropped and rolled but arose again under the sting of the quirt and renewed his frenzied attack as mose roweled him he kicked with both hind feet as if to tear the cinch from his belly he reared on his toes and fell backward he rushed with ferocious cunning against the corral forcing his rider to stand in the opposite stirrup then bucked keeping so close to the fence that mose was forced to hang to his mane and fight him from tearing his flesh with his savage teeth twice he went down and rolled over but when he arose mose was on his back twice he flung himself to the earth and the second time he broke the bridle rein but mose catching one piece kept his head up while he roweled him till the blood dripped in the dust  at last after fifteen minutes of struggle the broncho again made off around the track at a rapid run as he came opposite the judges stand mose swung him around in a circle and leaped to the ground leaving the horse to gallop down the track dusty and quivering with fatigue mose walked across the track and took up his coat  you earned your money mose said grassi as he handed out the roll of bills  ill think so tomorrow morning i reckon replied mose and his walk showed dizziness and weakness  youve had the easy end of it said dan you should have took him when i did when he was fresh  you didnt stay on him long enough to weaken him any said mose in offensive reply and dan did not care to push the controversy any further  that spoils my shooting now mose said to haney i couldnt hit the side of a mule  oh youll stiddy up after dinner  good boy called the crisp voice of mrs raimon come here i want to talk with you  he could not decently refuse to go to the side of her carriage she had with her a plain woman slightly younger than herself who passed for her niece the two men who came with them were in the judges stand  leaning over she spoke with sudden intensity my god you mustnt take such risksim all of a quiver youre too good a man to be killed by a miserable bucking broncho dont do it again for my sakeif that dont count for her sake  and he in sudden joy and confidence replied thats just why i did it for her sake  her eyes set in sudden alarm what do you mean  youll know in a day or two im going to quit my job  i know she said with a quick indrawn breath youre going away whos that girl i saw you talking with today is that the one  he laughed at her for the first time not by a thousand miles  what do you mean by that does she live in chicago  he ceased to laugh and grew a little darker of brow and she quietly added thats none o my business youd like to say all rightsay it isnt but wont you get in and go down to dinner with me i want to honor the championthe ivanhoe of the tournament  he shook his head no ive promised to picnic with some old friends of mine  that girl over there  yes  well just as you say but you must eat with me tonight will you come now what do you say  with a half promise mose walked away toward the reynolds carriagenot without regret for there was charm in the princess both in her own handsome person and because she suggested a singular world of which he knew nothing she allured and repelled at the same time  beside the buggy cora and mrs reynolds had spread a substantial lunch and in such humble company the victor of the tournament ate his dinner while dan and the rest galloped off to a saloon  i dont know what i can do with the gun he said in reply to a question from cora my nerves are still on the jump i guess ill keep out of the contestit would hurt my reputation to miss he turned to reynolds captn i want you to get me a chance to punch cattle on a car down to chicago  reynolds looked surprised what fur do you want to go to chicago mose i never have knew you to mention hit befo  mose felt his skin growing red well i just thought id like to take a turn in the states and see the elephant  youll see the hull circus if you go to chicago said mrs reynolds they say its a terrible wicked place  i dont suppose its any worse than wagon wheel ma said cora  yes but its so much bigger  well mother said reynolds a bear is bigger than a honet but the honet can give him points and beat him suah thing  mose was rather glad of this diversion for when reynolds spoke again it was to say i reckon i can fix it for you when do you want it  right off this week  be gone long  cora waited anxiously for his answer and his hesitation and uncertainty of tone made her heart grow heavy  oh noonly a short trip i reckon got to get back before my money gives out  he did not intend to enter the revolver contest but it offered so easy to his hand that he went in and won hands down his arm was lame but his nerves not fevered by whisky swiftly recovered tone he was careful however not to go beyond the limits of the contest as he should have done had his arm possessed all of its proper cunning he had no real competitor but dan who had been drinking steadily all day and was unfitted for his work mose lost nothing in the trial  that night he put into his pocket one hundred and twenty dollars as the result of his days work and immediately asked to be released of his duties as guard  the manager of the express company said im sorry youre leaving us and i hope youll return to us soon ill hold the place open for you if you say so  this mose refused i dont like it he said i dont think i earn the money hire a good driver and hell have no trouble you dont need me  mindful of his promise to eat dinner with the princess he said to reynolds dont wait for me go onill overtake you at twelve mile creek  the princess had not lost sight of him for a single moment and the instant he departed from his friends she drove up you are to come to my house tonight remember  i must overtake my folks i cant stay long he said lamely  her power was augmented by her home he had expected pictures and fine carpets and a piano and they were there but there was a great deal more he perceived a richness of effect which he could not have formulated better than to say it was all fine he had expected things to be costly and gay of color but this mysterious fitness of everything was a marvel to one like himself used only to the meager ornaments of the homes in rock river or the threadbare poverty of the ranches and the squalid hotels of the cow country the house was a large new frame building not so much different from other houses with respect to exterior but as he entered the door he took off his hat to it as he used to do as a lad in the home of banker brooks deacon in his fathers church  his was a sensitive soul eye and ear were both acute he perceived without accounting for it that the walls and hangings were complementary in color that the furniture matched the carpet and that the pictures on the wall were unusually good they were not all highlycolored naked subjects as he had been led to expect his respect for mrs raimon rose for he remembered that marys home while just as different from this as mary was different from mrs raimon had after all something in commonboth were beautiful to him though marys home was sweeter daintier and homelier he was in the midst of an analysis of these subtleties when mrs raimon as he now determined to call her returned from changing her dress  he was amazed at the change in her she wore a dark gray gown with almost no ornament and looked smaller older and paler but incomparably more winning and womanly than she had ever seemed before she appeared to be serious and her voice was gentle and winning  well boy here you areunder my roof not such an awful den after all is it she said with a smile  beats a holler log in a snowstorm he replied looking about the room must have shipped all this truck from the states it never was built out hereit would take me a couple of months to earn a whole outfit like this wouldnt it  she remained serious mose i want to tell you  wait a minute he interrupted lets start fair my name is harold excell and im going to call you mrs raimon  she thrust out her hand good boy he could see she was profoundly pleased indeed she could not at once resume at last she said i was going to say harold that you cant earn a home trailin around over these mountains year after year with a band of indians  he became thoughtful i reckon youre right about that im wasting time ive got to picket old kintuck somewhere and go to work if i  he stopped abruptly and she smiled mournfully you neednt hesitate tell me all about it  he sat in silencea silence that at last became a rebuke she arose well suppose we go out to supper we can talk all the better there  he felt out of place and selfconscious but he gave little outward sign of it as he took his seat at the table opposite her for reasons of her own she emphasized the domestic side of her life and fairly awed the stern youth by her womanly dignity and grace the little table was set for two with pretty dishes liquor had no place on the cover but a shining teapot brought in by a smiling negress was placed at her right hand her talk for a time was of the tea the food his taste as to sugar and other things pertaining to her duties as hostess all his lurid imaginings of her faded into the wind and a thousand new and old conceptions of wife and home and peaceful middle age came thronging like sobercolored birds if she were playing a game it was well done and successful mose fell often into silence and deep thought  she respected his introspection and busying herself with the service and with lowvoiced orders to the waitress left him free for a time  suddenly she turned you mustnt judge me by what people say outside judge me by what i am to you i dont claim to be a sundayschool teacher but i average up pretty well after all i appear to a disadvantage when raimon died i took hold of his business out here and ive made it pay i have a talent for business and i like it ive got enough to be silly with if i want to but i intend to take care of myselfand i may even marry again i can see youre deeply involved in a love affair mose and i honestly want to help youbut i shant say another word about itonly remember when you need help you come to martha jane williams raimon how is that for a name its mine my father was lawrence todd williams professor of paleontology at blank college raimon was an actor of the tenth ratethe kind that play leading business in the candlestick circuit naturally doctor todd objected to an actor as a soninlaw i eloped launt was a good fellow and we had a happy honeymoon but he lost his health and came out here and invested in a mine that brought me i was always lucky and we struck itbut the poor fellow didnt live long enough to enjoy it you know all she ended with a curious forced lightness of utterance  after another characteristic silence mose said slowly anyhow i want you to understand that im much obliged for your good will im not worth a cuss at putting things in a smooth way i think im getting worse every day but youve been my friend andand theres no discount on my words when i tell you youve made me feel ashamed of myself today from this time on i take no other mans judgment of a woman you know my lifeall there is that would interest you i dont know how to talk to a womanany kind of a womanbut no matter what i say i dont mean to do anybody any harm im getting a good deal like an indiani talk to make known whats on my mind since i was seventeen years of age ive let girls pretty well alone the kind i meet alongside the trail dont interest me when i was a boy i was glib enough but i know a whole lot less now than i did thenthat is about some things what i started to say is this im mighty much obliged for what youve done for me herebut im going to pull out tonight  not for good she said  wellthats beyond me all i know is i hit the longest and wildest trail i ever entered where it comes out at i dont know but i shant forget you youve been a good friend to me  her voice faltered a little as she said i wish youd write to me and let me know how you are  oh dont expect that of me i chew my tongue like a tenyearold kid when i write i never was any good at it and im clear out of it now the chances are ill round up in the mountains again i cant see how id make a living anywhere else if i come back this way ill let you know  neither of them was eating now and the tension was great she knew that no artifice could keep him and he was aware of her emotion and was eager to escape  he pushed back his chair at last and she arose and came toward him and took his hand standing so close to him that her bosom almost touched his shoulder  i hate to see you go she said and the passionate tremor in her voice moved him very deeply youve brought back my interest in simple thingsand life seems worth while when im with you  he shook her hand and then dropped it well so long  so long she said and added with another attempt at brightness and dont stay away too long and dont fail to let me know when you make the circuit  as he mounted his horse he remembered that there was another goodby to speak and that was to cora  i wish these women would let a man go without saying goodby at all he thought in irritation but the patter of kintucks feet set his thought in other directions as he topped the divide he drew rein and looked at the great range to the southeast lit by the dull red light of the sun which had long since set to the settlers in the valley his heart was for a moment divided the joys of the trailthe carefree lifeperhaps after all the family life was not for him perhaps he was chasing a mirage he was on the divide of his life on one side were the mountains the camps the cattle the wild animalson the other the plains the cities and mary  the thought of mary went deep it took hold of the foundations of his thinking and decided him shuddering with the pain and despair of his love he lifted rein and rode down into the deep shadow of the long cañon through which roared the swift waters of the north fork on their long journey to the east and south thereafter he had no uncertainties like the water of the cañon he had but to go downward to the plain     chapter xix  the eagle adventures into strange lands   it can not be said that the black eagle of the rocky mountains approached civilization in any heroic disguise at its best accompanying a cattle train is not epic in its largeness to prod cattle by means of a long pole to pull out smothered sheep are not in themselves degrading deeds but they are not picturesque in quality they smell of the shambles not of the hills  day by day the train slid down the shining threads of track like a long string of rectangular green and brown and yellow beads the caboose was filled with cattlemen and their assistants who smoked talked politics told stories and slept at all hours of the day whenever a spare segment of bench offered those who were awake saw everything and commented on everything in sight to some the main questions were when and where they were to get dinner or secure a drink the train being a through freight ran almost as steadily as a passenger train and the thirsty souls became quite depressed or savage at times by lack of opportunities to wet their whistles  mose was singularly silent for he was reliving his boyish life on the plains and noting the changes which had taken place the towns had grown gray with the bleach of the weather farms had multiplied and fences cut the range into pasture lands as the mountains sank beneath the level horizon line his heart sank with them every hour of travel to the east was to him dangerous disheartening on the second day he was ready to leap from the caboose and wave it goodby but he did nothe merely sat on the back platform and watched the track he felt as if he were in one of those aerial buckets which descend like eagles from the mines in the marshall basin the engine appeared to proceed eastward of its own weight impossible to check or turn back  the uncertainty of finding mary in the millions of the city weakened his resolution but as he was aboard and as the train slid while he pondered descending remorselessly he determined to stay with it as he would with a bucking broncho  kansas city with its big depot sheds filled with clangor and swarming with emigrants gave him a foretaste of chicago two of his companions proceeded to get drunk and became so offensive that he was forced to cuff them into quiet this depressed him alsohe had no other defense but his hands his revolvers were put away in his valise where they could not be reached in a hurry reynolds had said to him now mose youre going into a country where they settle things with fists so leave your guns at home keep cool and dont mix in where theres no call to mix in if a man gives you lipwalk off and leave himdont hunt your guns  mose had also purchased a hard hat and shaved off his mustache in cañon city and reynolds himself would not have known him as he sauntered about the station room every time he lifted his fingers to his mustache he experienced a shock and coming before a big mirror over the fireplace he stared with amazementso boyish and so sorrowful did he appear to himself it seemed as though he were playing a part  as the train drew out of the town night was falling and the east grew mysterious as the thitherward side of the river of death familiar things were being left behind uncertainties thickened like the darkness all night long the engine hooted and howled and jarred along through the deep darkness and every time the train stopped the cattle and sheep were inspected lanterns held aloft disclosed cattle being trampled to death and sheep smothering wild shouting oaths broke forth accompanied by thumpings and the rumbling and creaking of cars as the cattle surged to and fro and at the end circles of firelanterns signaling go aheadcaused a wild rush for the caboose  morning brought to light a land of small farms with cattle in minute pastures surrounded by stacks of hay and grain plowed fields threshing crews and teams plodding to and fro on dusty roads the plainsman was gone the prairie farmer filled the landscape towns thickened and grew larger at noon the freight lay at a siding to let the express trains come in at a populous city and in the wait mose found time to pace the platform the people were better dressed the cowboy hat was absent and nearly everybody wore not merely a coat but a vest and linen collar some lovely girls looking crisp as columbines or plains poppies looked at him from the doors of the parlor cars they suggested mary to him of course and made him realize how far he was getting from the range  these dainty girls looked and acted like some of those he had seen in cañon city and the springs they walked with the same step and held their dresses the same way that must be the fashion he thought the men of the town were less solemn than plainsmen they smiled oftener and they joked more easily mose wondered how so many of them made a living in one place he heard one girl say to another yesbut hes awful sad looking dont you think so and it was some minutes before he began to understand that they were talking about him then he wished he knew what else they had said  there was little chance to see the towns for the train whirled through them with furious jangle of bell and whiz of steamor else drew up in the freight yard a long way out from the station when night fell on this the third day they were nearing the great river and all the cattlemen were lamenting the fact those who had been over the line before said  too bad fellers youd ought to see the mississippi shes a looloo the bridge too is worth seein  during the evening there was a serious talk about hotels and the amusements to be had one faction led by mccleary of currant creek stood for the drovers home its right out near the stockyards an its a good place dollar a day covers everything unless you want a big room which is a quarter extra grub is all rightand some darn nice girls waitin on the table too  but thompson who owned the sheep was contemptuous i want to be in town i dont go to chicago to live out in the stockyards i want to be where things go by i ante my valise at the grand palace or the new merchants the best is good enough for me  mccleary looked a little put down well thats all right for a man who can afford it ive got a big family and i wouldnt feel right to be blowing in two or three dollars a day just for style  wherever the girls are thickest theres where youll find me said one of the young fellows  thats me said another  thompson smiled with a superior air you fellersll bring up down on south clark street before you end some choice dive on the levee is gappin for you now mind you i wont bail you out you go into the game with your eyes open he said and his banter was highly pleasing to the accused ones  mccleary turned to harold whom he knew only as hank and said  hank you aint sayin a word whatre your plans  ill stay with you as long as you need me  all right ill take care o you then  night fell before they came in sight of the city they were woefully behindhand and everything delayed them after a hundred hesitations succeeded by fierce forward dashes after switching this way and that they came to a final halt in a jungle of freight cars a chaos of mysterious activities and a dense hot steaming atmosphere that oppressed and sickened the men from the mountains lanterns sparkled and looped and circled and fierce cries arose engines snorted in sullen labor charging to and fro aimlessly it appeared and all around cattle were bawling sheep were pleading for release and swine lifted their piercing protests against imprisonment  here we are in chicago said mccleary who always entered the city on that side now fellers watch out for yourselves keep your hands on your wallets and dont blow out the electric light  oh you go to hell was their jocular reply  were no spring chickens  you go up against this town my boys and youll think youre just out o the shell  mose said nothing he had the indifferent air of a man who had been often to the great metropolis and knew exactly what he wished to do  it was after twelve oclock when the crowd of noisy cattlemen tramped into the drovers home glad of a safe ending of their trip they were all boisterous and all of them were liquorous except harold who drank little and remained silent and uncommunicative he had been most efficient in all ways and mccleary was grateful and filled with admiration of him he had taken him without knowing who he was merely because reynolds requested it but he now said  hank youre a jimdandy i want you when youve had your spree here you come back with me and ill do the right thing by ye  harold thanked him in offhand phrase and went early to bed  he had not slept in a hotel bed since the night in marmion when jack was with him and the wonderful charm and mystery and passion of those two days so intimately wrought in with passionate memories of mary came back upon him now keeping him awake till nearly dawn he arose late and yet found only mccleary at breakfast the other men had remained so long in the barroom that sleep and drunkenness came together  after breakfast harold wandered out into the street to his left a hundred towers of dull gray smoke rose and prodigious buildings set in empty spaces were like the cliffs of red stone in the quirino beyond great roofs thickened in the haze farther on in that way lay chicago and somewhere in that welter that tumult that terror of the unknown lived mary  with mccleary he took a car that galloped like a broncho and started for the very heart of the mystery as the crowds thickened as the cars they met grew more heavily laden mccleary said  my god where are they all goin how do they all make a livin  that beats me said harold seems as if they eat up all the grub in the world  the older man sighed well i reckon they know what theyre doin but id hate to take my chances among em  if any man had told harold before he started that he would grow irresolute and weak in the presence of the city he would have bitterly resented it but now the mass and weight of things hitherto unimagined appalled and bewildered him  a profound melancholy settled over his heart as the smoke and gray light of the metropolis closed in over his head for half a day he did little more than wander up and down clark street his ears acute as a hounds took hold of every sound and attempted to identify it just as his eyes seized and tried to understand the forms and faces of the swarming pavements he felt his weakness as never before and it made him sullen and irritable he acknowledged also the folly of thrusting himself into such a world and had it not been for a certain tenacity of purpose which was beyond his will he would have returned with his companions at the end of their riotous week  up till the day of their going he had made no effort to find mary but had merely loitered in the streets in the daytime and at night had visited the cheap theaters not knowing the good from the bad the city grew each day more vast and more hateful to him the mere thought of being forced to earn a living in such a mad tumult made him shudder the day that mccleary started west harold went to see him off and after they had shaken hands for the last time harold went to the ticket window and handed in his return coupon to the agent saying id like to have you put that aside for me i dont want to run any chances of losing it  the agent smiled knowingly all right what name  excell xl thats my brand  all right shes right here any time you want herinside of the thirty daystime runs out on the fifteenth  i savvy said harold as he turned away  he disposed his money about his person in four or five small wads and so fortified faced the city to lose his little fund would be like having his pack mule give out in the desert and he took every precaution against such a calamity  nothing of this uncertainty and inner weakness appeared in his outward actions however no one accused him of looking like an easy mark or a soft thing the line of his lips and the lower of his strongly marked eyebrows made strangers slow of approach he was never awkward he could not be so any more than could a fox or a puma but he was restless irresolute brooding and gloomy  he moved down to the occidental grand where he was able to secure a room on the top floor for fifty cents per day his meals he picked up wherever he chanced to be when feeling hungry when weary with his wanderings he often returned to his seat on the sidewalk before the hotel and watched the people pass finding in this a melancholy pleasure  one evening the night clerk a brisk young fellow took a seat beside him this is a great corner for the girls all right a feller can just about take his pick here along about eight theyre after a ticket to the theater and a supper if a feller only has a few seemolleons to spare he can have a life worth livin  mose turned a curious glance upon him if you wanted to find a party in this town how would you go at it  well id try the directory first gooff if i didnt find him there id write to some of his folks if i knew any of em and get a clew if i didnt succeed then id try the police whats his name  harold ignored this query  where could i try this directory  theres one right in there on the desk  that big book  yes  i didnt know what that was i thought it was a dictionary  the clerk shrieked with merriment the dictionary well say where have you been raised  on the range  you mean cowboy  yes we dont need directories out there does that book tell where everybody lives  well no but most everybody shows up in it somewhere replied the clerk quite soberly it had not occurred to him that anybody could live outside a directory  harold got up and went to the book which he turned over slowly looking at the names i dont see that this helps a man much he said to the clerk who came in to help him here is henry coleman lives at 2201 exeter street now how is a man going to find that street  ask a policeman replied the clerk much interested youre not used to towns  not much i can cross a mountain range easier than i can find one of these streets  under the clerks supervision harold found the yardwells thomas and james but marys name did not appear he turned to conservatories and located three or four and having made out a slip of information set forth the first one he found to be situated up several flights of stairs and was closed so was the second the third was in a brilliantly lighted building which towered high above the street on the eighth floor in a small office a young girl with severe cast of countenance and hair parted on one side looked up from her writing and coldly inquired  is there anything i can do for you  is there a girl named mary yardwell in your school he asked with some effort feeling a hot flush in his cheeka sensation new to him  i dont think so ill look replied the girl with business civility she thumbed a book to see and at length replied no sir there is not  much obliged  not at all replied the girl calmly resuming her work  harold went down the steps to avoid the elevator the next place was oppressive with its grandeur a tremendous wall cold and dark except for a single row of lighted windows loomed high overhead in the center of an arched opening in this wall a white hot globe flamed lighting into still more dazzling cleanliness a broad flight of marble steps which led by a half turn to unknown regions above young people were crowding into the elevator girls in dainty costumes predominating they seemed wondrously flowerlike and birdlike to the plainsman and brought back his school days at the seminary and the time when he was at ease with young people like this he had gone far from them nowtheir happy faces made him sad  he walked up the stairway four flights and came to a long hall which rustled and rippled and sparkled with flights of young girlseager vivid excited and carefree a few men moved about like dullcoated robins surrounded by orioles and canary birds  a bland old man with cleanshaven mouth seemed to be the proper source of information and to him harold stepped with his question  the old man smiled miss yardwell yesshe is one of our most valued pupils certainlywilly he called to a small boy who carried a livery of startling newness go tell miss yardwell a gentleman would like to see her  i suppose you are from her country home said the old gentleman who imagined a romance in this relation of a powerful and handsome young man to miss yardwell  i am harold replied briefly  take a seatshe will be here presently  harold took the offered seat with a sick faint feeling at the pit of his stomach the longhopedfor event was at hand it seemed impossible that mary could be therethat she was about to stand before him his mind was filled with the things he had arranged to say to her but they were now in confused mass circling and circling like the wrack of a boat in a rivers whirlpool  he knew her far down the hallhe recognized the poise of her head and her walk which had always been very fine and dignified as she approached the radiance of her dress her beauty scared him she looked at him once and then at the clerk as if to say is this the man  then harold arose and said well mary here i am  for an instant she looked at him and then a light leaped into her eyes  why harold excell she stopped abruptly as he caught her outstretched hands and she remembered the sinister association of the name why why i didnt know you where do you come from her face was flushed her eyes eager searching restless come in here she said abruptly and before he had time to reply she led him to a little anteroom with a cushioned wall seat and they took seats side by side  it is impossible she said still staring at him her bosom pulsating with her quickened breath it is not youit cant be you she whispered black mose sitting herewith mein chicago youre in danger  i dont feel that way  he smiled for the first time and his fine teeth shining from his handsome mouth led her to say  your big mustaches are gonethats the reason i didnt know you at oncei dont believe i like you so well  theyll grow again he said im in disguise he smiled again as if in a joke  again the thought of who he really was flamed through her mind what a life you lead how do you happen to be here i never expected to see you in a cityyou dont fit into a city  im here because you are he replied and the simplicity of his reply moved her deeply i came as soon as i got your letter he went on  my letter ive written only one letter that was soon after your visit to marmion  thats the one i mean i got it nearly four years after you wrote it i hope you havent changed since that letter  im older she said evasively my father died a little over a year ago  i know jack wrote me  why didnt you get my letter sooner  i was on the trail  on the trail you are always on the trail oh the wild life you lead i saw notices of you once or twicealways in some trouble she looked at him smilingly but there was sadness in her smile  its no fault of mine he exclaimed i cant stand by and see some poor indian or chinaman bulliedand besides the papers always exaggerate everything i do you mustnt condemn me till you hear my side of these scrapes  i dont condemn you at all but it makes me sad she slowly replied you are wasting your life out there in the wild countryoh isnt it strange that we should sit here my mind is so busy with the wonder of it i cant talk straight i had given up ever seeing you again  youre not married he asked with startling bluntness  she colored hotly no  are you engaged  no she replied faintly  then youre mine he said with a clutch upon her wrist a masterful intensity of passion in his eyes  dontplease dont she said they will see you  i dont care if they do he exultingly said then his face darkened but perhaps you are ashamed of me  oh no noonly  i couldnt blame you if you were he said bitterly im only a poor devil of a mountaineer not fit to sit here beside you  tell me about yourself she hastened to say what have you been doing all these years she was determined to turn him from his savage arraignment of himself  it wont amount to much in your eyes it isnt worth as much to me as i thought it was going to be when i found king had your promisei hit the trail and i didnt care where it led so it didnt double on itself i didnt want to see or hear anything of you again what became of king why did you turn him loose  her eyelids fell to shut out his gaze wellafter your visit i couldnt find courage to fulfill my promiseand so i asked him to release meand he didhe was very kind  he couldnt do anything else  go on with your story she said hurriedly  as they sat thus in the corner of the little sitting room the pupils and guests of the institution came and went from the cloak rooms eyeing the intent couple with smiling and curious glances who could that dark handsome young man be who held miss yardwell with his glittering eyes the girls found something very interesting in his bronzed skin and in the big black hat which he held in his hands  on his part harold did not carehe scarcely noticed these figures their whispers were as unimportant as the sound of aspen leaves their footfalls as little to be heeded as those of rabbits on the pine needles of his camp before him sat the one human being in the world who could command him and she was absorbed in interest of his story he grew to a tense swift eager narration as he went on it pleased him to see her glow with interest and enthusiasm over the sights and sounds of the wild country at last he ended  and soi feel as though i could settle downif i only had you the trail got lonesome that last yeari didnt suppose it wouldbut it did after three years of it i was glad to get back to my old friends the reynolds i thought of you every daybut i didnt listen to hear you sing because i thought you were kings wifei didnt want to hear about you everbut thats all past nowi am here and you are here will you go back to the mountains with me this time  she looked away come and see me tomorrow i must think of this it is so hard to decideour lives are so different she arose abruptly i must go now come into the concert im going to sing she glanced at him in a sad halfsmiling way i cant sing if i were a voice for you but perhaps youll like my aria better  as they walked along the corridor together they formed a singularly handsome couple he was clad in a wellworn but neat black suit which he wore with grace his bigrimmed black hat was crushed in his left hand mary was in pale blue which became her well and on her softly rounded face a thoughtful smile rested she always walked with uncommon dignity and the eyes of many young men followed her there was something about her companion not quite analyzable to her city friendssomething alien and savage and admirable  entering the hall they found it well filled but mary secured a seat near the side door for harold and with a smile said i may not see you till tomorrow here is my address come up early at three i want a long talk with you  left to himself the plainsman looked around the hall which seemed a splendid and spacious one to him it was filled with ladies in beautiful costumes and with men in clawhammer coats he had seen pictures of evening suits in the newspapers but never before had he been privileged to behold live men in them the men seemed pale and puny for the most part he had never before seen ladies in lownecked dresses and one just before him seemed shamelessly naked and he gazed at her in astonishment he was glad mary had more modesty  the concert interested him but did not move him the songs were brilliant but without meaning he waited with fierce impatience for mary to come on and during this wait he did an inordinate amount of thinking a hundred new conceptions came into his besieged brainengaging but by no means confusing him he perceived that mary was already as much a part of this highcolored life as she had been of the life of marmion quite at ease certain of herself and the cañon between them widened swiftly she was infinitely further away from him than before his cause now entirely hopeless he had no right to ask any such sacrifice of hereven if she were ready to make it  as she stepped out upon the stage in the glare of the light she seemed as far from him as the roseate crown of snow on sierra blanca and he shivered with a sort of awe her singing moved him less than her delicate beautybut her voice and the pretty way she had of lifting her chin thrilled him just as when he sat in the little church at marmion the flowerlike texture of her skin and the exquisite grace of her hands plunged him into gloom  he did not join in the generous applause which followedhe wondered if she would sing if i were a voice for him he felt a numbness creeping over his limbs and he drew his breath like one in pain mary looked pale as a lily as she returned and stood waiting for the applause to die away then out over the tense audience straight toward him soared her voice quivering with emotionshe dared to sing the old song for him  suddenly all sense of material things passed from the wild heart of the plainsman he saw only the singer who stood in the center of a white flame a soft humming roar was in his ears like the falling of rain drops on the leaves of maple trees he remembered the pale little girl in the prisonthis was not marybut she had the voice and the spirit of mary  then the song stopped the singer went awaythe white light went with her and the yellow glare of lamps came back he heard the passionate applausehe saw mary reappear and bow a sad smile on her facea smile which he alone could understandher heart was full of pity for him then once more she withdrew and staggering like one suffering from vertigothe eaglehearted youth went out of the hall and down the polished stairway like an outcast soul descending from paradise into hell  that radiant singer was not for such as black mose     chapter xx  a dark day with a glowing sunset   the clerk at the station window was not the kindly young man who had received harolds ticket for safe keeping he knew nothing of it and poked around for several minutes before finding it after glancing keenly at its date he threw it down and brusquely said  times out on this my friend  harold looked at him sharply oh no that cant be its a thirtyday trip  the agent grew irritable i know it is it was good to the fifteenth this is the seventeenth the ticket is worthless  harold took up the slip of paper and stared at it in bewilderment the agent was right he had overstayed the limit and was without five dollars in his pocket he turned weak with a sudden sense of his helplessness and the desolation of his surroundings he was like a man whose horse fails him on a desert taking a seat on a bench in a dark corner of the waiting room he gave himself up to a study of the situation to be alone in the needle range was nothing to worry about but to be alone and without money in a city scared him  for two hours he sat there his thoughts milling like a herd of restless cattle turning aimlessly around and around in their tracks he had foolishly neglected his opportunity to escape and the mountains became each moment more beautiful as they swiftly receded into unattainable distance he had expected to be riding back into the safe and splendid plains country back to friends and familiar things and had trusted to the joy of his return to soften the despair of his second failure to take mary back with him  it was a sorrowful thing to see the young eagle in somber dream the man of unhesitating action becoming introspective floods of intent business men gay young girls and grizzled old farmers in groups of twos and threes streamed by dimly shadowed in his reflective eyes all these people had purpose and reward in their lives he alone was a stray a tramp with no one but old kintuck to draw him to any particular spot or keep him there  i am outside of everything he bitterly thought there is nothing for me  yes there was cora and there was little pinkand then he thought of mrs raimon whose wealth and serenity of temper had a greater appeal than ever before he knew perfectly well that a single word from him would bring her and her money to his rescue at once but something arose in him which made the utterance of such a word impossible as for cora and the little one they brought up a different emotion and the thought of them at last aroused him to action  ill get something to do and earn money enough to go back on he finally said to himself thats all im fit for just to work by the day for some other man thats my size ive failed in everything else ive ever undertaken ive no business to interfere with a girl like mary shes too high class for a hobo like me even if i had a ranch it would be playing it low down on a singer like her to ask her to go out there its no use im worse than a failureim in a hole and the first thing ive got to do is to earn money enough to get out of it  he was ashamed to go back to the little hotel to which he had said goodby with so much relief it was too expensive for him anyhow and so he set to work to find one near by which came within his changed condition he secured lodging at last in an old wooden shack on a side street not far from the station where rooms could be had for twenty cents a nightin advance it was a wretched place filled with cockroaches and other insects but it was at least a hole in which he could den up for a few nights when sleep overcame him thus fortified he wandered forth into the city which was becoming each moment more remorseless and more menacing in his eyes  almost without knowing it he found himself walking the broad pavement before the musical college wherein he found mary he had no definite hope of seeing her again but that doorway was the one spot of light in all the weltering black chaos of the city which now threatened him with hunger and cold the awe and terror he felt were such as a city dweller would feel if left alone in a wild swamp filled with strange beasts and reptiles  after an hours aimless walking to and fro he returned to his bed each night still revolving every conceivable plan for earning money his thought turned naturally to the handling of cattle at the stockyards and one morning he set forth on his quest only to meet with a great surprise he found all the world changed to him when it became known that he was looking for a job when he said to the office boys i want to see the man who has charge of hiring the hands they told him to wait a while in a tone of voice which he had never before encountered his blood flamed hot in an instant over their calm insolence eventually he found his way into a room where a surly fat man sat writing he looked up over his shoulder and snarled out  well what is it what do you want  harold controlled himself and replied i want to get a job im a cattleman from colorado and id like  i dont care where youre from weve got all the men we want see mr white dont come bothering me  harold put his hand on the mans shoulder with the gesture of an angry leopard and a yellow glare filled his eyes from which the brutal boss shrank as if from a flame  with a powerful effort he pulled himself up short and said treat the next cattleman that comes your way a little more decent or youll get a part of your lung carried away good day  he walked out with the old familiar numbness in his body and the red flashes wavering before his eyes his brain was in tumult the free man of the mountain had come in contact with the tyrant of labor and it was well for the big beast that harold was for the moment without his gun  going back to his room he took out his revolver and loaded every chamber in the set of his lips was menace to the next employer who dared to insult and degrade him  in the days that followed he wandered over the city with eyes that took note of every group of workmen he could not bring himself to go back to the stockyards there was danger of his becoming a murderer if he did and as he approached the various bosses of the gangs of men in the street he found himself again and again without the resolution to touch his hat and ask for a job once or twice he saw others quite as brutally rebuffed as he had been and it was only by turning away that he kept himself from taking a hand in an encounter once or twice when the overseer happened to be a decent and sociable fellow harold edging near caught his eye and was able to address him on terms of equality but in each case the talk which followed brought out the fact that men were swarming for every place indeed harold could see this for himself ultimately he fell into the ranks of poor shivering hollowcheeked fellows who stood around wistfully watching the excavation of cellars or hanging with pathetic intentness above the handling of great iron beams or pile drivers  work came to be a wonderful thing to possess to put hand to a beam or a shovel seemed now a most desirable favor for it meant not only warm food and security and shelter but in his case it promised a return to the mountains which came each hour to seem the one desirable and splendid country in the worldso secure so joyous so shining his heart ached with wistful love of it  each night he walked over to the lake shore past the college and up the viaduct till he could look out over the mysterious dim expanse of water it reminded him of the plains and helped him with its lonely sweep and its serene majesty of reflected stars at night he dreamed of the cattle and of his old companions on the trail once he was riding with talfeather and his band in the west elk mountains once he was riding up the looping splendid incline of the trout lake trail seeing the clouds gather around old lizard head at other times he was back at the reynolds ranch taking supper while the cattle bawled and through the open door the light of the setting sun fell  he had written to reynolds asking him to buy his saddle and bridle he couldnt bring himself to sell kintuck and each day he hoped for a reply he had not stated his urgent need of money but reynolds would know one by one every little trinket which he possessed went to pay his landlord for his room he had a small nugget which he had carried as a goodluck pocketpiece for many months this he sold and at last his revolvers went and then he seemed helpless  no word from reynolds came and the worst of it was if the money did come it would not now be enough to carry him back if he had been able to put it with the money from his nugget and revolvers it would at least have taken him to denver but now it was too late  at last there came a day when he was at his last resource he could find no work to do in the streets and so setting his teeth on his pride he once more sought the stockyards and mr white it was a cold rainy day and he walked the entire distance weak as he was from insufficient food bad air and his depression he could not afford to spend one cent for car fare  white turned out to be a very decent fellow who knew nothing whatever of harolds encounter with the other man he had no work for him however he seemed genuinely regretful and said  as a matter of fact im laying off men just now you see the rush is pretty well over with  harold went over to the great western hotel and hung about the barroom hoping to meet some one he knew even though there was a certain risk of being recognized as black mose swarms of cattlemen filled the hotel but they were mainly from texas and oklahoma and no familiar face met his searching eyes he was now so desperately homesick that he meditated striking one of these prosperouslooking fellows for a pass back to the cattle country but each time his pride stood in the way it would be necessary to tell his story and yet conceal his namewhich was a very difficult thing to do even if he had had nothing to cover up  late in the evening faint with hunger he started for his wretched bunk as a starving wolf returns after an unsuccessful hunt to his cold and cheerless den his money was again reduced to a few coppers and for a week he had allowed himself only a small roll three times a day my god if i was only among the injins he said savagely they wouldnt see a man starve not while they had a sliver of meat to share with him but these easterners dont care im no more to them than a snake or a horned toad  the knowledge that marys heart would bleed with sorrow if she knew of his condition nerved him to make another desperate trial ill try again tomorrow he said through his set teeth  on the way home his curious fatalism took a sudden turn and a feeling that reynolds letter surely awaited him made his heart glow it was impossible that he should actually be without a cent of money and the thought filled his brain with an irrational exaltation which made him forget the slime in which his feet slipped he planned to start on the limited train ill go as far from this cursed hole of a city as i can he said ill get out where men dont eat each other to keep alive hell certainly send me twenty dollars the silver on the bridle is worth that alone mebbe hell understand im broke and send me fifty  he became so sure of this at last that he stepped into a saloon and bought a big glass of brandy to ward off a chill which he felt coming upon him and helped himself to a lunch at the counter when he arose his limbs felt weak and a singular numbness had spread over his whole body he had never been drunk in his lifebut he knew the brandy had produced this effect  i shouldnt have taken it on an empty stomach he muttered to himself as he dragged his heavy limbs out of the door  when he came fairly to his senses again he was lying in his little room and the slatternly chambermaid was looking in at him  you aind seek alretty she asked  go away he said with a scowl youve bothered me too much  you peen trinkenaind it chim help you up de stairs last nide  what time is it he asked with an effort to recall where he had been  tweluf oclock she replied still looking at him keenly genuinely concerned about him  go away i must get up as she went toward the door he sat up for a moment but a terrible throbbing pain just back of his eyes threw him back upon his pillow as if he had met the blow of a fist oh im used upi cant do it he groaned pressing his palms to his temples im burning up with fever  the girl came back dats vat i tought you dond look ride your mudder vouldnt known you since you gome here pedder you send for your folks alretty  oh go outlet me alone yes ill do it ill get up soon  when the girl returned with the proprietor of the hotel harold was far past rational speech he was pounding furiously on the door shouting let me out when they tried to open the door they found it locked the proprietor a burly german set his weight against it and tore the lock off  harold was dangerously quiet as he said youd better let me out o here them greasers are stampeding the cattle its a little trick of theirs  dots all right you go back to bed ill look out for dot greaser pisness said the landlord who thought him drunk  you let me out or ill break you in two the determined man replied and a tremendous struggle took place  ultimately harold was vanquished and schmidt piling his huge bulk on the wornout body of the young man held him until his notion changed  did you ever have a tree burn up in your head he asked  pring a policeman whispered schmidt to the girl and a doctor de man is grazy mit fevers he aindt trunk  when the officer came in harold looked at him with sternly steady eyes see here cap dont you try any funny business with me i wont stand it ill shoot with you for dollars or doughnuts  whats the matterjimjams asked the officer indifferently  no replied schmidt i tondt pelief ithes got some fever onto him  the policeman felt his pulse hes certainly hot enough who is he  hank jones  thats a lieim black mose said harold  the policeman smiled black mose was killed in san juan last summer  harold received this news gravely sorry for him but im the man youll find my name on my revolver the big onenot the little one im all the black mose there is if youll give me a chance ill rope a steer with you for blood or whisky im thirsty  well now said the policeman you be quiet till the doctor comes and ill go through your valise after a hasty examination he said damned little here and no revolvers of any kind does he eat here  no he only hires this room  mebbe he dont eat anywhere he looks to me like a hungry man  dots what i think said the maid ill go pring him some soup  the prisoner calmly said too late now my stomach is all dried up  havent you any folks the policeman asked  harold seemed to pause for thought i believe i have but i cant think mary could tell you  whos mary  whats that to you bring me some waterim burning dry  now keep quiet said the policeman youre sick as a horse  when the doctor came the policeman turned harold over to him this is a case for st lukes hospital i guess he said as he went out  the doctor briskly administered a narcotic as being the easiest and simplest way to handle a patient who seemed friendless and penniless the man is simply delirious with fever he looks like a man emaciated from lack of food what do you know about him  the landlord confessed he knew but little  the doctor resumed of course you cant attend to him here ill inform the hospital authorities at once meanwhile communicate with his friends if you can hell be all right for the present  this valuable man was hardly gone before a lively young fellow with a smoothly shaven smiling face slipped in he went through every pocket of harolds clothing and found a torn envelope with the name excell written on it and a small photo of a little girl with the words to mose from cora the young mans smile became a chuckle as he saw these things and he said to himself nothing here to identify him eh then to the landlord he said im from the star office if anything new turns up i wish youd call up harriman thats me and let me in on it  the hospital authorities were not informed or paid no attention to the summons and harold was left to the care of the chambermaid who did her poor best to serve him  the star next morning contained two columns of closely printed matter under the caption black mose the famous dead shot dying in a west side hotel after years of adventure on the trail the famous desperado succumbs to old john barley corn the article recounted all the deeds which had been ascribed to harold and added a few entirely new ones his marvelous skill with the revolver was referred to and his defense of the red men and others in distress was touched upon so eloquently that the dying man was lifted to a romantic height of hardihood and gallantry a fancy picture of him took nearly a quarter of a page and was surrounded by a corona of revolvers each spouting flame  mrs raimon seated at breakfast in the lofty dining room of her hotel languidly unfolded the star gave one glance and opened the paper so quickly and nervously her cup and saucer fell to the floor  my god can that be true i must see him as she read the article she carried on a rapid thinking how can i find him i must see that reporter he will know she was a woman of decision she arose quickly and returned to her room call a carriage for me quick she said to the bell boy who answered to her call no name is given to the hotel but the star will know good heavens if he should die her florid face was set and white as she took her seat in the cab to the star officequick she said to the driver and there was command in the slam of the door  to the city editor she abruptly said i want to find the man who wrote this article on black mose i want to find the hotel where he is  the editor was enormously interested at once harriman is on the night force and at home how but ill see what i can do by punching various bells and speaking into mysteriously ramifying tubes he was finally able to say the man is at a little hotel just across the river i think it is called the st nicholas it isnt a nice place youd better take some one with you mind you i dont vouch for the truth of that article the boy may be mistaken about it  mrs raimon turned on her heel and vanished she had her information and acted upon it she was never finer than when she knelt at harolds bedside and laid her hand gently on his forehead she could not speak for a moment and when her eyes cleared of their tears and she felt the wide dry eyes of the man searching her a spasm of pain contracted her heart  he dont know me she cried to the slatternly maid who stood watching the scene with deep sympathy  harold spoke petulantly go away and tell mary i want her it costs too much for her to sing or else shed come these people wont let me get up but reynolds will be here soon and then something will rip wide open they took my guns and my saddle if i had old kintuck here i could ride to mary she said shed sing for me every sunday look here i want ice on my head this pillow has been heated i dont want a hot pillowand i dont want my arms covered say i wish youd send word to old jack i dont know where he is but hed comeso will reynolds these policemen will have a hot time keeping me here after they come its too low here i must take mary awayits healthier in the mountains it aint so hot  out of this stream of loosely uttered words the princess caught and held little more than the names jack and mary  who is jack she softly asked  harold laughed dont you know old frecklefaced jack why id know jack in the dark of a cave hes my friendmy old chum he didnt forget me when they sent me to jail neither did mary she sung for me  cant you tell me marys name  why its just mary mary yardwell  where does she live  oh dont bother me he replied irritably what do you want to know for  the princess softly persisted and he said she lives in the east in chicago its too far off to find her it takes five days to get down there on a cattle train and then you have to look her up in a directory and then trail her down i couldnt find her  the princess took down marys name and sent a messenger to try to find the address of this woman who was more to the delirious man than all the rest of the world  as he tossed and muttered she took possession of the house is this the worst room you have get the best bed in the house ready i want this man to have the cleanest room you have hurry telephone to the western palace and ask doctor sanborn to come at oncetell him mrs raimon wants him  under her vigorous action one of the larger rooms was cleared out and made ready and when the doctor came harold was moved under his personal supervision i shall stay here till he is out of danger she said to the doctor as he was leaving and please ask my maid to go out and get some clean bed linen and bring it down here at onceand tell her to send mr doris here wont you  the doctor promised to attend to these matters at once  she sat by the bedside of the sufferer bathing his hands and face as if he were a child talking to him gently with a mothers grave cadences he was now too weak to resist any command and took his medicine at a gulp like a young robin                                       late in the afternoon as mrs raimon returned from an errand to the street she was amazed to find a tall and handsome girl sitting beside the sick mans bed holding his two cold white hands in both of hers there was a singular and thrilling serenity in the strangers facea composure that was exaltation while harold with halfclosed eyelids lay as if in awe gazing up into the womans face  mrs raimon waited until harolds eyes closed like a sleepy childs and the watcher arosethen she drew near and timidly asked  are you mary  yes was the simple reply  the elder womans voice trembled i am glad youve come he has called for you incessantly you must let me help youi am mrs raimon of wagon wheeli knew him there  mary understood the womans humble attitude but she did not encourage a caress she coldly replied i shall be very grateful he is very ill and i shall not leave him till his friends come  she thought immediately of jack and sent a telegram saying harold is here illcome at once she did not know where to reach mr excell so could only wait to consult jack  mrs raimon remained with her and was so unobtrusively ready to do good that marys heart softened toward herthough she did not like her florid beauty and her display of jewels  a telegram from jack came during the evening do all you can for harold will reach him tonight  he came in at eleven oclock his face knotted into anxious lines they smoothed out as his eyes fell upon mary who met him in the hall  oh im glad to see you here he said brokenly how is heis there any hope  in his presence marys composure gave way o jack if he should die now she laid her head against his sturdy shoulder and for a moment shook with nervous weakness almost before he could speak she recovered herself he only knew me for a few moments hes delirious again the doctor is with himoh i cant bear to hear him rave it is awful he calls for me and yet does not know me o jack it makes my heart ache so he is so weak he came to see meand then went awayi didnt know where he had gone and all the time he was starving here o god it would be too dreadfulif he should die  we wont let him die he stoutly replied im going in to see him  together they went in the doctor intently studying his patient sat motionless and silent he was a young man with a serious face but his movements were quick silent and full of decision he looked up and made a motion stopping them where they were  out of a low mutter at last harolds words grew distinct i dont carebut the water is cold as icei wouldnt put a cayuse into itlet alone kintuck should be a bridge here somewhere  oh hes on the trail again said mary harold dont you know me she bent over to him again and put forth the utmost intensity of her will to recall him i am here harold dont you see me  his head ceased to roll and he looked at her with eyes that made her heart grow sickthen a slow faint smile came to his lips yesi know you marybut the river is between us and its swift and cold and kintuck is thin and hungryi cant cross now  doctor said jack as the physician was leaving what are the chances  the doctors voice carried conviction oh hell pull throughhe has one of the finest bodies i ever saw he smiled hell cross the river all rightand land on our side  two days later mr excell big and brown his brow also knotted with anxiety entered the room and fell on his knees and threw his long arm over the helpless figure beneath the coverlet harry my boy do you know me  harold looked up at him with big staring eyes and slowly put out his hand sure thing and im not dead yet father ill soon be all right ive got mary with me she can cure meif the doctor cant  he spoke slowly but there was will behind the voice his wasted face had a gentleness that was most moving to the father he could not look at the pitiful wreck of his once proud and fearless boy without weeping and being mindful of harolds prejudice against sentiment he left the room to regain his composure to mary mr excell said i dont know youbut you are a noble woman i give you a fathers gratitude wont you tell me who you are  i am mary yardwell she replied in her peculiarly succinct speech my home was in marmion but i attended school in your village i sang in your church for a little while  his face lighted up i remember youa pale serious little girl did you know my son there  she looked away for a moment i sang for himwhen he was in jail she replied i belonged to the rescue band  a shadow fell again upon the fathers face  i did not know it he said feeling something mysterious heresomething which lay outside his grasp have you seen him meanwhile i suppose you must have done so  once in marmion some four years ago  ah now i understand his visit to marmion said mr excell with a sudden smile i thought he came to see jack and me he really came to see you am i right  yes she replied he wanted me to go back with him but iicouldnt do so  i knowi know he replied hastily he had no right to ask it of youpoor boy  it seems now as though i had no right to refuse i might have helped him if he should die now there would be an incurable ache hereshe lifted her hand to her throat so long as i lived i should not forgive myself     chapter xxi  conclusion   as he crawled slowly back to life and clear thinking harolds wild heart was filled with a peace and serenity of emotion such as it had not known since childhood he was like a boy in a careless dream forecasting nothing remembering nothing content to see mary come and go about the room glad of the sound of her skirts thrilling under the gentle pressure of her hand  she on her part could not realize any part of his dark fame as she smiled down into his big yellowbrown eyes which were as pathetic and wistful as those of a gentle animal  mrs raimon spoke of this i saw black mose as he stood in the streets of wagon wheel the most famous deadshot in the state i cant realize that this is the same man hes gentle as a babe now he was as terrible and as beautiful as a tiger then  reynolds sent fifty dollars with an apology for the delay and mr excell offered his slender purse but mrs raimon said ill attend to this matter of expense let me do that little for himplease and he gave way knowing her great wealth  but all these things began at last to trouble the proud heart of the sick man and as he grew stronger his hours of quiet joy began to be broken by disquieting calculations of his indebtedness to mrs raimon as well as to mary and jack he wished to be free of all obligations even gratitude he insisted on his fathers return to his pastoratewhich he did at the end of the week  meanwhile mary and jack conspired for the eagles good together they planned to remove him to some fairer quarter of the city together they read and discussed the letters which poured in upon them from theatrical managers wild west shows music halls and other similar enterprises and from romantic girls and shrewd photographers and every other conceivable kind of crank the offers of the music halls jack was inclined to consider worth while hed be a great success there or as a deadshot in a wild west show they pay pretty well too  i dont believe hed care to do anything like that mary quietly replied  they both found that he cared to do nothing which involved his remaining in the east as his eyes grew brighter his longing for the west came back he lifted his arms above his quilts with the action of the eaglet who meditates leaping from the home ledge it was a sorrowful thing to see this powerful young animal made thin and white and weak by fever but his spirit was indomitable  he must be moved to the west before he will fully recover said the doctor and to this mrs raimon replied  very well doctor you name the day when it is safe and well go ill have a special car if necessary but first of all he must go to a good hotel cant he be moved now  outwardly mary acknowledged all the kindness of this rich and powerful woman but inwardly she resented her intimacy drawing all her little store of ready money she quietly began paying off the bills when all was settled she took a seat beside harold one day when they were alone and laying one strong warm hand on his thin white arm she said  harold the doctor says you can be moved from here and soyou must give me the right to take you home with me  there was a piercing pathos in his wan smile as he replied all right youre the boss its a pretty hard come down though i thought once id come back after you in a private car if you stand by me i may be a cattle king yet theres a whole lot of fight in me stillyou watch me and see  the next day he was moved to a private hotel on the north side and mary breathed a sigh of deep relief as she saw him sink back into his soft bed in a clean and sunny room he with a touch of his old fire said this sure beats a holler log but all the same ill be glad to see the time when i can camp on my saddle again  mary only smiled and patted him like a mother caressing a babe ill hate to have you go and leave menow  no danger of that mary we camp down on the same blanket from this on  mr excell came on to marry them but jack sent his best wishes by mail he could not quite bring himself to see mary give herself awayeven to his hero  mrs raimon took her defeat with most touching grace youre right she said hes yoursi know that perfectly well but you must let me help him to make a start it wont hurt him and itll please me i have a ranch i have mines i could give him something to do till he got on his feet again if youd let me and i hope you wont deny me a pleasure that will carry no obligation with it  she was powerfully moved as she went in to say goodby to him he was sitting in a chair but looked very pale and weak she said mose youre in luck youve got a woman wholl do you good shes loyal and shes strong and theres nothing further for me to dounless you let me help you see here why not let me help you get a start what do you say  harold felt the deep sincerity of the womans regard and he said simply  all right let me know what you find and ill talk it over with mary  she seized his thin hand in both hers and pressed it hard the tears creeping down her cheeks youre a good boy mose youre the kind that are good to women in ways they dont like sometimes i hope youll forget the worst of me and remember only the best i dont think she knows anything about me if she hears anything tell her the truth but say i was better than women think  one day about ten days later a bulky letter came addressed to mose excell it was from mrs raimon but contained a letter from reynolds who wrote      yesterday a young cheyenne came ridin in here inquirin for     you  i told him you was in chicago sick he brought a     message from old talfeather who is gettin scared about the     cattlemen he says theyre crowdin onto his reservation and     he wants you to come and help him he wants you to talk with     them and to go to washington and see the great father he     sent this medicine and said it was to draw you to him he     said he was blind and his heart was heavy because he feared     trouble i went up to wagon wheel and saw the princess who     has a big pull she said shed write you kintuck is well but     getting lazy  mrs raimon wrote excitedly      dear friend here is work for you to do the agent at sand     lake has asked to be relieved and i have written senator     miller to have you appointed he thought the idea     excellent we both believe your presence will quiet the     cattlemen as well as talfeather and his band will you     accept  as harold read his body uplifted and his eyes grew stern see here mary what do you think of this and he read the letter and explained the situation she too became tense with interest but being a woman who thought before she spoke she remained silent  harold after a moment arose from his chair gaunt and unsteady as he was thats what im fitted for mary that solves my problem i know these cattlemen they know me i am the white chief of talfeathers people if you can stand it to live there with me mary i will go we can do good the women need some one like you to teach em to do things  marys altruistic nature began to glow do you think so harold could i be of use  of use why mary those poor squaws and their children need you worse than they need a god i know for ive lived among em  then i will go she said and out of the gray cloud the sun broke and shone from the west across the great lonely plains  again black mose rode up the almost invisible ascent toward the rocky mountains again he saw the mighty snow peaks loom over the faintly green swells of the plain but this time he left nothing behind the aching hunger was gone out of his heart for beside him mary sat eager as he to see the wondrous mountain land whose trails to her were script of epic tales and whose peaks were monuments to great dead beasts and mysterious peoples long since swept away by the ruthless march of the white men  if she had doubts or hesitations she concealed them for hers was a nature fitted for such sacrifice as thisand besides each day increased her love for the singular and daring soul of harold excell
