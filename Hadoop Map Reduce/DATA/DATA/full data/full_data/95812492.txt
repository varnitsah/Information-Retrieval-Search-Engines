characters are clearly defined and act consistently  nature always inartistic takes pleasure in creating the impossible  reginald blake was as typical a specimen of the wellbred cad as one could hope to find between piccadilly circus and hyde park corner  vicious without passion and possessing brain without mind existence presented to him no difficulties while his pleasures brought him no pains  his morality was bounded by the doctor on the one side and the magistrate on the other  careful never to outrage the decrees of either he was at fortyfive still healthy though stout and had achieved the not too easy task of amassing a fortune while avoiding all risk of holloway  he and his wife edith nee eppington were as illmatched a couple as could be conceived by any dramatist seeking material for a problem play  as they stood before the altar on their wedding morn they might have been taken as symbolising satyr and saint more than twenty years his junior beautiful with the beauty of a raphaels madonna his every touch of her seemed a sacrilege  yet once in his life mr blake played the part of a great gentleman mrs blake on the same occasion contenting herself with a singularly mean rolemean even for a woman in love  the affair of course had been a marriage of convenience  blake to do him justice had made no pretence to anything beyond admiration and regard  few things grow monotonous sooner than irregularity  he would tickle his jaded palate with respectability and try for a change the companionship of a good woman  the girls face drew him as the moonlight holds a man who bored by the noise turns from a heated room to press his forehead to the windowpane  accustomed to bid for what he wanted he offered his price  the eppington family was poor and numerous  the girl bred up to the false notions of duty inculcated by a narrow conventionality and feminine like half in love with martyrdom for its own sake let her father bargain for a higher price and then sold herself  to a drama of this description a lover is necessary if the complications are to be of interest to the outside world  harry sennett a pleasantlooking enough young fellow in spite of his receding chin was possessed perhaps of more good intention than sense  under the influence of ediths stronger character he was soon persuaded to acquiesce meekly in the proposed arrangement  both succeeded in convincing themselves that they were acting nobly  the tone of the farewell interview arranged for the eve of the wedding would have been fit and proper to the occasion had edith been a modern joan of arc about to sacrifice her own happiness on the altar of a great cause as the girl was merely selling herself into ease and luxury for no higher motive than the desire to enable a certain number of more or less worthy relatives to continue living beyond their legitimate means the sentiment was perhaps exaggerated  many tears were shed and many everlasting good byes spoken though seeing that ediths new home would be only a few streets off and that of necessity their social set would continue to be the same more experienced persons might have counselled hope  three months after the marriage they found themselves side by side at the same dinnertable and after a little melodramatic fencing with what they were pleased to regard as fate they accommodated themselves to the customary positions  blake was quite aware that sennett had been ediths lover  so had half a dozen other men some younger some older than himself  he felt no more embarrassment at meeting them than standing on the pavement outside the stock exchange he would have experienced greeting his brother jobbers after a settling day that had transferred a fortune from their hands into his  sennett in particular he liked and encouraged  our whole social system always a mystery to the philosopher owes its existence to the fact that few men and women possess sufficient intelligence to be interesting to themselves  blake liked company but not much company liked blake  young sennett however could always be relied upon to break the tediousness of the domestic dialogue  a common love of sport drew the two men together  most of us improve upon closer knowledge and so they came to find good in one another  that is the man you ought to have married said blake one night to his wife half laughingly half seriously as they sat alone listening to sennetts departing footsteps echoing upon the deserted pavement  hes a good fellownot a mere moneygrubbing machine like me  and a week later sennett sitting alone with edith suddenly broke out with  hes a better man than i am with all my highfalutin talk and upon my soul he loves you  shall i go abroad  if you like was the answer  what would you do  kill myself replied the other with a laugh or run away with the first man that asked me  so sennett stayed on  blake himself had made the path easy to them  there was little need for either fear or caution  indeed their safest course lay in recklessness and they took it  to sennett the house was always open  it was blake himself who when unable to accompany his wife would suggest sennett as a substitute  club friends shrugged their shoulders  was the man completely under his wifes thumb or tired of her was he playing some devils game of his own  to most of his acquaintances the latter explanation seemed the more plausible  the gossip in due course reached the parental home  mrs eppington shook the vials of her wrath over the head of her soninlaw  the father always a cautious man felt inclined to blame his child for her want of prudence  shell ruin everything he said  why the devil cant she be careful  i believe the man is deliberately plotting to get rid of her said mrs eppington  i shall tell him plainly what i think  youre a fool hannah replied her husband allowing himself the licence of the domestic hearth  if you are right you will only precipitate matters if you are wrong you will tell him what there is no need for him to know  leave the matter to me  i can sound him without giving anything away and meanwhile you talk to edith  so matters were arranged but the interview between mother and daughter hardly improved the position  mrs eppington was conventionally moral edith had been thinking for herself and thinking in a bad atmosphere mrs eppington grew angry at the girls callousness  have you no sense of shame she cried  i had once was ediths reply before i came to live here  do you know what this house is for me with its gilded mirrors its couches its soft carpets  do you know what i am and have been for two years  the elder woman rose with a frightened pleading look upon her face and the other stopped and turned away towards the window  we all thought it for the best continued mrs eppington meekly  the girl spoke wearily without looking round  oh every silly thing that was ever done was done for the best  i thought it would be for the best myself  everything would be so simple if only we were not alive  dont lets talk any more  all you can say is quite right  the silence continued for a while the dresdenchina clock on the mantelpiece ticking louder and louder as if to say i time am here  do not make your plans forgetting me little mortals i change your thoughts and wills  you are but my puppets  then what do you intend to do demanded mrs eppington at length  intend  oh the right thing of course  we all intend that  i shall send harry away with a few wellchosen words of farewell learn to love my husband and settle down to a life of quiet domestic bliss  oh its easy enough to intend  the girls face wrinkled with a laugh that aged her  in that moment it was a hard evil face and with a pang the elder woman thought of that other face so like yet so unlikethe sweet pure face of a girl that had given to a sordid home its one touch of nobility  as under the lightnings flash we see the whole arc of the horizon so mrs eppington looked and saw her childs life  the gilded overfurnished room vanished  she and a bigeyed fairhaired child the only one of her children she had ever understood were playing wonderful games in the twilight among the shadows of a tiny attic  now she was the wolf devouring edith who was red riding hood with kisses  now cinderellas prince now both her wicked sisters  but in the favourite game of all mrs eppington was a beautiful princess bewitched by a wicked dragon so that she seemed to be an old worn woman  but curlyheaded edith fought the dragon represented by the threelegged rockinghorse and slew him with much shouting and the toastingfork  then mrs eppington became again a beautiful princess and went away with edith back to her own people  in this twilight hour the misbehaviour of the general the importunity of the family butcher and the airs assumed by cousin jane who kept two servants were forgotten  the games ended  the little curly head would be laid against her breast for five minutes love while the restless little brain framed the endless question that children are for ever asking in all its thousand forms what is life mother  i am very little and i think and think until i grow frightened  oh mother tell me what is life  had she dealt with these questions wisely  might it not have been better to have treated them more seriously  could life after all be ruled by maxims learned from copybooks  she had answered as she had been answered in her own farback days of questioning  might it not have been better had she thought for herself  suddenly edith was kneeling on the floor beside her  i will try to be good mother  it was the old baby cry the cry of us all children that we are till mother nature kisses us and bids us go to sleep  their arms were round each other now and so they sat mother and child once more  and the twilight of the old attic creeping westward from the east found them again  the masculine duet had more result but was not conducted with the finesse that mr eppington who prided himself on his diplomacy had intended  indeed so evidently ill at ease was that gentleman when the moment came for talk and so palpably were his pointless remarks mere efforts to delay an unpleasant subject that blake always direct bluntly though not illnaturedly asked him how much  mr eppington was disconcerted  its not thatat least thats not what i have come about he answered confusedly  what have you come about  inwardly mr eppington cursed himself for a fool for the which he was perhaps not altogether without excuse  he had meant to act the part of a clever counsel acquiring information while giving none by a blunder he found himself in the witnessbox  oh nothing nothing was the feeble response merely looked in to see how edith was  much the same as at dinner last night when you were here answered blake  come out with it  it seemed the best course now and mr eppington took the plunge  dont you think he said unconsciously glancing round the room to be sure they were alone that young sennett is a little too much about the house  blake stared at him  of course we know it is all rightas nice a young fellow as ever livedand edithand all that  of course its absurd but  but what  well people will talk  what do they say  the other shrugged his shoulders  blake rose  he had an ugly look when angry and his language was apt to be coarse  tell them to mind their own business and leave me and my wife alone that was the sense of what he said he expressed himself at greater length and in stronger language  but my dear blake urged mr eppington for your own sake is it wise  there was a sort of boy and girl attachment between themnothing of any moment but all that gives colour to gossip  forgive me but i am her father i do not like to hear my child talked about  then dont open your ears to the chatter of a pack of fools replied his soninlaw roughly  but the next instant a softer expression passed over his face and he laid his hand on the older mans arm  perhaps there are many more but theres one good woman in the world he said and thats your daughter  come and tell me that the bank of england is getting shaky on its legs and ill listen to you  but the stronger the faith the deeper strike the roots of suspicion blake said no further word on the subject and sennett was as welcome as before  but edith looking up suddenly would sometimes find her husbands eyes fixed on her with a troubled look as of some dumb creature trying to understand and often he would slip out of the house of an evening by himself returning home hours afterwards tired and mudstained  he made attempts to show his affection  this was the most fatal thing he could have done  illtemper illtreatment even she might have borne his clumsy caresses his foolish halting words of tenderness became a horror to her  she wondered whether to laugh or to strike at his upturned face  his tactless devotion filled her life as with some sickly perfume stifling her  if only she could be by herself for a little while to think  but he was with her night and day  there were times when as he would cross the room towards her he grew monstrous until he towered above her a formless thing such as children dream of  and she would sit with her lips tight pressed clutching the chair lest she should start up screaming  her only thought was to escape from him  one day she hastily packed a few necessaries in a small handbag and crept unperceived from the house she drove to charing cross but the continental express did not leave for an hour and she had time to think  of what use was it  her slender stock of money would soon be gone how could she live  he would find her and follow her  it was all so hopeless  suddenly a fierce desire of life seized hold of her the angry answer of her young blood to despair  why should she die never having known what it was to live  why should she prostrate herself before this juggernaut of other peoples respectability  joy called to her only her own cowardice stayed her from stretching forth her hand and gathering it  she returned home a different woman for hope had come to her  a week later the butler entered the dining room and handed blake a letter addressed to him in his wifes handwriting  he took it without a word as though he had been expecting it  it simply told him that she had left him for ever        the world is small and money commands many services  sennett had gone out for a stroll edith was left in the tiny salon of their appartement at fecamp  it was the third day of their arrival in the town  the door was opened and closed and blake stood before her  she rose frightened but by a motion he reassured her  there was a quiet dignity about the man that was strange to her  why have you followed me she asked  i want you to return home  home she cried  you must be mad  do you not know  he interrupted her vehemently  i know nothing  i wish to know nothing go back to london at once  i have made everything right no one suspects  i shall not be there you will never see me again and you will have an opportunity of undoing your mistakeour mistake  she listened  hers was not a great nature and the desire to obtain happiness without paying the price was strong upon her  as for his good name what could that matter he urged  people would only say that he had gone back to the evil from which he had emerged and few would be surprised  his life would go on much as it had done and she would only be pitied  she quite understood his plan it seemed mean of her to accept his proposal and she argued feebly against it  but he overcame all her objections  for his own sake he told her he would prefer the scandal to be connected with his name rather than with that of his wife  as he unfolded his scheme she began to feel that in acquiescing she was conferring a favour  it was not the first deception he had arranged for the public and he appeared to be half in love with his own cleverness she even found herself laughing at his mimicry of what this acquaintance and that would say  her spirits rose the play that might have been a painful drama seemed turning out an amusing farce  the thing settled he rose to go and held out his hand  as she looked up into his face something about the line of his lips smote upon her  you will be well rid of me she said  i have brought you nothing but trouble  oh trouble he answered  if that were all  a man can bear trouble  what else she asked  his eyes travelled aimlessly about the room  they taught me a lot of things when i was a boy he said my mother and othersthey meant wellwhich as i grew older i discovered to be lies and so i came to think that nothing good was true and that everything and everybody was evil  and then  his wandering eyes came round to her and he broke off abruptly  good bye he said and the next moment he was gone  she sat wondering for a while what he had meant  then sennett returned and the words went out of her head        a good deal of sympathy was felt for mrs blake  the man had a charming wife he might have kept straight but as his friends added blake always was a cad     an item of fashionable intelligence   speaking personally i do not like the countess of   she is not the type of woman i could love  i hesitate the less giving expression to this sentiment by reason of the conviction that the countess of  would not be unduly depressed even were the fact to reach her ears  i cannot conceive the countess of s being troubled by the opinion concerning her of any being human or divine other than the countess of   but to be honest i must admit that for the earl of  she makes an ideal wife  she rules him as she rules all others relations and retainers from the curate to the dowager but the rod though firmly held is wielded with justice and kindly intent  nor is it possible to imagine the earl of s living as contentedly as he does with any partner of a less dominating turn of mind  he is one of those weakheaded stronglimbed goodnatured childish men born to be guided in all matters from the tying of a neckcloth to the choice of a political party by their women folk  such men are in clover when their proprietor happens to be a good and sensible woman but are to be pitied when they get into the hands of the selfish or the foolish  as very young men they too often fall victims to badtempered chorus girls or to middleaged matrons of the class from which pope judged all womankind they make capital husbands when well managed treated badly they say little but set to work after the manner of a dissatisfied cat to find a kinder mistress generally succeeding  the earl of  adored his wife deeming himself the most fortunate of husbands and better testimonial than such no wife should hope for  till the day she snatched him away from all other competitors and claimed him for her own he had obeyed his mother with a dutifulness bordering on folly  were the countess to die tomorrow he would be unable to tell you his mind on any single subject until his eldest daughter and his still unmarried sister ladies both of strong character attracted towards one another by a mutual antagonism had settled between themselves which was to be mistress of him and of his house  however there is little fear bar accidents but that my friend the countess will continue to direct the hereditary vote of the earl of  towards the goal of common sense and public good guide his social policy with judgment and kindness and manage his estates with prudence and economy for many years to come  she is a hearty vigorous lady of generous proportions with the blood of sturdy forebears in her veins and one who takes the same excellent good care of herself that she bestows on all others dependent upon her guidance  i remember said the doctorwe were dining with the doctor in homely fashion and our wives had adjourned to the drawingroom to discuss servants and husbands and other domestic matters with greater freedom leaving us to the claret and the twilighti remember when we had the cholera in the villageit must be twenty years ago nowthat woman gave up the london season to stay down here and take the whole burden of the trouble upon her own shoulders  i do not feel any call to praise her she liked the work and she was in her element but it was good work for all that  she had no fear  she would carry the children in her arms if time pressed and the little ambulance was not at hand  i have known her sit all night in a room not twelve feet square between a dying man and his dying wife  but the thing never touched her  six years ago we had the smallpox and she went all through that in just the same way  i dont believe she has ever had a days illness in her life  she will be physicking this parish when my bones are rattling in my coffin and she will be laying down the laws of literature long after your statue has become a familiar ornament of westminster abbey  shes a wonderful woman but a trifle masterful  he laughed but i detected a touch of irritation in his voice  my host looked a man wishful to be masterful himself  i do not think he quite relished the calm way in which this grand dame took possession of all things around her himself and his work included  did you ever hear the story of the marriage he asked  no i replied whose marriage  the earls  i should call it the countesss he answered  it was the gossip of the county when i first came here but other curious things have happened among us to push it gradually out of memory  most people i really believe have quite forgotten that the countess of  once served behind a bakers counter  you dont say so i exclaimed  the remark i admit sounds weak when written down the most natural remarks always do  its a fact said the doctor though she does not suggest the shop girl does she  but then i have known countesses descended in a direct line from william the conqueror who did so things balance one another mary countess of  was thirty years ago mary sewell daughter of a taunton linendraper  the business profitable enough as country businesses go was inadequate for the needs of the sewell family consisting as i believe it did of seven boys and eight girls  mary the youngest as soon as her brief schooling was over had to shift for herself  she seems to have tried her hand at one or two things finally taking service with a cousin a baker and confectioner who was doing well in oxford street  she must have been a remarkably attractive girl shes a handsome woman now  i can picture that soft creamy skin when it was fresh and smooth and the west of england girls run naturally to dimples and eyes that glisten as though they had been just washed in morning dew  the shop did a good trade in ladies lunchesit was the glass of sherry and sweet biscuit period  i expect they dressed her in some neatfitting grey or black dress with short sleeves showing her plump arms and that she flitted around the marbletopped tables smiling and looking cool and sweet  there the present earl of  then young lord c fresh from oxford and new to the dangers of london bachelordom first saw her  he had accompanied some female relatives to the photographers and hotels and restaurants being deemed impossible in those days for ladies had taken them to sewells to lunch  mary sewell waited upon the party and now as many of that party as are above ground wait upon mary sewell  he showed good sense in marrying her i said i admire him for it the doctors sixtyfour lafitte was excellent  i felt charitably inclined towards all men and women even towards earls and countesses  i dont think he had much to do with it laughed the doctor beyond being like barkis willing  its a queer story some people profess not to believe it but those who know her ladyship best think it is just the story that must be true because it is so characteristic of her  and besides i happen to know that it is true  i should like to hear it i said  i am going to tell it you said the doctor lighting a fresh cigar and pushing the box towards me        i will leave you to imagine the lads suddenly developed appetite for decantered sherry at sixpence a glass and the familiar currant bun of our youth  he lunched at sewells shop he tead at sewells occasionally he dined at sewells off cutlets followed by assorted pastry  possibly merely from fear lest the affair should reach his mothers ears for he was neither worldlywise nor vicious he made love to mary under an assumed name and to do the girl justice it must be remembered that she fell in love with and agreed to marry plain mr john robinson son of a colonial merchant a gentleman as she must have seen and a young man of easy means but of a position not so very much superior to her own  the first intimation she received that her lover was none other than lord c the future earl of  was vouchsafed her during a painful interview with his lordships mother  i never knew it madam asserted mary standing by the window of the drawingroom above the shop upon my word of honour i never knew it  perhaps not answered her ladyship coldly  would you have refused him if you had  i cannot tell was the girls answer it would have been different from the beginning  he courted me and asked me to be his wife  we wont go into all that interrupted the other i am not here to defend him  i do not say he acted well  the question is how much will compensate you for your natural disappointment  her ladyship prided herself upon her bluntness and practicability  as she spoke she took her chequebook out of her reticule and opening it dipped her pen into the ink  i am inclined to think that the flutter of that chequebook was her ladyships mistake  the girl had common sense and must have seen the difficulties in the way of a marriage between the heir to an earldom and a linendrapers daughter and had the old lady been a person of discernment the interview might have ended more to her satisfaction  she made the error of judging the world by one standard forgetting there are individualities  mary sewell came from a west of england stock that in the days of drake and frobisher had given more than one ablebodied pirate to the service of the country and that insult of the chequebook put the fight into her  her lips closed with a little snap and the fear fell from her  i am sorry i dont see my way to obliging your ladyship she said  what do you mean girl asked the elder woman  i dont mean to be disappointed answered the girl but she spoke quietly and respectfully  we have pledged our word to one another  if he is a gentleman as i know he is he will keep his and i shall keep mine  then her ladyship began to talk reason as people do when it is too late she pointed out to the girl the difference of social position and explained to her the miseries that come from marrying out of ones station  but the girl by this time had got over her surprise and perhaps had begun to reflect that in any case a countessship was worth fighting for  the best of women are influenced by such considerations        i am not a lady i know she replied quietly but my people have always been honest folk well known and i shall try to learn  i am not wishing to speak disrespectfully of my betters but i was in service before i came here maam as ladys maid in a place where i saw much of what is called society  i think i can be as good a lady as some i know if not better  the countess began to grow angry again  and who do you think will receive you she cried a girl who has served in a pastrycooks shop  lady l came from behind the bar mary answered and thats not much better  and the duchess of c i have heard was a ballet girl but nobody seems to remember it  i dont think the people whose opinion is worth having will object to me for very long  the girl was beginning rather to enjoy the contest  you profess to love my son cried the countess fiercely and you are going to ruin his life  you will drag him down to your own level  the girl must have looked rather fine at that moment i should dearly love to have been present  there will be no dragging down my lady she replied on either side i do love your son very dearly  he is one of the kindest and best of gentlemen  but i am not blind and whatever amount of cleverness there may be between us belongs chiefly to me  i shall make it my duty to fit myself for the position of his wife and to help him in his work  you need not fear my lady i shall be a good wife to him and he shall never regret it  you might find him a richer wife a better educated wife but you will never find him a wife who will be more devoted to him and to his interests  that practically brought the scene to a close  the countess had sense enough to see that she was only losing ground by argument  she rose and replaced her chequebook in her bag  i think my good girl you must be mad she said if you will not allow me to do anything for you theres an end to the matter  i did not come here to quarrel with you  my son knows his duty to me and to his family  you must take your own course and i must take mine  very well my lady said mary sewell holding the door open for her ladyship to pass out we shall see who wins  but however brave a front mary sewell may have maintained before the enemy i expect she felt pretty limp when thinking matters calmly over after her ladyships departure  she knew her lover well enough to guess that he would be as wax in the firm hands of his mother while she herself would not have a chance of opposing her influence against those seeking to draw him away from her  once again she read through the few schoolboy letters he had written her and then looked up at the framed photograph that hung above the mantelpiece of her little bedroom  the face was that of a frank pleasantlooking young fellow lightened by eyes somewhat large for a man but spoiled by a painfully weak mouth  the more mary sewell thought the more sure she felt in her own mind that he loved her and had meant honestly by her  did the matter rest with him she might reckon on being the future countess of  but unfortunately for her the person to be considered was not lord c but the present countess of   from childhood through boyhood into manhood it had never once occurred to lord c to dispute a single command of his mothers and his was not the type of brain to readily receive new ideas if she was to win in the unequal contest it would have to be by art not by strength  she sat down and wrote a letter which under all the circumstances was a model of diplomacy  she knew that it would be read by the countess and writing it she kept both mother and son in mind she made no reproaches and indulged in but little sentiment  it was the letter of a woman who could claim rights but who asked only for courtesy  it stated her wish to see him alone and obtain from his own lips the assurance that he wished their engagement to cease  do not fear mary sewell wrote that i shall be any annoyance to you  my own pride would not let me urge you to marry me against your desire and i care for you too much to cause you any pain  assure me with your own lips that you wish our engagement to be at an end and i shall release you without another word  the family were in town and mary sent her letter by a trusty hand  the countess read it with huge satisfaction and resealing it gave it herself into her sons hands  it promised a happy solution of the problem  in imagination she had all the night been listening to a vulgar breach of promise case  she herself had been submitted to a most annoying crossexamination by a pert barrister  her sons assumption of the name of robinson had been misunderstood and severely commented upon by the judge  a sympathetic jury had awarded thumping damages and for the next six months the family title would be a peg on which musichall singers and comic journalists would hang their ribald jokes  lord c read the letter flushed and dutifully handed it back to his mother  she made pretence to read it as for the first time and counselled him to accord the interview  i am so glad she said that the girl is taking the matter sensibly we must really do something for her in the future when everything is settled  let her ask for me and then the servants will fancy shes a ladys maid or something of that sort come after a place and wont talk  so that evening mary sewell addressed by the butler as young woman was ushered into the small drawingroom that connects the library of no  grosvenor square with the other reception rooms  the countess now all amiability rose to meet her  my son will be here in a moment she explained he has informed me of the purport of your letter  believe me my dear miss sewell no one can regret his thoughtless conduct more than i do  but young men will be young men and they do not stop to reflect that what may be a joke to them may be taken quite seriously by others  i dont regard the matter as a joke my lady replied mary somewhat curtly  of course not my dear added the countess thats what im saying  it was very wrong of him altogether  but with your pretty face you will not i am sure have long to wait for a husband we must see what we can do for you  the countess certainly lacked tact it must have handicapped her exceedingly  thank you answered the girl but i prefer to choose my own  fortunatelyor the interview might have ended in another quarrelthe cause of all the trouble at this moment entered the room and the countess whispering a few final words of instruction to him as she passed out left them together  mary took a chair in the centre of the room at equal distance from both doors  lord c finding any sort of a seat uncomfortable under the circumstances preferred to stand with his back to the mantelpiece  dead silence was maintained for a few seconds and then mary drawing the daintiest of handkerchiefs from her pocket began to cry  the countess must have been a poor diplomatist or she might have thought of this or she may have remembered her own appearance on the rare occasions when she herself a big rawboned girl had attempted the softening influence of tears and have attached little importance to the possibility  but when these soft dimpled women cry and cry quietly it is another matter their eyes grow brighter and the tears few and far between lie like dewdrops on a rose leaf  lord c was as tenderhearted a lout as ever lived  in a moment he was on his knees with his arm round the girls waist pouring out such halting words of love and devotion as came to his unready brain cursing his fate his earldom and his mother and assuring mary that his only chance of happiness lay in his making her his countess  had mary liked to say the word at that moment he would have caught her to his arms and defied the whole worldfor the time being  but mary was a very practical young woman and there are difficulties in the way of handling a lover who however ready he may be to do your bidding so long as your eyes are upon him is liable to be turned from his purpose so soon as another influence is substituted for your own  his lordship suggested an immediate secret marriage  but you cannot run out into the street knock up a clergyman and get married on the spot and mary knew that the moment she was gone his lordships will would revert to his mothers keeping  then his lordship suggested flight but flight requires money and the countess knew enough to keep his lordships purse in her own hands  despair seized upon his lordship  its no use he cried it will end in my marrying her  whos she exclaimed mary somewhat quickly  his lordship explained the position  the family estates were heavily encumbered  it was deemed advisable that his lordship should marry money and money in the person of the only daughter of rich and ambitious parvenus had offered itselfor to speak more correctly had been offered  whats she like asked mary  oh shes nice enough was the reply only i dont care for her and she doesnt care for me  it wont be much fun for either of us and his lordship laughed dismally  how do you know she doesnt care for you asked mary  a woman may be critical of her lovers shortcomings but at the very least he is good enough for every other woman  well she happens to care for somebody else answered his lordship she told me so herself  that would account for it  and is she willing to marry you inquired mary  his lordship shrugged his shoulders  oh well you know her people want it he replied  in spite of her trouble the girl could not help a laugh  these young swells seemed to have but small wills of their own  her ladyship on the other side of the door grew nervous  it was the only sound she had been able to hear  its deuced awkward explained his lordship when yourewell when you are anybody you know  you cant do as you like  things are expected of you and theres such a lot to be considered  mary rose and clasped her pretty dimpled hands from which she had drawn her gloves behind his neck  you do love me jack she said looking up into his face  for answer the lad hugged her to him very tightly and there were tears in his eyes  look here mary he cried if i could only get rid of my position and settle down with you as a country gentleman id do it tomorrow  damn the title its going to be the curse of my life  perhaps in that moment mary also wished that the title were at the bottom of the sea and that her lover were only the plain mr john robinson she had thought him  these big stupid men are often very loveable in spite of or because of their weakness  they appeal to the mother side of a womans heart and that is the biggest side in all good women  suddenly however the door opened  the countess appeared and sentiment flew out  lord c releasing mary sprang back looking like a guilty schoolboy  i thought i heard miss sewell go out said her ladyship in the icy tones that had never lost their power of making her sons heart freeze within him  i want to see you when you are free  i shant be long stammered his lordship  marymiss sewell is just going  mary waited without moving until the countess had left and closed the door behind her  then she turned to her lover and spoke in quick low tones  give me her addressthe girl they want you to marry  what are you going to do asked his lordship  i dont know answered the girl but im going to see her  she scribbled the name down and then said looking the boy squarely in the face  tell me frankly jack do you want to marry me or do you not  you know i do mary he answered and his eyes spoke stronger than his words  if i werent a silly ass there would be none of this trouble but i dont know how it is i say to myself ill do a thing but the mater talks and talks and  i know interrupted mary with a smile  dont argue with her fall in with all her views and pretend to agree with her  if you could only think of some plan said his lordship catching at the hope of her words you are so clever  i am going to try answered mary and if i fail you must run off with me even if you have to do it right before your mothers eyes  what she meant was i shall have to run off with you but she thought it better to put it the other way about  mary found her involuntary rival a meek gentle little lady as much under the influence of her blustering father as was lord c under that of his mother  what took place at the interview one can only surmise but certain it is that the two girls each for her own ends undertook to aid and abet one another  much to the surprised delight of their respective parents there came about a change in the attitude hitherto assumed towards one another by miss clementina hodskiss and lord c  all objections to his lordships unwilling attentions were suddenly withdrawn by the lady  indeed so swift to come and go are the whims of women his calls were actually encouraged especially when as generally happened they coincided with the absence from home of mr and mrs hodskiss  quite as remarkable was the newborn desire of lord c towards miss clementina hodskiss  marys name was never mentioned and the suggestion of immediate marriage was listened to without remonstrance  wiser folk would have puzzled their brains but both her ladyship and excontractor hodskiss were accustomed to find all things yield to their wishes  the countess saw visions of a rehabilitated estate and clementinas father dreamed of a peerage secured by the influence of aristocratic connections  all that the young folks stipulated for and on that point their firmness was supernatural was that the marriage should be quiet almost to the verge of secrecy  no beastly fuss his lordship demanded  let it be somewhere in the country and no mob and his mother thinking she understood his reason patted his cheek affectionately  i should like to go down to aunt janes and be married quietly from there explained miss hodskiss to her father  aunt jane resided on the outskirts of a small hampshire village and sat under a clergyman famous throughout the neighbourhood for having lost the roof to his mouth  you cant be married by that old fool thundered her fathermr hodskiss always thundered he thundered even his prayers  he christened me urged miss clementina  and lord knows what he called you  nobody can understand a word he says  id like him to marry me reiterated miss clementina  neither her ladyship nor the contractor liked the idea  the latter in particular had looked forward to a big function chronicled at length in all the newspapers  but after all the marriage was the essential thing and perhaps having regard to some foolish love passages that had happened between clementina and a certain penniless naval lieutenant ostentation might be out of place  so in due course clementina departed for aunt janes accompanied only by her maid  quite a treasure was miss hodskisss new maid  a clean wholesome girl said of her contractor hodskiss who cultivated affability towards the lower orders knows her place and talks sense  you keep that girl clemmy  do you think she knows enough hazarded the maternal hodskiss  quite sufficient for any decent woman retorted the contractor  when clemmy wants painting and stuffing it will be time enough for her to think about getting one of your ach himmels or mon dieus  i like the girl myself immensely agreed clementinas mother  you can trust her and she doesnt give herself airs  her praises reached even the countess suffering severely at the moment from the tyranny of an elderly fraulein  i must see this treasure thought the countess to herself  i am tired of these foreign minxes  but no matter at what cunning hour her ladyship might call the treasure always happened for some reason or other to be abroad  your girl is always out when i come laughed the countess  one would fancy there was some reason for it  it does seem odd agreed clementina with a slight flush  miss hodskiss herself showed rather than spoke her appreciation of the girl  she seemed unable to move or think without her  not even from the interviews with lord c was the maid always absent  the marriage it was settled should be by licence  mrs hodskiss made up her mind at first to run down and see to the preliminaries but really when the time arrived it hardly seemed necessary to take that trouble the ordering of the whole affair was so very simple and the treasure appeared to understand the business most thoroughly and to be willing to take the whole burden upon her own shoulders  it was not therefore until the evening before the wedding that the hodskiss family arrived in force filling aunt janes small dwelling to its utmost capacity  the swelling figure of the contractor standing beside the tiny porch compelled the passerby to think of the dolls house in which the dwarf resides during fairtime ringing his own bell out of his own firstfloor window  the countess and lord c were staying with her ladyships sister the hon mrs j at g hall some ten miles distant and were to drive over in the morning  the then earl of  was in norway salmon fishing  domestic events did not interest him  clementina complained of a headache after dinner and went to bed early the treasure also was indisposed  she seemed worried and excited  that girl is as eager about the thing remarked mrs hodskiss as though it was her own marriage  in the morning clementina was still suffering from her headache but asserted her ability to go through the ceremony provided everybody would keep away and not worry her  the treasure was the only person she felt she could bear to have about her  half an hour before it was time to start for church her mother looked her up again  she had grown still paler if possible during the interval and also more nervous and irritable  she threatened to go to bed and stop there if she was not left quite alone  she almost turned her mother out of the room locking the door behind her  mrs hodskiss had never known her daughter to be like this before  the others went on leaving her to follow in the last carriage with her father  the contractor forewarned spoke little to her  only once he had occasion to ask her a question and then she answered in a strained unnatural voice  she appeared so far as could be seen under her heavy veil to be crying  well this is going to be a damned cheerful wedding said mr hodskiss and lapsed into sulkiness  the wedding was not so quiet as had been anticipated  the village had got scent of it and had spread itself upon the event while half the house party from g hall had insisted on driving over to take part in the proceedings  the little church was better filled than it had been for many a long year past  the presence of the stylish crowd unnerved the ancient clergyman long unaccustomed to the sight of a strange face and the first sound of the ancient clergymans voice unnerved the stylish crowd  what little articulation he possessed entirely disappeared no one could understand a word he said  he appeared to be uttering sounds of distress  the ancient gentlemans infliction had to be explained in low asides and it also had to be explained why such an one had been chosen to perform the ceremony  it was a whim of clementinas whispered her mother  her father and myself were married from here and he christened her  the dear childs full of sentiment  i think it so nice of her  everybody agreed it was charming but wished it were over  the general effect was weird in the extreme  lord c spoke up fairly well but the brides responses were singularly indistinct the usual order of things being thus reversed  the story of the naval lieutenant was remembered and added to and some of the more sentimental of the women began to cry in sympathy  in the vestry things assumed a brighter tone  there was no lack of witnesses to sign the register  the verger pointed out to them the place and they wrote their names as people in such cases do without stopping to read  then it occurred to some one that the bride had not yet signed  she stood apart with her veil still down and appeared to have been forgotten  encouraged she came forward meekly and took the pen from the hand of the verger  the countess came and stood behind her  mary wrote the bride in a hand that looked as though it ought to have been firm but which was not  dear me said the countess i never knew there was a mary in your name  how differently you write when you write slowly  the bride did not answer but followed with susannah  why what a lot of names you must have my dear exclaimed the countess  when are you going to get to the ones we all know  ruth continued the bride without answering  breeding is not always proof against strong emotion  the countess snatched the brides veil from her face and mary susannah ruth sewell stood before her flushed and trembling but looking none the less pretty because of that  at this point the crowd came in useful  i am sure your ladyship does not wish a scene said mary speaking low the thing is done  the thing can be undone and will be retorted the countess in the same tone  you you  my wife dont forget that mother said lord c coming between them and slipping marys hand on to his arm  we are both sorry to have had to go about the thing in this roundabout way but we wanted to avoid a fuss  i think we had better be getting away  im afraid mr hodskiss is going to be noisy        the doctor poured himself out a glass of claret and drank it off  his throat must have been dry  and what became of clementina i asked  did the naval lieutenant while the others were at church dash up in a postchaise and carry her off  thats what ought to have happened for the whole thing to be in keeping agreed the doctor  i believe as a matter of fact she did marry him eventually but not till some years later after the contractor had died  and did mr hodskiss make a noise in the vestry i persisted  the doctor never will finish a story  i cant say for certain answered my host i only saw the gentleman once  that was at a shareholders meeting  i should incline to the opinion that he did  i suppose the bride and bridegroom slipped out as quietly as possible and drove straight off i suggested  that would have been the sensible thing for them to do agreed the doctor  but how did she manage about her travelling frock i continued  she could hardly have gone back to her aunt janes and changed her things the doctor has no mind for minutiae  i cannot tell you about all that he replied  i think i mentioned that mary was a practical girl  possibly she had thought of these details  and did the countess take the matter quietly i asked  i like a tidy story where everybody is put into his or her proper place at the end  your modern romance leaves half his characters lying about just anyhow  that also i cannot tell you for certain answered the doctor but i give her credit for so much sense  lord c was of age and with mary at his elbow quite knew his own mind  i believe they travelled for two or three years  the first time i myself set eyes on the countess nee mary sewell was just after the late earls death  i thought she looked a countess every inch of her but then i had not heard the story  i mistook the dowager for the housekeeper     blase billy   it was towards the end of august  he and i appeared to be the only two men left to the club  he was sitting by an open window the times lying on the floor beside him  i drew my chair a little closer and remarkedgood morning  he suppressed a yawn and replied mornindropping the g  the custom was just coming into fashion he was always correct  going to be a very hot day i am afraid i continued  fraid so was the response after which he turned his head away and gently closed his eyes  i opined that conversation was not to his wish but this only made me more determined to talk and to talk to him above all others in london the desire took hold of me to irritate himto break down the imperturbable calm within which he moved and had his being and i gathered myself together and settled down to the task  interesting paper the times i observed  very he replied taking it from the floor and handing it to me  wont you read it  i had been careful to throw into my voice an aggressive cheeriness which i had calculated would vex him but his manner remained that of a man who is simply bored  i argued with him politely concerning the paper but he insisted still with the same weary air that he had done with it  i thanked him effusively  i judged that he hated effusiveness  they say that to read a times leader i persisted is a lesson in english composition  so ive been told he answered tranquilly  personally i dont take them  the times i could see was not going to be of much assistance to me  i lit a cigarette and remarked that he was not shooting  he admitted the fact  under the circumstances it would have taxed him to deny it but the necessity for confession aroused him  to myself he said a tramp through miles of mud in company with four gloomy men in black velveteen a couple of depressedlooking dogs and a heavy gun the entire cavalcade being organised for the purpose of killing some twelveandsixpence worth of poultry suggests the disproportionate  i laughed boisterously and cried good goodvery good  he was the type of man that shudders inwardly at the sound of laughter  i had the will to slap him on the back but i thought maybe that would send him away altogether  i asked him if he hunted  he replied that fourteen hours talk a day about horses and only about horses tired him and that in consequence he had abandoned hunting  you fish i said  i was never sufficiently imaginative he answered  you travel a good deal i suggested  he had apparently made up his mind to abandon himself to his fate for he turned towards me with a resigned air  an ancient nurse of mine had always described me as the most wearing child she had ever come across i prefer to speak of myself as persevering  i should go about more he said were i able to see any difference between one place and another  tried central africa i inquired  once or twice he answered  it always reminds me of kew gardens  china i hazarded  cross between a willowpattern plate and a new york slum was his comment  the north pole i tried thinking the third time might be lucky  never got quite up to it he returned  reached cape hakluyt once  how did that impress you i asked  it didnt impress me he replied  the talk drifted to women and bogus companies dogs literature and such like matters  i found him well informed upon and bored by all  they used to be amusing he said speaking of the first named until they began to take themselves seriously  now they are merely silly  i was forced into closer companionship with blase billy that autumn for by chance a month later he and i found ourselves the guests of the same delightful hostess and i came to liking him better  he was a useful man to have about one  in matters of fashion one could always feel safe following his lead  one knew that his necktie his collar his socks if not the very newest departure were always correct and upon social paths as guide philosopher and friend he was invaluable  he knew every one together with his or her previous convictions  he was acquainted with every womans past and shrewdly surmised every mans future  he could point you out the coalshed where the countess of glenleman had gambolled in her days of innocence and would take you to breakfast at the coffeeshop off the mile end road where sam smith estd 1820 own brother to the worldfamed society novelist smithstratford lived an uncriticised unparagraphed unphotographed existence upon the profits of rashers at threehapence and doorsteps at two a penny  he knew at what houses it was inadvisable to introduce soap and at what tables it would be bad form to denounce political jobbery  he could tell you offhand what trademark went with what crest and remembered the price paid for every baronetcy created during the last twentyfive years  regarding himself he might have made claim with king charles never to have said a foolish thing and never to have done a wise one  he despised or affected to despise most of his fellowmen and those of his fellowmen whose opinion was most worth having unaffectedly despised him  shortly described one might have likened him to a gaiety johnny with brains  he was capital company after dinner but in the early morning one avoided him  so i thought of him until one day he fell in love or to put it in the words of teddy tidmarsh who brought the news to us got mashed on gerty lovell  the redhaired one teddy explained to distinguish her from her sister who had lately adopted the newer golden shade  gerty lovell exclaimed the captain why ive always been told the lovell girls hadnt a penny among them  the old mans stone broke i know for a certainty volunteered teddy who picked up a mysterious but in other respects satisfactory income in an office near hatton garden and who was candour itself concerning the private affairs of everybody but himself  oh some rich porkpacking or diamondsweating uncle has cropped up in australia or america or one of those places suggested the captain and billys got wind of it in good time  billy knows his way about  we agreed that some such explanation was needed though in all other respects gerty lovell was just the girl that reason not always consulted on these occasions might herself have chosen for blase billys mate  the sunlight was not too kind to her but at evening parties where the lighting has been well considered i have seen her look quite girlish  at her best she was not beautiful but at her worst there was about her an air of breeding and distinction that always saved her from being passed over and she dressed to perfection  in character she was the typical society woman always charming generally insincere  she went to kensington for her religion and to mayfair for her morals accepted her literature from mudies and her art from the grosvenor gallery and could and would gabble philanthropy philosophy and politics with equal fluency at every fiveoclock teatable she visited  her ideas could always be guaranteed as the very latest and her opinion as that of the person to whom she was talking  asked by a famous novelist one afternoon at the pioneer club to give him some idea of her little mrs bund the painters wife had remained for a few moments with her pretty lips pursed and had then said  she is a woman to whom life could bring nothing more fully satisfying than a dinner invitation from a duchess and whose nature would be incapable of sustaining deeper suffering than that caused by an illfitting costume  at the time i should have said the epigram was as true as it was cruel but i suppose we none of us quite know each other  i congratulated blase billy or to drop his club nickname and give him the full benefit of his social label the hon william cecil wychwood stanley drayton on the occasion of our next meeting which happened upon the steps of the savoy restaurant and i thoughtunless a quiver of the electric light deceived methat he blushed  charming girl i said  youre a lucky dog billy  it was the phrase that custom demands upon such occasions and it came of its own accord to my tongue without costing me the trouble of composition but he seized upon it as though it had been a gem of friendly sincerity  you will like her even more when you know her better he said  she is so different from the usual woman that one meets  come and see her to morrow afternoon she will be so pleased  go about four i will tell her to expect you  i rang the bell at ten minutes past five  billy was there  she greeted me with a little tremor of embarrassment which sat oddly upon her but which was not altogether unpleasing  she said it was kind of me to come so early  i stayed for about half an hour but conversation flagged and some of my cleverest remarks attracted no attention whatever  when i rose to take my leave billy said that he must be off too and that he would accompany me  had they been ordinary lovers i should have been careful to give them an opportunity of making their adieus in secret but in the case of the honourable william drayton and the eldest miss lovell i concluded that such tactics were needless so i waited till he had shaken hands and went downstairs with him  but in the hall billy suddenly ejaculated by jove  half a minute and ran back up the stairs three at a time  apparently he found what he had gone for on the landing for i did not hear the opening of the drawing room door  then the honourable billy redescended with a sober nonchalent air  left my gloves behind me he explained as he took my arm  i am always leaving my gloves about  i did not mention that i had seen him take them from his hat and slip them into his coattail pocket  we at the club did not see very much of billy during the next three months but the captain who prided himself upon his playing of the role of smokingroom cynicthough he would have been better in the part had he occasionally displayed a little originalitywas of opinion that our loss would be more than made up to us after the marriage  once in the twilight i caught sight of a figure that reminded me of billys accompanied by a figure that might have been that of the eldest miss lovell but as the spot was battersea park which is not a fashionable evening promenade and the two figures were holding each others hands the whole picture being suggestive of the closing chapter of a london journal romance i concluded i had made an error  but i did see them in the adelphi stalls one evening rapt in a sentimental melodrama  i joined them between the acts and poked fun at the play as one does at the adelphi but miss lovell begged me quite earnestly not to spoil her interest and billy wanted to enter upon a serious argument as to whether a man was justified in behaving as will terriss had just behaved towards the woman he loved  i left them and returned to my own party to the satisfaction i am inclined to think of all concerned  they married in due course  we were mistaken on one point  she brought billy nothing  but they both seemed quite content on his not too extravagant fortune  they took a tiny house not far from victoria station and hired a brougham for the season  they did not entertain very much but they contrived to be seen everywhere it was right and fashionable they should be seen  the honourable mrs drayton was a much younger and brighter person than had been the eldest miss lovell and as she continued to dress charmingly her social position rose rapidly billy went everywhere with her and evidently took a keen pride in her success  it was even said that he designed her dresses for her and i have myself seen him earnestly studying the costumes in russell and allens windows  the captains prophecy remained unfulfilled  blase billyif the name could still be applied to himhardly ever visited the club after his marriage  but i had grown to like him and as he had foretold to like his wife  i found their calm indifference to the burning questions of the day a positive relief from the strenuous atmosphere of literary and artistic circles  in the drawingroom of their little house in eaton row the comparative merits of george meredith and george r sims were not considered worth discussion  both were regarded as persons who afforded a certain amount of amusement in return for a certain amount of cash  and on any wednesday afternoon henrick ibsen and arthur roberts would have been equally welcome as adding piquancy to the small gathering  had i been compelled to pass my life in such a house this philistine attitude might have palled upon me but under the circumstances it refreshed me and i made use of my welcome which i believe was genuine to its full extent  as months went by they seemed to me to draw closer to one another though i am given to understand that such is not the rule in fashionable circles  one evening i arrived a little before my time and was shown up into the drawingroom by the softfooted butler  they were sitting in the dusk with their arms round one another  it was impossible to withdraw so i faced the situation and coughed  a pair of middleclass lovers could not have appeared more awkward or surprised  but the incident established an understanding between us and i came to be regarded as a friend before whom there was less necessity to act  studying them i came to the conclusion that the ways and manners of love are very samelike throughout the world as though the foolish boy unheedful of human advance kept but one school for minor poet and east end shopboy for girton girl and little milliner taught but the one lesson to the endofthenineteenthcentury johnny that he taught to bearded pict and hun four thousand years ago  thus the summer and the winter passed pleasantly for the honourable billy and then as luck would have it he fell ill just in the very middle of the london season when invitations to balls and dinner parties luncheons and at homes were pouring in from every quarter when the lawns at hurlingham were at their smoothest and the paddocks at their smartest  it was unfortunate too that the fashions that season suited the honourable mrs billy as they had not suited her for years  in the early spring she and billy had been hard at work planning costumes calculated to cause a flutter through mayfair and the dresses and the bonnetseach one a work of artwere waiting on their stands to do their killing work but the honourable mrs billy for the first time in her life had lost interest in such things  their friends were genuinely sorry for society was billys element and in it he was interesting and amusing  but as lady gower said there was no earthly need for his wife to constitute herself a prisoner  her shutting herself off from the world could do him no good and it would look odd  accordingly the honourable mrs drayton to whom oddness was a crime and the voice of lady gower as the voice of duty sacrificed her inclinations on the social shrine laced the new costumes tight across her aching heart and went down into society  but the honourable mrs drayton achieved not the success of former seasons  her small talk grew so very small that even park lane found it unsatisfying  her famous laugh rang mechanically  she smiled at the wisdom of dukes and became sad at the funny stories of millionaires society voted her a good wife but bad company and confined its attentions to cards of inquiry  and for this relief the honourable mrs drayton was grateful for billy waned weaker and weaker  in the world of shadows in which she moved he was the one real thing  she was of very little practical use but it comforted her to think that she was helping to nurse him  but billy himself it troubled  i do wish you would go out more he would say  it makes me feel that im such a selfish brute keeping you tied up here in this dismal little house  besides he would add people miss you they will hate me for keeping you away  for where his wife was concerned billys knowledge of the world availed him little  he really thought society craved for the honourable mrs drayton and would not be comforted where she was not  i would rather stop with you dear would be the answer i dont care to go about by myself  you must get well quickly and take me  and so the argument continued until one evening as she sat by herself the nurse entered softly closed the door behind her and came over to her  i wish you would go out tonight maam said the nurse just for an hour or two  i think it would please the master he is worrying himself because he thinks it is his fault that you do not and just nowthe woman hesitated for a momentjust now i want to keep him very quiet  is he weaker nurse  well he is not stronger maam and i thinki think we must humour him  the honourable mrs drayton rose and crossing to the window stood for a while looking out  but where am i to go nurse she said at length turning with a smile ive no invitations anywhere  cant you make believe to have one said the nurse  it is only seven oclock  say you are going to a dinnerparty you can come home early then  go and dress yourself and come down and say goodbye to him and then come in again about eleven as though you had just returned  you think i must nurse  i think it would be better maam  i wish you would try it  the honourable mrs drayton went to the door then paused  he has such sharp ears nurse he will listen for the opening of the door and the sound of the carriage  i will see to that said the nurse  i will tell them to have the carriage here at ten minutes to eight  then you can drive to the end of the street slip out and walk back  i will let you in myself  and about coming home asked the other woman  you must slip out for a few minutes before eleven and the carriage must be waiting for you at the corner again  leave all that to me  in half an hour the honourable mrs drayton entered the sickroom radiant in evening dress and jewels  fortunately the lights were low or blasebilly might have been doubtful as to the effect his wife was likely to produce  for her face was not the face that one takes to dinnerparties  nurse tells me you are going to the grevilles this evening  i am so glad  ive been worrying myself about you moped up here right through the season  he took her hands in his and held her out at arms length from him  how handsome you look dear he said  how they must have all been cursing me for keeping you shut up here like a princess in an ogres castle  i shall never dare to face them again  she laughed well pleased at his words  i shall not be late she said  i shall be so anxious to get back and see how my boy has behaved  if you have not been good i shant go again  they kissed and parted and at eleven she returned to the room  she told him what a delightful evening it had been and bragged a little of her own success  the nurse told her that he had been more cheerful that evening than for many nights  so every day the farce was played for him  one day it was to a luncheon that she went in a costume by redfern the next night to a ball in a frock direct from paris again to an at home or concert or dinner party  loafers and passersby would stop to stare at a haggard redeyed woman dressed as for a drawingroom slipping thieflike in and out of her own door  i heard them talking of her one afternoon at a house where i called and i joined the group to listen  i always thought her heartless but i gave her credit for sense a woman was saying  one doesnt expect a woman to be fond of her husband but she neednt make a parade of ignoring him when he is dying  i pleaded absence from town to inquire what was meant and from all lips i heard the same account  one had noticed her carriage at the door two or three evenings in succession  another had seen her returning home  a third had seen her coming out and so on  i could not fit the fact in with my knowledge of her so the next evening i called  the door was opened instantly by herself  i saw you from the window she said  come in here dont speak  i followed her and she closed the door behind her  she was dressed in a magnificent costume her hair sparkling with diamonds and i looked my questions  she laughed bitterly  i am supposed to be at the opera tonight she explained  sit down if you have a few minutes to spare  i said it was for a talk that i had come and there in the dark room lighted only by the street lamp without she told me all  and at the end she dropped her head on her bare arms and i turned away and looked out of the window for a while  i feel so ridiculous she said rising and coming towards me  i sit here all the evening dressed like this  im afraid i dont act my part very well but fortunately dear billy never was much of a judge of art and it is good enough for him  i tell him the most awful lies about what everybody has said to me and what ive said to everybody and how my gowns were admired  what do you think of this one  for answer i took the privilege of a friend  im glad you think well of me she said  billy has such a high opinion of you  you will hear some funny tales  im glad you know  i had to leave london again and billy died before i returned  i heard that she had to be fetched from a ball and was only just in time to touch his lips before they were cold  but her friends excused her by saying that the end had come very suddenly  i called on her a little later and before i left i hinted to her what people were saying and asked her if i had not better tell them the truth  i would rather you didnt she answered  it seems like making public the secret side of ones life  but i urged they will think  she interrupted me  does it matter very much what they think  which struck me as a very remarkable sentiment coming from the hon mrs drayton nee the elder miss lovell     the choice of cyril harjohn   between a junior resident master of twentyone and a backward lad of fifteen there yawns an impassable gulf  between a struggling journalist of oneandthirty and an md of twentyfive with a brilliant record behind him and a career of exceptional promise before him a close friendship is however permissible  my introduction to cyril harjohn was through the rev charles fauerberg  our young friend said the rev mr fauerberg standing in the most approved tutorial attitude with his hand upon his pupils shoulder our young friend has been somewhat neglected but i see in him possibilities warranting hopewarranting i may say very great hope  for the present he will be under my especial care and you will not therefore concern yourself with his studies  he will sleep with milling and the others in dormitory number two  the lad formed a liking for me and i think and hope i rendered his sojourn at alpha house less irksome than otherwise it might have been the reverend charles method with the backward was on all fours with that adopted for the bringing on of geese he cooped them up and crammed them the process is profitable to the trainer but painful to the goose  young harjohn and myself left alpha house at the end of the same term he bound for brasenose i for bloomsbury  he made a point of never coming up to london without calling on me when we would dine together in one of sohos many dingy garlicscented restaurants and afterwards over our bottle of cheap beaune discuss the coming of our lives and when he entered guys i left john street and took chambers close to his in staple inn  those were pleasant days  childhood is an overrated period fuller of sorrow than of joy  i would not take my childhood back were it a gift but i would give the rest of my life to live the twenties over again  to cyril i was the man of the world and he looked to me for wisdom not seeing always i fear that he got it while from him i gathered enthusiasm and learnt the profit that comes to a man from the keeping of ideals  often as we have talked i have felt as though a visible light came from him framing his face as with the halo of some pictured saint  nature had wasted him putting him into this nineteenth century of ours  her victories are accomplished  her army of heroes the few sung the many forgotten is disbanded  the long peace won by their blood and pain is settled on the land  she had fashioned cyril harjohn for one of her soldiers  he would have been a martyr in the days when thought led to the stake a fighter for the truth when to speak ones mind meant death to lead some forlorn hope for civilisation would have been his true work fate had condemned him to sentry duty in a wellordered barrack  but there is work to be done in the world though the labour lies now in the vineyard not on the battlefield  a small but sufficient fortune purchased for him freedom  to most men an assured income is the grave of ambition to cyril it was the foundation of desire  relieved from the necessity of working to live he could afford the luxury of living to work  his profession was to him a passion he regarded it not with the cold curiosity of the scholar but with the imaginative devotion of the disciple  to help to push its frontiers forward to carry its flag farther into the untravelled desert that ever lies beyond the moving boundary of human knowledge was his dream  one summer evening i remember we were sitting in his rooms and during a silence there came to us through the open window the moaning of the city as of a tired child  he rose and stretched his arms out towards the darkening streets as if he would gather to him all the toiling men and women and comfort them  oh that i could help you he cried my brothers and my sisters  take my life oh god and spend it for me among your people  the speech sounds theatrical as i read it written down but to the young such words are not ridiculous as to us older men  in the natural order of events he fell in love and with just the woman one would expect him to be attracted by  elspeth grant was of the type from which the world by instinct rather than by convention has drawn its madonnas and its saints  to describe a woman in words is impossible her beauty was not a possession to be catalogued but herself  one felt it as one feels the beauty of a summers dawn breaking the shadows of a sleeping city but one cannot set it down  i often met her and when talking to her i knew myselfi hackjournalist frequenter of fleet street bars retailer of smokeroom storiesa great gentleman incapable of meanness fit for all noble deeds  in her presence life became a thing beautiful and gracious a school for courtesy and tenderness and simplicity  i have wondered since coming to see a little more clearly into the ways of men whether it would not have been better had she been less spiritual had her nature possessed a greater alloy of earth making it more fit for the uses of this workaday world  but at the time these two friends of mine seemed to me to have been created for one another  she appealed to all that was highest in cyrils character and he worshipped her with an unconcealed adoration that from any man less high minded would have appeared affectation and which she accepted with the sweet content that artemis might have accorded to the homage of endymion  there was no formal engagement between them  cyril seemed to shrink from the materialising of his love by any thought of marriage  to him she was an ideal of womanhood rather than a fleshandblood woman  his love for her was a religion it had no taint of earthly passion in its composition  had i known the world better i might have anticipated the result for the red blood ran in my friends veins and alas we dream our poems not live them  but at the time the idea of any other woman coming between them would have appeared to me folly  the suggestion that that other woman might be geraldine fawley i should have resented as an insult to my intelligence that is the point of the story i do not understand to this day  that he should be attracted by her that he should love to linger near her watching the dark flush come and go across her face seeking to call the fire into her dark eyes was another matter and quite comprehensible for the girl was wonderfully handsome with a bold voluptuous beauty which invited while it dared  but considered in any other light than that of an animal she repelled  at times when for her ends it seemed worth the exertion she would assume a certain wayward sweetness but her acting was always clumsy and exaggerated capable of deceiving no one but a fool  cyril at all events was not taken in by it  one evening at a bohemian gathering the entree to which was notoriety rather than character they had been talking together for some considerable time when wishing to speak to cyril i strolled up to join them  as i came towards them she moved away her dislike for me being equal to mine for her a thing which was perhaps well for me  miss fawley prefers two as company to three i observed looking after her retreating figure  i am afraid she finds you what we should call an antisympathetic element he replied laughing  do you like her i asked him somewhat bluntly  his eyes rested upon her as she stood in the doorway talking to a small blackbearded man who had just been introduced to her  after a few moments she went out upon his arm and then cyril turned to me  i think her he replied speaking as was necessary very low the embodiment of all that is evil in womanhood  in old days she would have been a cleopatra a theodora a delilah  today lacking opportunity she is the smart woman grubbing for an opening into societyand old fawleys daughter  im tired let us go home  his allusion to her parentage was significant  few people thought of connecting clever handsome geraldine fawley with rogue fawley jew renegade exgaol bird and outside broker who having expectations from his daughter took care not to hamper her by ever being seen in her company  but no one who had once met the father could ever forget the relationship while talking to the daughter  the older face with its cruelty its cunning and its greed stood reproduced feature for feature line for line  it was as though nature for an artistic freak had set herself the task of fashioning hideousness and beauty from precisely the same materials  between the leer of the man and the smile of the girl where lay the difference  it would have puzzled any student of anatomy to point it out  yet the one sickened while to gain the other most men would have given much  cyrils answer to my question satisfied me for the time  he met the girl often as was natural  she was a singer of some repute and our social circle was what is commonly called literary and artistic  to do her justice however she made no attempt to fascinate him nor even to be particularly agreeable to him  indeed she seemed to be at pains to show him her naturalin other words her most objectionable side  coming out of the theatre one first night we met her in the lobby  i was following cyril at some little distance but as he stopped to speak to her the movement of the crowd placed me just behind them  will you be at leightons tomorrow i heard him ask her in a low tone  yes she answered and i wish you wouldnt come  why not  because youre a fool and you bore me  under ordinary circumstances i should have taken the speech for badinageit was the kind of wit the woman would have indulged in  but cyrils face clouded with anger and vexation  i said nothing  i did not wish him to know that i had overheard  i tried to believe that he was amusing himself but my own explanation did not satisfy me  next evening i went to leightons by myself  the grants were in town and cyril was dining with them  i found i did not know many people and cared little for those i did  i was about to escape when miss fawleys name was announced  i was close to the door and she had to stop and speak to me  we exchanged a few commonplaces  she either made love to a man or was rude to him  she generally talked to me without looking at me nodding and smiling meanwhile to people around  i have met many women equally illmannered and without her excuse  for a moment however she turned her eyes to mine  wheres your friend mr harjohn she asked  i thought you were inseparables  i looked at her in astonishment  he is dining out tonight i replied  i do not think he will come  she laughed  i think it was the worst part about the woman her laugh it suggested so much cruelty  i think he will she said  it angered me into an indiscretion  she was moving away  i stepped in front of her and stopped her  what makes you think so i asked and my voice i know betrayed the anxiety i felt as to her reply  she looked me straight in the face there was one virtue she possessedthe virtue that animals hold above mankindtruthfulness  she knew i disliked herhate would be perhaps a more exact expression did not the word sound out of date and she made no pretence of not knowing it and returning the compliment  because i am here she answered  why dont you save him  have you no influence over him  tell the saint to keep him i dont want him  you heard what i said to him last night  i shall only marry him for the sake of his position and the money he can earn if he likes to work and not play the fool  tell him what i have said i shant deny it  she passed on to greet a decrepit old lord with a languishing smile and i stood staring after her with i fear a somewhat stupid expression until some young fool came up grinning to ask me whether i had seen a ghost or backed a wrong un  there was no need to wait i felt no curiosity  something told me the woman had spoken the truth  it was mere want of motive that made me linger  i saw him come in and watched him hanging round her like a dog waiting for a kind word or failing that a look  i knew she saw me and i knew it added to her zest that i was there  not till we were in the street did i speak to him  he started as i touched him  we were neither of us good actors  he must have read much in my face and i saw that he had read it and we walked side by side in silence i thinking what to say wondering whether i should do good or harm wishing that we were anywhere but in these silent lifepacked streets so filled with the unseen  it was not until we had nearly reached the albert hall that we broke the silence  then it was he who spoke  do you think i havent told myself all that he said  do you think i dont know im a damned fool a cad a liar  what the devils the good of talking about it  but i cant understand it i said  no he replied because youre a fool because you have only seen one side of me  you think me a grand gentleman because i talk big and am full of noble sentiment  why you idiot the devil himself could take you in  he has his fine moods i suppose talks like a saint and says his prayers with the rest of us  do you remember the first night at old fauerbergs  you poked your silly head into the dormitory and saw me kneeling by the bedside while the other fellows stood by grinning  you closed the door softlyyou thought i never saw you  i was not praying i was trying to pray  it showed that you had pluck if it showed nothing else i answered most boys would not have tried and you kept it up  ah yes he answered i promised the mater i would and i did  poor old soul she was as big a fool as you are  she believed in me  dont you remember finding me one saturday afternoon all alone stuffing myself with cake and jam  i laughed at the recollection though heaven knows i was in no laughing mood  i had found him with an array of pastry spread out before him sufficient to make him ill for a week and i had boxed his ears and had thrown the whole collection into the road  the mater gave me halfacrown a week for pocketmoney he continued and i told the fellows i had only a shilling so that i could gorge myself with the other eighteenpence undisturbed  pah  i was a little beast even in those days  it was only a schoolboy trick i argued it was natural enough  yes he answered and this is only a mans trick and is natural enough but it is going to ruin my life to turn me into a beast instead of a man  good god do you think i dont know what that woman will do for me  she will drag me down down down to her own level  all my ideas all my ambition all my lifes work will be bartered for a smug practice among paying patients  i shall scheme and plot to make a big income that we may live like a couple of plump animals that we may dress ourselves gaudily and parade our wealth  nothing will satisfy her  such women are leeches their only cry is give give give  so long as i can supply her with money she will tolerate me and to get it for her i shall sell my heart and my brain and my soul  she will load herself with jewels and go about from house to house half naked to leer at every man she comes across that is life to such women  and i shall trot behind her the laughing stock of every fool the contempt of every man  his vehemence made any words i could say sound weak before they were uttered  what argument could i show stronger than that he had already put before himself  i knew his answer to everything i could urge  my mistake had been in imagining him different from other men  i began to see that he was like the rest of us part angel part devil  but the new point he revealed to me was that the higher the one the lower the other  it seems as if nature must balance her work the nearer the leaves to heaven the deeper the roots striking down into the darkness  i knew that his passion for this woman made no change in his truer love the one was a spiritual the other a mere animal passion  the memory of incidents that had puzzled me came back to enlighten me  i remembered how often on nights when i had sat up late working i had heard his steps pass my door heavy and uncertain how once in a dingy quarter of london i had met one who had strangely resembled him  i had followed him to speak but the mans bleared eyes had stared angrily at me and i had turned away calling myself a fool for my mistake  but as i looked at the face beside me now i understood  and then there rose up before my eyes the face i knew better the eager noble face that to merely look upon had been good  we had reached a small evilsmelling street leading from leicester square towards holborn  i caught him by the shoulders and turned him round with his back against some church railings  i forget what i said  we are strange mixtures  i thought of the shy backward boy i had coached and bullied at old fauerbergs of the laughing handsome lad i had watched grow into manhood  the very restaurant we had most frequented in his old oxford dayswhere we had poured out our souls to one another was in this very street where we were standing  for the moment i felt towards him as perhaps his mother might have felt i wanted to scold him and to cry with him to shake him and to put my arms about him  i pleaded with him and urged him and called him every name i could put my tongue to  it must have seemed an odd conversation  a passing policeman making a not unnatural mistake turned his bullseye upon us and advised us sternly to go home  we laughed and with that laugh cyril came back to his own self and we walked on to staple inn more soberly  he promised me to go away by the very first train the next morning and to travel for some four or five months and i undertook to make all the necessary explanations for him  we both felt better for our talk and when i wished him goodnight at his door it was the real cyril harjohn whose hand i grippedthe real cyril because the best that is in a man is his real self  if there be any future for man beyond this world it is the good that is in him that will live  the other side of him is of the earth it is that he will leave behind him  he kept his word  in the morning he was gone and i never saw him again i had many letters from him hopeful at first full of strong resolves he told me he had written to elspeth not telling her everything for that she would not understand but so much as would explain and from her he had had sweet womanly letters in reply  i feared she might have been cold and unsympathetic for often good women untouched by temptation themselves have small tenderness for those who struggle  but her goodness was something more than a mere passive quantity she loved him the better because he had need of her  i believe she would have saved him from himself had not fate interfered and taken the matter out of her hands  women are capable of big sacrifices i think this woman would have been content to lower herself if by so doing she could have raised him  but it was not to be  from india he wrote to me that he was coming home i had not met the fawley woman for some time and she had gone out of my mind until one day chancing upon a theatrical paper some weeks old i read that miss fawley had sailed for calcutta to fulfil an engagement of long standing  i had his last letter in my pocket  i sat down and worked out the question of date  she would arrive in calcutta the day before he left whether it was chance or intention on her part i never knew as likely as not the former for there is a fatalism in this world shaping our ends  i heard no more from him i hardly expected to do so but three months later a mutual acquaintance stopped me on the club steps  have you heard the news he said about young harjohn  no i replied  is he married  married he answered no poor devil hes dead  thank god was on my lips but fortunately i checked myself  how did it happen i asked  at a shooting party up at some rajahs place  must have caught his gun in some brambles i suppose  the bullet went clean through his head  dear me i said how very sad  i could think of nothing else to say at the moment     the materialisation of charles and mivanway   the fault that most people will find with this story is that it is unconvincing  its scheme is improbable its atmosphere artificial  to confess that the thing really happenednot as i am about to set it down for the pen of the professional writer cannot but adorn and embroider even to the detriment of his materialis i am well aware only an aggravation of my offence for the facts of life are the impossibilities of fiction  a truer artist would have left this story alone or at most have kept it for the irritation of his private circle  my lower instinct is to make use of it  a very old man told me the tale  he was landlord of the cromlech arms the only inn of a small rocksheltered village on the northeast coast of cornwall and had been so for nine and forty years  it is called the cromlech hotel now and is under new management and during the season some four coachloads of tourists sit down each day to table dhote lunch in the lowceilinged parlour  but i am speaking of years ago when the place was a mere fishing harbour undiscovered by the guide books  the old landlord talked and i hearkened the while we both sat drinking thin ale from earthenware mugs late one summers evening on the bench that runs along the wall just beneath the latticed windows  and during the many pauses when the old landlord stopped to puff his pipe in silence and lay in a new stock of breath there came to us the murmuring voices of the atlantic and often mingled with the pompous roar of the big breakers farther out we would hear the rippling laugh of some small wave that maybe had crept in to listen to the tale the landlord told  the mistake that charles seabohn junior partner of the firm of seabohn  son civil engineers of london and newcastleupontyne and mivanway evans youngest daughter of the rev thomas evans pastor of the presbyterian church at bristol made originally was marrying too young charles seabohn could hardly have been twenty years of age and mivanway could have been little more than seventeen when they first met upon the cliffs two miles beyond the cromlech arms  young charles seabohn coming across the village in the course of a walking tour had decided to spend a day or two exploring the picturesque coast and mivanways father had hired that year a neighbouring farmhouse wherein to spend his summer vacation  early one morningfor at twenty one is virtuous and takes exercise before breakfastas young charles seabohn lay upon the cliffs watching the white waters coming and going upon the black rocks below he became aware of a form rising from the waves  the figure was too far off for him to see it clearly but judging from the costume it was a female figure and promptly the mind of charles poetically inclined turned to thoughts of venusor aphrodite as he being a gentleman of delicate taste would have preferred to term her  he saw the figure disappear behind a headland but still waited  in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour it reappeared clothed in the garments of the eighteensixties and came towards him  hidden from sight himself behind a group of rocks he could watch it at his leisure ascending the steep path from the beach and an exceedingly sweet and dainty figure it would have appeared even to eyes less susceptible than those of twenty  sea wateri stand open to correctionis not i believe considered anything of a substitute for curling tongs but to the hair of the youngest miss evans it had given an additional and most fascinating wave  natures red and white had been most cunningly laid on and the large childish eyes seemed to be searching the world for laughter with which to feed a pair of delicious pouting lips  charless upturned face petrified into admiration was just the sort of thing for which they were on the look out  a startled oh came from the slightly parted lips followed by the merriest of laughs which in its turn was suddenly stopped by a deep blush  then the youngest miss evans looked offended as though the whole affair had been charless fault which is the way of women  and charles feeling himself guilty under that stern gaze of indignation rose awkwardly and apologised meekly whether for being on the cliffs at all or for having got up too early he would have been unable to explain  the youngest miss evans graciously accepted the apology thus tendered with a bow and passed on and charles stood staring after her till the valley gathered her into its spreading arms and hid her from his view  that was the beginning of all things  i am speaking of the universe as viewed from the standpoint of charles and mivanway  six months later they were man and wife or perhaps it would be more correct to say boy and wifelet  seabohn senior counselled delay but was overruled by the impatience of his junior partner  the reverend mr evans in common with most theologians possessed a goodly supply of unmarried daughters and a limited income  personally he saw no necessity for postponement of the marriage  the months honeymoon was spent in the new forest  that was a mistake to begin with  the new forest in february is depressing and they had chosen the loneliest spot they could find  a fortnight in paris or rome would have been more helpful  as yet they had nothing to talk about except love and that they had been talking and writing about steadily all through the winter  on the tenth morning charles yawned and mivanway had a quiet halfhours cry about it in her own room  on the sixteenth evening mivanway feeling irritable and wondering why as though fifteen damp chilly days in the new forest were not sufficient to make any woman irritable requested charles not to disarrange her hair and charles speechless with astonishment went out into the garden and swore before all the stars that he would never caress mivanways hair again as long as he lived  one supreme folly they had conspired to commit even before the commencement of the honeymoon  charles after the manner of very young lovers had earnestly requested mivanway to impose upon him some task  he desired to do something great and noble to show his devotion  dragons was the thing he had in mind though he may not have been aware of it dragons also no doubt flitted through mivanways brain but unfortunately for lovers the supply of dragons has lapsed  mivanway liking the conceit however thought over it and then decided that charles must give up smoking  she had discussed the matter with her favourite sister and that was the only thing the girls could think of charless face fell  he suggested some more herculean labour some sacrifice more worthy to lay at mivanways feet  but mivanway had spoken  she might think of some other task but the smoking prohibition would in any case remain  she dismissed the subject with a pretty hauteur that would have graced marie antoinette  thus tobacco the good angel of all men no longer came each day to teach charles patience and amiability and he fell into the ways of short temper and selfishness  they took up their residence in a suburb of newcastle and this was also unfortunate for them because there the society was scanty and middle aged and in consequence they had still to depend much upon their own resources  they knew little of life less of each other and nothing at all of themselves  of course they quarrelled and each quarrel left the wound a little more raw  no kindly experienced friend was at hand to laugh at them  mivanway would write down all her sorrows in a bulky diary which made her feel worse so that before she had written for ten minutes her pretty unwise head would drop upon her dimpled arm and the bookthe proper place for which was behind the firewould become damp with her tears and charles his days work done and the clerks gone would linger in his dingy office and hatch trifles into troubles  the end came one evening after dinner when in the heat of a silly squabble charles boxed mivanways ears  that was very ungentlemanly conduct and he was heartily ashamed of himself the moment he had done it which was right and proper for him to be  the only excuse to be urged on his behalf is that girls sufficiently pretty to have been spoilt from childhood by everyone about them can at times be intensely irritating  mivanway rushed up to her room and locked herself in charles flew after her to apologise but only arrived in time to have the door slammed in his face  it had only been the merest touch  a boys muscles move quicker than his thoughts  but to mivanway it was a blow  this was what it had come to this was the end of a mans love  she spent half the night writing in the precious diary with the result that in the morning she came down feeling more bitter than she had gone up  charles had walked the streets of newcastle all night and that had not done him any good  he met her with an apology combined with an excuse which was bad tactics  mivanway of course fastened upon the excuse and the quarrel recommenced  she mentioned that she hated him he hinted that she had never loved him and she retorted that he had never loved her  had there been anybody by to knock their heads together and suggest breakfast the thing might have blown over but the combined effect of a sleepless night and an empty stomach upon each proved disastrous  their words came poisoned from their brains and each believed they meant what they said  that afternoon charles sailed from hull on a ship bound for the cape and that evening mivanway arrived at the paternal home in bristol with two trunks and the curt information that she and charles had separated for ever  the next morning both thought of a soft speech to say to the other but the next morning was just twentyfour hours too late  eight days afterwards charless ship was run down in a fog near the coast of portugal and every soul on board was supposed to have perished mivanway read his name among the list of lost the child died within her and she knew herself for a woman who had loved deeply and will not love again  good luck intervening however charles and one other man were rescued by a small trading vessel and landed in algiers  there charles learnt of his supposed death and the idea occurred to him to leave the report uncontradicted  for one thing it solved a problem that had been troubling him  he could trust his father to see to it that his own small fortune with possibly something added was handed over to mivanway and she would be free if she wished to marry again  he was convinced that she did not care for him and that she had read of his death with a sense of relief  he would make a new life for himself and forget her  he continued his journey to the cape and once there he soon gained for himself an excellent position  the colony was young engineers were welcome and charles knew his business  he found the life interesting and exciting  the rough dangerous upcountry work suited him and the time passed swiftly  but in thinking he would forget mivanway he had not taken into consideration his own character which at bottom was a very gentlemanly character  out on the lonely veldt he found himself dreaming of her  the memory of her pretty face and merry laugh came back to him at all hours occasionally he would curse her roundly but that only meant that he was sore because of the thought of her what he was really cursing was himself and his own folly  softened by the distance her quick temper her very petulance became mere added graces and if we consider women as human beings and not as angels it was certainly a fact that he had lost a very sweet and lovable woman  ah if she only were by his side nownow that he was a man capable of appreciating her and not a foolish selfish boy  this thought would come to him as he sat smoking at the door of his tent and then he would regret that the stars looking down upon him were not the same stars that were watching her it would have made him feel nearer to her  for though young people may not credit it one grows more sentimental as one grows older at least some of us do and they perhaps not the least wise  one night he had a vivid dream of her  she came to him and held out her hand and he took it and they said goodbye to one another  they were standing on the cliff where he had first met her and one of them was going upon a long journey though he was not sure which  in the towns men laugh at dreams but away from civilisation we listen more readily to the strange tales that nature whispers to us  charles seabohn recollected this dream when he awoke in the morning  she is dying he said and she has come to wish me goodbye  he made up his mind to return to england at once perhaps if he made haste he would be in time to kiss her  but he could not start that day for work was to be done and charles seabohn lover though he still was had grown to be a man and knew that work must not be neglected even though the heart may be calling  so for a day or two he stayed and on the third night he dreamed of mivanway again and this time she lay within the little chapel at bristol where on sunday mornings he had often sat with her  he heard her fathers voice reading the burial service over her and the sister she had loved best was sitting beside him crying softly  then charles knew that there was no need for him to hasten  so he remained to finish his work  that done he would return to england  he would like again to stand upon the cliffs above the little cornish village where they had first met  thus a few months later charles seabohn or charles denning as he called himself aged and bronzed not easily recognisable by those who had not known him well walked into the cromlech arms as six years before he had walked in with his knapsack on his back and asked for a room saying he would be stopping in the village for a short while  in the evening he strolled out and made his way to the cliffs  it was twilight when he reached the place of rocks to which the fancyloving cornish folk had given the name of the witches cauldron  it was from this spot that he had first watched mivanway coming to him from the sea  he took the pipe from his mouth and leaning against a rock whose rugged outline seemed fashioned into the face of an old friend gazed down the narrow pathway now growing indistinct in the dim light  and as he gazed the figure of mivanway came slowly up the pathway from the sea and paused before him  he felt no fear  he had half expected it  her coming was the complement of his dreams  she looked older and graver than he remembered her but for that the face was the sweeter  he wondered if she would speak to him but she only looked at him with sad eyes and he stood there in the shadow of the rocks without moving and she passed on into the twilight  had he on his return cared to discuss the subject with his landlord had he even shown himself a ready listenerfor the old man loved to gossiphe might have learnt that a young widow lady named mrs charles seabohn accompanied by an unmarried sister had lately come to reside in the neighbourhood having upon the death of a former tenant taken the lease of a small farmhouse sheltered in the valley a mile beyond the village and that her favourite evenings walk was to the sea and back by the steep footway leading past the witches cauldron  had he followed the figure of mivanway into the valley he would have known that out of sight of the witches cauldron it took to running fast till it reached a welcome door and fell panting into the arms of another figure that had hastened out to meet it  my dear said the elder woman you are trembling like a leaf  what has happened  i have seen him answered mivanway  seen whom  charles  charles repeated the other looking at mivanway as though she thought her mad  his spirit i mean explained mivanway in an awed voice  it was standing in the shadow of the rocks in the exact spot where we first met  it looked older and more careworn but oh margaret so sad and reproachful  my dear said her sister leading her in you are overwrought  i wish we had never come back to this house  oh  i was not frightened answered mivanway i have been expecting it every evening  i am so glad it came  perhaps it will come again and i can ask it to forgive me  so next night mivanway though much against her sisters wishes and advice persisted in her usual walk and charles at the same twilight hour started from the inn  again mivanway saw him standing in the shadow of the rocks  charles had made up his mind that if the thing happened again he would speak but when the silent figure of mivanway clothed in the fading light stopped and gazed at him his will failed him  that it was the spirit of mivanway standing before him he had not the faintest doubt  one may dismiss other peoples ghosts as the phantasies of a weak brain but one knows ones own to be realities and charles for the last five years had mingled with a people whose dead dwell about them  once drawing his courage around him he made to speak but as he did so the figure of mivanway shrank from him and only a sigh escaped his lips and hearing that the figure of mivanway turned and again passed down the path into the valley leaving charles gazing after it  but the third night both arrived at the trysting spot with determination screwed up to the sticking point  charles was the first to speak  as the figure of mivanway came towards him with its eyes fixed sadly on him he moved from the shadow of the rocks and stood before it  mivanway he said  charles replied the figure of mivanway  both spoke in an awed whisper suitable to the circumstances and each stood gazing sorrowfully upon the other  are you happy asked mivanway  the question strikes one as somewhat farcical but it must be remembered that mivanway was the daughter of a gospeller of the old school and had been brought up to beliefs that were not then out of date  as happy as i deserve to be was the sad reply and the answerthe inference was not complimentary to charless desertsstruck a chill to mivanways heart  how could i be happy having lost you went on the voice of charles  now this speech fell very pleasantly upon mivanways ears  in the first place it relieved her of her despair regarding charless future  no doubt his present suffering was keen but there was hope for him secondly it was a decidedly pretty speech for a ghost and i am not at all sure that mivanway was the kind of woman to be averse to a little mild flirtation with the spirit of charles  can you forgive me asked mivanway  forgive you replied charles in a tone of awed astonishment  can you forgive me  i was a brutea fooli was not worthy to love you  a most gentlemanly spirit it seemed to be  mivanway forgot to be afraid of it  we were both to blame answered mivanway  but this time there was less submission in her tones  but i was the most at fault  i was a petulant child  i did not know how deeply i loved you  you loved me repeated the voice of charles and the voice lingered over the words as though it found them sweet  surely you never doubted it answered the voice of mivanway  i never ceased to love you  i shall love you always and ever  the figure of charles sprang forward as though it would clasp the ghost of mivanway in its arms but halted a step or two off  bless me before you go he said and with uncovered head the figure of charles knelt to the figure of mivanway  really ghosts could be exceedingly nice when they liked  mivanway bent graciously towards her shadowy suppliant and as she did so her eye caught sight of something on the grass beside it and that something was a wellcoloured meerschaum pipe  there was no mistaking it for anything else even in that treacherous light it lay glistening where charles in falling upon his knees had jerked it from his breastpocket  charles following mivanways eyes saw it also and the memory of the prohibition against smoking came back to him  without stopping to consider the futility of the actionnay the direct confession implied therebyhe instinctively grabbed at the pipe and rammed it back into his pocket and then an avalanche of mingled understanding and bewilderment fear and joy swept mivanways brain before it  she felt she must do one of two things laugh or scream and go on screaming and she laughed  peal after peal of laughter she sent echoing among the rocks and charles springing to his feet was just in time to catch her as she fell forward a dead weight into his arms  ten minutes later the eldest miss evans hearing heavy footsteps went to the door  she saw what she took to be the spirit of charles seabohn staggering under the weight of the lifeless body of mivanway and the sight not unnaturally alarmed her  charless suggestion of brandy however sounded human and the urgent need of attending to mivanway kept her mind from dwelling upon problems tending towards insanity  charles carried mivanway to her room and laid her upon the bed  ill leave her with you he whispered to the eldest miss evans  it will be better for her not to see me until she is quite recovered  she has had a shock  charles waited in the dark parlour for what seemed to him an exceedingly long time  but at last the eldest miss evans returned  shes all right now were the welcome words he heard  ill go and see her he said  but shes in bed exclaimed the scandalised miss evans  and then as charles only laughed oh ahyes i supposeof course she added  and the eldest miss evans left alone sat down and wrestled with the conviction that she was dreaming     portrait of a lady   my work pressed upon me but the louder it challenged mesuch is the heart of the timid fighterthe less stomach i felt for the contest  i wrestled with it in my study only to be driven to my books  i walked out to meet it in the streets only to seek shelter from it in musichall or theatre  thereupon it waxed importunate and overbearing till the shadow of it darkened all my doings  the thought of it sat beside me at the table and spoilt my appetite  the memory of it followed me abroad and stood between me and my friends so that all talk died upon my lips and i moved among men as one ghostridden  then the throbbing town with its thousand distracting voices grew maddening to me  i felt the need of converse with solitude that master and teacher of all the arts and i bethought me of the yorkshire wolds where a man may walk all day meeting no human creature hearing no voice but the curlews cry where lying prone upon the sweet grass he may feel the pulsation of the earth travelling at its eleven hundred miles a minute through the ether  so one morning i bundled many things some needful more needless into a bag hurrying lest somebody or something should happen to stay me and that night i lay in a small northern town that stands upon the borders of smokedom at the gate of the great moors and at seven the next morning i took my seat beside a oneeyed carrier behind an ancient piebald mare  the oneeyed carrier cracked his whip the piebald horse jogged forward  the nineteenth century with its turmoil fell away behind us the distant hills creeping nearer swallowed us up and we became but a moving speck upon the face of the quiet earth  late in the afternoon we arrived at a village the memory of which had been growing in my mind  it lies in the triangle formed by the sloping walls of three great fells and not even the telegraph wire has reached it yet to murmur to it whispers of the restless worldor had not at the time of which i write  nought disturbs it save once a day the oneeyed carrierif he and his piebald mare have not yet laid their ancient bones to restwho passing through leaves a few letters and parcels to be called for by the people of the scattered hillfarms round about  it is the meetingplace of two noisy brooks  through the sleepy days and the hushed nights one hears them ever chattering to themselves as children playing alone some game of makebelieve  coming from their faroff homes among the hills they mingle their waters here and journey on in company and then their converse is more serious as becomes those who have joined hands and are moving onward towards life together  later they reach sad weary towns black beneath a neverlifted pall of smoke where day and night the clang of iron drowns all human voices where the children play with ashes where the men and women have dull patient faces and so on muddy and stained to the deep sea that ceaselessly calls to them  here however their waters are fresh and clear and their passing makes the only stir that the valley has ever known  surely of all peaceful places this was the one where a tired worker might find strength  my oneeyed friend had suggested i should seek lodgings at the house of one mistress cholmondley a widow lady who resided with her only daughter in the whitewashed cottage that is the last house in the village if you take the road that leads over coll fell  tha can see th house from here by reason o its standing so high above tothers said the carrier pointing with his whip  its theer or nowhere awm thinking for folks dont often coom seeking lodgings in these parts  the tiny dwelling half smothered in june roses looked idyllic and after a lunch of bread and cheese at the little inn i made my way to it by the path that passes through the churchyard  i had conjured up the vision of a stout pleasant comfortradiating woman assisted by some bright fresh girl whose rosy cheeks and sunburnt hands would help me banish from my mind all clogging recollections of the town and hopeful i pushed back the halfopened door and entered  the cottage was furnished with a taste that surprised me but in themselves my hosts disappointed me  my bustling comely housewife turned out a wizened bleareyed dame  all day long she dozed in her big chair or crouched with shrivelled hands spread out before the fire  my dream of winsome maidenhood vanished before the reality of a wearylooking sharpfeatured woman of between forty and fifty  perhaps there had been a time when the listless eyes had sparkled with roguish merriment when the shrivelled tightdrawn lips had pouted temptingly but spinsterhood does not sweeten the juices of a woman and strong country air though like old ale it is good when taken occasionally dulls the brain if lived upon  a narrow uninteresting woman i found her troubled with a shyness that sat ludicrously upon her age and that yet failed to save her from the landladys customary failing of loquacity concerning better days together with an irritating if harmless affectation of youthfulness  all other details were however most satisfactory and at the window commanding the road that leads through the valley towards the distant world i settled down to face my work  but the spirit of industry once driven forth returns with coy steps  i wrote for perhaps an hour and then throwing down my halting pen i looked about the room seeking distraction  a chippendale bookcase stood against the wall and i strolled over to it  the key was in the lock and opening its glass doors i examined the wellfilled shelves  they held a curious collection miscellanies with quaint glazed bindings novels and poems whose authors i had never heard of old magazines long dead their very names forgotten keepsakes and annuals redolent of an age of vastly pretty sentiments and lavendercoloured silks  on the top shelf however was a volume of keats wedged between a number of the evangelical rambler and youngs night thoughts and standing on tip toe i sought to draw it from its place  the book was jambed so tightly that my efforts brought two or three others tumbling about me covering me with a cloud of fine dust and to my feet there fell with a rattle of glass and metal a small miniature painting framed in black wood  i picked it up and taking it to the window examined it  it was the picture of a young girl dressed in the fashion of thirty years agoi mean thirty years ago then  i fear it must be nearer fifty speaking as from nowwhen our grandmothers wore corkscrew curls and lowcut bodices that one wonders how they kept from slipping down  the face was beautiful not merely with the conventional beauty of tiresome regularity and impossible colouring such as one finds in all miniatures but with soul behind the soft deep eyes  as i gazed the sweet lips seemed to laugh at me and yet there lurked a sadness in the smile as though the artist in some rare moment had seen the coming shadow of life across the sunshine of the face  even my small knowledge of art told me that the work was clever and i wondered why it should have lain so long neglected when as a mere ornament it was valuable  it must have been placed in the bookcase years ago by someone and forgotten  i replaced it among its dusty companions and sat down once more to my work  but between me and the fading light came the face of the miniature and would not be banished  wherever i turned it looked out at me from the shadows  i am not naturally fanciful and the work i was engaged uponthe writing of a farcical comedywas not of the kind to excite the dreamy side of a mans nature  i grew angry with myself and made a further effort to fix my mind upon the paper in front of me  but my thoughts refused to return from their wanderings  once glancing back over my shoulder i could have sworn i saw the original of the picture sitting in the big chintzcovered chair in the far corner  it was dressed in a faded lilac frock trimmed with some old lace and i could not help noticing the beauty of the folded hands though in the portrait only the head and shoulders had been drawn  next morning i had forgotten the incident but with the lighting of the lamp the memory of it awoke within me and my interest grew so strong that again i took the miniature from its hidingplace and looked at it  and then the knowledge suddenly came to me that i knew the face  where had i seen her and when  i had met her and spoken to her  the picture smiled at me as if rallying me on my forgetfulness  i put it back upon its shelf and sat racking my brains trying to recollect  we had met somewherein the countrya long time ago and had talked of commonplace things  to the vision of her clung the scent of roses and the murmuring voices of haymakers  why had i never seen her again  why had she passed so completely out of my mind  my landlady entered to lay my supper and i questioned her assuming a careless tone  reason with or laugh at myself as i would this shadowy memory was becoming a romance to me  it was as though i were talking of some loved dead friend even to speak of whom to commonplace people was a sacrilege  i did not want the woman to question me in return  oh yes answered my landlady  ladies had often lodged with her sometimes people stayed the whole summer wandering about the woods and fells but to her thinking the great hills were lonesome  some of her lodgers had been young ladies but she could not remember any of them having impressed her with their beauty  but then it was said women were never a judge of other women  they had come and gone  few had ever returned and fresh faces drove out the old  you have been letting lodgings for a long time i asked  i suppose it could be fifteentwenty years ago that strangers to you lived in this room  longer than that she said quietly dropping for the moment all affectation  we came here from the farm when my father died  he had had losses and there was but little left  that is twentyseven years ago now  i hastened to close the conversation fearing longwinded recollections of better days  i have heard such so often from one landlady and another  i had not learnt much  who was the original of the miniature how it came to be lying forgotten in the dusty bookcase were still mysteries and with a strange perversity i could not have explained to myself i shrank from putting a direct question  so two days more passed by  my work took gradually a firmer grip upon my mind and the face of the miniature visited me less often  but in the evening of the third day which was a sunday a curious thing happened  i was returning from a stroll and dusk was falling as i reached the cottage  i had been thinking of my farce and i was laughing to myself at a situation that seemed to me comical when passing the window of my room i saw looking out the sweet fair face that had become so familiar to me  it stood close to the latticed panes a slim girlish figure clad in the oldfashioned lilaccoloured frock in which i had imagined it on the first night of my arrival the beautiful hands clasped across the breast as then they had been folded on the lap  her eyes were gazing down the road that passes through the village and goes south but they seemed to be dreaming not seeing and the sadness in them struck upon one almost as a cry  i was close to the window but the hedge screened me and i remained watching until after a minute i suppose though it appeared longer the figure drew back into the darkness of the room and disappeared  i entered but the room was empty  i called but no one answered  the uncomfortable suggestion took hold of me that i must be growing a little crazy  all that had gone before i could explain to myself as a mere train of thought but this time it had come to me suddenly uninvited while my thoughts had been busy elsewhere  this thing had appeared not to my brain but to my senses  i am not a believer in ghosts but i am in the hallucinations of a weak mind and my own explanation was in consequence not very satisfactory to myself  i tried to dismiss the incident but it would not leave me and later that same evening something else occurred that fixed it still clearer in my thoughts  i had taken out two or three books at random with which to amuse myself and turning over the leaves of one of them a volume of verses by some obscure poet i found its sentimental passages much scored and commented upon in pencil as was common fifty years agoas may be common now for your fleet street cynic has not altered the world and its ways to quite the extent that he imagines  one poem in particular had evidently appealed greatly to the readers sympathies  it was the old old story of the gallant who woos and rides away leaving the maiden to weep  the poetry was poor and at another time its conventionality would have excited only my ridicule  but reading it in conjunction with the quaint naive notes scattered about its margins i felt no inclination to jeer  these hackneyed stories that we laugh at are deep profundities to the many who find in them some shadow of their own sorrows and shefor it was a womans handwritingto whom this book belonged had loved its trite verses because in them she had read her own heart  this i told myself was her story also  a common enough story in life as in literature but novel to those who live it  there was no reason for my connecting her with the original of the miniature except perhaps a subtle relationship between the thin nervous handwriting and the mobile features yet i felt instinctively they were one and the same and that i was tracing link by link the history of my forgotten friend  i felt urged to probe further and next morning while my landlady was clearing away my breakfast things i fenced round the subject once again  by the way i said while i think of it if i leave any books or papers here behind me send them on at once  i have a knack of doing that sort of thing  i suppose i added your lodgers often do leave some of their belongings behind them  it sounded to myself a clumsy ruse  i wondered if she would suspect what was behind it  not often she answered  never that i can remember except in the case of one poor lady who died here  i glanced up quickly  in this room i asked  my landlady seemed troubled at my tone  well not exactly in this very room  we carried her upstairs but she died immediately  she was dying when she came here  i should not have taken her in had i known  so many people are prejudiced against a house where death has occurred as if there were anywhere it had not  it was not quite fair to us  i did not speak for a while and the rattle of the plates and knives continued undisturbed  what did she leave here i asked at length  oh just a few books and photographs and suchlike small things that people bring with them to lodgings was the reply  her people promised to send for them but they never did and i suppose i forgot them  they were not of any value  the woman turned as she was leaving the room  it wont drive you away sir i hope what i have told you she said it all happened a long while ago  of course not i answered  it interested me that was all  and the woman went out closing the door behind her  so here was the explanation if i chose to accept it  i sat long that morning wondering to myself whether things i had learnt to laugh at could be after all realities  and a day or two afterwards i made a discovery that confirmed all my vague surmises  rummaging through this same dusty bookcase i found in one of the ill fitting drawers beneath a heap of torn and tumbled books a diary belonging to the fifties stuffed with many letters and shapeless flowers pressed between stained pages and therefor the writer of stories tempted by human documents is weakin faded ink brown and withered like the flowers i read the story i already knew  such a very old story it was and so conventional  he was an artistwas ever story of this type written where the hero was not an artist  they had been children together loving each other without knowing it till one day it was revealed to them  here is the entry     may 18thi do not know what to say or how to begin  chris loves    me  i have been praying to god to make me worthy of him and dancing    round the room in my bare feet for fear of waking them below  he    kissed my hands and clasped them round his neck saying they were    beautiful as the hands of a goddess and he knelt and kissed them    again  i am holding them before me and kissing them myself  i am    glad they are so beautiful  o god why are you so good to me  help    me to be a true wife to him  help me that i may never give him an    instants pain  oh that i had more power of loving that i might    love him betterand thus foolish thoughts for many pages but    foolish thoughts of the kind that has kept this worn old world    hanging for so many ages in space from turning sour  later in february there is another entry that carries on the story     chris left this morning  he put a little packet into my hands at the    last moment saying it was the most precious thing he possessed and    that when i looked at it i was to think of him who loved it  of    course i guessed what it was but i did not open it till i was alone    in my room  it is the picture of myself that he has been so secret    about but oh so beautiful  i wonder if i am really as beautiful as    this  but i wish he had not made me look so sad  i am kissing the    little lips  i love them because he loved to kiss them  oh    sweetheart it will be long before you kiss them again  of course it    was right for him to go and i am glad he has been able to manage it    he could not study properly in this quiet country place and now he    will be able to go to paris and rome and he will be great  even the    stupid people here see how clever he is  but oh it will be so long    before i see him again my love my king  with each letter that comes from him similar foolish rhapsodies are written down but these letters of his i gather as i turn the pages grow after a while colder and fewer and a chill fear that dare not be penned creeps in among the words     march 12th  six weeks and no letter from chris and oh dear i am    so hungry for one for the last i have almost kissed to pieces  i    suppose he will write more often when he gets to london  he is    working hard i know and it is selfish of me to expect him to write    more often but i would sit up all night for a week rather than miss    writing to him  i suppose men are not like that  o god help me    help me whatever happens  how foolish i am tonight  he was always    careless  i will punish him for it when he comes back but not very    much  truly enough a conventional story  letters do come from him after that but apparently they are less and less satisfactory for the diary grows angry and bitter and the faded writing is blotted at times with tears  then towards the end of another year there comes this entry written in a hand of strange neatness and precision     it is all over now  i am glad it is finished  i have written to    him giving him up  i have told him i have ceased to care for him    and that it is better we should both be free  it is best that way  he    would have had to ask me to release him and that would have given him    pain  he was always gentle  now he will be able to marry her with an    easy conscience and he need never know what i have suffered  she is    more fitted for him than i am  i hope he will be happy  i think i    have done the right thing  a few lines follow left blank and then the writing is resumed but in a stronger more vehement hand     why do i lie to myself  i hate her  i would kill her if i could  i    hope she will make him wretched and that he will come to hate her as    i do and that she will die  why did i let them persuade me to send    that lying letter  he will show it to her and she will see through    it and laugh at me  i could have held him to his promise he could    not have got out of it     what do i care about dignity and womanliness and right and all the    rest of the canting words  i want him  i want his kisses and his    arms about me  he is mine  he loved me once  i have only given him    up because i thought it a fine thing to play the saint  it is only an    acted lie  i would rather be evil and he loved me  why do i deceive    myself  i want him  i care for nothing else at the bottom of my    hearthis love his kisses  and towards the end  my god what am i saying  have i no shame no strength  o god help me        and there the diary closes  i looked among the letters lying between the pages of the book  most of them were signed simply chris or christopher  but one gave his name in full and it was a name i know well as that of a famous man whose hand i have often shaken  i thought of his hardfeatured handsome wife and of his great chill place half house half exhibition in kensington filled constantly with its smart chattering set among whom he seemed always to be the uninvited guest of his weary face and bitter tongue and thinking thus there rose up before me the sweet sad face of the woman of the miniature and meeting her eyes as she smiled at me from out of the shadows i looked at her my wonder  i took the miniature from its shelf  there would be no harm now in learning her name  so i stood with it in my hand till a little later my landlady entered to lay the cloth  i tumbled this out of your bookcase i said in reaching down some books  it is someone i know someone i have met but i cannot think where  do you know who it is  the woman took it from my hand and a faint flush crossed her withered face  i had lost it she answered  i never thought of looking there its a portrait of myself painted years ago by a friend  i looked from her to the miniature as she stood among the shadows with the lamplight falling on her face and saw her perhaps for the first time  how stupid of me i answered  yes i see the likeness now     the man who would manage   it has been told me by those in a position to knowand i can believe itthat at nineteen months of age he wept because his grandmother would not allow him to feed her with a spoon and that at three and a half he was fished in an exhausted condition out of the waterbutt whither he had climbed for the purpose of teaching a frog to swim  two years later he permanently injured his left eye showing the cat how to carry kittens without hurting them and about the same period was dangerously stung by a bee while conveying it from a flower where as it seemed to him it was only wasting its time to one more rich in honey making properties  his desire was always to help others  he would spend whole mornings explaining to elderly hens how to hatch eggs and would give up an afternoons blackberrying to sit at home and crack nuts for his pet squirrel  before he was seven he would argue with his mother upon the management of children and reprove his father for the way he was bringing him up  as a child nothing could afford him greater delight than minding other children or them less  he would take upon himself this harassing duty entirely of his own accord without hope of reward or gratitude  it was immaterial to him whether the other children were older than himself or younger stronger or weaker whenever and wherever he found them he set to work to mind them  once during a school treat piteous cries were heard coming from a distant part of the wood and upon search being made he was discovered prone upon the ground with a cousin of his a boy twice his own weight sitting upon him and steadily whacking him  having rescued him the teacher said  why dont you keep with the little boys  what are you doing along with him  please sir was the answer i was minding him  he would have minded noah if he had got hold of him  he was a goodnatured lad and at school he was always willing for the whole class to copy from his slateindeed he would urge them to do so he meant it kindly but inasmuch as his answers were invariably quite wrongwith a distinctive and inimitable wrongness peculiar to himselfthe result to his followers was eminently unsatisfactory and with the shallowness of youth that ignoring motives judges solely from results they would wait for him outside and punch him  all his energies went to the instruction of others leaving none for his own purposes  he would take callow youths to his chambers and teach them to box  now try and hit me on the nose he would say standing before them in an attitude of defence  dont be afraid  hit as hard as ever you can  and they would do it  and so soon as he had recovered from his surprise and a little lessened the bleeding he would explain to them how they had done it all wrong and how easily he could have stopped the blow if they had only hit him properly  twice at golf he lamed himself for over a week showing a novice how to drive and at cricket on one occasion i remember seeing his middle stump go down like a ninepin just as he was explaining to the bowler how to get the balls in straight  after which he had a long argument with the umpire as to whether he was in or out  he has been known during a stormy channel passage to rush excitedly upon the bridge in order to inform the captain that he had just seen a light about two miles away to the left and if he is on the top of an omnibus he generally sits beside the driver and points out to him the various obstacles likely to impede their progress  it was upon an omnibus that my own personal acquaintanceship with him began  i was sitting behind two ladies when the conductor came up to collect fares  one of them handed him a sixpence telling him to take to piccadilly circus which was twopence  no said the other lady to her friend handing the man a shilling i owe you sixpence you give me fourpence and ill pay for the two  the conductor took the shilling punched two twopenny tickets and then stood trying to think it out  thats right said the lady who had spoken last give my friend fourpence  the conductor did so  now you give that fourpence to me  the friend handed it to her  and you she concluded to the conductor give me eightpence then we shall be all right  the conductor doled out to her the eightpencethe sixpence he had taken from the first lady with a penny and two halfpennies out of his own bagdistrustfully and retired muttering something about his duties not including those of a lightning calculator  now said the elder lady to the younger i owe you a shilling  i deemed the incident closed when suddenly a florid gentleman on the opposite seat called out in stentorian tones  hi conductor youve cheated these ladies out of fourpence  oos cheated oo out o fourpence replied the indignant conductor from the top of the steps it was a twopenny fare  two twopences dont make eightpence retorted the florid gentleman hotly  how much did you give the fellow my dear he asked addressing the first of the young ladies  i gave him sixpence replied the lady examining her purse  and then i gave you fourpence you know she added addressing her companion  thats a dear two penoth chimed in a commonlooking man on the seat behind  oh thats impossible dear returned the other because i owed you sixpence to begin with  but i did persisted the first lady  you gave me a shilling said the conductor who had returned pointing an accusing forefinger at the elder of the ladies  the elder lady nodded  and i gave you sixpence and two pennies didnt i  the lady admitted it  an i give erhe pointed towards the younger ladyfourpence didnt i  which i gave you you know dear remarked the younger lady  blow me if it aint me as as been cheated out of the fourpence cried the conductor  but said the florid gentleman the other lady gave you sixpence  which i give to er replied the conductor again pointing the finger of accusation at the elder lady  you can search my bag if yer like  i aint got a bloomin sixpence on me  by this time everybody had forgotten what they had done and contradicted themselves and one another  the florid man took it upon himself to put everybody right with the result that before piccadilly circus was reached three passengers had threatened to report the conductor for unbecoming language  the conductor had called a policeman and had taken the names and addresses of the two ladies intending to sue them for the fourpence which they wanted to pay but which the florid man would not allow them to do the younger lady had become convinced that the elder lady had meant to cheat her and the elder lady was in tears  the florid gentleman and myself continued to charing cross station  at the booking office window it transpired that we were bound for the same suburb and we journeyed down together  he talked about the fourpence all the way  at my gate we shook hands and he was good enough to express delight at the discovery that we were near neighbours  what attracted him to myself i failed to understand for he had bored me considerably and i had to the best of my ability snubbed him  subsequently i learned that it was a peculiarity of his to be charmed with anyone who did not openly insult him  three days afterwards he burst into my study unannouncedhe appeared to regard himself as my bosom friendand asked me to forgive him for not having called sooner which i did  i met the postman as i was coming along he said handing me a blue envelope and he gave me this for you  i saw it was an application for the waterrate  we must make a stand against this he continued  thats for water to the 29th september  youve no right to pay it in june  i replied to the effect that waterrates had to be paid and that it seemed to me immaterial whether they were paid in june or september  thats not it he answered its the principle of the thing  why should you pay for water you have never had  what right have they to bully you into paying what you dont owe  he was a fluent talker and i was ass enough to listen to him  by the end of half an hour he had persuaded me that the question was bound up with the inalienable rights of man and that if i paid that fourteen and tenpence in june instead of in september i should be unworthy of the privileges my forefathers had fought and died to bestow upon me  he told me the company had not a leg to stand upon and at his instigation i sat down and wrote an insulting letter to the chairman  the secretary replied that having regard to the attitude i had taken up it would be incumbent upon themselves to treat it as a test case and presumed that my solicitors would accept service on my behalf  when i showed him this letter he was delighted  you leave it to me he said pocketing the correspondence and well teach them a lesson  i left it to him  my only excuse is that at the time i was immersed in the writing of what in those days was termed a comedydrama  the little sense i possessed must i suppose have been absorbed by the play  the magistrates decision somewhat damped my ardour but only inflamed his zeal  magistrates he said were muddleheaded old fogies  this was a matter for a judge  the judge was a kindly old gentleman and said that bearing in mind the unsatisfactory wording of the subclause he did not think he could allow the company their costs so that all told i got off for something under fifty pounds inclusive of the original fourteen and tenpence  afterwards our friendship waned but living as we did in the same outlying suburb i was bound to see a good deal of him and to hear more  at parties of all kinds he was particularly prominent and on such occasions being in his most goodnatured mood was most to be dreaded no human being worked harder for the enjoyment of others or produced more universal wretchedness  one christmas afternoon calling upon a friend i found some fourteen or fifteen elderly ladies and gentlemen trotting solemnly round a row of chairs in the centre of the drawingroom while poppleton played the piano  every now and then poppleton would suddenly cease and everyone would drop wearily into the nearest chair evidently glad of a rest all but one who would thereupon creep quietly away followed by the envying looks of those left behind  i stood by the door watching the weird scene  presently an escaped player came towards me and i enquired of him what the ceremony was supposed to signify  dont ask me he answered grumpily  some of poppletons damned tomfoolery  then he added savagely weve got to play forfeits after this  the servant was still waiting a favourable opportunity to announce me  i gave her a shilling not to and got away unperceived  after a satisfactory dinner he would suggest an impromptu dance and want you to roll up mats or help him move the piano to the other end of the room  he knew enough round games to have started a small purgatory of his own just as you were in the middle of an interesting discussion or a delightful teteatete with a pretty woman he would swoop down upon you with come along were going to play literary consequences and dragging you to the table and putting a piece of paper and a pencil before you would tell you to write a description of your favourite heroine in fiction and would see that you did it  he never spared himself  it was always he who would volunteer to escort the old ladies to the station and who would never leave them until he had seen them safely into the wrong train  he it was who would play wild beasts with the children and frighten them into fits that would last all night  so far as intention went he was the kindest man alive  he never visited poor sick persons without taking with him in his pocket some little delicacy calculated to disagree with them and make them worse  he arranged yachting excursions for bad sailors entirely at his own expense and seemed to regard their subsequent agonies as ingratitude  he loved to manage a wedding  once he planned matters so that the bride arrived at the altar threequarters of an hour before the groom which led to unpleasantness upon a day that should have been filled only with joy and once he forgot the clergyman  but he was always ready to admit when he made a mistake  at funerals also he was to the fore pointing out to the griefstricken relatives how much better it was for all concerned that the corpse was dead and expressing a pious hope that they would soon join it  the chiefest delight of his life however was to be mixed up in other peoples domestic quarrels  no domestic quarrel for miles round was complete without him  he generally came in as mediator and finished as leading witness for the appellant  as a journalist or politician his wonderful grasp of other peoples business would have won for him esteem  the error he made was working it out in practice     the man who lived for others   the first time we met to speak he was sitting with his back against a pollard willow smoking a clay pipe  he smoked it very slowly but very conscientiously  after each whiff he removed the pipe from his mouth and fanned away the smoke with his cap  feeling bad i asked from behind a tree at the same time making ready for a run big boys answers to small boys impertinences being usually of the nature of things best avoided  to my surprise and relieffor at second glance i perceived i had under estimated the length of his legshe appeared to regard the question as a natural and proper one replying with unaffected candour not yet  my desire became to comfort hima sentiment i think he understood and was grateful for  advancing into the open i sat down over against him and watched him for a while in silence  presently he said  have you ever tried drinking beer  i admitted i had not  oh it is beastly stuff he rejoined with an involuntary shudder  rendered forgetful of present trouble by bitter recollection of the past he puffed away at his pipe carelessly and without judgment  do you often drink it i inquired  yes he replied gloomily all we fellows in the fifth form drink beer and smoke pipes  a deeper tinge of green spread itself over his face  he rose suddenly and made towards the hedge  before he reached it however he stopped and addressed me but without turning round  if you follow me young un or look ill punch your head he said swiftly and disappeared with a gurgle  he left at the end of the terms and i did not see him again until we were both young men  then one day i ran against him in oxford street and he asked me to come and spend a few days with his people in surrey  i found him wanlooking and depressed and every now and then he sighed during a walk across the common he cheered up considerably but the moment we got back to the house door he seemed to recollect himself and began to sigh again  he ate no dinner whatever merely sipping a glass of wine and crumbling a piece of bread  i was troubled at noticing this but his relativesa maiden aunt who kept house two elder sisters and a weakeyed female cousin who had left her husband behind her in indiawere evidently charmed  they glanced at each other and nodded and smiled  once in a fit of abstraction he swallowed a bit of crust and immediately they all looked pained and surprised  in the drawingroom under cover of a sentimental song sung by the female cousin i questioned his aunt on the subject  whats the matter with him i said  is he ill  the old lady chuckled  youll be like that one day she whispered gleefully  when i asked not unnaturally alarmed  when youre in love she answered  is he in love i inquired after a pause  cant you see he is she replied somewhat scornfully  i was a young man and interested in the question  wont he ever eat any dinner till hes got over it i asked  she looked round sharply at me but apparently decided that i was only foolish  you wait till your time comes she answered shaking her curls at me you wont care much about your dinnernot if you are really in love  in the night about halfpast eleven i heard as i thought footsteps in the passage and creeping to the door and opening it i saw the figure of my friend in dressinggown and slippers vanishing down the stairs  my idea was that his brain weakened by trouble he had developed sleepwalking tendencies  partly out of curiosity partly to watch over him i slipped on a pair of trousers and followed him  he placed his candle on the kitchen table and made a beeline for the pantry door from where he subsequently emerged with two pounds of cold beef on a plate and about a quart of beer in a jug and i came away leaving him fumbling for pickles  i assisted at his wedding where it seemed to me he endeavoured to display more ecstasy than it was possible for any human being to feel and fifteen months later happening to catch sight of an advertisement in the births column of the times i called on my way home from the city to congratulate him  he was pacing up and down the passage with his hat on pausing at intervals to partake of an uninvitinglooking meal consisting of a cold mutton chop and a glass of lemonade spread out upon a chair  seeing that the cook and the housemaid were wandering about the house evidently bored for want of something to do and that the dining room where he would have been much more out of the way was empty and quite in order i failed at first to understand the reason for his deliberate choice of discomfort  i however kept my reflections to myself and inquired after the mother and child  couldnt be better he replied with a groan  the doctor said hed never had a more satisfactory case in all his experience  oh im glad to hear that i answered i was afraid youd been worrying yourself  worried he exclaimed  my dear boy i dont know whether im standing on my head or my heels he gave one that idea  this is the first morsel of food thats passed my lips for twentyfour hours  at this moment the nurse appeared at the top of the stairs  he flew towards her upsetting the lemonade in his excitement  what is it he asked hoarsely  is it all right  the old lady glanced from him to his cold chop and smiled approvingly  theyre doing splendidly she answered patting him on the shoulder in a motherly fashion  dont you worry  i cant help it mrs jobson he replied sitting down upon the bottom stair and leaning his head against the banisters  of course you cant said mrs jobson admiringly and you wouldnt be much of a man if you could  then it was borne in upon me why he wore his hat and dined off cold chops in the passage  the following summer they rented a picturesque old house in berkshire and invited me down from a saturday to monday  their place was near the river so i slipped a suit of flannels in my bag and on the sunday morning i came down in them  he met me in the garden  he was dressed in a frock coat and a white waistcoat and i noticed that he kept looking at me out of the corner of his eye and that he seemed to have a trouble on his mind  the first breakfast bell rang and then he said you havent got any proper clothes with you have you  proper clothes i exclaimed stopping in some alarm  why has anything given way  no not that he explained  i mean clothes to go to church in  church i said  youre surely not going to church a fine day like this  i made sure youd be playing tennis or going on the river  you always used to  yes he replied nervously flicking a rosebush with a twig he had picked up  you see it isnt ourselves exactly  maud and i would rather like to but our cook shes scotch and a little strict in her notions  and does she insist on your going to church every sunday morning i inquired  well he answered she thinks it strange if we dont and so we generally do just in the morningand evening  and then in the afternoon a few of the village girls drop in and we have a little singing and that sort of thing  i never like hurting anyones feelings if i can help it  i did not say what i thought  instead i said ive got that tweed suit i wore yesterday  i can put that on if you like  he ceased flicking the rosebush and knitted his brows  he seemed to be recalling it to his imagination  no he said shaking his head im afraid it would shock her  its my fault i know he added remorsefully  i ought to have told you  then an idea came to him  i suppose he said you wouldnt care to pretend you were ill and stop in bed just for the day  i explained that my conscience would not permit my being a party to such deception  no i thought you wouldnt he replied  i must explain it to her  i think ill say youve lost your bag  i shouldnt like her to think bad of us  later on a fourteenth cousin died leaving him a large fortune  he purchased an estate in yorkshire and became a county family and then his real troubles began  from may to the middle of august save for a little fly fishing which generally resulted in his getting his feet wet and catching a cold life was fairly peaceful but from early autumn to late spring he found the work decidedly trying  he was a stout man constitutionally nervous of firearms and a sixhours tramp with a heavy gun across ploughed fields in company with a crowd of careless persons who kept blazing away within an inch of other peoples noses harassed and exhausted him  he had to get out of bed at four on chilly october mornings to go cubhunting and twice a week throughout the winterexcept when a blessed frost brought him a brief respitehe had to ride to hounds  that he usually got off with nothing more serious than mere bruises and slight concussions of the spine he probably owed to the fortunate circumstances of his being little and fat  at stiff timber he shut his eyes and rode hard and ten yards from a river he would begin to think about bridges  yet he never complained  if you are a country gentleman he would say you must behave as a country gentleman and take the rough with the smooth  as ill fate would have it a chance speculation doubled his fortune and it became necessary that he should go into parliament and start a yacht parliament made his head ache and the yacht made him sick notwithstanding every summer he would fill it with a lot of expensive people who bored him and sail away for a months misery in the mediterranean  during one cruise his guests built up a highlyinteresting gambling scandal  he himself was confined to his cabin at the time and knew nothing about it but the opposition papers getting hold of the story referred casually to the yacht as a floating hell and the police news awarded his portrait the place of honour as the chief criminal of the week  later on he got into a cultured set ruled by a thicklipped undergraduate  his favourite literature had hitherto been of the corelli and titbits order but now he read meredith and the yellow book and tried to understand them and instead of the gaiety he subscribed to the independent theatre and fed his soul on dutch shakespeares  what he liked in art was a pretty girl by a cottagedoor with an eligible young man in the background or a child and a dog doing something funny  they told him these things were wrong and made him buy impressions that stirred his liver to its deepest depths every time he looked at themgreen cows on red hills by pink moonlight or scarlethaired corpses with three feet of neck  he said meekly that such seemed to him unnatural but they answered that nature had nothing to do with the question that the artist saw things like that and that whatever an artist sawno matter in what condition he may have been when he saw itthat was art  they took him to wagner festivals and burnejoness private views  they read him all the minor poets  they booked seats for him at all ibsens plays  they introduced him into all the most soulful circles of artistic society  his days were one long feast of other peoples enjoyments  one morning i met him coming down the steps of the arts club  he looked weary  he was just off to a private view at the new gallery  in the afternoon he had to attend an amateur performance of the cenci given by the shelley society  then followed three literary and artistic at homes a dinner with an indian nabob who couldnt speak a word of english tristam and isolde at covent garden theatre and a ball at lord salisburys to wind up the day  i laid my hand upon his shoulder  come with me to epping forest i said  theres a fourhorse brake starts from charing cross at eleven  its saturday and theres bound to be a crowd down there  ill play you a game of skittles and we will have a shy at the cocoanuts  you used to be rather smart at cocoanuts we can have lunch there and be back at seven dine at the troc spend the evening at the empire and sup at the savoy  what do you say  he stood hesitating on the steps a wistful look in his eyes  his brougham drew up against the curb and he started as if from a dream  my dear fellow he replied what would people say  and shaking me by the hand he took his seat and the footman slammed the door upon him     a man of habit   there were three of us in the smokeroom of the alexandraa very good friend of mine myself and in the opposite corner a shylooking unobtrusive man the editor as we subsequently learned of a new york sunday paper  my friend and i were discussing habits good and bad  after the first few months said my friend it is no more effort for a man to be a saint than to be a sinner it becomes a mere matter of habit  i know i interrupted it is every whit as easy to spring out of bed the instant you are called as to say all right and turn over for just another five minutes snooze when you have got into the way of it  it is no more trouble not to swear than to swear if you make a custom of it  toast and water is as delicious as champagne when you have acquired the taste for it  things are also just as easy the other way about  it is a mere question of making your choice and sticking to it  he agreed with me  now take these cigars of mine he said pushing his open case towards me  thank you i replied hurriedly im not smoking this passage  dont be alarmed he answered i meant merely as an argument  now one of these would make you wretched for a week  i admitted his premise  very well he continued  now i as you know smoke them all day long and enjoy them  why  because i have got into the habit  years ago when i was a young man i smoked expensive havanas  i found that i was ruining myself  it was absolutely necessary that i should take a cheaper weed  i was living in belgium at the time and a friend showed me these i dont know what they areprobably cabbage leaves soaked in guano they tasted to me like that at firstbut they were cheap  buying them by the five hundred they cost me three a penny  i determined to like them and started with one a day  it was terrible work i admit but as i said to myself nothing could be worse than the havanas themselves had been in the beginning  smoking is an acquired taste and it must be as easy to learn to like one flavour as another  i persevered and i conquered before the year was over i could think of them without loathing at the end of two i could smoke them without positive discomfort  now i prefer them to any other brand on the market  indeed a good cigar disagrees with me  i suggested it might have been less painful to have given up smoking altogether  i did think of it he replied but a man who doesnt smoke always seems to me bad company  there is something very sociable about smoke  he leant back and puffed great clouds into the air filling the small den with an odour suggestive of bilge water and cemeteries  then again he resumed after a pause take my claret  no you dont like it  i had not spoken but my face had evidently betrayed me nobody does at least no one i have ever met  three years ago when i was living in hammersmith we caught two burglars with it  they broke open the sideboard and swallowed five bottlefuls between them  a policeman found them afterwards sitting on a doorstep a hundred yards off the swag beside them in a carpet bag  they were too ill to offer any resistance and went to the station like lambs he promising to send the doctor to them the moment they were safe in the cells  ever since then i have left out a decanterful upon the table every night  well i like that claret and it does me good  i come in sometimes dead beat  i drink a couple of glasses and im a new man  i took to it in the first instance for the same reason that i took to the cigarsit was cheap  i have it sent over direct from geneva and it costs me six shillings a dozen  how they do it i dont know  i dont want to know as you may remember its fairly heady and theres body in it  i knew one man he continued who had a regular mrs caudle of a wife all day long she talked to him or at him or of him and at night he fell asleep to the rising and falling rhythm of what she thought about him  at last she died and his friends congratulated him telling him that now he would enjoy peace  but it was the peace of the desert and the man did not enjoy it  for twoandtwenty years her voice had filled the house penetrated through the conservatory and floated in faint shrilly waves of sound round the garden and out into the road beyond the silence now pervading everywhere frightened and disturbed him  the place was no longer home to him  he missed the breezy morning insult the long winter evenings reproaches beside the flickering fire  at night he could not sleep  for hours he would lie tossing restlessly his ears aching for the accustomed soothing flow of invective  ah he would cry bitterly to himself it is the old story we never know the value of a thing until we have lost it  he grew ill  the doctors dosed him with sleeping draughts in vain  at last they told him bluntly that his life depended upon his finding another wife able and willing to nag him to sleep  there were plenty of wives of the type he wanted in the neighbourhood but the unmarried women were of necessity inexperienced and his health was such that he could not afford the time to train them  fortunately just as despair was about to take possession of him a man died in the next parish literally talked to death the gossip said by his wife  he obtained an introduction and called upon her the day after the funeral  she was a cantankerous old woman and the wooing was a harassing affair but his heart was in his work and before six months were gone he had won her for his own  she proved however but a poor substitute  the spirit was willing but the flesh was weak  she had neither that command of language nor of wind that had distinguished her rival  from his favourite seat at the bottom of the garden he could not hear her at all so he had his chair brought up into the conservatory  it was all right for him there so long as she continued to abuse him but every now and again just as he was getting comfortably settled down with his pipe and his newspaper she would suddenly stop  he would drop his paper and sit listening with a troubled anxious expression  are you there dear he would call out after a while  yes im here  where do you think i am you old fool she would gasp back in an exhausted voice  his face would brighten at the sound of her words  go on dear he would answer  im listening  i like to hear you talk  but the poor woman was utterly pumped out and had not so much as a snort left  then he would shake his head sadly  no she hasnt poor dear susans flow he would say  ah what a woman that was  at night she would do her best but it was a lame and halting performance by comparison  after rating him for little over threequarters of an hour she would sink back on the pillow and want to go to sleep  but he would shake her gently by the shoulder  yes dear he would say you were speaking about jane and the way i kept looking at her during lunch  its extraordinary concluded my friend lighting a fresh cigar what creatures of habit we are  very i replied  i knew a man who told tall stories till when he told a true one nobody believed it  ah that was a very sad case said my friend  speaking of habit said the unobtrusive man in the corner i can tell you a true story that ill bet my bottom dollar you wont believe  havent got a bottom dollar but ill bet you half a sovereign i do replied my friend who was of a sporting turn  who shall be judge  ill take your word for it said the unobtrusive man and started straight away        he was a jefferson man this man im going to tell you of he begun he was born in the town and for fortyseven years he never slept a night outside it  he was a most respectable mana drysalter from nine to four and a presbyterian in his leisure moments  he said that a good life merely meant good habits  he rose at seven had family prayer at seventhirty breakfasted at eight got to his business at nine had his horse brought round to the office at four and rode for an hour reached home at five had a bath and a cup of tea played with and read to the children he was a domesticated man till halfpast six dressed and dined at seven went round to the club and played whist till quarter after ten home again to evening prayer at tenthirty and bed at eleven for fiveandtwenty years he lived that life with never a variation  it worked into his system and became mechanical  the church clocks were set by him  he was used by the local astronomers to check the sun  one day a distant connection of his in london an east indian merchant and an exlord mayor died leaving him sole legatee and executor  the business was a complicated one and needed management  he determined to leave his son by his first wife now a young man of twentyfour in charge at jefferson and to establish himself with his second family in england and look after the east indian business  he set out from jefferson city on october the fourth and arrived in london on the seventeenth  he had been ill during the whole of the voyage and he reached the furnished house he had hired in bayswater somewhat of a wreck  a couple of days in bed however pulled him round and on the wednesday evening he announced his intention of going into the city the next day to see to his affairs  on the thursday morning he awoke at one oclock  his wife told him she had not disturbed him thinking the sleep would do him good  he admitted that perhaps it had  anyhow he felt very well and he got up and dressed himself  he said he did not like the idea of beginning his first day by neglecting a religious duty and his wife agreeing with him they assembled the servants and the children in the diningroom and had family prayer at halfpast one  after which he breakfasted and set off reaching the city about three  his reputation for punctuality had preceded him and surprise was everywhere expressed at his late arrival  he explained the circumstances however and made his appointments for the following day to commence from ninethirty  he remained at the office until late and then went home  for dinner usually the chief meal of the day he could manage to eat only a biscuit and some fruit  he attributed his loss of appetite to want of his customary ride  he was strangely unsettled all the evening  he said he supposed he missed his game of whist and determined to look about him without loss of time for some quiet respectable club  at eleven he retired with his wife to bed but could not sleep  he tossed and turned and turned and tossed but grew only more and more wakeful and energetic a little after midnight an overpowering desire seized him to go and wish the children goodnight  he slipped on a dressinggown and stole into the nursery  he did not intend it but the opening of the door awoke them and he was glad  he wrapped them up in the quilt and sitting on the edge of the bed told them moral stories till one oclock  then he kissed them bidding them be good and go to sleep and finding himself painfully hungry crept downstairs where in the back kitchen he made a hearty meal off cold game pie and cucumber  he retired to bed feeling more peaceful yet still could not sleep so lay thinking about his business affairs till five when he dropped off  at one oclock to the minute he awoke  his wife told him she had made every endeavour to rouse him but in vain  the man was vexed and irritated  if he had not been a very good man indeed i believe he would have sworn  the same programme was repeated as on the thursday and again he reached the city at three  this state of things went on for a month  the man fought against himself but was unable to alter himself  every morning or rather every afternoon at one he awoke  every night at one he crept down into the kitchen and foraged for food  every morning at five he fell asleep  he could not understand it nobody could understand it  the doctor treated him for water on the brain hypnotic irresponsibility and hereditary lunacy  meanwhile his business suffered and his health grew worse  he seemed to be living upside down  his days seemed to have neither beginning nor end but to be all middle  there was no time for exercise or recreation  when he began to feel cheerful and sociable everybody else was asleep  one day by chance the explanation came  his eldest daughter was preparing her home studies after dinner  what time is it now in new york she asked looking up from her geography book  new york said her father glancing at his watch let me see  its just ten now and theres a little over four and a half hours difference  oh about halfpast five in the afternoon  then in jefferson said the mother it would be still earlier wouldnt it  yes replied the girl examining the map jefferson is nearly two degrees further west  two degrees mused the father and theres forty minutes to a degree that would make it now at the present moment in jefferson  he leaped to his feet with a cry  ive got it he shouted i see it  see what asked his wife alarmed  why its four oclock in jefferson and just time for my ride  thats what im wanting  there could be no doubt about it  for fiveandtwenty years he had lived by clockwork  but it was by jefferson clockwork not london clockwork  he had changed his longitude but not himself  the habits of a quarter of a century were not to be shifted at the bidding of the sun  he examined the problem in all its bearings and decided that the only solution was for him to return to the order of his old life  he saw the difficulties in his way but they were less than those he was at present encountering  he was too formed by habit to adapt himself to circumstances  circumstances must adapt themselves to him  he fixed his office hours from three till ten leaving himself at half past nine  at ten he mounted his horse and went for a canter in the row and on very dark nights he carried a lantern  news of it got abroad and crowds would assemble to see him ride past  he dined at one oclock in the morning and afterwards strolled down to his club  he had tried to discover a quiet respectable club where the members were willing to play whist till four in the morning but failing had been compelled to join a small soho gamblinghell where they taught him poker  the place was occasionally raided by the police but thanks to his respectable appearance he generally managed to escape  at halfpast four he returned home and woke up the family for evening prayers  at five he went to bed and slept like a top  the city chaffed him and bayswater shook its head over him but that he did not mind  the only thing that really troubled him was loss of spiritual communion  at five oclock on sunday afternoons he felt he wanted chapel but had to do without it  at seven he ate his simple mid day meal  at eleven he had tea and muffins and at midnight he began to crave again for hymns and sermons  at three he had a breadandcheese supper and retired early at four am feeling sad and unsatisfied  he was essentially a man of habit        the unobtrusive stranger ceased and we sat gazing in silence at the ceiling  at length my friend rose and taking halfasovereign from his pocket laid it upon the table and linking his arm in mine went out with me upon the deck     the absentminded man   you ask him to dine with you on thursday to meet a few people who are anxious to know him  now dont make a muddle of it you say recollectful of former mishaps and come on the wednesday  he laughs goodnaturedly as he hunts through the room for his diary  shant be able to come wednesday he says shall be at the mansion house sketching dresses and on friday i start for scotland so as to be at the opening of the exhibition on saturday  its bound to be all right this time  where the deuce is that diary  never mind ill make a note of it on thisyou can see me do it  you stand over him while he writes the appointment down on a sheet of foolscap and watch him pin it up over his desk  then you come away contented  i do hope hell turn up you say to your wife on the thursday evening while dressing  are you sure you made it clear to him she replies suspiciously and you instinctively feel that whatever happens she is going to blame you for it  eight oclock arrives and with it the other guests  at halfpast eight your wife is beckoned mysteriously out of the room where the parlour maid informs her that the cook has expressed a determination in case of further delay to wash her hands figuratively speaking of the whole affair  your wife returning suggests that if the dinner is to be eaten at all it had better be begun  she evidently considers that in pretending to expect him you have been merely playing a part and that it would have been manlier and more straightforward for you to have admitted at the beginning that you had forgotten to invite him  during the soup and the fish you recount anecdotes of his unpunctuality by the time the entree arrives the empty chair has begun to cast a gloom over the dinner and with the joint the conversation drifts into talk about dead relatives  on friday at a quarter past eight he dashes to the door and rings violently  hearing his voice in the hall you go to meet him  sorry im late he sings out cheerily  fool of a cabman took me to alfred place instead of  well what do you want now you are come you interrupt feeling anything but genially inclined towards him  he is an old friend so you can be rude to him  he laughs and slaps you on the shoulder  why my dinner my dear boy im starving  oh you grunt in reply  well you go and get it somewhere else then youre not going to have it here  what the devil do you mean he says  you asked me to dinner  i did nothing of the kind you tell him  i asked you to dinner on thursday not on friday  he stares at you incredulously  how did i get friday fixed in my mind inquiringly  because yours is the sort of mind that would get friday firmly fixed into it when thursday was the day you explain  i thought you had to be off to edinburgh tonight you add  great scott he cries so i have  and without another word he dashes out and you hear him rushing down the road shouting for the cab he has just dismissed  as you return to your study you reflect that he will have to travel all the way to scotland in evening dress and will have to send out the hotel porter in the morning to buy him a suit of readymade clothes and are glad  matters work out still more awkwardly when it is he who is the host  i remember being with him on his houseboat one day  it was a little after twelve and we were sitting on the edge of the boat dangling our feet in the riverthe spot was a lonely one halfway between wallingford and days lock  suddenly round the bend appeared two skiffs each one containing six elaboratelydressed persons  as soon as they caught sight of us they began waving handkerchiefs and parasols  hullo i said heres some people hailing you  oh they all do that about here he answered without looking up  some beanfeast from abingdon i expect  the boats draw nearer  when about two hundred yards off an elderly gentleman raised himself up in the prow of the leading one and shouted to us  mcquae heard his voice and gave a start that all but pitched him into the water  good god he cried id forgotten all about it  about what i asked  why its the palmers and the grahams and the hendersons  ive asked them all over to lunch and theres not a blessed thing on board but two mutton chops and a pound of potatoes and ive given the boy a holiday  another day i was lunching with him at the junior hogarth when a man named hallyard a mutual friend strolled across to us  what are you fellows going to do this afternoon he asked seating himself the opposite side of the table  im going to stop here and write letters i answered  come with me if you want something to do said mcquae  im going to drive leena down to richmond  leena was the young lady he recollected being engaged to  it transpired afterwards that he was engaged to three girls at the time  the other two he had forgotten all about  its a roomy seat at the back  oh all right said hallyard and they went away together in a hansom  an hour and a half later hallyard walked into the smokingroom looking depressed and worn and flung himself into a chair  i thought you were going to richmond with mcquae i said  so did i he answered  had an accident i asked  yes  he was decidedly curt in his replies  cart upset i continued  no only me  his grammar and his nerves seemed thoroughly shaken  i waited for an explanation and after a while he gave it  we got to putney he said with just an occasional run into a tram car and were going up the hill when suddenly he turned a corner  you know his style at a cornerover the curb across the road and into the opposite lamppost  of course as a rule one is prepared for it but i never reckoned on his turning up there and the first thing i recollect is finding myself sitting in the middle of the street with a dozen fools grinning at me  it takes a man a few minutes in such a case to think where he is and what has happened and when i got up they were some distance away  i ran after them for a quarter of a mile shouting at the top of my voice and accompanied by a mob of boys all yelling like hell on a bank holiday but one might as well have tried to hail the dead so i took the bus back  they might have guessed what had happened he added by the shifting of the cart if theyd had any sense  im not a lightweight  he complained of soreness and said he would go home  i suggested a cab but he replied that he would rather walk  i met mcquae in the evening at the st jamess theatre  it was a first night and he was taking sketches for the graphic  the moment he saw me he made his way across to me  the very man i wanted to see he said  did i take hallyard with me in the cart to richmond this afternoon  you did i replied  so leena says he answered greatly bewildered but ill swear he wasnt there when we got to the queens hotel  its all right i said you dropped him at putney  dropped him at putney he repeated  ive no recollection of doing so  he has i answered  you ask him about it  hes full of it  everybody said he never would get married that it was absurd to suppose he ever would remember the day the church and the girl all in one morning that if he did get as far as the altar he would forget what he had come for and would give the bride away to his own best man  hallyard had an idea that he was already married but that the fact had slipped his memory  i myself felt sure that if he did marry he would forget all about it the next day  but everybody was wrong  by some miraculous means the ceremony got itself accomplished so that if hallyards idea be correct as to which there is every possibility there will be trouble  as for my own fears i dismissed them the moment i saw the lady  she was a charming cheerful little woman but did not look the type that would let him forget all about it  i had not seen him since his marriage which had happened in the spring working my way back from scotland by easy stages i stopped for a few days at scarboro  after table dhote i put on my mackintosh and went out for a walk  it was raining hard but after a month in scotland one does not notice english weather and i wanted some air  struggling along the dark beach with my head against the wind i stumbled over a crouching figure seeking to shelter itself a little from the storm under the lee of the spa wall  i expected it to swear at me but it seemed too brokenspirited to mind anything  i beg your pardon i said  i did not see you  at the sound of my voice it started to its feet  is that you old man it cried  mcquae i exclaimed  by jove he said i was never so glad to see a man in all my life before  and he nearly shook my hand off  but what in thunder i said are you doing here  why youre drenched to the skin  he was dressed in flannels and a tenniscoat  yes he answered  i never thought it would rain  it was a lovely morning  i began to fear he had overworked himself into a brain fever  why dont you go home i asked  i cant he replied  i dont know where i live  ive forgotten the address  for heavens sake he said take me somewhere and give me something to eat  im literally starving  havent you any money i asked him as we turned towards the hotel  not a sou he answered  we got in here from york the wife and i about eleven  we left our things at the station and started to hunt for apartments  as soon as we were fixed i changed my clothes and came out for a walk telling maud i should be back at one to lunch  like a fool i never took the address and never noticed the way i was going  its an awful business he continued  i dont see how im ever going to find her  i hoped she might stroll down to the spa in the evening and ive been hanging about the gates ever since six  i hadnt the threepence to go in  but have you no notion of the sort of street or the kind of house it was i enquired  not a ghost he replied  i left it all to maud and didnt trouble  have you tried any of the lodginghouses i asked  tried he exclaimed bitterly  ive been knocking at doors and asking if mrs mcquae lives there steadily all the afternoon and they slam the door in my face mostly without answering  i told a policemani thought perhaps he might suggest somethingbut the idiot only burst out laughing and that made me so mad that i gave him a black eye and had to cut  i expect theyre on the lookout for me now  i went into a restaurant he continued gloomily and tried to get them to trust me for a steak  but the proprietress said shed heard that tale before and ordered me out before all the other customers  i think id have drowned myself if you hadnt turned up  after a change of clothes and some supper he discussed the case more calmly but it was really a serious affair  they had shut up their flat and his wifes relatives were travelling abroad  there was no one to whom he could send a letter to be forwarded there was no one with whom she would be likely to communicate  their chance of meeting again in this world appeared remote  nor did it seem to mefond as he was of his wife and anxious as he undoubtedly was to recover herthat he looked forward to the actual meeting should it ever arrive with any too pleasurable anticipation  she will think it strange he murmured reflectively sitting on the edge of the bed and thoughtfully pulling off his socks  she is sure to think it strange  the following day which was wednesday we went to a solicitor and laid the case before him and he instituted inquiries among all the lodging house keepers in scarborough with the result that on thursday afternoon mcquae was restored after the manner of an adelphi hero in the last act to his home and wife  i asked him next time i met him what she had said  oh much what i expected he replied  but he never told me what he had expected     a charming woman   not the mr  really  in her deep brown eyes there lurked pleased surprise struggling with wonder  she looked from myself to the friend who introduced us with a bewitching smile of incredulity tempered by hope  he assured her adding laughingly the only genuine and original and left us  ive always thought of you as a staid middleaged man she said with a delicious little laugh then added in low soft tones im so very pleased to meet you really  the words were conventional but her voice crept round one like a warm caress  come and talk to me she said seating herself upon a small settee and making room for me  i sat down awkwardly beside her my head buzzing just a little as with one glass too many of champagne  i was in my literary childhood  one small book and a few essays and criticisms scattered through various obscure periodicals had been as yet my only contributions to current literature  the sudden discovery that i was the mr anybody and that charming women thought of me and were delighted to meet me was a brain disturbing thought  and it was really you who wrote that clever book she continued and all those brilliant things in the magazines and journals  oh it must be delightful to be clever  she gave breath to a little sigh of vain regret that went to my heart  to console her i commenced a laboured compliment but she stopped me with her fan  on after reflection i was glad she hadit would have been one of those things better expressed otherwise  i know what you are going to say she laughed but dont  besides from you i should not know quite how to take it  you can be so satirical  i tried to look as though i could be but in her case would not  she let her ungloved hand rest for an instant upon mine  had she left it there for two i should have gone down on my knees before her or have stood on my head at her feethave made a fool of myself in some way or another before the whole room full  she timed it to a nicety  i dont want you to pay me compliments she said i want us to be friends  of course in years im old enough to be your mother  by the register i should say she might have been thirtytwo but looked twentysix  i was twentythree and i fear foolish for my age  but you know the world and youre so different to the other people one meets  society is so hollow and artificial dont you find it so  you dont know how i long sometimes to get away from it to know someone to whom i could show my real self who would understand me  youll come and see me sometimesim always at home on wednesdaysand let me talk to you wont you and you must tell me all your clever thoughts  it occurred to me that maybe she would like to hear a few of them there and then but before i had got well started a hollow society man came up and suggested supper and she was compelled to leave me  as she disappeared however in the throng she looked back over her shoulder with a glance half pathetic half comic that i understood  it said pity me ive got to be bored by this vapid shallow creature and i did  i sought her through all the rooms before i went  i wished to assure her of my sympathy and support  i learned however from the butler that she had left early in company with the hollow society man  a fortnight later i ran against a young literary friend in regent street and we lunched together at the monico  i met such a charming woman last night he said a mrs clifton courtenay a delightful woman  oh do you know her i exclaimed  oh were very old friends  shes always wanting me to go and see her  i really must  oh i didnt know you knew her he answered  somehow the fact of my knowing her seemed to lessen her importance in his eyes  but soon he recovered his enthusiasm for her  a wonderfully clever woman he continued  im afraid i disappointed her a little though  he said this however with a laugh that contradicted his words  she would not believe i was the mr smith she imagined from my book that i was quite an old man  i could see nothing in my friends book myself to suggest that the author was of necessity anything over eighteen  the mistake appeared to me to display want of acumen but it had evidently pleased him greatly  i felt quite sorry for her he went on chained to that bloodless artificial society in which she lives  you cant tell she said to me how i long to meet someone to whom i could show my real selfwho would understand me  im going to see her on wednesday  i went with him  my conversation with her was not as confidential as i had anticipated owing to there being some eighty other people present in a room intended for the accommodation of eight but after surging round for an hour in hot and aimless miseryas very young men at such gatherings do knowing as a rule only the man who has brought them and being unable to find himi contrived to get a few words with her  she greeted me with a smile in the light of which i at once forgot my past discomfort and let her fingers rest with delicious pressure for a moment upon mine  how good of you to keep your promise she said  these people have been tiring me so  sit here and tell me all you have been doing  she listened for about ten seconds and then interrupted me with  and that clever friend of yours that you came with  i met him at dear lady lennons last week  has he written anything  i explained to her that he had  tell me about it she said  i get so little time for reading and then i only care to read the books that help me and she gave me a grateful look more eloquent than words  i described the work to her and wishing to do my friend justice i even recited a few of the passages upon which as i knew he especially prided himself  one sentence in particular seemed to lay hold of her  a good womans arms round a mans neck is a lifebelt thrown out to him from heaven  how beautiful she murmured  say it again  i said it again and she repeated it after me  then a noisy old lady swooped down upon her and i drifted away into a corner where i tried to look as if i were enjoying myself and failed  later on feeling it time to go i sought my friend and found him talking to her in a corner  i approached and waited  they were discussing the latest eastend murder  a drunken woman had been killed by her husband a hardworking artizan who had been maddened by the ruin of his home  ah she was saying what power a woman has to drag a man down or lift him up  i never read a case in which a woman is concerned without thinking of those beautiful lines of yours a good womans arms round a mans neck is a lifebelt thrown out to him from heaven        opinions differed concerning her religion and politics  said the low church parson an earnest christian woman sir of that unostentatious type that has always been the bulwark of our church  i am proud to know that woman and i am proud to think that poor words of mine have been the humble instrument to wean that true womans heart from the frivolities of fashion and to fix her thoughts upon higher things  a good churchwoman sir a good churchwoman in the best sense of the word  said the pale aristocraticlooking young abbe to the comtesse the light of oldworld enthusiasm shining from his deepset eyes i have great hopes for our dear friend  she finds it hard to sever the ties of time and love  we are all weak but her heart turns towards our mother church as a child though suckled among strangers yearns after many years for the bosom that has borne it  we have spoken and i even i may be the voice in the wilderness leading the lost sheep back to the fold  said sir harry bennett the great theosophist lecturer writing to a friend a singularly gifted woman and a woman evidently thirsting for the truth  a woman capable of willing her own life  a woman not afraid of thought and reason a lover of wisdom  i have talked much with her at one time or another and i have found her grasp my meaning with a quickness of perception quite unusual in my experience and the arguments i have let fall i am convinced have borne excellent fruit  i look forward to her becoming at no very distant date a valued member of our little band  indeed without betraying confidence i may almost say i regard her conversion as an accomplished fact  colonel maxim always spoke of her as a fair pillar of the state  with the enemy in our midst said the florid old soldier it behoves every true manaye and every true womanto rally to the defence of the country and all honour say i to noble ladies such as mrs clifton courtenay who laying aside their natural shrinking from publicity come forward in such a crisis as the present to combat the forces of disorder and disloyalty now rampant in the land  but some listener would suggest i gathered from young jocelyn that mrs clifton courtenay held somewhat advanced views on social and political questions  jocelyn the colonel would reply with scorn pah  there may have been a short space of time during which the fellows long hair and windy rhetoric impressed her  but i flatter myself ive put my spoke in mr jocelyns wheel  why damme sir shes consented to stand for grand dame of the bermondsey branch of the primrose league next year  whats jocelyn to say to that the scoundrel  what jocelyn said was  i know the woman is weak  but i do not blame her i pity her  when the time comes as soon it will when woman is no longer a puppet dancing to the threads held by some brainless manwhen a woman is not threatened with social ostracism for daring to follow her own conscience instead of that of her nearest male relativethen will be the time to judge her  it is not for me to betray the confidence reposed in me by a suffering woman but you can tell that interesting old fossil colonel maxim that he and the other old women of the bermondsey branch of the primrose league may elect mrs clifton courtenay for their president and make the most of it they have only got the outside of the woman  her heart is beating time to the tramp of an onwardmarching people her souls eyes are straining for the glory of a coming dawn  but they all agreed she was a charming woman     whibleys spirit   i never met it myself but i knew whibley very well indeed so that i came to hear a goodish deal about it  it appeared to be devoted to whibley and whibley was extremely fond of it  personally i am not interested in spirits and no spirit has ever interested itself in me  but i have friends whom they patronise and my mind is quite open on the subject  of whibleys spirit i wish to speak with every possible respect  it was i am willing to admit as hardworking and conscientious a spirit as any one could wish to live with  the only thing i have to say against it is that it had no sense  it came with a carved cabinet that whibley had purchased in wardour street for old oak but which as a matter of fact was chestnut wood manufactured in germany and at first was harmless enough saying nothing but yes or no and that only when spoken to  whibley would amuse himself of an evening asking it questions being careful to choose tolerably simple themes such as are you there to which the spirit would sometimes answer yes and sometimes no  can you hear me  are you happyand so on  the spirit made the cabinet crackthree times for yes and twice for no  now and then it would reply both yes and no to the same question which whibley attributed to overscrupulousness  when nobody asked it anything it would talk to itself repeating yes  no  no  yes over and over again in an aimless lonesome sort of a way that made you feel sorry for it  after a while whibley bought a table and encouraged it to launch out into more active conversation  to please whibley i assisted at some of the earlier seances but during my presence it invariably maintained a reticence bordering on positive dulness  i gathered from whibley that it disliked me thinking that i was unsympathetic  the complaint was unjust i was not unsympathetic at least not at the commencement  i came to hear it talk and i wanted to hear it talk i would have listened to it by the hour  what tired me was its slowness in starting and its foolishness when it had started in using long words that it did not know how to spell  i remember on one occasion whibley jobstock whibleys partner and myself sitting for two hours trying to understand what the thing meant by hesturnemysfear  it used no stops whatever  it never so much as hinted where one sentence ended and another began  it never even told us when it came to a proper name  its idea of an evenings conversation was to plump down a hundred or so vowels and consonants in front of you and leave you to make whatever sense out of them you could  we fancied at first it was talking about somebody named hester it had spelt hester with a u before we allowed a margin for spelling and we tried to work the sentence out on that basis hester enemies fear we thought it might be  whibley had a niece named hester and we decided the warning had reference to her  but whether she was our enemy and we were to fear her or whether we had to fear her enemies and if so who were they or whether it was our enemies who were to be frightened by hester or her enemies or enemies generally still remained doubtful  we asked the table if it meant the first suggestion and it said no  we asked what it did mean and it said yes  this answer annoyed me but whibley explained that the spirit was angry with us for our stupidity which seemed quaint  he informed us that it always said first no and then yes when it was angry and as it was his spirit and we were in his house we kept our feelings to ourselves and started afresh  this time we abandoned the hestur theory altogether  jobstock suggested haste for the first word and thought the spirit might have gone on phonetically  haste you are here miss sfear was what he made of it  whibley asked him sarcastically if hed kindly explain what that meant  i think jobstock was getting irritable  we had been sitting cramped up round a wretched little onelegged table all the evening and this was almost the first bit of gossip we had got out of it  to further excuse him it should also be explained that the gas had been put out by whibley and that the fire had gone out of its own accord  he replied that it was hard labour enough to find out what the thing said without having to make sense of it  it cant spell he added and its got a nasty sulky temper  if it was my spirit id hire another spirit to kick it  whibley was one of the mildest little men i ever knew but chaff or abuse of his spirit roused the devil in him and i feared we were going to have a scene  fortunately i was able to get his mind back to the consideration of hesturnemysfear before anything worse happened than a few muttered remarks about the laughter of fools and want of reverence for sacred subjects being the sign of a shallow mind  we tried hes stern and his turn and the fear of hesturnemy and tried to think who hesturnemy might be  three times we went over the whole thing again from the beginning which meant six hundred and six tiltings of the table and then suddenly the explanation struck meeastern hemisphere  whibley had asked it for any information it might possess concerning his wifes uncle from whom he had not heard for months and that apparently was its idea of an address  the fame of whibleys spirit became noised abroad with the result that whibley was able to command the willing service of more congenial assistants and jobstock and myself were dismissed  but we bore no malice  under these more favourable conditions the spirit plucked up wonderfully and talked everybodys head off  it could never have been a cheerful companion however for its conversation was chiefly confined to warnings and prognostications of evil  about once a fortnight whibley would drop round on me in a friendly way to tell me that i was to beware of a man who lived in a street beginning with a c or to inform me that if i would go to a town on the coast where there were three churches i should meet someone who would do me an irreparable injury and that i did not rush off then and there in search of that town he regarded as flying in the face of providence  in its passion for poking its ghostly nose into other peoples affairs it reminded me of my earthly friend poppleton  nothing pleased it better than being appealed to for aid and advice and whibley who was a perfect slave to it would hunt half over the parish for people in trouble and bring them to it  it would direct ladies eager for divorce court evidence to go to the third house from the corner of the fifth street past such and such a church or publichouse it never would give a plain straightforward address and ring the bottom bell but one twice  they would thank it effusively and next morning would start to find the fifth street past the church and would ring the bottom bell but one of the third house from the corner twice and a man in his shirt sleeves would come to the door and ask them what they wanted  they could not tell what they wanted they did not know themselves and the man would use bad language and slam the door in their faces  then they would think that perhaps the spirit meant the fifth street the other way or the third house from the opposite corner and would try again with still more unpleasant results  one july i met whibley mooning disconsolately along princes street edinburgh  hullo i exclaimed what are you doing here  i thought you were busy over that school board case  yes he answered i ought really to be in london but the truth is im rather expecting something to happen down here  oh i said and whats that  well he replied hesitatingly as though he would rather not talk about it i dont exactly know yet  youve come from london to edinburgh and dont know what youve come for i cried  well you see he said still more reluctantly as it seemed to me it was marias idea she wished  maria i interrupted looking perhaps a little sternly at him whos maria  his wifes name i knew was emily georgina anne  oh  i forgot he explained she never would tell her name before you would she  its the spirit you know  oh that i said its she that has sent you here  didnt she tell you what for  no he answered thats what worries me  all she would say was go to edinburghsomething will happen  and how long are you going to remain here i inquired  i dont know he replied  ive been here a week already and jobstock writes quite angrily  i wouldnt have come if maria hadnt been so urgent  she repeated it three evenings running  i hardly knew what to do  the little man was so dreadfully in earnest about the business that one could not argue much with him  you are sure i said after thinking a while that this maria is a good spirit  there are all sorts going about im told  youre sure this isnt the spirit of some deceased lunatic playing the fool with you  ive thought of that he admitted  of course that might be so  if nothing happens soon i shall almost begin to suspect it  well i should certainly make some inquiries into its character before i trusted it any further i answered and left him  about a month later i ran against him outside the law courts  it was all right about maria something did happen in edinburgh while i was there  that very morning i met you one of my oldest clients died quite suddenly at his house at queensferry only a few miles outside the city  im glad of that i answered i mean of course for marias sake  it was lucky you went then  well not altogether he replied at least not in a worldly sense  he left his affairs in a very complicated state and his eldest son went straight up to london to consult me about them and not finding me there and time being important went to kebble  i was rather disappointed when i got back and heard about it  umph i said shes not a smart spirit anyway  no he answered perhaps not  but you see something did really happen  after that his affection for maria increased tenfold while her attachment to himself became a burden to his friends  she grew too big for her table and dispensing with all mechanical intermediaries talked to him direct  she followed him everywhere  marys lamb couldnt have been a bigger nuisance  she would even go with him into the bedroom and carry on long conversations with him in the middle of the night  his wife objected she said it seemed hardly decent but there was no keeping her out  she turned up with him at picnics and christmas parties  nobody heard her speak to him but it seemed necessary for him to reply to her aloud and to see him suddenly get up from his chair and slip away to talk earnestly to nothing in a corner disturbed the festivities  i should really be glad he once confessed to me to get a little time to myself  she means kindly but it is a strain  and then the others dont like it  it makes them nervous  i can see it does  one evening she caused quite a scene at the club  whibley had been playing whist with the major for a partner  at the end of the game the major leaning across the table toward him asked in a tone of deadly calm may i inquire sir whether there was any earthly reason he emphasised earthly for your following my lead of spades with your only trump  iiam very sorry major replied whibley apologetically iisomehow felt ii ought to play that queen  entirely your own inspiration or suggested persisted the major who had of course heard of maria  whibley admitted the play had been suggested to him  the major rose from the table  then sir said he with concentrated indignation i decline to continue this game  a human fool i can tolerate for a partner but if i am to be hampered by a damned spirit  youve no right to say that cried whibley hotly  i apologise returned the major coldly we will say a blessed spirit i decline to play whist with spirits of any kind and i advise you sir if you intend giving many exhibitions with the lady first to teach her the rudiments of the game  saying which the major put on his hat and left the club and i made whibley drink a stiff glass of brandy and water and sent him and maria home in a cab  whibley got rid of maria at last  it cost him in round figures about eight thousand pounds but his family said it was worth it  a spanish count hired a furnished house a few doors from whibleys and one evening he was introduced to whibley and came home and had a chat with him  whibley told him about maria and the count quite fell in love with her  he said that if only he had had such a spirit to help and advise him it might have altered his whole life  he was the first man who had ever said a kind word about the spirit and whibley loved him for it  the count seemed as though he could never see enough of whibley after that evening and the three of themwhibley the count and mariawould sit up half the night talking together  the precise particulars i never heard  whibley was always very reticent on the matter  whether maria really did exist and the count deliberately set to work to bamboozle her she was fool enough for anything or whether she was a mere hallucination of whibleys and the man tricked whibley by hypnotic suggestions as i believe it is called i am not prepared to say  the only thing certain is that maria convinced whibley that the count had discovered a secret gold mine in peru  she said she knew all about it and counselled whibley to beg the count to let him put a few thousands into the working of it maria it appeared had known the count from his boyhood and could answer for it that he was the most honourable man in all south america possibly enough he was  the count was astonished to find that whibley knew all about his mine eight thousand pounds was needed to start the workings but he had not mentioned it to any one as he wanted to keep the whole thing to himself and thought he could save the money on his estates in portugal  however to oblige maria he would let whibley supply the money  whibley supplied itin cash and no one has ever seen the count since  that broke up whibleys faith in maria and a sensible doctor getting hold of him threatened to prescribe a lunatic asylum for him if ever he found him carrying on with any spirits again  that completed the cure     the man who went wrong   i first met jack burridge nearly ten years ago on a certain northcountry racecourse  the saddling bell had just rung for the chief event of the day  i was sauntering along with my hands in my pockets more interested in the crowd than in the race when a sporting friend crossing on his way to the paddock seized me by the arm and whispered hoarsely in my ear  put your shirt on mrs waller  put my i began  put your shirt on mrs waller he repeated still more impressively and disappeared in the throng  i stared after him in blank amazement  why should i put my shirt on mrs waller  even if it would fit a lady  and how about myself  i was passing the grand stand and glancing up i saw mrs waller twelve to one chalked on a bookmakers board  then it dawned upon me that mrs waller was a horse and thinking further upon the matter i evolved the idea that my friends advice expressed in more becoming language was back mrs waller for as much as you can possibly afford  thank you i said to myself i have backed castiron certainties before  next time i bet upon a horse i shall make the selection by shutting my eyes and putting a pin through the card  but the seed had taken root  my friends words surged in my brain  the birds passing overhead twittered put your shirt on mrs waller  i reasoned with myself  i reminded myself of my few former ventures  but the craving to put if not my shirt at all events half a sovereign on mrs waller only grew the stronger the more strongly i battled against it  i felt that if mrs waller won and i had nothing on her i should reproach myself to my dying day  i was on the other side of the course  there was no time to get back to the enclosure  the horses were already forming for the start  a few yards off under a white umbrella an outside bookmaker was shouting his final prices in stentorian tones  he was a big geniallooking man with an honest red face  what price mrs waller i asked him  fourteen to one he answered and good luck to you  i handed him half a sovereign and he wrote me out a ticket  i crammed it into my waistcoat pocket and hurried off to see the race  to my intense astonishment mrs waller won  the novel sensation of having backed the winner so excited me that i forgot all about my money and it was not until a good hour afterwards that i recollected my bet  then i started off to search for the man under the white umbrella  i went to where i thought i had left him but no white umbrella could i find  consoling myself with the reflection that my loss served me right for having been fool enough to trust an outside bookie i turned on my heel and began to make my way back to my seat  suddenly a voice hailed me  here you are sir  its jack burridge you want  over here sir  i looked round and there was jack burridge at my elbow  i saw you looking about sir he said but i could not make you hear you was looking the wrong side of the tent  it was pleasant to find that his honest face had not belied him  it is very good of you i said i had given up all hopes of seeing you  or i added with a smile my seven pounds  seven pun ten he corrected me youre forgetting your own thin un  he handed me the money and went back to his stand  on my way into the town i came across him again  a small crowd was collected thoughtfully watching a tramp knocking about a miserablelooking woman  jack pushing to the front took in the scene and took off his coat in the same instant  now then my fine old english gentleman he sang out come and have a try at me for a change  the tramp was a burly ruffian and i have seen better boxers than jack he got himself a black eye and a nasty cut over the lip before he hardly knew where he was  but in spite of thatand a good deal morehe stuck to his man and finished him  at the end as he helped his adversary up i heard him say to the fellow in a kindly whisper  youre too good a sort you know to whollop a woman  why you very near give me a licking  you must have forgot yourself matey  the fellow interested me  i waited and walked on with him  he told me about his home in london at mile endabout his old father and mother his little brothers and sistersand what he was saving up to do for them  kindliness oozed from every pore in his skin  many that we met knew him and all when they saw his round red face smiled unconsciously  at the corner of the high street a palefaced little drudge of a girl passed us saying as she slipped by goodevening mr burridge  he made a dart and caught her by the shoulder  and how is father he asked  oh if you please mr burridge he is out again  all the mills is closed answered the child  and mother  she dont get no better sir  and whos keeping you all  oh if you please sir jimmys earning something now replied the mite  he took a couple of sovereigns from his waistcoat pocket and closed the childs hand upon them  thats all right my lass thats all right he said stopping her stammering thanks  you write to me if things dont get better  you know where to find jack burridge  strolling about the streets in the evening i happened to pass the inn where he was staying  the parlour window was open and out into the misty night his deep cheery voice trolling forth an oldfashioned drinking song came rolling like a wind cleansing the corners of ones heart with its breezy humanness  he was sitting at the head of the table surrounded by a crowd of jovial cronies  i lingered for a while watching the scene  it made the world appear a less sombre dwellingplace than i had sometimes pictured it  i determined on my return to london to look him up and accordingly one evening started to find the little bystreet off the mile end road in which he lived  as i turned the corner he drove up in his dogcart it was a smart turnout  on the seat beside him sat a neat withered little old woman whom he introduced to me as his mother  i tell im its a fine gell as e oughter ave up ere aside im said the old lady preparing to dismount an old woman like me takes all the paint off the show  get along with yer he replied laughingly jumping down and handing the reins to the lad who had been waiting you could give some of the young uns points yet mother  i allus promised the old lady as she should ride behind her own oss one day he continued turning to me didnt i mother  ay ay replied the old soul as she hobbled nimbly up the steps yere a good son jack yere a good son  he led the way into the parlour  as he entered every face lightened up with pleasure a harmony of joyous welcome greeted him  the old hard world had been shut out with the slam of the front door  i seemed to have wandered into dickensland  the redfaced man with the small twinkling eyes and the lungs of leather loomed before me a large fat household fairy  from his capacious pockets came forth tobacco for the old father a huge bunch of hothouse grapes for a neighbours sickly child who was stopping with them a book of hentysbeloved of boysfor a noisy youngster who called him uncle a bottle of port wine for a wan elderly woman with a swollen facehis widowed sisterinlaw as i subsequently learned sweets enough for the baby whose baby i dont know to make it sick for a week and a roll of music for his youngest sister  were agoing to make a lady of her he said drawing the childs shy face against his gaudy waistcoat and running his coarse hand through her pretty curls and she shall marry a jockey when she grows up  after supper he brewed some excellent whisky punch and insisted upon the old lady joining us which she eventually did with much coughing and protestation but i noticed that she finished the tumblerful  for the children he concocted a marvellous mixture which he called an eyecomposer the chief ingredients being hot lemonade ginger wine sugar oranges and raspberry vinegar  it had the desired effect  i stayed till late listening to his inexhaustible fund of stories  over most of them he laughed with us himselfa great gusty laugh that made the cheap glass ornaments upon the mantelpiece to tremble but now and then a recollection came to him that spread a sudden gravity across his jovial face bringing a curious quaver into his deep voice  their tongues a little loosened by the punch the old folks would have sung his praises to the verge of tediousness had he not almost sternly interrupted them  shut up mother he cried at last quite gruffly what i does i does to please myself  i likes to see people comfortable about me  if they wasnt its me as would be more upset than them  i did not see him again for nearly two years  then one october evening strolling about the east end i met him coming out of a little chapel in the burdett road  he was so changed that i should not have known him had not i overheard a woman as she passed him say goodevening mr burridge  a pair of bushy sidewhiskers had given to his red face an aggressively respectable appearance  he was dressed in an illfitting suit of black and carried an umbrella in one hand and a book in the other  in some mysterious way he managed to look both thinner and shorter than my recollection of him  altogether he suggested to me the idea that he himselfthe real manhad by some means or other been extracted leaving only his shrunken husk behind  the genial juices of humanity had been squeezed out of him  not jack burridge i exclaimed confronting him in astonishment  his little eyes wandered shiftily up and down the street  no sir he replied his tones had lost their windy boisterousnessa hard metallic voice spoke to me not the one as you used to know praise be the lord  and have you given up the old business i asked  yes sir he replied thats all over ive been a vile sinner in my time god forgive me for it  but thank heaven i have repented in time  come and have a drink i said slipping my arm through his and tell me all about it  he disengaged himself from me firmly but gently  you mean well sir he said but i have given up the drink  evidently he would have been rid of me but a literary man scenting material for his stockpot is not easily shaken off  i asked after the old folks and if they were still stopping with him  yes he said for the present  of course a man cant be expected to keep people for ever so many mouths to fill is hard work these times and everybody sponges on a man just because hes goodnatured  and how are you getting on i asked  tolerably well thank you sir  the lord provides for his servants he replied with a smug smile  i have got a little shop now in the commercial road  whereabouts i persisted  i would like to call and see you  he gave me the address reluctantly and said he would esteem it a great pleasure if i would honour him by a visit which was a palpable lie  the following afternoon i went  i found the place to be a pawnbrokers shop and from all appearances he must have been doing a very brisk business  he was out himself attending a temperance committee but his old father was behind the counter and asked me inside  though it was a chilly day there was no fire in the parlour and the two old folks sat one each side of the empty hearth silent and sad  they seemed little more pleased to see me than their son but after a while mrs burridges natural garrulity asserted itself and we fell into chat  i asked what had become of his sisterinlaw the lady with the swollen face  i couldnt rightly tell you sir answered the old lady she aint livin with us now  you see sir she continued johns got different notions to what e used to ave  e dont cotten much to them as aint found grace and poor jane never did ave much religion  and the little one i inquired  the one with the curls  what bessie sir said the old lady  oh shes out at service sir john dont think it good for young folks to be idle  your son seems to have changed a good deal mrs burridge i remarked  ay sir she assented you may well say that  it nearly broke my art at fust everythin so different to what it ad been  not as id stand in the boys light  if our being a bit uncomfortable like in this world is agoing to do im any good in the next me and father aint the ones to begrudge it are we old man  the old man concurred grumpily  was it a sudden conversion i asked  how did it come about  it was a young woman as started im off explained the old lady  she come round to our place one day acollectin for somethin or other and jack in is freeanded way e give er a fivepun note  next week she come agen for somethin else and stopped and talked to im about is soul in the passage  she told im as e was agoin straight to ell and that e oughter give up the bookmakin and settle down to a respecble godfearin business  at fust e only laughed but she lammed in tracts at im full of the most awful language and one day she fetched im round to one of them revivalist chaps as fair settled im  e aint never been his old self since then  e give up the bettin and bought this ere though whats the difference blessed if i can see  it makes my eart ache it do to ear my jack abeatin down the poor peopleand it aint like im  it went agen is grain at fust i could see but they told him as ow it was folkss own fault that they was poor and as ow it was the will of god because they was a drinkin improvident lot  then they made im sign the pledge  ed allus been used to is glass jack ad and i think as knockin it off ave soured im a bitseems as if all the sperit ad gone out of imand of course me and father ave ad to give up our little drop too  then they told im as e must give up smokin that was another way of goin straight to elland that aint made im any the more cheerful like and father misses is little bitdont ye father  ay answered the old fellow savagely cant say i thinks much of these ere folks as is going to heaven blowed if i dont think theyll be a chirpier lot in tother place  an angry discussion in the shop interrupted us  jack had returned and was threatening an excited woman with the police  it seemed she had miscalculated the date and had come a day too late with her interest  having got rid of her he came into the parlour with the watch in his hand  its providential she was late he said looking at it its worth ten times what i lent on it  he packed his father back into the shop and his mother down into the kitchen to get his tea and for a while we sat together talking  i found his conversation a strange mixture of selflaudation showing through a flimsy veil of selfdisparagement and of satisfaction at the conviction that he was saved combined with equally evident satisfaction that most other people werentsomewhat trying however and remembering an appointment rose to go  he made no effort to stay me but i could see that he was bursting to tell me something  at last taking a religious paper from his pocket and pointing to a column he blurted out  you dont take any interest in the lords vineyard i suppose sir  i glanced at the part of the paper indicated  it announced a new mission to the chinese and heading the subscription list stood the name mr john burridge one hundred guineas  you subscribe largely mr burridge i said handing him back the paper  he rubbed his big hands together  the lord will repay a hundredfold he answered  in which case its just as well to have a note of the advance down in black and white eh i added  his little eyes looked sharply at me but he made no reply and shaking hands i left him     the hobby rider   bump  bump  bumpbump  bump  i sat up in bed and listened intently  it seemed to me as if someone with a muffled hammer were trying to knock bricks out of the wall  burglars i said to myself one assumes as a matter of course that everything happening in this world after 1 am is due to burglars and i reflected what a curiously literal but at the same time slow and cumbersome method of housebreaking they had adopted  the bumping continued irregularly yet uninterruptedly  my bed was by the window  i reached out my hand and drew aside a corner of the curtain  the sunlight streamed into the room  i looked at my watch it was ten minutes past five  a most unbusinesslike hour for burglars i thought  why it will be breakfasttime before they get in  suddenly there came a crash and some substance striking against the blind fell upon the floor  i sprang out of bed and threw open the window  a redhaired young gentleman scantily clad in a sweater and a pair of flannel trousers stood on the lawn below me  good morning he said cheerily  do you mind throwing me back my ball  what ball i said  my tennis ball he answered  it must be somewhere in the room it went clean through the window  i found the ball and threw it back to him  what are you doing i asked  playing tennis  no he said  i am just practising against the side of the house  it improves your game wonderfully  it dont improve my nights rest i answered somewhat surlily i fear i came down here for peace and quiet  cant you do it in the daytime  daytime he laughed  why it has been daytime for the last two hours never mind ill go round the other side  he disappeared round the corner and set to work at the back where he woke up the dog  i heard another window smash followed by a sound as of somebody getting up violently in a distant part of the house and shortly afterwards i must have fallen asleep again  i had come to spend a few weeks at a boarding establishment in deal  he was the only other young man in the house and i was naturally thrown a good deal upon his society  he was a pleasant genial young fellow but he would have been better company had he been a little less enthusiastic as regards tennis  he played tennis ten hours a day on the average  he got up romantic parties to play it by moonlight when half his time was generally taken up in separating his opponents and godless parties to play it on sundays  on wet days i have seen him practising services by himself in a mackintosh and goloshes  he had been spending the winter with his people at tangiers and i asked him how he liked the place  oh a beast of a hole he replied  there is not a court anywhere in the town  we tried playing on the roof but the mater thought it dangerous  switzerland he had been delighted with  he counselled me next time i went to stay at zermatt  there is a capital court at zermatt he said  you might almost fancy yourself at wimbledon  a mutual acquaintance whom i subsequently met told me that at the top of the jungfrau he had said to him his eyes fixed the while upon a small snow plateau enclosed by precipices a few hundred feet below them  by jove  that wouldnt make half a bad little tennis courtthat flat bit down there  have to be careful you didnt run back too far  when he was not playing tennis or practising tennis or reading about tennis he was talking about tennis  renshaw was the prominent figure in the tennis world at that time and he mentioned renshaw until there grew up within my soul a dark desire to kill renshaw in a quiet unostentatious way and bury him  one drenching afternoon he talked tennis to me for three hours on end referring to renshaw so far as i kept count four thousand nine hundred and thirteen times  after tea he drew his chair to the window beside me and commenced  have you ever noticed how renshaw  i said  suppose someone took a gunsomeone who could aim very straightand went out and shot renshaw till he was quite dead would you tennis players drop him and talk about somebody else  oh but who would shoot renshaw he said indignantly  never mind i said supposing someone did  well then there would be his brother he replied  i had forgotten that  well we wont argue about how many of them there are i said  suppose someone killed the lot should we hear less of renshaw  never he replied emphatically  renshaw will always be a name wherever tennis is spoken of  i dread to think what the result might have been had his answer been other than it was  the next year he dropped tennis completely and became an ardent amateur photographer whereupon all his friends implored him to return to tennis and sought to interest him in talk about services and returns and volleys and in anecdotes concerning renshaw  but he would not heed them  whatever he saw wherever he went he took  he took his friends and made them his enemies  he took babies and brought despair to fond mothers hearts  he took young wives and cast a shadow on the home once there was a young man who loved not wisely so his friends thought but the more they talked against her the more he clung to her  then a happy idea occurred to the father  he got begglely to photograph her in seven different positions  when her lover saw the first he said  what an awful looking thing  who did it  when begglely showed him the second he said  but my dear fellow its not a bit like her  youve made her look an ugly old woman  at the third he said  whatever have you done to her feet  they cant be that size you know it isnt in nature  at the fourth he exclaimed  but heavens man  look at the shape youve made her  where on earth did you get the idea from  at the first glimpse of the fifth he staggered  great scott he cried with a shudder what a ghastly expression youve got into it  it isnt human  begglely was growing offended but the father who was standing by came to his defence  its nothing to do with begglely exclaimed the old gentleman suavely it cant be his fault  what is a photographer  simply an instrument in the hands of science  he arranges his apparatus and whatever is in front of it comes into it  no continued the old gentleman laying a constrained hand upon begglely who was about to resume the exhibition dontdont show him the other two  i was sorry for the poor girl for i believe she really cared for the youngster and as for her looks they were quite up to the average  but some evil sprite seemed to have got into begglelys camera  it seized upon defects with the unerring instinct of a born critic and dilated upon them to the obscuration of all virtues  a man with a pimple became a pimple with a man as background  people with strongly marked features became merely adjuncts to their own noses  one man in the neighbourhood had undetected worn a wig for fourteen years  begglelys camera discovered the fraud in an instant and so completely exposed it that the mans friends wondered afterwards how the fact ever could have escaped them  the thing seemed to take a pleasure in showing humanity at its very worst  babies usually came out with an expression of low cunning most young girls had to take their choice of appearing either as simpering idiots or embryo vixens  to mild old ladies it generally gave a look of aggressive cynicism  our vicar as excellent an old gentleman as ever breathed begglely presented to us as a beetlebrowed savage of a peculiarly low type of intellect while upon the leading solicitor of the town he bestowed an expression of such thinlyveiled hypocrisy that few who saw the photograph cared ever again to trust him with their affairs  as regards myself i should perhaps make no comment i am possibly a prejudiced party  all i will say therefore is that if i in any way resemble begglelys photograph of me then the critics are fully justified in everything they have at any time anywhere said of meand more  nor i maintainthough i make no pretence of possessing the figure of apollois one of my legs twice the length of the other and neither does it curve upwards  this i can prove  begglely allowed that an accident had occurred to the negative during the process of development but this explanation does not appear on the picture and i cannot help feeling that an injustice has been done me  his perspective seemed to be governed by no law either human or divine  i have seen a photograph of his uncle and a windmill judging from which i defy any unprejudiced person to say which is the bigger the uncle or the mill  on one occasion he created quite a scandal in the parish by exhibiting a wellknown and eminently respectable maiden lady nursing a young man on her knee  the gentlemans face was indistinct and he was dressed in a costume which upon a man of his sizeone would have estimated him as rising 6 ft 4 inappeared absurdly juvenile  he had one arm round her neck and she was holding his other hand and smirking  i knowing something of begglelys machine willingly accepted the ladys explanation which was to the effect that the male in question was her nephew aged eleven but the uncharitable ridiculed this statement and appearances were certainly against her  it was in the early days of the photographic craze and an inexperienced world was rather pleased with the idea of being taken on the cheap  the consequence was that nearly everyone for three miles round sat or stood or leant or laid to begglely at one time or another with the result that a less conceited parish than ours it would have been difficult to discover  no one who had once looked upon a photograph of himself taken by begglely ever again felt any pride in his personal appearance  the picture was invariably a revelation to him  later some evildisposed person invented kodaks and begglely went everywhere slung on to a thing that looked like an overgrown missionary box and that bore a legend to the effect that if begglely would pull the button a shameless company would do the rest  life became a misery to begglelys friends  nobody dared to do anything for fear of being taken in the act  he took an instantaneous photograph of his own father swearing at the gardener and snapped his youngest sister and her lover at the exact moment of farewell at the garden gate  nothing was sacred to him  he kodaked his aunts funeral from behind and showed the chief mourner but one whispering a funny story into the ear of the third cousin as they stood behind their hats beside the grave  public indignation was at its highest when a new comer to the neighbourhood a young fellow named haynoth suggested the getting together of a party for a summers tour in turkey  everybody took up the idea with enthusiasm and recommended begglely as the party  we had great hopes from that tour  our idea was that begglely would pull his button outside a harem or behind a sultana and that a bashi bazouk or a janissary would do the rest for us  we were however partly doomed to disappointmenti say partly because although begglely returned alive he came back entirely cured of his photographic craze  he said that every englishspeaking man woman or child whom he met abroad had its camera with it and that after a time the sight of a black cloth or the click of a button began to madden him  he told us that on the summit of mount tutra in the carpathians the english and american amateur photographers waiting to take the grand panorama were formed by the hungarian police in queue two abreast each with his or her camera under his or her arm and that a man had to stand sometimes as long as three and a half hours before his turn came round he also told us that the beggars in constantinople went about with placards hung round their necks stating their charges for being photographed  one of these price lists he brought back with him as a sample  it ran  one snap shot back or front          2 frcs               with expression          3                surprised in quaint attitude  4                while saying prayers     5                while fighting           10    he said that in some instances where a man had an exceptionally villainous cast of countenance or was exceptionally deformed as much as twenty francs were demanded and readily obtained  he abandoned photography and took to golf  he showed people how by digging a hole here and putting a brickbat or two there they could convert a tennislawn into a miniature golf linkand did it for them he persuaded elderly ladies and gentlemen that it was the mildest exercise going and would drag them for miles over wet gorse and heather and bring them home dead beat coughing and full of evil thoughts  the last time i saw him was in switzerland a few months ago  he appeared indifferent to the subject of golf but talked much about whist we met by chance at grindelwald and agreed to climb the faulhorn together next morning  halfway up we rested and i strolled on a little way by myself to gain a view  returning i found him with a cavendish in his hand and a pack of cards spread out before him on the grass solving a problem     the man who did not believe in luck   he got in at ipswich with seven different weekly papers under his arm  i noticed that each one insured its reader against death or injury by railway accident  he arranged his luggage upon the rack above him took off his hat and laid it on the seat beside him mopped his bald head with a red silk handkerchief and then set to work steadily to write his name and address upon each of the seven papers  i sat opposite to him and read punch  i always take the old humour when travelling i find it soothing to the nerves  passing over the points at manningtree the train gave a lurch and a horseshoe he had carefully placed in the rack above him slipped through the netting falling with a musical ring upon his head  he appeared neither surprised nor angry  having staunched the wound with his handkerchief he stooped and picked the horseshoe up glanced at it with as i thought an expression of reproach and dropped it gently out of the window  did it hurt you i asked  it was a foolish question  i told myself so the moment i had uttered it the thing must have weighed three pounds at the least it was an exceptionally large and heavy shoe  the bump on his head was swelling visibly before my eyes  anyone but an idiot must have seen that he was hurt  i expected an irritable reply  i should have given one myself had i been in his place  instead however he seemed to regard the inquiry as a natural and kindly expression of sympathy  it did a little he replied  what were you doing with it i asked  it was an odd sort of thing for a man to be travelling with  it was lying in the roadway just outside the station he explained i picked it up for luck  he refolded his handkerchief so as to bring a cooler surface in contact with the swelling while i murmured something genial about the inscrutability of providence  yes he said ive had a deal of luck in my time but its never turned out well  i was born on a wednesday he continued which as i daresay you know is the luckiest day a man can be born on  my mother was a widow and none of my relatives would do anything for me  they said it would be like taking coals to newcastle helping a boy born on a wednesday and my uncle when he died left every penny of his money to my brother sam as a slight compensation to him for having been born on a friday  all i ever got was advice upon the duties and responsibilities of wealth when it arrived and entreaties that i would not neglect those with claims upon me when i came to be a rich man  he paused while folding up his various insurance papers and placing them in the inside breastpocket of his coat  then there are black cats he went on theyre said to be lucky  why there never was a blacker cat than the one that followed me into my rooms in bolsover street the very first night i took them  didnt it bring you luck i enquired finding that he had stopped  a faraway look came into his eyes  well of course it all depends he answered dreamily  maybe wed never have suited one another you can always look at it that way  still id like to have tried  he sat staring out of the window and for a while i did not care to intrude upon his evidently painful memories  what happened then i asked however at last  he roused himself from his reverie  oh he said  nothing extraordinary  she had to leave london for a time and gave me her pet canary to take charge of while she was away  but it wasnt your fault i urged  no perhaps not he agreed but it created a coldness which others were not slow to take advantage of  i offered her the cat too he added but more to himself than to me  we sat and smoked in silence  i felt that the consolations of a stranger would sound weak  piebald horses are lucky too he observed knocking the ashes from his pipe against the window sash  i had one of them once  what did it do to you i enquired  lost me the best crib i ever had in my life was the simple rejoinder the governor stood it a good deal longer than i had any right to expect but you cant keep a man who is always drunk  it gives a firm a bad name  it would i agreed  you see he went on i never had the head for it  to some men it would not have so much mattered but the very first glass was enough to upset me  id never been used to it  but why did you take it i persisted  the horse didnt make you drink did he  well it was this way he explained continuing to rub gently the lump which was now about the size of an egg  the animal had belonged to a gentleman who travelled in the wine and spirit line and who had been accustomed to visit in the way of business almost every publichouse he came to  the result was you couldnt get that little horse past a public houseat least i couldnt  he sighted them a quarter of a mile off and made straight for the door  i struggled with him at first but it was five to ten minutes work getting him away and folks used to gather round and bet on us  i think maybe id have stuck to it however if it hadnt been for a temperance chap who stopped one day and lectured the crowd about it from the opposite side of the street  he called me pilgrim and said the little horse was pollion or some such name and kept on shouting out that i was to fight him for a heavenly crown  after that they called us polly and the pilgrim fighting for the crown  it riled me that did and at the very next house at which he pulled up i got down and said id come for two of scotch  that was the beginning  it took me years to break myself of the habit  but there he continued it has always been the same  i hadnt been a fortnight in my first situation before my employer gave me a goose weighing eighteen pounds as a christmas present  well that couldnt have done you any harm i remarked  that was lucky enough  so the other clerks said at the time he replied  the old gentleman had never been known to give anything away before in his life  hes taken a fancy to you they said you are a lucky beggar  he sighed heavily  i felt there was a story attached  what did you do with it i asked  that was the trouble he returned  i didnt know what to do with it it was ten oclock on christmas eve just as i was leaving that he gave it to me  tiddling brothers have sent me a goose biggles he said to me as i helped him on with his greatcoat  very kind of em but i dont want it myself you can have it  of course i thanked him and was very grateful  he wished me a merry christmas and went out  i tied the thing up in brown paper and took it under my arm  it was a fine bird but heavy  under all the circumstances and it being christmas time i thought i would treat myself to a glass of beer  i went into a quiet little house at the corner of the lane and laid the goose on the counter  thats a big un said the landlord youll get a good cut off him to morrow  his words set me thinking and for the first time it struck me that i didnt want the birdthat it was of no use to me at all  i was going down to spend the holidays with my young ladys people in kent  was this the canary young lady i interrupted  no he replied  this was before that one  it was this goose im telling you of that upset this one  well her folks were big farmers it would have been absurd taking a goose down to them and i knew no one in london to give it to so when the landlord came round again i asked him if he would care to buy it  i told him he could have it cheap  i dont want it myself he answered  ive got three in the house already  perhaps one of these gentlemen would like to make an offer  he turned to a couple of chaps who were sitting drinking gin  they didnt look to me worth the price of a chicken between them  the seediest said hed like to look at it however and i undid the parcel he mauled the thing pretty considerably and crossexamined me as to how i come by it ending by upsetting half a tumbler of gin and water over it  then he offered me half a crown for it  it made me so angry that i took the brown paper and the string in one hand and the goose in the other and walked straight out without saying a word  i carried it in this way for some distance because i was excited and didnt care how i carried it but as i cooled i began to reflect how ridiculous i must look  one or two small boys evidently noticed the same thing  i stopped under a lamppost and tried to tie it up again  i had a bag and an umbrella with me at the same time and the first thing i did was to drop the goose into the gutter which is just what i might have expected to do attempting to handle four separate articles and three yards of string with one pair of hands  i picked up about a quart of mud with that goose and got the greater part of it over my hands and clothes and a fair quantity over the brown paper and then it began to rain  i bundled everything up into my arm and made for the nearest pub where i thought i would ask for a piece more string and make a neat job of it  the bar was crowded  i pushed my way to the counter and flung the goose down in front of me  the men nearest stopped talking to look at it and a young fellow standing next to me said  well youve killed it  i daresay i did seem a bit excited  i had intended making another effort to sell it here but they were clearly not the right sort  i had a pint of alefor i was feeling somewhat tired and hotscraped as much of the mud off the bird as i could made a fresh parcel of it and came out  crossing the road a happy idea occurred to me  i thought i would raffle it  at once i set to work to find a house where there might seem to be a likely lot  it cost me three or four whiskiesfor i felt i didnt want any more beer which is a thing that easily upsets mebut at length i found just the crowd i wanteda quiet domesticlooking set in a homely little place off the goswell road  i explained my views to the landlord  he said he had no objection he supposed i would stand drinks round afterwards  i said i should be delighted to do so and showed him the bird  it looks a bit poorly he said  he was a devonshire man  oh thats nothing i explained  i happened to drop it  that will all wash off  it smells a bit queer too he said  thats mud i answered you know what london mud is  and a gentleman spilled some gin over it  nobody will notice that when its cooked  well he replied  i dont think ill take a hand myself but if any other gent likes to thats his affair  nobody seemed enthusiastic  i started it at sixpence and took a ticket myself  the potman had a free chance for superintending the arrangements and he succeeded in inducing five other men much against their will to join us  i won it myself and paid out three and twopence for drinks  a solemnlooking individual who had been snoring in a corner suddenly woke up as i was going out and offered me sevenpence hapenny for itwhy sevenpence hapenny i have never been able to understand  he would have taken it away i should never have seen it again and my whole life might have been different  but fate has always been against me  i replied with perhaps unnecessary hauteur that i wasnt a christmas dinner fund for the destitute and walked out  it was getting late and i had a long walk home to my lodgings  i was beginning to wish i had never seen the bird  i estimated its weight by this time to be thirtysix pounds  the idea occurred to me to sell it to a poulterer  i looked for a shop i found one in myddleton street  there wasnt a customer near it but by the way the man was shouting you might have thought that he was doing all the trade of clerkenwell  i took the goose out of the parcel and laid it on the shelf before him  whats this he asked  its a goose i said  you can have it cheap  he just seized the thing by the neck and flung it at me  i dodged and it caught the side of my head  you can have no idea if youve never been hit on the head with a goose how if hurts  i picked it up and hit him back with it and a policeman came up with the usual now then whats all this about  i explained the facts  the poulterer stepped to the edge of the curb and apostrophised the universe generally  look at that shop he said  its twenty minutes to twelve and theres seven dozen geese hanging there that im willing to give away and this fool asks me if i want to buy another  i perceived then that my notion had been a foolish one and i followed the policemans advice and went away quietly taking the bird with me  then said i to myself i will give it away  i will select some poor deserving person and make him a present of the damned thing  i passed a good many people but no one looked deserving enough  it may have been the time or it may have been the neighbourhood but those i met seemed to me to be unworthy of the bird  i offered it to a man in judd street who i thought appeared hungry  he turned out to be a drunken ruffian  i could not make him understand what i meant and he followed me down the road abusing me at the top of his voice until turning a corner without knowing it he plunged down tavistock place shouting after the wrong man  in the euston road i stopped a halfstarved child and pressed it upon her  she answered not me and ran away  i heard her calling shrilly after me who stole the goose  i dropped it in a dark part of seymour street  a man picked it up and brought it after me  i was unequal to any more explanations or arguments  i gave him twopence and plodded on with it once more  the pubs were just closing and i went into one for a final drink  as a matter of fact i had had enough already being as i am unaccustomed to anything more than an occasional class of beer  but i felt depressed and i thought it might cheer me  i think i had gin which is a thing i loathe  i meant to fling it over into oakley square but a policeman had his eye on me and followed me twice round the railings  in golding road i sought to throw it down an area but was frustrated in like manner  the whole night police of london seemed to have nothing else to do but prevent my getting rid of that goose  they appeared so anxious about it that i fancied they might like to have it  i went up to one in camden street  i called him bobby and asked him if he wanted a goose  ill tell you what i dont want he replied severely and that is none of your sauce  he was very insulting and i naturally answered him back  what actually passed i forget but it ended in his announcing his intention of taking me in charge  i slipped out of his hands and bolted down king street  he blew his whistle and started after me  a man sprang out from a doorway in college street and tried to stop me  i tied him up with a butt in the stomach and cut through the crescent doubling back into the camden road by batt street  at the canal bridge i looked behind me and could see no one  i dropped the goose over the parapet and it fell with a splash into the water  heaving a sigh of relief i turned and crossed into randolph street and there a constable collared me  i was arguing with him when the first fool came up breathless  they told me i had better explain the matter to the inspector and i thought so too  the inspector asked me why i had run away when the other constable wanted to take me in charge  i replied that it was because i did not desire to spend my christmas holidays in the lockup which he evidently regarded as a singularly weak argument  he asked me what i had thrown into the canal  i told him a goose  he asked me why i had thrown a goose into the canal  i told him because i was sick and tired of the animal  at this stage a sergeant came in to say that they had succeeded in recovering the parcel  they opened it on the inspectors table  it contained a dead baby  i pointed out to them that it wasnt my parcel and that it wasnt my baby but they hardly took the trouble to disguise the fact that they did not believe me  the inspector said it was too grave a case for bail which seeing that i did not know a soul in london was somewhat immaterial  i got them to send a telegram to my young lady to say that i was unavoidably detained in town and passed as quiet and uneventful a christmas day and boxing day as i ever wish to spend  in the end the evidence against me was held to be insufficient to justify a conviction and i got off on the minor charge of drunk and disorderly  but i lost my situation and i lost my young lady and i dont care if i never see a goose again  we were nearing liverpool street  he collected his luggage and taking up his hat made an attempt to put it on his head  but in consequence of the swelling caused by the horseshoe it would not go anywhere near him and he laid it sadly back upon the seat  no he said quietly i cant say that i believe very much in luck     dick dunkermans cat   richard dunkerman and i had been old schoolfellows if a gentleman belonging to the upper sixth and arriving each morning in a topper and a pair of gloves and a discredit to the lower fourth in a scotch cap can by any manner of means be classed together  and though in those early days a certain amount of coldness existed between us originating in a poem composed and sung on occasions by myself in commemoration of an alleged painful incident connected with a certain breakingup day and which if i remember rightly ran     dicky dicky dunk    always in a funk    drank a glass of sherry wine    and went home roaring drunk  and kept alive by his brutal criticism of the same expressed with the bony part of the knee yet in after life we came to know and like each other better  i drifted into journalism while he for years had been an unsuccessful barrister and dramatist but one spring to the astonishment of us all he brought out the play of the season a somewhat impossible little comedy but full of homely sentiment and belief in human nature it was about a couple of months after its production that he first introduced me to pyramids esquire  i was in love at the time  her name was i think naomi and i wanted to talk to somebody about her  dick had a reputation for taking an intelligent interest in other mens love affairs  he would let a lover rave by the hour to him taking brief notes the while in a bulky redcovered volume labelled commonplace book  of course everybody knew that he was using them merely as raw material for his dramas but we did not mind that so long as he would only listen  i put on my hat and went round to his chambers  we talked about indifferent matters for a quarter of an hour or so and then i launched forth upon my theme  i had exhausted her beauty and goodness and was well into my own feelingsthe madness of my ever imagining i had loved before the utter impossibility of my ever caring for any other woman and my desire to die breathing her namebefore he made a move  i thought he had risen to reach down as usual the commonplace book and so waited but instead he went to the door and opened it and in glided one of the largest and most beautiful black tom cats i have ever seen  it sprang on dicks knee with a soft curroo and sat there upright watching me and i went on with my tale  after a few minutes dick interrupted me with  i thought you said her name was naomi  so it is i replied  why  oh nothing he answered only just now you referred to her as enid  this was remarkable as i had not seen enid for years and had quite forgotten her  somehow it took the glitter out of the conversation  a dozen sentences later dick stopped me again with  whos julia  i began to get irritated  julia i remembered had been cashier in a city restaurant and had when i was little more than a boy almost inveigled me into an engagement  i found myself getting hot at the recollection of the spooney rhapsodies i had hoarsely poured into her powderstreaked ear while holding her flabby hand across the counter  did i really say julia i answered somewhat sharply or are you joking  you certainly alluded to her as julia he replied mildly  but never mind you go on as you like i shall know whom you mean  but the flame was dead within me  i tried to rekindle it but every time i glanced up and met the green eyes of the black tom it flickered out again  i recalled the thrill that had penetrated my whole being when naomis hand had accidently touched mine in the conservatory and wondered whether she had done it on purpose  i thought how good and sweet she was to that irritatingly silly old frump her mother and wondered if it really were her mother or only hired  i pictured her crown of goldbrown hair as i had last seen it with the sunlight kissing its wanton waves and felt i would like to be quite sure that it were all her own  once i clutched the flying skirts of my enthusiasm with sufficient firmness to remark that in my own private opinion a good woman was more precious than rubies adding immediately afterwardsthe words escaping me unconsciously before i was aware even of the thoughtpity its so difficult to tell em  then i gave it up and sat trying to remember what i had said to her the evening before and hoping i had not committed myself  dicks voice roused me from my unpleasant reverie  no he said i thought you would not be able to  none of them can  none of them can what i asked  somehow i was feeling angry with dick and with dicks cat and with myself and most other things  why talk love or any other kind of sentiment before old pyramids here he replied stroking the cats soft head as it rose and arched its back  whats the confounded cat got to do with it i snapped  thats just what i cant tell you he answered but its very remarkable  old leman dropped in here the other evening and began in his usual style about ibsen and the destiny of the human race and the socialistic idea and all the rest of ityou know his way  pyramids sat on the edge of the table there and looked at him just as he sat looking at you a few minutes ago and in less than a quarter of an hour leman had come to the conclusion that society would do better without ideals and that the destiny of the human race was in all probability the dust heap he pushed his long hair back from his eyes and looked for the first time in his life quite sane  we talk about ourselves he said as though we were the end of creation  i get tired listening to myself sometimes pah he continued for all we know the human race may die out utterly and another insect take our place as possibly we pushed out and took the place of a former race of beings  i wonder if the ant tribe may not be the future inheritors of the earth  they understand combination and already have an extra sense that we lack  if in the courses of evolution they grow bigger in brain and body they may become powerful rivals who knows  curious to hear old leman talking like that wasnt it  what made you call him pyramids i asked of dick  i dont know he answered i suppose because he looked so old  the name came to me  i leaned across and looked into the great green eyes and the creature never winking never blinking looked back into mine until the feeling came to me that i was being drawn down into the very wells of time  it seemed as though the panorama of the ages must have passed in review before those expressionless orbsall the loves and hopes and desires of mankind all the everlasting truths that have been found false all the eternal faiths discovered to save until it was discovered they damned the strange black creature grew and grew till it seemed to fill the room and dick and i to be but shadows floating in the air  i forced from myself a laugh that only in part however broke the spell and inquired of dick how he had acquired possession of it  it came to me he answered one night six months ago  i was down on my luck at the time  two of my plays on which i had built great hopes had failed one on top of the otheryou remember themand it appeared absurd to think that any manager would ever look at anything of mine again  old walcott had just told me that he did not consider it right of me under all the circumstances to hold lizzie any longer to her engagement and that i ought to go away and give her a chance of forgetting me and i had agreed with him  i was alone in the world and heavily in debt  altogether things seemed about as hopeless as they could be and i dont mind confessing to you now that i had made up my mind to blow out my brains that very evening  i had loaded my revolver and it lay before me on the desk  my hand was toying with it when i heard a faint scratching at the door  i paid no attention at first but it grew more persistent and at length to stop the faint noise which excited me more than i could account for i rose and opened the door and it walked in  it perched itself upon the corner of my desk beside the loaded pistol and sat there bolt upright looking at me and i pushing back my chair sat looking at it  and there came a letter telling me that a man of whose name i had never heard had been killed by a cow in melbourne and that under his will a legacy of three thousand pounds fell into the estate of a distant relative of my own who had died peacefully and utterly insolvent eighteen months previously leaving me his sole heir and representative and i put the revolver back into the drawer  do you think pyramids would come and stop with me for a week i asked reaching over to stroke the cat as it lay softly purring on dicks knee  maybe he will some day replied dick in a low voice but before the answer camei know not whyi had regretted the jesting words  i came to talk to him as though he were a human creature continued dick and to discuss things with him  my last play i regard as a collaboration indeed it is far more his than mine  i should have thought dick mad had not the cat been sitting there before me with its eyes looking into mine  as it was i only grew more interested in his tale  it was rather a cynical play as i first wrote it he went on a truthful picture of a certain corner of society as i saw and knew it from an artistic point of view i felt it was good from the boxoffice standard it was doubtful  i drew it from my desk on the third evening after pyramids advent and read it through  he sat on the arm of the chair and looked over the pages as i turned them  it was the best thing i had ever written  insight into life ran through every line i found myself reading it again with delight  suddenly a voice beside me said  very clever my boy very clever indeed  if you would just turn it topsyturvy change all those bitter truthful speeches into noble sentiments make your undersecretary for foreign affairs who never has been a popular character die in the last act instead of the yorkshireman and let your bad woman be reformed by her love for the hero and go off somewhere by herself and be good to the poor in a black frock the piece might be worth putting on the stage  i turned indignantly to see who was speaking  the opinions sounded like those of a theatrical manager  no one was in the room but i and the cat no doubt i had been talking to myself but the voice was strange to me  be reformed by her love for the hero i retorted contemptuously for i was unable to grasp the idea that i was arguing only with myself why its his mad passion for her that ruins his life  and will ruin the play with the great bp returned the other voice the british dramatic hero has no passion but a pure and respectful admiration for an honest hearty english girlpronounced geyurl  you dont know the canons of your art  and besides i persisted unheeding the interruption women born and bred and soaked for thirty years in an atmosphere of sin dont reform  well this ones got to thats all was the sneering reply let her hear an organ  but as an artist i protested  you will be always unsuccessful was the rejoinder  my dear fellow you and your plays artistic or in artistic will be forgotten in a very few years hence  you give the world what it wants and the world will give you what you want  please if you wish to live  so with pyramids beside me day by day i rewrote the play and whenever i felt a thing to be utterly impossible and false i put it down with a grin  and every character i made to talk claptrap sentiment while pyramids purred and i took care that everyone of my puppets did that which was right in the eyes of the lady with the lorgnettes in the second row of the dress circle and old hewson says the play will run five hundred nights  but what is worst concluded dick is that i am not ashamed of myself and that i seem content  what do you think the animal is i asked with a laugh an evil spirit  for it had passed into the next room and so out through the open window and its strangely still green eyes no longer drawing mine towards them i felt my common sense returning to me  you have not lived with it for six months answered dick quietly and felt its eyes for ever on you as i have  and i am not the only one  you know canon whycherly the great preacher  my knowledge of modern church history is not extensive i replied  i know him by name of course  what about him  he was a curate in the east end continued dick and for ten years he laboured poor and unknown leading one of those noble heroic lives that here and there men do yet live even in this age  now he is the prophet of the fashionable uptodate christianity of south kensington drives to his pulpit behind a pair of thoroughbred arabs and his waistcoat is taking to itself the curved line of prosperity  he was in here the other morning on behalf of princess   they are giving a performance of one of my plays in aid of the destitute vicars fund  and did pyramids discourage him i asked with perhaps the suggestion of a sneer  no answered dick so far as i could judge it approved the scheme the point of the matter is that the moment whycherly came into the room the cat walked over to him and rubbed itself affectionately against his legs  he stood and stroked it  oh so its come to you has it he said with a curious smile  there was no need for any further explanation between us  i understood what lay behind those few words  i lost sight of dick for some time though i heard a good deal of him for he was rapidly climbing into the position of the most successful dramatist of the day and pyramids i had forgotten all about until one afternoon calling on an artist friend who had lately emerged from the shadows of starving struggle into the sunshine of popularity i saw a pair of green eyes that seemed familiar to me gleaming at me from a dark corner of the studio  why surely i exclaimed crossing over to examine the animal more closely why yes youve got dick dunkermans cat  he raised his face from the easel and glanced across at me  yes he said we cant live on ideals and i remembering hastened to change the conversation  since then i have met pyramids in the rooms of many friends of mine  they give him different names but i am sure it is the same cat i know those green eyes  he always brings them luck but they are never quite the same men again afterwards  sometimes i sit wondering if i hear his scratching at the door     the minor poets story   it doesnt suit you at all i answered  youre very disagreeable said she i shant ever ask your advice again  nobody i hastened to add would look well in it  you of course look less awful in it than any other woman would but its not your style  he means exclaimed the minor poet that the thing itself not being preeminently beautiful it does not suit is not in agreement with you the contrast between you and anything approaching the ugly or the commonplace is too glaring to be aught else than displeasing  he didnt say it replied the woman of the world and besides it isnt ugly  its the very latest fashion  why is it asked the philosopher that women are such slaves to fashion  they think clothes they talk clothes they read clothes yet they have never understood clothes  the purpose of dress after the primary object of warmth has been secured is to adorn to beautify the particular wearer  yet not one woman in a thousand stops to consider what colours will go best with her complexion what cut will best hide the defects or display the advantages of her figure  if it be the fashion she must wear it  and so we have palefaced girls looking ghastly in shades suitable to dairymaids and dots waddling about in costumes fit and proper to sixfooters  it is as if crows insisted on wearing cockatoos feathers on their heads and rabbits ran about with peacocks tails fastened behind them  and are not you men every bit as foolish retorted the girton girl sack coats come into fashion and dumpy little men trot up and down in them looking like buttertubs on legs  you go about in july melting under frockcoats and chimneypot hats and because it is the stylish thing to do you all play tennis in still shirts and standup collars which is idiotic  if fashion decreed that you should play cricket in a pair of topboots and a divers helmet you would play cricket in a pair of topboots and a divers helmet and dub every sensible fellow who didnt a cad  its worse in you than in us men are supposed to think for themselves and to be capable of it the womanly woman isnt  big women and little men look well in nothing said the woman of the world  poor emily was five foot ten and a half and never looked an inch under seven foot whatever she wore  empires came into fashion and the poor child looked like the giants baby in a pantomime  we thought the greek might help her but it only suggested a crystal palace statue tied up in a sheet and tied up badly and when puffsleeves and shoulder capes were in and teddy stood up behind her at a waterparty and sang under the spreading chestnuttree she took it as a personal insult and boxed his ears  few men liked to be seen with her and im sure george proposed to her partly with the idea of saving himself the expense of a stepladder she reaches down his boots for him from the top shelf  i said the minor poet take up the position of not wanting to waste my brain upon the subject  tell me what to wear and i will wear it and there is an end of the matter  if society says wear blue shirts and white collars i wear blue shirts and white collars  if she says the time has now come when hats should be broadbrimmed i take unto myself a broadbrimmed hat  the question does not interest me sufficiently for me to argue it  it is your fop who refuses to follow fashion  he wishes to attract attention to himself by being peculiar  a novelist whose books pass unnoticed gains distinction by designing his own necktie and many an artist following the line of least resistance learns to let his hair grow instead of learning to paint  the fact is remarked the philosopher we are the mere creatures of fashion  fashion dictates to us our religion our morality our affections our thoughts  in one age successful cattlelifting is a virtue a few hundred years later companypromoting takes its place as a respectable and legitimate business  in england and america christianity is fashionable in turkey mohammedanism and the crimes of clapham are chaste in martaban  in japan a woman dresses down to the knees but would be considered immodest if she displayed bare arms  in europe it is legs that no pureminded woman is supposed to possess  in china we worship our motherinlaw and despise our wife in england we treat our wife with respect and regard our motherinlaw as the bulwark of comic journalism  the stone age the iron age the age of faith the age of infidelism the philosophic age what are they but the passing fashions of the world  it is fashion fashion fashion wherever we turn  fashion waits beside our cradle to lead us by the hand through life  now literature is sentimental now hopefully humorous now psychological now newwomanly  yesterdays pictures are the laughingstock of the upto date artist of today and todays art will be sneered at tomorrow  now it is fashionable to be democratic to pretend that no virtue or wisdom can exist outside corduroy and to abuse the middle classes  one season we go slumming and the next we are all socialists  we think we are thinking we are simply dressing ourselves up in words we do not understand for the gods to laugh at us  dont be pessimistic retorted the minor poet pessimism is going out you call such changes fashions i call them the footprints of progress each phase of thought is an advance upon the former bringing the footsteps of the many nearer to the landmarks left by the mighty climbers of the past upon the mountain paths of truth  the crowd that was satisfied with the derby day now appreciates millet  the public that were content to wag their heads to the bohemian girl have made wagner popular  and the play lovers who stood for hours to listen to shakespeare interrupted the philosopher now crowd to musichalls  the track sometimes descends for a little way but it will wind upwards again returned the poet  the musichall itself is improving i consider it the duty of every intellectual man to visit such places  the mere influence of his presence helps to elevate the tone of the performance  i often go myself  i was looking said the woman of the world at some old illustrated papers of thirty years ago showing the men dressed in those very absurd trousers so extremely roomy about the waist and so extremely tight about the ankles  i recollect poor papa in them i always used to long to fill them out by pouring in sawdust at the top  you mean the pegtop period i said  i remember them distinctly myself but it cannot be more than threeandtwenty years ago at the outside  that is very nice of you replied the woman of the world and shows more tact than i should have given you credit for  it could as you say have been only twentythree years ago  i know i was a very little girl at the time  i think there must be some subtle connection between clothes and thought  i cannot imagine men in those trousers and dundreary whiskers talking as you fellows are talking now any more than i could conceive of a woman in a crinoline and a poke bonnet smoking a cigarette  i think it must be so because dear mother used to be the most easygoing woman in the world in her ordinary clothes and would let papa smoke all over the house  but about once every three weeks she would put on a hideous oldfashioned black silk dress that looked as if queen elizabeth must have slept in it during one of those seasons when she used to go about sleeping anywhere and then we all had to sit up look out mas got her black silk dress on came to be a regular formula  we could always make papa take us out for a walk or a drive by whispering it to him  i can never bear to look at those pictures of bygone fashions said the old maid i see the bygone people in them and it makes me feel as though the faces that we love are only passing fashions with the rest  we wear them for a little while upon our hearts and think so much of them and then there comes a time when we lay them by and forget them and newer faces take their place and we are satisfied  it seems so sad  i wrote a story some years ago remarked the minor poet about a young swiss guide who was betrothed to a laughing little french peasant girl  named suzette interrupted the girton girl  i know her  go on  named jeanne corrected the poet the majority of laughing french girls in fiction are named suzette i am well aware  but this girls mothers family was english  she was christened jeanne after an aunt jane who lived in birmingham and from whom she had expectations  i beg your pardon apologised the girton girl i was not aware of that fact  what happened to her  one morning a few days before the date fixed for the wedding said the minor poet she started off to pay a visit to a relative living in the village the other side of the mountain  it was a dangerous track climbing halfway up the mountain before it descended again and skirting more than one treacherous slope but the girl was mountain born and bred surefooted as a goat and no one dreamed of harm  she went over of course said the philosopher those surefooted girls always do  what happened replied the minor poet was never known  the girl was never seen again  and what became of her lover asked the girton girl  was he when next years snow melted and the young men of the village went forth to gather edelweiss wherewith to deck their sweethearts found by them dead beside her at the bottom of the crevasse  no said the poet you do not know this story you had better let me tell it  her lover returned the morning before the wedding day to be met with the news  he gave way to no sign of grief he repelled all consolation  taking his rope and axe he went up into the mountain by himself  all through the winter he haunted the track by which she must have travelled indifferent to the danger that he ran impervious apparently to cold or hunger or fatigue undeterred by storm or mist or avalanche  at the beginning of the spring he returned to the village purchased building utensils and day after day carried them back with him up into the mountain  he hired no labour he rejected the proffered assistance of his brother guides  choosing an almost inaccessible spot at the edge of the great glacier far from all paths he built himself a hut with his own hands and there for eighteen years he lived alone  in the season he earned good fees being known far and wide as one of the bravest and hardiest of all the guides but few of his clients liked him for he was a silent gloomy man speaking little and with never a laugh or jest on the journey  each fall having provisioned himself he would retire to his solitary hut and bar the door and no human soul would set eyes on him again until the snows melted  one year however as the spring days wore on and he did not appear among the guides as was his wont the elder men who remembered his story and pitied him grew uneasy and after much deliberation it was determined that a party of them should force their way up to his eyrie they cut their path across the ice where no foot among them had trodden before and finding at length the lonely snowencompassed hut knocked loudly with their axestaves on the door but only the whirling echoes from the glaciers thousand walls replied so the foremost put his strong shoulder to the worn timber and the door flew open with a crash  they found him dead as they had more than half expected lying stiff and frozen on the rough couch at the farther end of the hut and beside him looking down upon him with a placid face as a mother might watch beside her sleeping child stood jeanne  she wore the flowers pinned to her dress that she had gathered when their eyes had last seen her  the girls face that had laughed back to their goodbye in the village nineteen years ago  a strange steely light clung round her half illuminating half obscuring her and the men drew back in fear thinking they saw a vision till one bolder than the rest stretched out his hand and touched the ice that formed her coffin  for eighteen years the man had lived there with this face that he had loved  a faint flush still lingered on the fair cheeks the laughing lips were still red  only at one spot above her temple the wavy hair lay matted underneath a clot of blood  the minor poet ceased  what a very unpleasant way of preserving ones love said the girton girl  when did the story appear i asked  i dont remember reading it  i never published it explained the minor poet  within the same week two friends of mine one of whom had just returned from norway and the other from switzerland confided to me their intention of writing stories about girls who had fallen into glaciers and who had been found by their friends long afterwards looking as good as new and a few days later i chanced upon a book the heroine of which had been dug out of a glacier alive three hundred years after she had fallen in  there seemed to be a run on ice maidens and i decided not to add to their number  it is curious said the philosopher how there seems to be a fashion even in thought  an idea has often occurred to me that has seemed to me quite new and taking up a newspaper i have found that some man in russia or san francisco has just been saying the very same thing in almost the very same words  we say a thing is in the air it is more true than we are aware of  thought does not grow in us  it is a thing apart we simply gather it  all truths all discoveries all inventions they have not come to us from any one man  the time grows ripe for them and from this corner of the earth and from that hands guided by some instinct grope for and grasp them  buddha and christ seize hold of the morality needful to civilisation and promulgate it unknown to one another the one on the shores of the ganges the other by the jordan  a dozen forgotten explorers feeling america prepared the way for columbus to discover it  a deluge of blood is required to sweep away old follies and rousseau and voltaire and a myriad others are set to work to fashion the storm clouds  the steamengine the spinning loom is in the air  a thousand brains are busy with them a few go further than the rest  it is idle to talk of human thought there is no such thing  our minds are fed as our bodies with the food god has provided for us  thought hangs by the wayside and we pick it and cook it and eat it and cry out what clever thinkers we are  i cannot agree with you replied the minor poet if we were simply automata as your argument would suggest what was the purpose of creating us  the intelligent portion of mankind has been asking itself that question for many ages returned the philosopher  i hate people who always think as i do said the girton girl there was a girl in our corridor who never would disagree with me  every opinion i expressed turned out to be her opinion also  it always irritated me  that might have been weakmindedness said the old maid which sounded ambiguous  it is not so unpleasant as having a person always disagreeing with you said the woman of the world  my cousin susan never would agree with any one  if i came down in red she would say why dont you try green dear every one says you look so well in green and when i wore green she would say why have you given up red dear  i thought you rather fancied yourself in red  when i told her of my engagement to tom she burst into tears and said she couldnt help it  she had always felt that george and i were intended for one another and when tom never wrote for two whole months and behaved disgracefully inin other ways and i told her i was engaged to george she reminded me of every word i had ever said about my affection for tom and of how i had ridiculed poor george papa used to say if any man ever tells susan that he loves her she will argue him out of it and will never accept him until he has jilted her and will refuse to marry him every time he asks her to fix the day  is she married asked the philosopher  oh yes answered the woman of the world and is devoted to her children  she lets them do everything they dont want to     the degeneration of thomas henry   the most respectable cat i have ever known was thomas henry  his original name was thomas but it seemed absurd to call him that  the family at hawarden would as soon think of addressing mr gladstone as bill  he came to us from the reform club via the butcher and the moment i saw him i felt that of all the clubs in london that was the club he must have come from  its atmosphere of solid dignity and petrified conservatism seemed to cling to him  why he left the club i am unable at this distance of time to remember positively but i am inclined to think that it came about owing to a difference with the new chef an overbearing personage who wanted all the fire to himself  the butcher hearing of the quarrel and knowing us as a catless family suggested a way out of the impasse that was welcomed both by cat and cook  the parting between them i believe was purely formal and thomas arrived prejudiced in our favour  my wife the moment she saw him suggested henry as a more suitable name it struck me that the combination of the two would be still more appropriate and accordingly in the privacy of the domestic circle thomas henry he was called  when speaking of him to friends we generally alluded to him as thomas henry esquire  he approved of us in his quiet undemonstrative way  he chose my own particular easy chair for himself and stuck to it  an ordinary cat i should have shot out but thomas henry was not the cat one chivvies  had i made it clear to him that i objected to his presence in my chair i feel convinced he would have regarded me much as i should expect to be regarded by queen victoria were that gracious lady to call upon me in a friendly way and were i to inform her that i was busy and request her to look in again some other afternoon  he would have risen and have walked away but he never would have spoken to me again so long as we lived under the same roof  we had a lady staying with us at the timeshe still resides with us but she is now older and possessed of more judgmentwho was no respecter of cats  her argument was that seeing the tail stuck up and came conveniently to ones hand that was the natural appendage by which to raise a cat  she also laboured under the error that the way to feed a cat was to ram things into its head and that its pleasure was to be taken out for a ride in a dolls perambulator  i dreaded the first meeting of thomas henry with this lady  i feared lest she should give him a false impression of us as a family and that we should suffer in his eyes  but i might have saved myself all anxiety  there was a something about thomas henry that checked forwardness and damped familiarity  his attitude towards her was friendly but firm  hesitatingly and with a new born respect for cats she put out her hand timidly towards its tail  he gently put it on the other side and looked at her  it was not an angry look nor an offended look  it was the expression with which solomon might have received the advances of the queen of sheba  it expressed condescension combined with distance  he was really a most gentlemanly cat  a friend of mine who believes in the doctrine of the transmigration of souls was convinced that he was lord chesterfield  he never clamoured for food as other cats do  he would sit beside me at meals and wait till he was served  he would eat only the knuckleend of a leg of mutton and would never look at over done beef  a visitor of ours once offered him a piece of gristle he said nothing but quietly left the room and we did not see him again until our friend had departed  but every one has his price and thomas henrys price was roast duck thomas henrys attitude in the presence of roast duck came to me as a psychological revelation  it showed me at once the lower and more animal side of his nature  in the presence of roast duck thomas henry became simply and merely a cat swayed by all the savage instincts of his race his dignity fell from him as a cloak  he clawed for roast duck he grovelled for it  i believe he would have sold himself to the devil for roast duck  we accordingly avoided that particular dish it was painful to see a cats character so completely demoralised  besides his manners when roast duck was on the table afforded a bad example to the children  he was a shining light among all the eats of our neighbourhood  one might have set ones watch by his movements  after dinner he invariably took half an hours constitutional in the square at ten oclock each night precisely he returned to the area door and at eleven oclock he was asleep in my easy chair  he made no friends among the other cats  he took no pleasure in fighting and i doubt his ever having loved even in youth his was too cold and selfcontained a nature female society he regarded with utter indifference  so he lived with us a blameless existence during the whole winter  in the summer we took him down with us into the country  we thought the change of air would do him good he was getting decidedly stout  alas poor thomas henry the country was his ruin  what brought about the change i cannot say maybe the air was too bracing  he slid down the moral incline with frightful rapidity  the first night he stopped out till eleven the second night he never came home at all the third night he came home at six oclock in the morning minus half the fur on the top of his head  of course there was a lady in the case indeed judging by the riot that went on all night i am inclined to think there must have been a dozen  he was certainly a fine cat and they took to calling for him in the day time  then gentleman cats who had been wronged took to calling also and demanding explanations which thomas henry to do him justice was always ready to accord  the village boys used to loiter round all day to watch the fights and angry housewives would be constantly charging into our kitchen to fling dead cats upon the table and appeal to heaven and myself for justice our kitchen became a veritable cats morgue and i had to purchase a new kitchen table  the cook said it would make her work simpler if she could keep a table entirely to herself  she said it quite confused her having so many dead cats lying round among her joints and vegetables she was afraid of making a mistake  accordingly the old table was placed under the window and devoted to the cats and after that she would never allow anyone to bring a cat however dead to her table  what do you want me to do with it i heard her asking an excited lady on one occasion cook it  its my cat said the lady thats what that is  well im not making cat pie today answered our cook  you take it to its proper table  this is my table  at first justice was generally satisfied with half a crown but as time went on cats rose  i had hitherto regarded cats as a cheap commodity and i became surprised at the value attached to them  i began to think seriously of breeding cats as an industry  at the prices current in that village i could have made an income of thousands  look what your beast has done said one irate female to whom i had been called out in the middle of dinner  i looked  thomas henry appeared to have done a mangy emaciated animal that must have been far happier dead than alive  had the poor creature been mine i should have thanked him but some people never know when they are well off  i wouldnt ha taken a fivepun note for that cat said the lady  its a matter of opinion i replied but personally i think you would have been unwise to refuse it  taking the animal as it stands i dont feel inclined to give you more than a shilling for it  if you think you can do better by taking it elsewhere you do so  he was more like a christian than a cat said the lady  im not taking dead christians i answered firmly and even if i were i wouldnt give more than a shilling for a specimen like that  you can consider him as a christian or you can consider him as a cat but hes not worth more than a shilling in either case  we settled eventually for eighteenpence  the number of cats that thomas henry contrived to dispose of also surprised me  quite a massacre of cats seemed to be in progress  one evening going into the kitchen for i made it a practice now to visit the kitchen each evening to inspect the daily consignment of dead cats i found among others a curiously marked tortoiseshell cat lying on the table  that cats worth half a sovereign said the owner who was standing by drinking beer  i took up the animal and examined it  your cat killed him yesterday continued the man  its a burning shame  my cat has killed him three times i replied  he was killed on saturday as mrs hedgers cat on monday he was killed for mrs myers  i was not quite positive on monday but i had my suspicions and i made notes  now i recognise him  you take my advice and bury him before he breeds a fever  i dont care how many lives a cat has got i only pay for one  we gave thomas henry every chance to reform but he only went from bad to worse and added poaching and chickenstalking to his other crimes and i grew tired of paying for his vices  i consulted the gardener and the gardener said he had known cats taken that way before  do you know of any cure for it i asked  well sir replied the gardener i have heard as how a dose of brickbat and pond is a good thing in a general way  well try him with a dose just before bed time i answered  the gardener administered it and we had no further trouble with him  poor thomas henry  it shows to one how a reputation for respectability may lie in the mere absence of temptation  born and bred in the atmosphere of the reform club what gentleman could go wrong  i was sorry for thomas henry and i have never believed in the moral influence of the country since     the city of the sea   they say the chroniclers who have written the history of that lowlying windswept coast that years ago the foam fringe of the ocean lay further to the east so that where now the north sea creeps among the treacherous sandreefs it was once dry land  in those days between the abbey and the sea there stood a town of seven towers and four rich churches surrounded by a wall of twelve stones thickness making it as men reckoned then a place of strength and much import and the monks glancing their eyes downward from the abbey garden on the hill saw beneath their feet its narrow streets gay with the ever passing of rich merchandise saw its many wharves and waterways ever noisy with the babel of strange tongues saw its many painted masts wagging their grave heads above the dormer roofs and quaintlycarved oak gables  thus the town prospered till there came a night when it did evil in the sight of god and man  those were troublous times to saxon dwellers by the sea for the danish waterrats swarmed round each river mouth scenting treasure from afar and by none was the white flash of their sharp strong teeth more often seen than by the men of eastern anglia and by none in eastern anglia more often than by the watchers on the walls of the town of seven towers that once stood upon the dry land but which now lies twenty fathom deep below the waters  many a bloody fight raged now without and now within its wall of twelve stones thickness many a groan of dying man many a shriek of murdered woman many a wail of mangled child knocked at the abbey door upon its way to heaven calling the tremblingmonks from their beds to pray for the souls that were passing by  but at length peace came to the longtroubled land dane and saxon agreeing to dwell in friendship side by side east anglia being wide and there being room for both  and all men rejoiced greatly for all were weary of a strife in which little had been gained on either side beyond hard blows and their thoughts were of the inglenook  so the longbearded danes their thirsty axes harmless on their backs passed to and fro in straggling bands seeking where undisturbed and undisturbing they might build their homes and thus it came about that haafager and his company as the sun was going down drew near to the town of seven towers that in those days stood on dry land between the abbey and the sea  and the men of the town seeing the danes opened wide their gates saying  we have fought but now there is peace  enter and make merry with us and tomorrow go your way  but haafager made answer  i am an old man i pray you do not take my words amiss  there is peace between us as you say and we thank you for your courtesy but the stains are still fresh upon our swords  let us camp here without your walls and a little later when the grass has grown upon the fields where we have striven and our young men have had time to forget we will make merry together as men should who dwell side by side in the same land  but the men of the town still urged haafager calling his people neighbours and the abbot who had hastened down fearing there might be strife added his words to theirs saying  pass in my children  let there indeed be peace between you that the blessing of god may be upon the land and upon both dane and saxon for the abbot saw that the townsmen were well disposed towards the danes and knew that men when they have feasted and drunk together think kinder of one another  then answered haafager who knew the abbot for a holy man  hold up your staff my father that the shadow of the cross your people worship may fall upon our path so we will pass into the town and there shall be peace between us for though your gods are not our gods faith between man and man is of all altars  and the abbot held his staff aloft between haafagers people and the sun it being fashioned in the form of a cross and under its shadow the danes passed by into the town of seven towers there being of them with the women and the children nearly two thousand souls and the gates were made fast behind them  so they who had fought face to face feasted side by side pledging one another in the wine cup as was the custom and haafagers men knowing themselves amongst friends cast aside their arms and when the feast was done being weary they lay down to sleep  then an evil voice arose in the town and said who are these that have come among us to share our land  are not the stones of our streets red with the blood of wife and child that they have slain  do men let the wolf go free when they have trapped him with meat  let us fall upon them now that they are heavy with food and wine so that not one of them shall escape  thus no further harm shall come to us from them nor from their children  and the voice of evil prevailed and the men of the town of seven towers fell upon the danes with whom they had broken meat even to the women and the little children and the blood of the people of haafager cried with a loud voice at the abbey door through the long night it cried saying  i trusted in your spoken word  i broke meat with you  i put my faith in you and in your god  i passed beneath the shadow of your cross to enter your doors  let your god make answer  nor was there silence till the dawn  then the abbot rose from where he knelt and called to god saying  thou hast heard o god  make answer  and there came a great sound from the sea as though a tongue had been given to the deep so that the monks fell upon their knees in fear but the abbot answered  it is the voice of god speaking through the waters  he hath made answer  and that winter a mighty storm arose the like of which no man had known before for the sea was piled upon the dry land until the highest tower of the town of seven towers was not more high and the waters moved forward over the dry land  and the men of the town of seven towers fled from the oncoming of the waters but the waters overtook them so that not one of them escaped  and the town of the seven towers and of the four churches and of the many streets and quays was buried underneath the waters and the feet of the waters still moved till they came to the hill whereon the abbey stood  then the abbot prayed to god that the waters might be stayed and god heard and the sea came no farther  and that this tale is true and not a fable made by the weavers of words he who doubts may know from the fisherfolk who today ply their calling amongst the reefs and sandbanks of that lonely coast  for there are those among them who peering from the bows of their small craft have seen far down beneath their keels a city of strange streets and many quays  but as to this i who repeat these things to you cannot speak of my own knowledge for this city of the sea is only visible when a rare wind blowing from the north sweeps the shadows from the waves and though on many a sunny day i have drifted where its seven towers should once have stood yet for me that wind has never blown pushing back the curtains of the sea and therefore i have strained my eyes in vain  but this i do know that the rumbling stones of that ancient abbey between which and the foam fringe of the ocean the town of seven towers once lay now stand upon a wavewashed cliff and that he who looks forth from its shattered mullions today sees only the marshland and the wrinkled waters hears only the plaint of the circling gulls and the weary crying of the sea  and that gods anger is not everlasting and that the evil that there is in men shall be blotted out he who doubts may also learn from the wisdom of the simple fisherfolk who dwell about the borders of the marshland for they will tell him that on stormy nights there speaks a deep voice from the sea calling the dead monks to rise from their forgotten graves and chant a mass for the souls of the men of the town of seven towers clothed in long glittering white they move with slowly pacing feet around the abbeys grassgrown aisles and the music of their prayers is heard above the screaming of the storm  and to this i also can bear witness for i have seen the passing of their shrouded forms behind the blackness of the shattered shafts i have heard their sweet sad singing above the wailing of the wind  thus for many ages have the dead monks prayed that the men of the town of seven towers may be forgiven  thus for many ages yet shall they so pray till the day come when of their once fair abbey not a single stone shall stand upon its fellow and in that day it shall be known that the anger of god against the men of the town of seven towers has passed away and in that day the feet of the waters shall move back and the town of seven towers shall stand again upon the dry land  there be some i know who say that this is but a legend who will tell you that the shadowy shapes that you may see with your own eyes on stormy nights waving their gleaming arms behind the ruined buttresses are but of phosphorescent foam tossed by the raging waves above the cliffs and that the sweet sad harmony cleaving the trouble of the night is but the aeolian music of the wind  but such are of the blind who see only with their eyes  for myself i see the whiterobed monks and hear the chanting of their mass for the souls of the sinful men of the town of seven towers  for it has been said that when an evil deed is done a prayer is born to follow it through time into eternity and plead for it  thus is the whole world clasped around with folded hands both of the dead and of the living as with a shield lest the shafts of gods anger should consume it  therefore i know that the good monks of this nameless abbey are still praying that the sin of those they love may be forgiven  god grant good men may say a mass for us     driftwood   characters   mr travers  mrs travers

man who will be able to entertain his guests decently  mrs travers  oh well james i dont know  none of us can afford to live up to the income we want people to think weve got  one must economise somewhere  a pretty figure we should cut in the county if i didnt know how to make fivepence look like a shilling  and besides there are certain people that one has to be civil to that at the same time one doesnt want to introduce into ones regular circle  if you take my advice marion you wont encourage those sisters of harrys more than you can help  theyre dear sweet girls and you can be very nice to them but dont have them too much about  their manners are terribly old fashioned and theyve no notion how to dress and those sort of people let down the tone of a house  marion  im not likely to have many dear sweet girls on my visiting list  with a laugh  there will hardly be enough in common to make the company desired on either side  mrs travers  well i only want you to be careful my dear  so much depends on how you begin and with prudence theres really no reason why you shouldnt do very well  i suppose theres no doubt about harrys income  he wont object to a few inquiries  marion

horribly businesslike way  one would think the girl was selling herself  mrs travers  oh dont be foolish james  one must look at the practical side of these things  marriage is a matter of sentiment

universe or a popular politician trying to understand what i was talking about and to believe it  and what am i  a newspaper reporter at threehapence a linei beg their pardon its occasionally twopence  marion  does it matter  dan  does it matter  does it matter whether a union jack or a tricolor floats over the turrets of badajoz yet we pour our blood into its ditches to decide the argument  does it matter whether one star more or less is marked upon our charts yet we grow blind peering into their depths  does it matter that one keel should slip through the grip of the polar ice yet nearer nearer to it we pile our whitening bones  and its worth playing the game of life  and theres a meaning in it  its worth playing if only that it strengthens the muscles of our souls  id like to have taken a hand in it  marion  why didnt you  dan  no partner  dull playing by oneself  no object  marion after a silence  what was she like  dan  so like you that there are times when i almost wish i had never met you  you set me thinking about myself and that is a subject i find it pleasanter to forget  marion  and this woman that was like meshe could have made a mans life  dan  ay  marion  wont you tell me about her  had she many faults  dan  enough to love her by  marion  but she must have been good  dan  good enough to be a woman  marion  that might mean so much or so little  dan  it should mean much to my thinking  there are few women  marion  few  i thought the economists held that there were too many of us  dan  not enoughnot enough to go round  that is why a true woman has many lovers  there is a silence between them  then marion rises but their eyes do not meet  marion  how serious we have grown  dan  they say a dialogue between a man and woman always does  marion she moves away then hesitating half returns  may i ask you a question  dan  that is an easy favour to grant  marion  ifif at any time you felt regard again for a woman would you for her sake if she wished it seek to gain even now that position in the world which is your rightwhich would make her proud of your friendshipwould make her feel that even her life had not been altogether without purpose  dan  too late  the old hack can only look over the hedge and watch the field race by  the old ambition stirs within me at timesespecially after a glass of good wineand harrys winegod bless himis excellentbut tomorrow morningwith a shrug of his shoulders he finishes his meaning  marion  then she could do nothing  dan  nothing for his fortunesmuch for himself  my dear young lady never waste pity on a man in lovenor upon a child crying for the moon the moon is a good thing to cry for  marion  i am glad i am like her  i am glad that i have met you  she gives him her hand and for a moment he holds it  then she goes out  a flower has fallen from her breast whether by chance or meaning he knows not  he picks it up and kisses it stands twirling it undecided for a second then lets it fall
