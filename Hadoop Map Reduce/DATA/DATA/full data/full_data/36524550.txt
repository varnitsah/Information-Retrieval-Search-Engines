paine  volume i   by mark twain     foreword  nowhere is the human being more truly revealed than in his letters not in literary lettersprepared with care and the thought of possible publicationbut in those letters wrought out of the press of circumstances and with no idea of print in mind a collection of such documents written by one whose life has become of interest to mankind at large has a value quite aside from literature in that it reflects in some degree at least the soul of the writer  the letters of mark twain are peculiarly of the revealing sort he was a man of few restraints and of no affectations in his correspondence as in his talk he spoke what was in his mind untrammeled by literary conventions  necessarily such a collection does not constitute a detailed life story but is supplementary to it an extended biography of mark twain has already been published his letters are here gathered for those who wish to pursue the subject somewhat more exhaustively from the strictly personal side selections from this correspondence were used in the biography mentioned most of these are here reprinted in the belief that an owner of the letters will wish the collection to be reasonably complete        etext editors note  a b paine considers this compendium      a supplement to his mark twain a biography i have      arranged the volumes of the letters to correspond as      closely as possible with the dates of the project gutenberg      six volumes of the biography  dw      mark twaina biographical summary  samuel langhorne clemens for nearly half a century known and celebrated as mark twain was born in florida missouri on november 30 1835 he was one of the foremost american philosophers of his day he was the worlds most famous humorist of any day during the later years of his life he ranked not only as americas chief man of letters but likewise as her best known and best loved citizen  the beginnings of that life were sufficiently unpromising the family was a good one of old virginia and kentucky stock but its circumstances were reduced its environment meager and disheartening the father john marshall clemensa lawyer by profession a merchant by vocationhad brought his household to florida from jamestown tennessee somewhat after the manner of judge hawkins as pictured in the gilded age florida was a small town then a mere village of twentyone houses located on salt river but judge clemens as he was usually called optimistic and speculative in his temperament believed in its future salt river would be made navigable florida would become a metropolis he established a small business there and located his family in the humble frame cottage where five months later was born a baby boy to whom they gave the name of samuela family nameand added langhorne after an old virginia friend of his father  the child was puny and did not make a very sturdy fight for life still he weathered along season after season and survived two stronger children margaret and benjamin by 1839 judge clemens had lost faith in florida he removed his family to hannibal and in this mississippi river town the little lad whom the world was to know as mark twain spent his early life in tom sawyer we have a picture of the hannibal of those days and the atmosphere of his boyhood there  his schooling was brief and of a desultory kind it ended one day in 1847 when his father died and it became necessary that each one should help somewhat in the domestic crisis his brother orion ten years his senior was already a printer by trade pamela his sister also considerably older had acquired music and now took a few pupils the little boy sam at twelve was apprenticed to a printer named ament his wages consisted of his board and clothesmore board than clothes as he once remarked to the writer  he remained with ament until his brother orion bought out a small paper in hannibal in 1850 the paper in time was moved into a part of the clemens home and the two brothers ran it the younger setting most of the type a still younger brother henry entered the office as an apprentice the hannibal journal was no great paper from the beginning and it did not improve with time still it managed to survivecountry papers nearly always manage to surviveyear after year bringing in some sort of return it was on this paper that young sam clemens began his writingsburlesque as a rule of local characters and conditionsusually published in his brothers absence generally resulting in trouble on his return yet they made the paper sell and if orion had but realized his brothers talent he might have turned it into capital even then  in 1853 he was not yet eighteen sam clemens grew tired of his limitations and pined for the wider horizon of the world he gave out to his family that he was going to st louis but he kept on to new york where a worlds fair was then going on in new york he found employment at his trade and during the hot months of 1853 worked in a printingoffice in cliff street by and by he went to philadelphia where he worked a brief time made a trip to washington and presently set out for the west again after an absence of more than a year  onion meanwhile had established himself at muscatine iowa but soon after removed to keokuk where the brothers were once more together till following their trade young sam clemens remained in keokuk until the winter of 185657 when he caught a touch of the southamerican fever then prevalent and decided to go to brazil he left keokuk for cincinnati worked that winter in a printingoffice there and in april took the little steamer paul jones for new orleans where he expected to find a southamerican vessel in life on the mississippi we have his story of how he met horace bixby and decided to become a pilot instead of a south american adventurerjauntily setting himself the stupendous task of learning the twelve hundred miles of the mississippi river between st louis and new orleansof knowing it as exactly and as unfailingly even in the dark as one knows the way to his own features it seems incredible to those who knew mark twain in his later yearsdreamy unpractical and indifferent to detailsthat he could have acquired so vast a store of minute facts as were required by that task yet within eighteen months he had become not only a pilot but one of the best and most careful pilots on the river intrusted with some of the largest and most valuable steamers he continued in that profession for two and a half years longer and during that time met with no disaster that cost his owners a single dollar for damage  then the war broke out south carolina seceded in december 1860 and other states followed clemens was in new orleans in january 1861 when louisiana seceded and his boat was put into the confederate service and sent up the red river his occupation gone he took steamer for the norththe last one before the blockade closed a blank cartridge was fired at them from jefferson barracks when they reached st louis but they did not understand the signal and kept on presently a shell carried away part of the pilothouse and considerably disturbed its inmates they realized then that war had really begun  in those days clemenss sympathies were with the south he hurried up to hannibal and enlisted with a company of young fellows who were recruiting with the avowed purpose of throwing off the yoke of the invader they were ready for the field presently and set out in good order a sort of nondescript cavalry detachment mounted on animals more picturesque than beautiful still it was a resolute band and might have done very well only it rained a good deal which made soldiering disagreeable and hard lieutenant clemens resigned at the end of two weeks and decided to go to nevada with orion who was a union abolitionist and had received an appointment from lincoln as secretary of the new territory  in roughing it mark twain gives us the story of the overland journey made by the two brothers and a picture of experiences at the other endtrue in aspect even if here and there elaborated in detail he was orions private secretary but there was no privatesecretary work to do and no salary attached to the position the incumbent presently went to mining adding that to his other trades  he became a professional miner but not a rich one he was at aurora california in the esmeralda district skimping along with not much to eat and less to wear when he was summoned by joe goodman owner and editor of the virginia city enterprise to come up and take the local editorship of that paper he had been contributing sketches to it now and then under the pen name of josh and goodman a man of fine literary instincts recognized a talent full of possibilities this was in the late summer of 1862 clemens walked one hundred and thirty miles over very bad roads to take the job and arrived wayworn and travelstained he began on a salary of twentyfive dollars a week picking up news items here and there and contributing occasional sketches burlesques hoaxes and the like when the legislature convened at carson city he was sent down to report it and then for the first time began signing his articles mark twain a river term used in making soundings recalled from his piloting days the name presently became known up and down the pacific coast his articles were copied and commented upon he was recognized as one of the foremost among a little coterie of overland writers two of whom mark twain and bret harte were soon to acquire a worldwide fame  he left carson city one day after becoming involved in a duel the result of an editorial squib written in goodmans absence and went across the sierras to san francisco the duel turned out farcically enough but the nevada law which regarded even a challenge or its acceptance as a felony was an inducement to his departure furthermore he had already aspired to a wider field of literary effort he attached himself to the morning call and wrote occasionally for one or two literary papersthe golden era and the californianprospering well enough during the better part of the year bret harte and the rest of the little pacificslope group were also on the staff of these papers and for a time at least the new school of american humor mustered in san francisco  the connection with the call was not congenial in due course it came to a natural end and mark twain arranged to do a daily san francisco letter for his old paper the enterprise the enterprise letters stirred up trouble they criticized the police of san francisco so severely that the officials found means of making the writers life there difficult and comfortless with jim gillis brother of a printer of whom he was fond and who had been the indirect cause of his troubles he went up into calaveras county to a cabin on jackass hill jim gillis a lovable picturesque character the truthful james of bret harte owned mining claims mark twain decided to spend his vacation in pocketmining and soon added that science to his store of knowledge it was a halcyon happy three months that he lingered there but did not make his fortune he only laid the cornerstone  they tried their fortune at angels camp a place well known to readers of bret harte but it rained pretty steadily and they put in most of their time huddled around the single stove of the dingy hotel of angels telling yarns among the stories was one told by a dreary narrator named ben coon it was about a frog that had been trained to jump but failed to win a wager because the owner of a rival frog had surreptitiously loaded him with shot the story had been circulated among the camps but mark twain had never heard it until then the tale and the tiresome fashion of its telling amused him he made notes to remember it  their stay in angels camp came presently to an end one day when the mining partners were following the specks of gold that led to a pocket somewhere up the hill a chill dreary rain set in jim as usual was washing and clemens was carrying water the color became better and better as they ascended and gillis possessed with the mining passion would have gone on regardless of the rain clemens however protested and declared that each pail of water was his last finally he said in his deliberate drawl  jim i wont carry any more water this work is too disagreeable lets go to the house and wait till it clears up  gillis had just taken out a pan of earth bring one more pail sam he pleaded  i wont do it jim not a drop not if i knew there was a million dollars in that pan  they left the pan standing there and went back to angels camp the rain continued and they returned to jackass hill without visiting their claim again meantime the rain had washed away the top of the pan of earth left standing on the slope above angels and exposed a handful of nuggetspure gold two strangers came along and observing it had sat down to wait until the thirtyday claimnotice posted by jim gillis should expire they did not mind the rainnot with that gold in sightand the minute the thirty days were up they followed the lead a few pans further and took outsome say ten some say twenty thousand dollars it was a good pocket mark twain missed it by one pail of water still it is just as well perhaps when one remembers the jumping frog  matters having quieted down in san francisco he returned and took up his work again artemus ward whom he had met in virginia city wrote him for something to use in his wards new book clemens sent the frog story but he had been dilatory in preparing it and when it reached new york carleton the publisher had wards book about ready for the press it did not seem worth while to carleton to include the frog story and handed it over to henry clapp editor of the saturday pressa perishing sheetsaying  here clapp heres something you can use  the story appeared in the saturday press of november 18 1865 according to the accounts of that time it set all new york in a roar which annoyed rather than gratified its author he had thought very little of it indeed yet had been wondering why some of his more highly regarded work had not found fuller recognition  but the jumping frog did not die papers printed it and reprinted it and it was translated into foreign tongues the name of mark twain became known as the author of that sketch and the two were permanently associated from the day of its publication  such fame as it brought did not yield heavy financial return its author continued to win a more or less precarious livelihood doing miscellaneous work until march 1866 when he was employed by the sacramento union to contribute a series of letters from the sandwich islands they were notable letters widely read and freely copied and the sojourn there was a generally fortunate one it was during his stay in the islands that the survivors of the wrecked vessel the hornet came in after long privation at sea clemens was sick at the time but anson burlingame who was in honolulu on the way to china had him carried in a cot to the hospital where he could interview the surviving sailors and take down their story it proved a great beat for the union and added considerably to its authors prestige on his return to san francisco he contributed an article on the hornet disaster to harpers magazine and looked forward to its publication as a beginning of a real career but alas when it appeared the printer and the proofreader had somehow converted mark twain into mark swain and his dreams perished  undecided as to his plans he was one day advised by a friend to deliver a lecture he was already known as an entertaining talker and his adviser judged his possibilities well in roughing it we find the story of that first lecture and its success he followed it with other lectures up and down the coast he had added one more profession to his intellectual stock in trade  mark twain now provided with money decided to pay a visit to his people he set out for the east in december 1866 via panama arriving in new york in january a few days later he was with his mother then living with his sister in st louis a little later he lectured in keokuk and in hannibal his old home  it was about this time that the first great mediterranean steamship excursion began to be exploited no such ocean picnic had ever been planned before and it created a good deal of interest east and west mark twain heard of it and wanted to go he wrote to friends on the alta california of san francisco and the publishers of that paper had sufficient faith to advance the money for his passage on the understanding that he was to contribute frequent letters at twenty dollars apiece it was a liberal offer as rates went in those days and a godsend in the fullest sense of the word to mark twain  clemens now hurried to new york in order to be there in good season for the sailing date which was in june in new york he met frank fuller whom he had known as territorial governor of utah an energetic and enthusiastic admirer of the western humorist fuller immediately proposed that clemens give a lecture in order to establish his reputation on the atlantic coast clemens demurred but fuller insisted and engaged cooper union for the occasion not many tickets were sold fuller however always ready for an emergency sent out a flood of complimentaries to the schoolteachers of new york and adjacent territory and the house was crammed it turned out to be a notable event mark twain was at his best that night the audience laughed until as some of them declared when the lecture was over they were too weak to leave their seats his success as a lecturer was assured  the quaker city was the steamer selected for the great oriental tour it sailed as advertised june 8 1867 and was absent five months during which mark twain contributed regularly to the altacalifornia and wrote several letters for the new york tribune they were read and copied everywhere they preached a new gospel in travel literaturea gospel of seeing with an overflowing honesty a gospel of sincerity in according praise to whatever he considered genuine and ridicule to the things believed to be shams it was a gospel that mark twain continued to preach during his whole career it became in fact his chief literary message to the world a world ready for that message  he returned to find himself famous publishers were ready with plans for collecting the letters in book form the american publishing company of hartford proposed a volume elaborately illustrated to be sold by subscription he agreed with them as to terms and went to washington to prepare copy but he could not work quietly there and presently was back in san francisco putting his book together lecturing occasionally always to crowded houses he returned in august 1868 with the manuscript of the innocents abroad and that winter while his book was being manufactured lectured throughout the east and middle west making his headquarters in hartford and in elmira new york  he had an especial reason for going to elmira on the quaker city he had met a young man by the name of charles langdon and one day in the bay of smyrna had seen a miniature of the boys sister olivia langdon then a girl of about twentytwo he fell in love with that picture and still more deeply in love with the original when he met her in new york on his return the langdon home was in elmira and it was for this reason that as time passed he frequently sojourned there when the proofs of the innocents abroad were sent him he took them along and he and sweet livy langdon read them together what he lacked in those days in literary delicacy she detected and together they pruned it away she became his editor that wintera position which she held until her death  the book was published in july 1869 and its success was immediate and abundant on his weddingday february 2 1870 clemens received a check from his publishers for more than four thousand dollars royalty accumulated during the three months preceding the sales soon amounted to more than fifty thousand copies and had increased to very nearly one hundred thousand at the end of the first three years it was a book of travel its lowest price three dollars and fifty cents even with our increased reading population no such sale is found for a book of that description today and the innocents abroad holds its placestill outsells every other book in its particular field this in 1917 dw  mark twain now decided to settle down he had bought an interest in the express of buffalo new york and took up his residence in that city in a house presented to the young couple by mr langdon it did not prove a fortunate beginning sickness death and trouble of many kinds put a blight on the happiness of their first married year and gave them a distaste for the home in which they had made such a promising start a baby boy langdon clemens came along in november but he was never a strong child by the end of the following year the clemenses had arranged for a residence in hartford temporary at first later made permanent it was in hartford that little langdon died in 1872  clemens meanwhile had sold out his interest in the express severed his connection with the galaxy a magazine for which he was doing a department each month and had written a second book for the american publishing company roughing it published in 1872 in august of the same year he made a trip to london to get material for a book on england but was too much sought after too continuously feted to do any work he went alone but in november returned with the purpose of taking mrs clemens and the new baby susy to england the following spring they sailed in april 1873 and spent a good portion of the year in england and scotland they returned to america in november and clemens hurried back to london alone to deliver a notable series of lectures under the management of george dolby formerly managing agent for charles dickens for two months mark twain lectured steadily to london audiencesthe big hanover square rooms always filled he returned to his family in january 1874  meantime a home was being built for them in hartford and in the autumn of 1874 they took up residence in ita happy residence continued through seventeen yearswellnigh perfect years their summers they spent in elmira on quarry farma beautiful hilltop the home of mrs clemenss sister it was in elmira that much of mark twains literary work was done he had a special study there some distance from the house where he loved to work out his fancies and put them into visible form  it was not so easy to work at hartford there was too much going on the clemens home was a sort of general headquarters for literary folk near and far and for distinguished foreign visitors of every sort howells and aldrich used it as their halfway station between boston and new york and every foreign notable who visited america made a pilgrimage to hartford to see mark twain some even went as far as elmira among them rudyard kipling who recorded his visit in a chapter of his american notes kipling declared he had come all the way from india to see mark twain  hartford had its own literary group mrs harriet beecher stowe lived near the clemens home also charles dudley warner the clemens and warner families were constantly associated and the gilded age published in 1873 resulted from the friendship of warner and mark twain the character of colonel sellers in that book has become immortal and it is a character that only mark twain could create for though drawn from his mothers cousin james lampton it embodiesand in no very exaggerated degreecharacteristics that were his own the tendency to make millions was always imminent temptation was always hard to resist moneymaking schemes are continually being placed before men of means and prominence and mark twain to the day of his death found such schemes fatally attractive  it was because of the sellers characteristics in him that he invested in a typesettingmachine which cost him nearly two hundred thousand dollars and helped to wreck his fortunes by and by it was because of this characteristic that he invested in numberless schemes of lesser importance but no less disastrous in the end his one successful commercial venture was his association with charles l webster in the publication of the grant memoirs of which enough copies were sold to pay a royalty of more than four hundred thousand dollars to grants widowthe largest royalty ever paid from any single publication it saved the grant family from poverty yet even this triumph was a misfortune to mark twain for it led to scores of less profitable book ventures and eventual disaster  meanwhile he had written and published a number of books tom sawyer the prince and the pauper life on the mississippi huckleberry finn and a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court were among the volumes that had entertained the world and inspired it with admiration and love for their author in 187879 he had taken his family to europe where they spent their time in traveling over the continent it was during this period that he was joined by his intimate friend the rev joseph h twichell of hartford and the two made a journey the story of which is told in a tramp abroad  in 1891 the hartford house was again closed this time indefinitely and the family now five in number took up residence in berlin the typesettingmachine and the unfortunate publishing venture were drawing heavily on the family finances at this period and the cost of the hartford establishment was too great to be maintained during the next three years he was distracted by the financial struggle which ended in april 1894 with the failure of charles l webster  co mark twain now found himself bankrupt and nearly one hundred thousand dollars in debt it had been a losing fight with this bitter ending always in view yet during this period of hard hopeless effort he had written a large portion of the book which of all his works will perhaps survive the longesthis tender and beautiful story of joan of arc all his life joan had been his favorite character in the worlds history and during those trying months and years of the early ninetiesin berlin in florence in parishe was conceiving and putting his picture of that gentle girlwarrior into perfect literary form it was published in harpers magazineanonymously because as he said it would not have been received seriously had it appeared over his own name the authorship was presently recognized exquisitely reverently as the story was told it had in it the touch of quaint and gentle humor which could only have been given to it by mark twain  it was only now and then that mark twain lectured during these years he had made a reading tour with george w cable during the winter of 188485 but he abominated the platform and often vowed he would never appear before an audience again yet in 1895 when he was sixty years old he decided to rebuild his fortunes by making a reading tour around the world it was not required of him to pay his debts in full the creditors were willing to accept fifty per cent of the liabilities and had agreed to a settlement on that basis but this did not satisfy mrs clemens and it did not satisfy him they decided to pay dollar for dollar they sailed for america and in july 1895 set out from elmira on the long trail across land and sea mrs clemens and clara clemens joined this pilgrimage susy and jean clemens remaining at elmira with their aunt looking out of the car windows the travelers saw susy waving them an adieu it was a picture they would long remember  the reading tour was one of triumph high prices and crowded houses prevailed everywhere the authorreader visited australia new zealand india ceylon south africa arriving in england at last with the money and material which would pay off the heavy burden of debt and make him once more free before the world and in that hour of triumph came the heavy blow susy clemens never very strong had been struck down the first cable announced her illness the mother and clara sailed at once before they were halfway across the ocean a second cable announced that susy was dead the father had to meet and endure the heartbreak alone he could not reach america in time for the burial he remained in england and was joined there by the sorrowing family  they passed that winter in london where he worked at the story of his travels following the equator the proofs of which he read the next summer in switzerland the returns from it and from his reading venture wiped away mark twains indebtedness and made him free he could go back to america as he said able to look any man in the face again  yet he did not go immediately he could live more economically abroad and economy was still necessary the family spent two winters in vienna and their apartments there constituted a veritable court where the worlds notables gathered another winter in england followed and then in the latter part of 1900 they went homethat is to america mrs clemens never could bring herself to return to hartford and never saw their home there again  mark twains return to america was in the nature of a national event wherever he appeared throngs turned out to bid him welcome mighty banquets were planned in his honor  in a house at 14 west tenth street and in a beautiful place at riverdale on the hudson most of the next three years were passed then mrs clemenss health failed and in the autumn of 1903 the family went to florence for her benefit there on the 5th of june 1904 she died they brought her back and laid her beside susy at elmira that winter the family took up residence at 21 fifth avenue new york and remained there until the completion of stormfield at redding connecticut in 1908  in his later life mark twain was accorded high academic honors already in 1888 he had received from yale college the degree of master of arts and the same college made him a doctor of literature in 1901 a year later the university of his own state at columbia missouri conferred the same degree and then in 1907 came the crowning honor when venerable oxford tendered him the doctors robe  i dont know why they should give me a degree like that he said quaintly i never doctored any literaturei wouldnt know how  he had thought never to cross the ocean again but he declared he would travel to mars and back if necessary to get that oxford degree he appreciated its full meaningrecognition by the worlds foremost institution of learning of the achievements of one who had no learning of the institutionary kind he sailed in june and his sojourn in england was marked by a continuous ovation his hotel was besieged by callers two secretaries were busy nearly twenty hours a day attending to visitors and mail when he appeared on the street his name went echoing in every direction and the multitudes gathered on the day when he rose in his scarlet robe and black mortarboard to receive his degree he must have made a splendid picture in that dress with his crown of silver hair the vast assembly went wild what a triumph indeed for the little missouri printerboy it was the climax of a great career  mark twains work was always of a kind to make people talk always important even when it was mere humor yet it was seldom that there was always wisdom under it and purpose and these things gave it dynamic force and enduring life some of his aphorismsso quaint in form as to invite laughterare yet fairly startling in their purport his paraphrase when in doubt tell the truth is of this sort frankness is a jewel only the young can afford it he once said to the writer apropos of a little girls remark his daily speech was full of such things the secret of his great charm was his great humanity and the gentle quaintness and sincerity of his utterance  his work did not cease when the pressing need of money came to an end he was full of ideas and likely to begin a new article or story at any time he wrote and published a number of notable sketches articles stories even books during these later years among them that marvelous short storythe man that corrupted hadleyburg in that story as in most of his later work he proved to the world that he was much more than a humoristthat he was in fact a great teacher moralist philosopherthe greatest perhaps of his age  his life at stormfieldhe had never seen the place until the day of his arrival june 18 1908was a peaceful and serene old age not that he was really old he never was that his step his manner his point of view were all and always young he was fond of children and frequently had them about him he delighted in gamesespecially in billiardsand in building the house at stormfield the billiardroom was first considered he had a genuine passion for the sport without it his afternoon was not complete his mornings he was likely to pass in bed smokinghe was always smokingand attending to his correspondence and reading history and the sciences interested him and his bed was strewn with biographies and stories of astronomical and geological research the vastness of distances and periods always impressed him he had no head for figures but he would labor for hours over scientific calculations trying to compass them and to grasp their gigantic import i remember once finding him highly elated over the fact that he had figured out for himself the length in hours and minutes of a light year he showed me the pages covered with figures and was more proud of them than if they had been the pages of an immortal story then we played billiards but even his favorite game could not make him altogether forget his splendid achievement  it was on the day before christmas 1909 that heavy bereavement once more came into the life of mark twain his daughter jean long subject to epileptic attacks was seized with a convulsion while in her bath and died before assistance reached her he was dazed by the suddenness of the blow his philosophy sustained him he was glad deeply glad for the beautiful girl that had been released  i never greatly envied anybody but the dead he said when he had looked at her i always envy the dead  the coveted estate of silence times only absolute gift it was the one benefaction he had ever considered worth while  yet the years were not unkindly to mark twain they brought him sorrow but they brought him likewise the capacity and opportunity for large enjoyment and at the last they laid upon him a kind of benediction naturally impatient he grew always more gentle more generous more tractable and considerate as the seasons passed his final days may be said to have been spent in the tranquil light of a summer afternoon  his own end followed by a few months that of his daughter there were already indications that his heart was seriously affected and soon after jeans death he sought the warm climate of bermuda but his malady made rapid progress and in april he returned to stormfield he died there just a week later april 21 1910  any attempt to designate mark twains place in the worlds literary history would be presumptuous now yet i cannot help thinking that he will maintain his supremacy in the century that produced him i think so because of all the writers of that hundred years his work was the most human his utterances went most surely to the mark in the long analysis of the ages it is the truth that counts and he never approximated never compromised but pronounced those absolute verities to which every human being of whatever rank must instantly respond  his understanding of subjective human naturethe vast unwritten life withinwas simply amazing such knowledge he acquired at the fountainheadthat is from himself he recognized in himself an extreme example of the human being with all the attributes of power and of weakness and he made his exposition complete  the world will long miss mark twain his example and his teaching will be neither ignored nor forgotten genius defies the laws of perspective and looms larger as it recedes the memory of mark twain remains to us a living and intimate presence that today even more than in life constitutes a stately moral bulwark reared against hypocrisy and superstitiona mighty national menace to sham      mark twains letters     i early letters 1853 new york and philadelphia       we have no record of mark twains earliest letters  very likely      they were soiled pencil notes written to some school sweetheart      to becky thatcher perhapsand tossed across at lucky moments      or otherwise with happy or disastrous results  one of those      smudgy muchfolded school notes of the tom sawyer period would be      priceless today and somewhere among forgotten keepsakes it may      exist but we shall not be likely to find it  no letter of his      boyhood no scrap of his earlier writing has come to light except      his penciled name sam clemens laboriously inscribed on the inside      of a small worn purse that once held his meager almost nonexistent      wealth  he became a printers apprentice at twelve but as he      received no salary the need of a purse could not have been urgent      he must have carried it pretty steadily however from its      appearanceas a kind of symbol of hope maybea token of that      sellersoptimism which dominated his early life and was never      entirely subdued       no other writing of any kind has been preserved from sam clemenss      boyhood none from that period of his youth when he had served his      apprenticeship and was a capable printer on his brothers paper a      contributor to it when occasion served  letters and manuscripts of      those days have vanishedeven his contributions in printed form are      unobtainable  it is not believed that a single number of orion      clemenss paper the hannibal journal exists today       it was not until he was seventeen years old that sam clemens wrote a      letter any portion of which has survived  he was no longer in      hannibal  orions unprosperous enterprise did not satisfy him      his wish to earn money and to see the world had carried him first to      st louis where his sister pamela was living then to new york      city where a worlds fair in a crystal palace was in progress      the letter tells of a visit to this great exhibition  it is not      complete and the fragment bears no date but it was written during      the summer of 1853   fragment of a letter from sam l clemens to his sister pamela moffett in st louis summer of 1853   from the gallery second floor you have a glorious sightthe flags of the different countries represented the lofty dome glittering jewelry gaudy tapestry c with the busy crowd passing to and frotis a perfect fairy palacebeautiful beyond description  the machinery department is on the main floor but i cannot enumerate any of it on account of the lateness of the hour past 8 oclock it would take more than a week to examine everything on exhibition and as i was only in a little over two hours tonight i only glanced at about onethird of the articles and having a poor memory i have enumerated scarcely any of even the principal objects the visitors to the palace average 6000 dailydouble the population of hannibal the price of admission being 50 cents they take in about 3000  the latting observatory height about 280 feet is near the palacefrom it you can obtain a grand view of the city and the country round the croton aqueduct to supply the city with water is the greatest wonder yet immense sewers are laid across the bed of the hudson river and pass through the country to westchester county where a whole river is turned from its course and brought to new york from the reservoir in the city to the westchester county reservoir the distance is thirtyeight miles and if necessary they could supply every family in new york with one hundred barrels of water per day  i am very sorry to learn that henry has been sick he ought to go to the country and take exercise for he is not half so healthy as ma thinks he is if he had my walking to do he would be another boy entirely four times every day i walk a little over one mile and working hard all day and walking four miles is exercisei am used to it now though and it is no trouble where is it orions going to tell ma my promises are faithfully kept and if i have my health i will take her to ky in the springi shall save money for this tell jim and all the rest of them to write and give me all the news i am sorry to hear such bad news from will and captain bowen i shall write to will soon the chathamsquare post office and the broadway office too are out of my way and i always go to the general post office so you must write the direction of my letters plain new york city n y without giving the street or anything of the kind or they may go to some of the other offices it has just struck 2 am and i always get up at 6 and am at work at 7 you ask me where i spend my evenings where would you suppose with a free printers library containing more than 4000 volumes within a quarter of a mile of me and nobody at home to talk to i shall write to ella soon write soon                           truly your brother                                               sam  p s i have written this by a light so dim that you nor ma could not read by it        he was lodging in a mechanics cheap boardinghouse in duane street      and we may imagine the bareness of his room the feeble poverty of      his lamp       tell ma my promises are faithfully kept  it was the day when he      had left hannibal  his mother jane clemens a resolute wiry woman      of fortynine had put together his few belongings  then holding      up a little testament       i want you to take hold of the end of this sam she said and      make me a promise  i want you to repeat after me these words      i do solemnly swear that i will not throw a card or drink a drop      of liquor while i am gone       it was this oath repeated after her that he was keeping      faithfully  the will bowen mentioned is a former playmate one of      tom sawyers outlaw band  he had gone on the river to learn      piloting with an elder brother the captain  what the bad news      was is no longer remembered but it could not have been very      serious for the bowen boys remained on the river for many years      ella was samuel clemenss cousin and onetime sweetheart ella      creel  jim was jim wolfe an apprentice in orions office and      the hero of an adventure which long after mark twain wrote under the      title of jim wolfe and the cats       there is scarcely a hint of the future mark twain in this early      letter  it is the letter of a boy of seventeen who is beginning to      take himself rather seriouslywho finding himself for the first      time far from home and equal to his own responsibilities is willing      to carry the responsibility of others  henry his brother three      years younger had been left in the printingoffice with orion who      after a long profitless fight is planning to remove from hannibal      the young traveler is concerned as to the family outlook and will      furnish advice if invited  he feels the approach of prosperity and      will take his mother on a longcoveted trip to her old home in the      spring  his evenings  where should he spend them with a free      library of four thousand volumes close by  it is distinctly a      youthful letter a bit pretentious and wanting in the spontaneity      and humor of a later time  it invites comment now chiefly because      it is the first surviving document in the long human story       he was working in the printingoffice of john a gray and green on      cliff street and remained there through the summer  he must have      written more than once during this period but the next existing      letteralso to sister pamelawas written in october  it is      perhaps a shade more natural in tone than the earlier example and      there is a hint of mark twain in the first paragraph    to mrs moffett in st louis                                new york oct saturday 53  my dear sisteri have not written to any of the family for some time from the fact firstly that i didnt know where they were and secondly because i have been fooling myself with the idea that i was going to leave new york every day for the last two weeks i have taken a liking to the abominable place and every time i get ready to leave i put it off a day or so from some unaccountable cause it is as hard on my conscience to leave new york as it was easy to leave hannibal i think i shall get off tuesday though  edwin forrest has been playing for the last sixteen days at the broadway theatre but i never went to see him till last night the play was the gladiator i did not like parts of it much but other portions were really splendid in the latter part of the last act where the gladiator forrest dies at his brothers feet in all the fierce pleasure of gratified revenge the mans whole soul seems absorbed in the part he is playing and it is really startling to see him i am sorry i did not see him play damon and pythias the former character being his greatest he appears in philadelphia on monday night  i have not received a letter from home lately but got a journal the other day in which i see the office has been sold i suppose ma orion and henry are in st louis now if orion has no other project in his head he ought to take the contract for getting out some weekly paper if he cannot get a foremanship now for such a paper as the presbyterian containing about 60000sixty thousand ems type measurement he could get 20 or 25 per week and he and henry could easily do the work nothing to do but set the type and make up the forms  if my letters do not come often you need not bother yourself about me for if you have a brother nearly eighteen years of age who is not able to take care of himself a few miles from home such a brother is not worth ones thoughts and if i dont manage to take care of no 1 be assured you will never know it i am not afraid however i shall ask favors from no one and endeavor to be and shall be as independent as a woodsawyers clerk  i never saw such a place for military companies as new york go on the street when you will you are sure to meet a company in full uniform with all the usual appendages of drums fifes c i saw a large company of soldiers of 1812 the other day with a 76 veteran scattered here and there in the ranks and as i passed through one of the parks lately i came upon a company of boys on parade their uniforms were neat and their muskets about half the common size some of them were not more than seven or eight years of age but had evidently been welldrilled  passage to albany 160 miles on the finest steamers that ply the hudson is now 25 centscheap enough but is generally cheaper than that in the summer  i want you to write as soon as i tell you where to direct your letter i would let you know now if i knew myself i may perhaps be here a week longer but i cannot tell when you write tell me the whereabouts of the family my love to mr moffett and ella tell ella i intend to write to her soon whether she wants me to nor not                                truly your brother                                          saml l clemens        he was in philadelphia when he wrote the nest letter that has come      down to us and apparently satisfied with the change  it is a      letter to orion clemens who had disposed of his paper but      evidently was still in hannibal  an extended description of a trip      to fairmount park is omitted because of its length its chief      interest being the tendency it shows to descriptive writingthe      field in which he would make his first great fame  there is      however no hint of humor and only a mild suggestion of the author      of the innocents abroad in this early attempt  the letter as here      given is otherwise complete the omissions being indicated    to orion clemens in hannibal                                     philadelphia pa oct 261853  my dear brotherit was at least two weeks before i left new york that i received my last letter from home and since then not a word have i heard from any of you and now since i think of it it wasnt a letter either but the last number of the daily journal saying that that paper was sold and i very naturally supposed from that that the family had disbanded and taken up winter quarters in st louis therefore i have been writing to pamela till ive tired of it and have received no answer i have been writing for the last two or three weeks to send ma some money but devil take me if i knew where she was and so the money has slipped out of my pocket somehow or other but i have a dollar left and a good deal owing to me which will be paid next monday i shall enclose the dollar in this letter and you can hand it to her i know its a small amount but then it will buy her a handkerchief and at the same time serve as a specimen of the kind of stuff we are paid with in philadelphia for you see its against the law in pennsylvania to keep or pass a bill of less denomination than 5 i have only seen two or three bank bills since i have been in the state on monday the hands are paid off in sparkling gold fresh from the mint so your dreams are not troubled with the fear of having doubtful money in your pocket  i am subbing at the inquirer office one man has engaged me to work for him every sunday till the first of next april when i shall return home to take ma to ky and another has engaged my services for the 24th of next month and if i want it i can get subbing every night of the week i go to work at 7 oclock in the evening and work till 3 oclock the next morning i can go to the theatre and stay till 12 oclock and then go to the office and get work from that till 3 the next morning when i go to bed and sleep till 11 oclock then get up and loaf the rest of the day the type is mostly agate and minion with some bourgeois and when one gets a good agate takeagate minion etc sizes of type take a piece of work type measurement is by ems meaning the width of the letter mhe is sure to make money i made 250 last sunday and was laughed at by all the hands the poorest of whom sets 11000 on sunday and if i dont set 10000 at least next sunday ill give them leave to laugh as much as they want to out of the 22 compositors in this office 12 at least set 15000 on sunday  unlike new york i like this philadelphia amazingly and the people in it there is only one thing that gets my dander upand that is the hands are always encouraging me telling meits no use to get discouragedno use to be downhearted for there is more work here than you can do downhearted the devil i have not had a particle of such a feeling since i left hannibal more than four months ago i fancy theyll have to wait some time till they see me downhearted or afraid of starving while i have strength to work and am in a city of 400000 inhabitants when i was in hannibal before i had scarcely stepped out of the town limits nothing could have convinced me that i would starve as soon as i got a little way from home  the grave of franklin is in christ churchyard corner of fifth and arch streets they keep the gates locked and one can only see the flat slab that lies over his remains and that of his wife but you cannot see the inscription distinctly enough to read it the inscription i believe reads thus                          benjamin                            and         franklin                          deborah     i counted 27 cannons 6 pounders planted in the edge of the sidewalk in water st the other day they are driven into the ground about a foot with the mouth end upwards a ball is driven fast into the mouth of each to exclude the water they look like so many posts they were put there during the war i have also seen them planted in this manner round the old churches in n y  there is one fine custom observed in phila a gentleman is always expected to hand up a ladys money for her yesterday i sat in the front end of the bus directly under the drivers boxa lady sat opposite me she handed me her money which was right but lord a st louis lady would think herself ruined if she should be so familiar with a stranger in st louis a man will sit in the front end of the stage and see a lady stagger from the far end to pay her fare the phila bus drivers cannot cheat in the front of the stage is a thing like an office clock with figures from 0 to 40 marked on its face when the stage starts the hand of the clock is turned toward the 0 when you get in and pay your fare the driver strikes a bell and the hand moves to the figure 1that is one fare and paid for and there is your receipt as good as if you had it in your pocket when a passenger pays his fare and the driver does not strike the bell immediately he is greeted strike that bell will you  i must close now i intend visiting the navy yard mint etc before i write again you must write often you see i have nothing to write interesting to you while you can write nothing that will not interest me dont say my letters are not long enough tell jim wolfe to write tell all the boys where i am and to write jim robinson particularly i wrote to him from n y tell me all that is going on in hl                                     truly your brother                                                         sam        those were primitive times  imagine a passenger in these      easygoing days calling to a driver or conductor to strike      that bell       hl is his abbreviation for hannibal  he had first used      it in a title of a poem which a few years before during one      of orions absences he had published in the paper  to      mary in hannibal was too long to set as a display head in      single column  the poem had no great merit but under the      abbreviated title it could hardly fail to invite notice  it      was one of several things he did to liven up the circulation      during a brief period of his authority       the doubtful money he mentions was the paper issued by      private banks wild cat as it was called  he had been      paid with it in new york and found it usually at a      discountsometimes even worthless  wages and money were      both better in philadelphia but the fund for his mothers      trip to kentucky apparently did not grow very rapidly       the next letter written a month later is also to orion      clemens who had now moved to muscatine iowa and      established there a new paper with an old title the      journal    to orion clemens in muscatine iowa                                     philadelphia nov 28th 1853  my dear brotheri received your letter today i think ma ought to spend the winter in st louis i dont believe in that climateits too cold for her  the printers annual ball and supper came off the other night the proceeds amounted to about 1000 the printers as well as other people are endeavoring to raise money to erect a monument to franklin but there are so many abominable foreigners here and among printers too who hate everything american that i am very certain as much money for such a purpose could be raised in st louis as in philadelphia i was in franklins old office this morningthe north american formerly philadelphia gazette and there was at least one foreigner for every american at work there  how many subscribers has the journal got what does the jobwork pay and what does the whole concern pay  i will try to write for the paper occasionally but i fear my letters will be very uninteresting for this incessant nightwork dulls ones ideas amazingly  from some cause i cannot set type nearly so fast as when i was at home sunday is a long day and while others set 12 and 15000 yesterday i only set 10000 however i will shake this laziness off soon i reckon  how do you like freesoili would like amazingly to see a good oldfashioned negro                                    my love to all                                          truly your brother                                                         sam        we may believe that it never occurred to the young printer looking      up landmarks of ben franklin that time would show points of      resemblance between the great franklins career and his own  yet      these seem now rather striking  like franklin he had been taken      out of school very young and put at the printers trade like      franklin he had worked in his brothers office and had written for      the paper  like him too he had left quietly for new york and      philadelphia to work at the trade of printing and in time samuel      clemens like benjamin franklin would become a worldfigure      manysided human and of incredible popularity  the boy sam      clemens may have had such dreams but we find no trace of them       there is but one more letter of this early period  young clemens      spent some time in washington but if he wrote from there his      letters have disappeared  the last letter is from philadelphia and      seems to reflect homesickness  the novelty of absence and travel      was wearing thin    to mrs moffett in st louis                                     philadelphia dec 5 53  my dear sisteri have already written two letters within the last two hours and you will excuse me if this is not lengthy if i had the money i would come to st louis now while the river is open but within the last two or three weeks i have spent about thirty dollars for clothing so i suppose i shall remain where i am i only want to return to avoid nightwork which is injuring my eyes i have received one or two letters from home but they are not written as they should be and i know no more about what is going on there than the man in the moon one only has to leave home to learn how to write an interesting letter to an absent friend when he gets back i suppose you board at mrs hunters yetand that i think is somewhere in olive street above fifth philadelphia is one of the healthiest places in the union i wanted to spend this winter in a warm climate but it is too late now i dont like our present prospect for cold weather at all                                     truly your brother                                                         sam        but he did not return to the west for another half year  the      letters he wrote during that period have not survived  it was late      in the summer of 1854 when he finally started for st louis  he sat      up for three days and nights in a smokingcar to make the journey      and arrived exhausted  the river packet was leaving in a few hours      for muscatine iowa where his mother and his two brothers were now      located  he paid his sister a brief visit and caught the boat      wornout he dropped into his berth and slept the thirtysix hours      of the journey       it was early whenhe arrivedtoo early to arouse the family  in      the office of the little hotel where he waited for daylight he found      a small book  it contained portraits of the english rulers with      the brief facts of their reigns  young clemens entertained himself      by learning this information by heart  he had a fine memory for      such things and in an hour or two had the printed data perfectly      and permanently committed  this incidentally acquired knowledge      proved of immense value to him  it was his groundwork for all      english history     ii letters 185661 keokuk and the river end of piloting       there comes a period now of nearly four years when samuel clemens      was either a poor correspondent or his letters have not been      preserved  only two from this time have survivedhappily of      intimate biographical importance       young clemens had not remained in muscatine  his brother had no      inducements to offer and he presently returned to st louis where      he worked as a compositor on the evening news until the following      spring rooming with a young man named burrough a journeyman      chairmaker with a taste for the english classics  orion clemens      meantime on a trip to keokuk had casually married there and a      little later removed his office to that city  he did not move the      paper perhaps it did not seem worth while and in keokuk he      confined himself to commercial printing  the ben franklin book and      job office started with fair prospects  henry clemens and a boy      named dick hingham were the assistants and somewhat later when      brother sam came up from st louis on a visit an offer of five      dollars a week and board induced him to remain  later when it      became increasingly difficult to pay the five dollars orion took      his brother into partnership which perhaps relieved the financial      stress though the office methods would seem to have left something      to be desired  it is about at this point that the first of the two      letters mentioned was written  the writer addressed it to his      mother and sisterjane clemens having by this time taken up her      home with her daughter mrs moffett    to mrs clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                          keokuk iowa june 10th 1856  my dear mother  sisteri have nothing to write everything is going on well the directory is coming on finely i have to work on it occasionally which i dont like a particle i dont like to work at too many things at once they take henry and dick away from me too before we commenced the directory i could tell before breakfast just how much work could be done during the day and manage accordinglybut now they throw all my plans into disorder by taking my hands away from their work i have nothing to do with the bookif i did i would have the two book hands do more work than they do or else i would drop it it is not a mere supposition that they do not work fast enoughi know it for yesterday the two book hands were at work all day henry and dick all the afternoon on the advertisements and they set up five pages and a halfand i set up two pages and a quarter of the same matter after supper night before last and i dont work fast on such things they are either excessively slow motioned or very lazy i am not getting along well with the job work i cant work blindlywithout system i gave dick a job yesterday which i calculated he would set in two hours and i could work off in three and therefore just finish it by supper time but he was transferred to the directory and the job promised this morning remains untouched through all the great pressure of job work lately i never before failed in a promise of the kind                                          your son                                                    sam excuse brevity this is my 3rd letter tonight        samuel clemens was never celebrated for his patience we may imagine      that the disorder of the office tried his nerves  he seems on the      whole however to have been rather happy in keokuk  there were      plenty of young people there and he was a favorite among them  but      he had grown dissatisfied and when one day some weeks later there      fell into his hands an account of the riches of the newly explored      regions of the upper amazon he promptly decided to find his fortune      at the headwaters of the great southamerican river  the second      letter reports this momentous decision  it was written to henry      clemens who was temporarily absentprobably in hannibal    to henry clemens                                          keokuk august 5th 56  my dear brother ward and i held a long consultation sunday morning and the result was that we two have determined to start to brazil if possible in six weeks from now in order to look carefully into matters there and report to dr martin in time for him to follow on the first of march we propose going via new york now between you and i and the fence you must say nothing about this to orion for he thinks that ward is to go clear through alone and that i am to stop at new york or new orleans until he reports but that dont suit me my confidence in human nature does not extend quite that far i wont depend upon wards judgment or anybodys elsei want to see with my own eyes and form my own opinion but you know what orion is when he gets a notion into his head and more especially if it is an erroneous one the devil cant get it out again so i know better than to combat his arguments long but apparently yielded inwardly determined to go clear through ma knows my determination but even she counsels me to keep it from orion she says i can treat him as i did her when i started to st louis and went to new yorki can start to new york and go to south america although orion talks grandly about furnishing me with fifty or a hundred dollars in six weeks i could not depend upon him for ten dollars so i have feelers out in several directions and have already asked for a hundred dollars from one source keep it to yourself i will lay on my oars for awhile and see how the wind sets when i may probably try to get more mrs creel is a great friend of mine and has some influence with ma and orion though i reckon they would not acknowledge it i am going up there tomorrow to press her into my service i shall take care that ma and orion are plentifully supplied with south american books they have herndons report now ward and the dr and myself will hold a grand consultation tonight at the office we have agreed that no more shall be admitted into our company  i believe the guards went down to quincy today to escort our first locomotive home                           write soon                                     your brother                                                   sam        readers familiar with the life of mark twain know that none of the      wouldbe adventurers found their way to the amazon his two      associates gave up the plan probably for lack of means  young      clemens himself found a fiftydollar bill one bleak november day      blowing along the streets of keokuk and after duly advertising his      find without result set out for the amazon by way of cincinnati      and new orleans       i advertised the find and left for the amazon the same day he      once declared a statement which we may take with a literary      discount       he remained in cincinnati that winter 185657 working at his      trade  no letters have been preserved from that time except two      that were sent to a keokuk weekly the saturday post and as these      were written for publication and are rather a poor attempt at      burlesque humortheir chief feature being a pretended illiteracy      they would seem to bear no relation to this collection  he roomed      that winter with a rugged selfeducated scotchmana mechanic but      a man of books and philosophies who left an impress on mark twains      mental life       in april he took up once more the journey toward south america but      presently forgot the amazon altogether in the new career that opened      to him  all through his boyhood and youth samuel clemens had wanted      to be a pilot  now came the longdeferred opportunity  on the      little cincinnati steamer the paul jones there was a pilot named      horace bixby  young clemens idling in the pilothouse was one      morning seized with the old ambition and laid siege to bixby to      teach him the river  the terms finally agreed upon specified a fee      to bixby of five hundred dollars one hundred down the balance when      the pupil had completed the course and was earning money  but all      this has been told in full elsewhere and is only summarized here      because the letters fail to complete the story       bixby soon made some trips up the missouri river and in his absence      turned his apprentice or cub over to other pilots such being      the river custom  young clemens in love with the life and a      favorite with his superiors had a happy time until he came under a      pilot named brown  brown was illiterate and tyrannical and from      the beginning of their association pilot and apprentice disliked      each other cordially       it is at this point that the letters begin once morethe first      having been written when young clemens now twentytwo years old      had been on the river nearly a year  life with brown of course      was not all sorrow and in this letter we find some of the fierce      joy of adventure which in those days samuel clemens loved    to onion clemens and wife in keokuk iowa                                          saint louis march 9th 1858  dear brother and sisteri must take advantage of the opportunity now presented to write you but i shall necessarily be dull as i feel uncommonly stupid we have had a hard trip this time left saint louis three weeks ago on the pennsylvania the weather was very cold and the ice running densely we got 15 miles below town landed the boat and then one pilot second mate and four deck hands took the sounding boat and shoved out in the ice to hunt the channel they failed to find it and the ice drifted them ashore the pilot left the men with the boat and walked back to us a mile and a half then the other pilot and myself with a larger crew of men started out and met with the same fate we drifted ashore just below the other boat then the fun commenced we made fast a line 20 fathoms long to the bow of the yawl and put the men both crews to it like horses on the shore brown the pilot stood in the bow with an oar to keep her head out and i took the tiller we would start the men and all would go well till the yawl would bring up on a heavy cake of ice and then the men would drop like so many tenpins while brown assumed the horizontal in the bottom of the boat after an hours hard work we got back with ice half an inch thick on the oars sent back and warped up the other yawl and then george the first mentioned pilot and myself took a double crew of fresh men and tried it again this time we found the channel in less than half an hour and landed on an island till the pennsylvania came along and took us off the next day was colder still i was out in the yawl twice and then we got through but the infernal steamboat came near running over us we went ten miles further landed and george and i cleared out againfound the channel first trial but got caught in the gorge and drifted helplessly down the river the ocean spray came along and started into the ice after us but although she didnt succeed in her kind intention of taking us aboard her waves washed us out and that was all we wanted we landed on an island built a big fire and waited for the boat she started and ran aground it commenced raining and sleeting and a very interesting time we had on that barren sandbar for the next four hours when the boat got off and took us aboard the next day was terribly cold we sounded hat island warped up around a bar and sounded againbut in order to understand our situation you will have to read dr kane it would have been impossible to get back to the boat but the maria denning was aground at the head of the islandthey hailed uswe ran alongside and they hoisted us in and thawed us out we had then been out in the yawl from 4 oclock in the morning till half past 9 without being near a fire there was a thick coating of ice over men yawl ropes and everything else and we looked like rockcandy statuary we got to saint louis this morning after an absence of 3 weeksthat boat generally makes the trip in 2  henry was doing little or nothing here and i sent him to our clerk to work his way for a trip by measuring wood piles counting coal boxes and other clerkly duties which he performed satisfactorily he may go down with us again for i expect he likes our bill of fare better than that of his boarding house  i got your letter at memphis as i went down that is the best place to write me at the post office here is always out of my route somehow or other remember the direction slc steamer pennsylvania care duval  algeo wharfboat memphis i cannot correspond with a paper because when one is learning the river he is not allowed to do or think about anything else  i am glad to see you in such high spirits about the land and i hope you will remain so if you never get richer i seldom venture to think about our landed wealth for hope deferred maketh the heart sick  i did intend to answer your letter but i am too lazy and too sleepy now we have had a rough time during the last 24 hours working through the ice between cairo and saint louis and i have had but little rest  i got here too late to see the funeral of the 10 victims by the burning of the pacific hotel in 7th street ma says there were 10 hearses with the fire companies their engines in mourningfiremen in uniform the various benevolent societies in uniform and mourning and a multitude of citizens and strangers forming altogether a procession of 30000 persons one steam fire engine was drawn by four white horses with crape festoons on their heads                      well i amjustaboutasleep                                     your brother                                                   sam        among other things we gather from this letter that orion clemens      had faith in his brother as a newspaper correspondent though the      two contributions from cincinnati already mentioned were not      promising  furthermore we get an intimation of orions unfailing      confidence in the future of the landthat is to say the great      tract of land in eastern tennessee which in an earlier day his      father had bought as a heritage for his children  it is the same      tennessee land that had millions in it for colonel sellersthe      land that would become as orion clemens long afterward phrased it      the worry of three generations       the doctor kane of this letter is of course dr elisha kent kane      the american arctic explorer  any book of exploration always      appealed to mark twain and in those days kane was a favorite       the paragraph concerning henry and his employment on the      pennsylvania begins the story of a tragedy  the story has been      fully told elsewheremark twain a biography by same author      and need only be sketched briefly here  henry a gentle faithful      boy shared with his brother the enmity of the pilot brown  some      two months following the date of the foregoing letter on a down      trip of the pennsylvania an unprovoked attack made by brown upon      the boy brought his brother sam to the rescue  brown received a      good pummeling at the hands of the future humorist who though      upheld by the captain decided to quit the pennsylvania at new      orleans and to come up the river by another boat  the brown episode      has no special bearing on the main tragedy though now in retrospect      it seems closely related to it  samuel clemens coming up the river      on the a t lacey two days behind the pennsylvania heard a voice      shout as they approached the greenville mississippi landing       the pennsylvania is blown up just below memphis at ship island      one hundred and fifty lives lost       it was a true report  at six oclock of a warm midjune morning      while loading wood sixty miles below memphis the pennsylvanias      boilers had exploded with fearful results  henry clemens was among      the injured  he was still alive when his brother reached memphis on      the lacey but died a few days later  samuel clemens had idolized      the boy and regarded himself responsible for his death  the letter      that follows shows that he was overwrought by the scenes about him      and the strain of watching yet the anguish of it is none the less      real    to mrs onion clemens                                memphis tenn friday june 18th 1858  dear sister mollielong before this reaches you my poor henry my darling my pride my glory my all will have finished his blameless career and the light of my life will have gone out in utter darkness o god this is hard to bear hardened hopelessaye lostlostlost and ruined sinner as i ami even i have humbled myself to the ground and prayed as never man prayed before that the great god might let this cup pass from methat he would strike me to the earth but spare my brotherthat he would pour out the fulness of his just wrath upon my wicked head but have mercy mercy mercy upon that unoffending boy the horrors of three days have swept over methey have blasted my youth and left me an old man before my time mollie there are gray hairs in my head tonight for fortyeight hours i labored at the bedside of my poor burned and bruised but uncomplaining brother and then the star of my hope went out and left me in the gloom of despair men take me by the hand and congratulate me and call me lucky because i was not on the pennsylvania when she blew up may god forgive them for they know not what they say  mollie you do not understand why i was not on that boati will tell you i left saint louis on her but on the way down mr brown the pilot that was killed by the explosion poor fellow quarreled with henry without cause while i was steering henry started out of the pilothousebrown jumped up and collared himturned him half way around and struck him in the faceand him nearly six feet highstruck my little brother i was wild from that moment i left the boat to steer herself and avenged the insultand the captain said i was rightthat he would discharge brown in n orleans if he could get another pilot and would do it in st louis anyhow of course both of us could not return to st louis on the same boatno pilot could be found and the captain sent me to the a t lacey with orders to her captain to bring me to saint louis had another pilot been found poor brown would have been the lucky man  i was on the pennsylvania five minutes before she left n orleans and i must tell you the truth molliethree hundred human beings perished by that fearful disaster henry was asleepwas blown upthen fell back on the hot boilers and i suppose that rubbish fell on him for he is injured internally he got into the water and swam to shore and got into the flatboat with the other survivorshenry had returned once to the pennsylvania to render assistance to the passengers later he had somehow made his way to the flatboathe had nothing on but his wet shirt and he lay there burning up with a southern sun and freezing in the wind till the kate frisbee came along his wounds were not dressed till he got to memphis 15 hours after the explosion he was senseless and motionless for 12 hours after that but may god bless memphis the noblest city on the face of the earth she has done her duty by these poor afflicted creaturesespecially henry for he has had fiveaye ten fifteen twenty times the care and attention that any one else has had dr peyton the best physician in memphis he is exactly like the portraits of webster sat by him for 36 hours there are 32 scalded men in that room and you would know dr peyton better than i can describe him if you could follow him around and hear each man murmur as he passes may the god of heaven bless you doctor the ladies have done well too our second mate a handsome noble hearted young fellow will die yesterday a beautiful girl of 15 stooped timidly down by his side and handed him a pretty bouquet the poor suffering boys eyes kindled his lips quivered out a gentle god bless you miss and he burst into tears he made them write her name on a card for him that he might not forget it  pray for me mollie and pray for my poor sinless brother                           your unfortunate brother                                          saml l clemens  p s i got here two days after henry        it is said that mark twain never really recovered from the tragedy      of his brothers deaththat it was responsible for the serious      pathetic look that the face of the worlds greatest laughmaker      always wore in repose       he went back to the river and in september of the same year after      an apprenticeship of less than eighteen months received his license      as a st louis and new orleans pilot and was accepted by his old      chief bixby as full partner on an important boat  in life on the      mississippi mark twain makes the period of his study from two to two      and a half years but this is merely an attempt to magnify his      dullness  he was in fact an apt pupil and a pilot of very high      class       clemens was now suddenly lifted to a position of importance  the      mississippi river pilot of those days was a person of distinction      earning a salary then regarded as princely  certainly two hundred      and fifty dollars a month was large for a boy of twentythree  at      once of course he became the head of the clemens family  his      brother orion was ten years older but he had not the gift of      success  by common consent the younger brother assumed permanently      the position of family counselor and financier  we expect him to      feel the importance of his new position and he is too human to      disappoint us  incidentally we notice an improvement in his      english  he no longer writes between you and i    fragment of a letter to orion clemens written at st louis in 1859   i am not talking nonsense nowi am in earnest i want you to keep your troubles and your plans out of the reach of meddlers until the latter are consummated so that in case you fail no one will know it but yourself  above all things between you and me never tell ma any of your troubles she never slept a wink the night your last letter came and she looks distressed yet write only cheerful news to her you know that she will not be satisfied so long as she thinks anything is going on that she is ignorant ofand she makes a little fuss about it when her suspicions are awakened but that makes no difference i know that it is better that she be kept in the dark concerning all things of an unpleasant nature she upbraids me occasionally for giving her only the bright side of my affairs but unfortunately for her she has to put up with it for i know that troubles that i curse awhile and forget would disturb her slumbers for some time parenthesis no 2possibly because she is deprived of the soothing consolation of swearing tell her the good news and me the bad  putting all things together i begin to think i am rather lucky than otherwisea notion which i was slow to take up the other night i was about to round to for a stormbut concluded that i could find a smoother bank somewhere i landed 5 miles below the storm camepassed away and did not injure us coming up day before yesterday i looked at the spot i first chose and half the trees on the bank were torn to shreds we couldnt have lived 5 minutes in such a tornado and i am also lucky in having a berth while all the young pilots are idle this is the luckiest circumstance that ever befell me not on account of the wagesfor that is a secondary considerationbut from the fact that the city of memphis is the largest boat in the trade and the hardest to pilot and consequently i can get a reputation on her which is a thing i never could accomplish on a transient boat i can bank in the neighborhood of 100 a month on her and that will satisfy me for the present principally because the other youngsters are sucking their fingers bless me what a pleasure there is in revenge and what vast respect prosperity commands why six months ago i could enter the rooms and receive only a customary fraternal greetingbut now they say why how are you old fellowwhen did you get in  and the young pilots who used to tell me patronizingly that i could never learn the river cannot keep from showing a little of their chagrin at seeing me so far ahead of them permit me to blow my horn for i derive a living pleasure from these things and i must confess that when i go to pay my dues i rather like to let the dd rascals get a glimpse of a hundred dollar bill peeping out from amongst notes of smaller dimensions whose face i do not exhibit you will despise this egotism but i tell you there is a stern joy in it  pilots did not remain long on one boat as a rule just why it is not so easy to understand perhaps they liked the experience of change perhaps both captain and pilot liked the pursuit of the ideal in the lighthearted letter that followswritten to a friend of the family formerly of hannibalwe get something of the uncertainty of the pilots engagements    to mrs elizabeth w smith in jackson cape girardeau county mo                                     st  louis oct 31 probably 1859  dear aunt betseyma has not written you because she did not know when i would get started down the river again  you see aunt betsey i made but one trip on the packet after you left and then concluded to remain at home awhile i have just discovered this morning that i am to go to new orleans on the col chambersfine lightdraught swiftrunning passenger steamerall modern accommodations and improvementsthrough with dispatchfor freight or passage apply on board or tobuti have forgotten the agents namehowever it makes no differenceand as i was saying or had intended to say aunt betsey probably if you are ready to come up you had better take the ben lewis the best boat in the packet line she will be at cape girardeau at noon on saturday day after tomorrow and will reach here at breakfast time sunday if mr hamilton is chief clerkvery well i am slightly acquainted with him and if messrs carter gray and dean somebody i have forgotten his other name are in the pilothousevery well againi am acquainted with them just tell mr gray aunt betseythat i wish him to place himself at your command  all the family are wellexcept myselfi am in a bad way againdisease love in its most malignant form hopes are entertained of my recovery however at the dinner tableexcellent symptomi am still as terrible as an army with banners  aunt betseythe wickedness of this worldbut i havent time to moralize this morning                                     goodbye                                          sam clemens        as we do not hear of this attack again the recovery was probably      prompt  his letters are not frequent enough for us to keep track of      his boats but we know that he was associated with bixby from time      to time and now and again with one of the bowen boys his old      hannibal schoolmates  he was reveling in the river life the ease      and distinction and romance of it  no other life would ever suit      him as well  he was at the age to enjoy just what it brought him      at the airy golden overweening age of youth    to orion clemens in keokuk iowa                                          st louis mch 1860  my dear broyour last has just come to hand it reminds me strongly of tom hoods letters to his family which i have been reading lately but yours only remind me of his for although there is a striking likeness your humour is much finer than his and far better expressed tom hoods wit in his letters has a savor of labor about it which is very disagreeable your letter is good that portion of it wherein the old sow figures is the very best thing i have seen lately its quiet style resembles goldsmiths citizen of the world and don quixotewhich are my beau ideals of fine writing  you have paid the preacher well that is good also what a man wants with religion in these breadless times surpasses my comprehension  pamela and i have just returned from a visit to the most wonderfully beautiful painting which this city has ever seenchurchs heart of the andeswhich represents a lovely valley with its rich vegetation in all the bloom and glory of a tropical summerdotted with birds and flowers of all colors and shades of color and sunny slopes and shady corners and twilight groves and cool cascadesall grandly set off with a majestic mountain in the background with its gleaming summit clothed in everlasting ice and snow i have seen it several times but it is always a new picturetotally newyou seem to see nothing the second time which you saw the first we took the opera glass and examined its beauties minutely for the naked eye cannot discern the little wayside flowers and soft shadows and patches of sunshine and halfhidden bunches of grass and jets of water which form some of its most enchanting features there is no slurring of perspective effect about itthe most distantthe minutest object in it has a marked and distinct personalityso that you may count the very leaves on the trees when you first see the tame ordinarylooking picture your first impulse is to turn your back upon it and say humbugbut your third visit will find your brain gasping and straining with futile efforts to take all the wonder inand appreciate it in its fulnessand understand how such a miracle could have been conceived and executed by human brain and human hands you will never get tired of looking at the picture but your reflectionsyour efforts to grasp an intelligible somethingyou hardly know whatwill grow so painful that you will have to go away from the thing in order to obtain relief you may find relief but you cannot banish the pictureit remains with you still it is in my mind nowand the smallest feature could not be removed without my detecting it so much for the heart of the andes  ma was delighted with her trip but she was disgusted with the girls for allowing me to embrace and kiss themand she was horrified at the schottische as performed by miss castle and myself she was perfectly willing for me to dance until 12 oclock at the imminent peril of my going to sleep on the after watchbut then she would top off with a very inconsistent sermon on dancing in general ending with a terrific broadside aimed at that heresy of heresies the schottische  i took ma and the girls in a carriage round that portion of new orleans where the finest gardens and residences are to be seen and although it was a blazing hot dusty day they seemed hugely delighted to use an expression which is commonly ignored in polite society they were hellbent on stealing some of the lusciouslooking oranges from branches which overhung the fences but i restrained them they were not aware before that shrubbery could be made to take any queer shape which a skilful gardener might choose to twist it into so they found not only beauty but novelty in their visit we went out to lake pontchartrain in the cars                                   your brother                                               sam clemens        we have not before heard of miss castle who appears to have been      one of the girls who accompanied jane clemens on the trip which her      son gave her to new orleans but we may guess that the other was his      cousin and good comrade ella creel  one wishes that he might have      left us a more extended account of that longago river journey a      fuller glimpse of a golden age that has vanished as completely as      the days of washington       we may smile at the natural youthful desire to air his reading and      his art appreciation and we may find his opinions not without      interest  we may even commend themin part  perhaps we no longer      count the leaves on churchs trees but goldsmith and cervantes      still deserve the place assigned them       he does not tell us what boat he was on at this time but later in      the year he was with bixby again on the alonzo child  we get a bit      of the pilot in port in his next    to orion clemens in keokuk iowa                           alonzo child n orleans sep 28th 1860  dear brotheri just received yours and mollies letter yesterdaythey had been here two weeksforwarded from st louis we got here yesterdaywill leave at noon today of course i have had no time in 24 hours to do anything therefore ill answer after we are under way again yesterday i had many things to do but bixby and i got with the pilots of two other boats and went off dissipating on a ten dollar dinner at a french restaurant breathe it not unto mawhere we ate sheephead fish with mushrooms shrimps and oystersbirdscoffee with brandy burnt in it c cate drank and smoked from 2 pm until 5 oclock and thenthen the day was too far gone to do any thing  please find enclosed and acknowledge receipt of2000                                     in haste                                          sam l clemens        it should be said perhaps that when he became pilot jane clemens      had released her son from his pledge in the matter of cards and      liquor  this license did not upset him however  he cared very      little for either of these dissipations  his one great indulgence      was tobacco a matter upon which he was presently to receive some      grave counsel  he reports it in his next letter a sufficiently      interesting document  the clairvoyant of this visit was madame      caprell famous in her day  clemens had been urged to consult her      and one idle afternoon concluded to make the experiment  the letter      reporting the matter to his brother is fragmentary and is the last      remaining to us of the piloting period    fragment of a letter to orion clemens in keokuk iowa                                          new orleans february 6 1862   shes a very pleasant little ladyrather prettyabout 28say 5 feet 2 and one quarterwould weigh 116has black eyes and hairis polite and intelligentused good language and talks much faster than i do  she invited me into the little back parlor closed the door and we were alone we sat down facing each other then she asked my age then she put her hands before her eyes a moment and commenced talking as if she had a good deal to say and not much time to say it in something after this style  madame yours is a watery planet you gain your livelihood on the water but you should have been a lawyerthere is where your talents lie you might have distinguished yourself as an orator or as an editor you have written a great deal you write wellbut you are rather out of practice no matteryou will be in practice some day you have a superb constitution and as excellent health as any man in the world you have great powers of endurance in your profession your strength holds out against the longest sieges without flagging still the upper part of your lungs the top of them is slightly affectedyou must take care of yourself you do not drink but you use entirely too much tobacco and you must stop it mind not moderate but stop the use of it totally then i can almost promise you 86 when you will surely die otherwise look out for 28 31 34 47 and 65 be carefulfor you are not of a longlived race that is on your fathers side you are the only healthy member of your family and the only one in it who has anything like the certainty of attaining to a great ageso stop using tobacco and be careful of yourself in some respects you take after your father but you are much more like your mother who belongs to the longlived energetic side of the house you never brought all your energies to bear upon any subject but what you accomplished itfor instance you are selfmade selfeducated  s l c which proves nothing  madame dont interrupt when you sought your present occupation you found a thousand obstacles in the wayobstacles unknownnot even suspected by any save you and me since you keep such matters to yourselfbut you fought your way and hid the long struggle under a mask of cheerfulness which saved your friends anxiety on your account to do all this requires all the qualities i have named  s l c you flatter well madame  madame dont interrupt up to within a short time you had always lived from hand to mouthnow you are in easy circumstancesfor which you need give credit to no one but yourself the turning point in your life occurred in 184078  s l c which was  madame a death perhaps and this threw you upon the world and made you what you are it was always intended that you should make yourself therefore it was well that this calamity occurred as early as it did you will never die of water although your career upon it in the future seems well sprinkled with misfortune you will continue upon the water for some time yet you will not retire finally until ten years from now what is your brothers age 35and a lawyer and in pursuit of an office well he stands a better chance than the other two and he may get it he is too visionaryis always flying off on a new hobby this will never dotell him i said so he is a good lawyera very good lawyerand a fine speakeris very popular and much respected and makes many friends but although he retains their friendship he loses their confidence by displaying his instability of character the land he has now will be very valuable after a while  s l c say a 50 years hence or thereabouts madame  madame noless timebut never mind the land that is a secondary considerationlet him drop that for the present and devote himself to his business and politics with all his might for he must hold offices under the government  after a while you will possess a good deal of propertyretire at the end of ten yearsafter which your pursuits will be literarytry the lawyou will certainly succeed i am done now if you have any questions to askask them freelyand if it be in my power i will answer without reservewithout reserve  i asked a few questions of minor importancepaid her 2and left under the decided impression that going to the fortune tellers was just as good as going to the opera and the cost scarcely a trifle moreergo i will disguise myself and go again one of these days when other amusements fail now isnt she the devil that is to say isnt she a right smart little woman  when you want money let ma know and she will send it she and pamela are always fussing about change so i sent them a hundred and twenty quarters yesterdayfiddlers change enough to last till i get back i reckon                                               sam        it is not so difficult to credit madame caprell with clairvoyant      powers when one has read the letters of samuel clemens up to this      point  if we may judge by those that have survived her prophecy of      literary distinction for him was hardly warranted by anything she      could have known of his past performance  these letters of his      youth have a value today only because they were written by the man      who later was to become mark twain  the squibs and skits which he      sometimes contributed to the new orleans papers were bright      perhaps and pleasing to his pilot associates but they were without      literary value  he was twentyfive years old  more than one author      has achieved reputation at that age  mark twain was of slower      growth at that age he had not even developed a definite literary      ambition  whatever the basis of madame caprells prophecy we must      admit that she was a good guesser on several matters a right smart      little woman as clemens himself phrased it       she overlooked one item however the proximity of the civil war      perhaps it was too close at hand for second sight  a little more      than two months after the caprell letter was written fort sumter was      fired upon  mask twain had made his last trip as a pilot up the      river to st louisthe nation was plunged into a four years      conflict       there are no letters of this immediate period  young clemens went      to hannibal and enlisting in a private company composed mainly of      old schoolmates went soldiering for two rainy inglorious weeks      by the end of which he had had enough of war and furthermore had      discovered that he was more of a union abolitionist than a      slaveholding secessionist as he had at first supposed      convictions were likely to be rather infirm during those early days      of the war and subject to change without notice  especially was      this so in a border state     iii letters 186162 on the frontier mining adventures journalistic beginnings       clemens went from the battlefront to keokuk where orion was      preparing to accept the appointment prophesied by madame caprell      orion was a stanch unionist and a member of lincolns cabinet had      offered him the secretaryship of the new territory of nevada  orion      had accepted and only needed funds to carry him to his destination      his pilot brother had the funds and upon being appointed private      secretary agreed to pay both passages on the overland stage which      would bear them across the great plains from st jo to carson city      mark twain in roughing it has described that glorious journey and      the frontier life that followed it  his letters form a supplement      of realism to a tale that is more or less fictitious though      marvelously true in color and background  the first bears no date      but it was written not long after their arrival august 14 1861      it is not complete but there is enough of it to give us a very fair      picture of carson city a wooden town its population two thousand      souls    part of a letter to mrs jane clemens in st louis                                date not given but sept or oct 1861  my dear motheri hope you will all come out here someday but i shant consent to invite you until we can receive you in style but i guess we shall be able to do that one of these days i intend that pamela shall live on lake bigler until she can knock a bull down with her fistsay about three months  tell everything as it isno better and no worse  well gold hill sells at 5000 per foot cash down wild cat isnt worth ten cents the country is fabulously rich in gold silver copper lead coal iron quick silver marble granite chalk plaster of paris gypsum thieves murderers desperadoes ladies children lawyers christians indians chinamen spaniards gamblers sharpers coyotes pronounced kiyoties poets preachers and jackass rabbits i overheard a gentleman say the other day that it was the ddest country under the sunand that comprehensive conception i fully subscribe to it never rains here and the dew never falls no flowers grow here and no green thing gladdens the eye the birds that fly over the land carry their provisions with them only the crow and the raven tarry with us our city lies in the midst of a desert of the purestmost unadulterated and compromising sandin which infernal soil nothing but that fagend of vegetable creation sagebrush ventures to grow if you will take a lilliputian cedar tree for a model and build a dozen imitations of it with the stiffest article of telegraph wireset them one foot apart and then try to walk through them youll understand provided the floor is covered 12 inches deep with sand what it is to wander through a sagebrush desert when crushed sage brush emits an odor which isnt exactly magnolia and equally isnt exactly polecat but is a sort of compromise between the two it looks a good deal like greasewood and is the ugliest plant that was ever conceived of it is gray in color on the plains sagebrush and greasewood grow about twice as large as the common geraniumand in my opinion they are a very good substitute for that useless vegetable greasewood is a perfectmost perfect imitation in miniature of a live oak treebarring the color of it as to the other fruits and flowers of the country there aint any except pulu or tuler or what ever they call ita species of unpoetical willow that grows on the banks of the carsona river 20 yards wide knee deep and so villainously rapid and crooked that it looks like it had wandered into the country without intending it and had run about in a bewildered way and got lost in its hurry to get out again before some thirsty man came along and drank it up i said we are situated in a flat sandy deserttrue and surrounded on all sides by such prodigious mountains that when you gaze at them awhileand begin to conceive of their grandeurand next to feel their vastness expanding your souland ultimately find yourself growing and swelling and spreading into a gianti say when this point is reached you look disdainfully down upon the insignificant village of carson and in that instant you are seized with a burning desire to stretch forth your hand put the city in your pocket and walk off with it  as to churches i believe they have got a catholic one here but like that one the new york fireman spoke of i believe they dont run her now now although we are surrounded by sand the greatest part of the town is built upon what was once a very pretty grassy spot and the streams of pure water that used to poke about it in rural sloth and solitude now pass through on dusty streets and gladden the hearts of men by reminding them that there is at least something here that hath its prototype among the homes they left behind them and up kings canon please pronounce canyon after the manner of the natives there are ranches or farms where they say hay grows and grass and beets and onions and turnips and other truck which is suitable for cowsyes and even irish potatoes also cabbage peas and beans  the houses are mostly frame unplastered but papered inside with floursacks sewed together and the handsomer the brand upon the sacks is the neater the house looks occasionally you stumble on a stone house on account of the dryness of the country the shingles on the houses warp till they look like short joints of stove pipe split lengthwise  remainder missing        in this letter is something of the wild freedom of the west which      later would contribute to his fame  the spirit of the frontierof      mark twainwas beginning to stir him       there had been no secretary work for him to do and no provision for      payment  he found his profit in studying human nature and in      prospecting native resources  he was not interested in mining not      yet  with a boy named john kinney he made an excursion to lake      biglernow tahoeand located a timber claim really of great      value  they were supposed to build a fence around it but they were      too full of the enjoyment of camplife to complete it  they put in      most of their time wandering through the stately forest or drifting      over the transparent lake in a boat left there by lumbermen  they      built themselves a brush house but they did not sleep in it  in      roughing it he writes it never occurred to us for one thing      and besides it was built to hold the ground and that was enough      we did not wish to strain it       they were having a glorious time when their campfire got away from      them and burned up their claim  his next letter of which the      beginning is missing describes the fire    fragment of a letter to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis   the level ranks of flame were relieved at intervals by the standardbearers as we called the tall dead trees wrapped in fire and waving their blazing banners a hundred feet in the air then we could turn from this scene to the lake and see every branch and leaf and cataract of flame upon its bank perfectly reflected as in a gleaming fiery mirror the mighty roaring of the conflagration together with our solitary and somewhat unsafe position for there was no one within six miles of us rendered the scene very impressive occasionally one of us would remove his pipe from his mouth and say superb magnificent beautiful butby the lord god almighty if we attempt to sleep in this little patch tonight well never live till morning for if we dont burn up well certainly suffocate but he was persuaded to sit up until we felt pretty safe as far as the fire was concerned and then we turned in with many misgivings when we got up in the morning we found that the fire had burned small pieces of drift wood within six feet of our boat and had made its way to within 4 or 5 steps of us on the south side we looked like lava men covered as we were with ashes and begrimed with smoke we were very black in the face but we soon washed ourselves white again  john d kinney a cincinnati boy and a firstrate fellow too who came out with judge turner was my comrade we staid at the lake four daysi had plenty of fun for john constantly reminded me of sam bowen when we were on our campaign in missouri but first and foremost for annies mollies and pamelas comfort be it known that i have never been guilty of profane language since i have been in this territory and kinney hardly ever swearsbut sometimes human nature gets the better of him on the second day we started to go by land to the lower camp a distance of three miles over the mountains each carrying an axe i dont think we got lost exactly but we wandered four hours over the steepest rockiest and most dangerous piece of country in the world i couldnt keep from laughing at kinneys distress so i kept behind so that he could not see me after he would get over a dangerous place with infinite labor and constant apprehension he would stop lean on his axe and look around then behind then ahead and then drop his head and ruminate awhilethen he would draw a long sigh and say wellcould any billygoat have scaled that place without breaking his   neck and i would reply noi dont think he could noyou dont think he could mimicking me why dont you curse the infernal place you know you want toi do and will curse the   thieving country as long as i live then we would toil on in silence for awhile finally i told himwell john what if we dont find our way out of this todaywell know all about the country when we do get out oh stuffi know enoughand too much about the dd villainous locality already finally we reached the camp but as we brought no provisions with us the first subject that presented itself to us was how to get back john swore he wouldnt walk back so we rolled a drift log apiece into the lake and set about making paddles intending to straddle the logs and paddle ourselves back home sometime or other but the lake objectedgot stormy and we had to give it up so we set out for the only house on this side of the lakethree miles from there down the shore we found the way without any trouble reached there before sundown played three games of cribbage borrowed a dugout and pulled back six miles to the upper camp as we had eaten nothing since sunrise we did not waste time in cooking our supper or in eating it either after supper we got out our pipesbuilt a rousing camp fire in the open airestablished a faro bank an institution of this country on our huge flat granite dining table and bet white beans till one oclock when john went to bed we were up before the sun the next morning went out on the lake and caught a fine trout for breakfast but unfortunately i spoilt part of the breakfast we had coffee and tea boiling on the fire in coffeepots and fearing they might not be strong enough i added more ground coffee and more tea butyou know mistakes will happeni put the tea in the coffeepot and the coffee in the teapotand if you imagine that they were not villainous mixtures just try the effect once  and so bella is to be married on the 1st of oct well i send her and her husband my very best wishes andi may not be herebut wherever i am on that night well have a rousing campfire and a jollification in honor of the event  in a day or two we shall probably go to the lake and build another cabin and fence and get everything into satisfactory trim before our trip to esmeralda about the first of november  what has become of sam bowen i would give my last shirt to have him out here i will make no promises but i believe if john would give him a thousand dollars and send him out here he would not regret it he might possibly do very well here but he could do little without capital  remember me to all my st louis and keokuk friends and tell challie and hallie renson that i heard a military band play what are the wild waves saying the other night and it reminded me very forcibly of them it brought ella creel and belle across the desert too in an instant for they sang the song in orions yard the first time i ever heard it it was like meeting an old friend i tell you i could have swallowed that whole band trombone and all if such a compliment would have been any gratification to them                           love to the young folks                                                    sam        the reference in the foregoing letter to esmeralda has to do      with mining plans  he was beginning to be mildly      interested and with his brother orion had acquired feet      in an esmeralda camp probably at a very small priceso      small as to hold out no exciting prospect of riches  in his      next letter he gives us the size of this claim which he has      visited his interest however still appears to be chiefly      in his timber claim on lake bigler tahoe though we are      never to hear of it again after this letter    to mrs moffett in st louis                                               carson city oct 25 1861  my dear sisteri have just finished reading your letter and mas of sept 8th how in the world could they have been so long coming you ask me if i have for gotten my promise to lay a claim for mr moffett by no means i have already laid a timber claim on the borders of a lake bigler which throws como in the shadeand if we succeed in getting one mr jones to move his sawmill up there mr moffett can just consider that claim better than bank stock jones says he will move his mill up next spring in that claim i took up about two miles in length by one in widthand the names in it are as follows sam l clemens wm a moffett thos nye and three others it is situated on sam clemens bayso named by capt nyeand it goes by that name among the inhabitants of that region i had better stop about the lake thoughfor whenever i think of it i want to go there and die the place is so beautiful ill build a country seat there one of these days that will make the devils mouth water if he ever visits the earth jim lampton will never know whether i laid a claim there for him or not until he comes here himself we have now got about 1650 feet of mining groundand if it proves good mr moffetts name will go inif not i can get feet for him in the spring which will be good you see pamela the trouble does not consist in getting mining groundfor that is plenty enoughbut the money to work it with after you get it is the mischief when i was in esmeralda a young fellow gave me fifty feet in the black warrioran unprospected claim the other day he wrote me that he had gone down eight feet on the ledge and found it eight feet thickand pretty good rock too he said he could take out rock now if there were a mill to crush itbut the mills are all engaged there are only four of them so if i were willing he would suspend work until spring i wrote him to let it alone at presentbecause you see in the spring i can go down myself and help him look after it there will then be twenty mills there orion and i have confidence enough in this country to think that if the war will let us alone we can make mr moffett rich without its ever costing him a cent of money or particle of trouble we shall lay plenty of claims for him but if they never pay him anything they will never cost him anything orion and i are not financiers therefore you must persuade uncle jim to come out here and help us in that line i have written to him twice to come i wrote him today in both letters i told him not to let you or ma know that we dealt in such romantic nonsense as brilliant prospects because i always did hate for anyone to know what my plans or hopes or prospects werefor if i kept people in ignorance in these matters no one could be disappointed but myself if they were not realized you know i never told you that i went on the river under a promise to pay bixby 500 until i had paid the money and cleared my skirts of the possibility of having my judgment criticised i would not say anything about our prospects now if we were nearer home but i suppose at this distance you are more anxious than you would be if you saw us every monthand therefore it is hardly fair to keep you in the dark however keep these matters to yourselves and then if we fail well keep the laugh in the family  what we want now is something that will commence paying immediately we have got a chance to get into a claim where they say a tunnel has been run 150 feet and the ledge struck i got a horse yesterday and went out with the attorneygeneral and the claimownerand we tried to go to the claim by a new route and got lost in the mountainssunset overtook us before we found the claimmy horse got too lame to carry me and i got down and drove him ahead of me till within four miles of townthen we sent rice on ahead bunker whose horse was in good condition undertook to lead mine and i followed after him darkness shut him out from my view in less than a minute and within the next minute i lost the road and got to wandering in the sage brush i would find the road occasionally and then lose it again in a minute or so i got to carson about nine oclock at night but not by the road i traveled when i left it the general says my horse did very well for awhile but soon refused to lead then he dismounted and had a jolly time driving both horses ahead of him and chasing them here and there through the sage brush it does my soul good when i think of it until he got to town when both animals deserted him and he cursed them handsomely and came home alone of course the horses went to their stables  tell sammy i will lay a claim for him and he must come out and attend to it he must get rid of that propensity for tumbling down though for when we get fairly started here i dont think we shall have time to pick up those who fall  that is stoughters house i expect that cousin jim has moved into this is just the country for cousin jim to live in i dont believe it would take him six months to make 100000 here if he had 3000 dollars to commence with i suppose he cant leave his family though  tell mrs benson i never intend to be a lawyer i have been a slave several times in my life but ill never be one again i always intend to be so situated unless i marry that i can pull up stakes and clear out whenever i feel like it  we are very thankful to you pamela for the papers you send we have received half a dozen or more and next to letters they are the most welcome visitors we have                                write oftener pamela                                              yr  brother                                                             sam   the cousin jim mentioned in this letter is the original of the character of colonel sellers whatever mark twains later opinion of cousin jim lamptons financial genius may have been he seems to have respected it at this time  more than three months pass until we have another letter and in that time the mining fever had become well seated mark twain himself was full of the sellers optimism and it was bound to overflow fortify as he would against it  he met with little enough encouragement with three companions in midwinter he made a mining excursion to the much exploited humboldt region returning emptyhanded after a month or two of hard experience this is the trip picturesquely described in chapters xxvii to xxxiii of roughing itit is set down historically in mark twain a biography harper  brothershe mentions the humboldt in his next letter but does not confess his failure    to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                               carson city feb 8 1862  my dear mother and sisterby george pamela i begin to fear that i have invoked a spirit of some kind or other which i will find some difficulty in laying i wasnt much terrified by your growing inclinations but when you begin to call presentiments to your aid i confess that i weaken mr moffett is right as i said beforeand i am not much afraid of his going wrong men are easily dealt withbut when you get the women started you are in for it you know but i have decided on two things viz any of you or all of you may live in california for that is the garden of eden reproducedbut you shall never live in nevada and secondly none of you save mr moffett shall ever cross the plains if you were only going to pikes peak a little matter of 700 miles from st jo you might take the coach and i wouldnt say a word but i consider it over 2000 miles from st jo to carson and the first 6 or 800 miles is mere fourth of july compared to the balance of the route but lord bless you a man enjoys every foot of it if you ever come here or to california it must be by sea mr moffett must come by overland coach though by all means he would consider it the jolliest little trip he ever took in his life either june july or august are the proper months to make the journey in he could not suffer from heat and three or four heavy army blankets would make the cold nights comfortable if the coach were full of passengers two good blankets would probably be sufficient if he comes and brings plenty of money and fails to invest it to his entire satisfaction i will prophesy no more  but i will tell you a few things which you wouldnt have found out if i hadnt got myself into this scrape i expect to return to st louis in julyper steamer i dont say that i will return then or that i shall be able to do itbut i expect toyou bet i came down here from humboldt in order to look after our esmeralda interests and my sorebacked horse and the bad roads have prevented me from making the journey yesterday one of my old esmeralda friends bob howland arrived here and i have had a talk with him he owns with me in the horatio and derby ledge he says our tunnel is in 52 feet and a small stream of water has been struck which bids fair to become a big thing by the time the ledge is reachedsufficient to supply a mill now if you knew anything of the value of water here you would perceive at a glance that if the water should amount to 50 or 100 inches we wouldnt care whether school kept or not if the ledge should prove to be worthless wed sell the water for money enough to give us quite a lift but you see the ledge will not prove to be worthless we have located near by a fine site for a mill and when we strike the ledge you know well have a millsite water power and payrock all handy then we shant care whether we have capital or not millfolks will build us a mill and wait for their pay if nothing goes wrong well strike the ledge in juneand if we do ill be home in july you know  pamela dont you know that undemonstrated human calculations wont do to bet on dont you know that i have only talked as yet but proved nothing dont you know that i have expended money in this country but have made none myself dont you know that i have never held in my hands a gold or silver bar that belonged to me dont you know that its all talk and no cider so far dont you know that people who always feel jolly no matter where they are or what happens to themwho have the organ of hope preposterously developedwho are endowed with an uncongealable sanguine temperamentwho never feel concerned about the price of cornand who cannot by any possibility discover any but the bright side of a pictureare very apt to go to extremes and exaggerate with 40horse microscopic power of course i never tried to raise these suspicions in your mind but then your knowledge of the fact that some peoples poor frail human nature is a sort of crazy institution anyhow ought to have suggested them to you now if i hadnt thoughtlessly got you into the notion of coming out here and thereby got myself into a scrape i wouldnt have given you that highlycolored paragraph about the mill etc because you know if that pretty little picture should fail and wash out and go the devil generally it wouldnt cost me the loss of an hours sleep but you fellows would be so much distressed on my account as i could possibly be if circumstances beyond my control were to prevent my being present at my own funeral butbut                 in the bright lexicon of youth                theres no such word as fail                                              and ill prove it  and look here i came near forgetting it dont you say a word to me about trains across the plains because i am down on that arrangement that sort of thing is played out you know the overland coach or the mail steamer is the thing  you want to know something about the route between california and nevada territory suppose you take my word for it that it is exceedingly jolly or take for a winter view j ross browns picture in harpers monthly of pack mules tumbling fifteen hundred feet down the side of a mountain why bless you theres scenery on that route you can stand on some of those noble peaks and see jerusalem and the holy land and you can start a boulder and send it tearing up the earth and crashing over treesdowndowndownto the very devil madam and you would probably stand up there and look and stare and wonder at the magnificence spread out before you till you starved to death if let alone but you should take someone along to keep you moving  since you want to know i will inform you that an eightstamp water mill put up and ready for business would cost about 10000 to 12000 then the water to run it with would cost from 1000 to 30000and even more according to the location what i mean by that is that water powers in this vicinity are immensely valuable so also in esmeralda but humboldt is a new country and things dont cost so much there yet i saw a good water power sold there for 75000 but here is the way the thing is managed a man with a good water power on carson river will lean his axe up against a tree provided you find him chopping cordwood at 4 a day and taking his chalk pipe out of his mouth to afford him an opportunity to answer your questions will look you coolly in the face and tell you his little property is worth forty or fifty thousand dollars but you can easily fix him you tell him that youll build a quartz mill on his property and make him a fourth or a third or half owner in said mill in consideration of the privilege of using said propertyand that will bring him to his milk in a jiffy so he spits on his hands and goes in again with his axe until the mill is finished when lo out pops the quondam woodchopper arrayed in purple and fine linen and prepared to deal in bankstock or bet on the races or take government loans with an air as to the amount of the most dont care addest unconcern that you can conceive of by george if i just had a thousand dollarsid be all right now theres the horatio for instance there are five or six shareholders in it and i know i could buy half of their interests at say 20 per foot now that flour is worth 50 per barrel and they are pressed for money but i am hard up myself and cant buyand in june theyll strike the ledge and then goodbye canary i cant get it for love or money twenty dollars a foot think of it for ground that is proven to be rich twenty dollars madamand we wouldnt part with a foot of our 75 for five times the sum so it will be in humboldt next summer the boys will get pushed and sell ground for a song that is worth a fortune but i am at the helm now i have convinced orion that he hasnt business talent enough to carry on a peanut stand and he has solemnly promised me that he will meddle no more with mining or other matters not connected with the secretarys office so you see if mines are to be bought or sold or tunnels run or shafts sunk parties have to come to meand me only im the firm you know  how long does it take one of those infernal trains to go through well anywhere between three and five months  tell margaret that if you ever come to live in california that you can promise her a home for a hundred years and a bully onebut she wouldnt like the country some people are malicious enough to think that if the devil were set at liberty and told to confine himself to nevada territory that he would come hereand look sadly around awhile and then get homesick and go back to hell again but i hardly believe it you know i am saying mind you that margaret wouldnt like the country perhapsnor the devil either for that matter or any other man but i like it when it rains here it never lets up till it has done all the raining it has got to doand after that theres a dry spell you bet why i have had my whiskers and moustaches so full of alkali dust that youd have thought i worked in a starch factory and boarded in a flour barrel  since we have been here there has not been a firealthough the houses are built of wood they holler fire sometimes though but i am always too late to see the smoke before the fire is out if they ever have any now they raised a yell here in front of the office a moment ago i put away my papers and locked up everything of value and changed my boots and pulled off my coat and went and got a bucket of water and came back to see what the matter was remarking to myself i guess ill be on hand this time any way but i met a friend on the pavement and he said where you been fires out half an hour ago  ma says axtele was above suspitionbut i have searched through websters unabridged and cant find the word however its of no consequencei hope he got down safely i knew axtele and his wife as well as i know dan haines mrs a once tried to embarrass me in the presence of company by asking me to name her baby when she was well aware that i didnt know the sex of that phenomenon but i told her to call it frances and spell it to suit herself that was about nine years ago and axtele had no property and could hardly support his family by his earnings he was a pious cuss though member of margaret sextons church  and ma says it looks like a man cant hold public office and be honest why certainly not madam a man cant hold public office and be honest lord bless you it is a common practice with orion to go about town stealing little things that happen to be lying around loose and i dont remember having heard him speak the truth since we have been in nevada he even tries to prevail upon me to do these things ma but i wasnt brought up in that way you know you showed the public what you could do in that line when you raised me madam but then you ought to have raised me first so that orion could have had the benefit of my example do you know that he stole all the stamps out of an 8 stamp quartz mill one night and brought them home under his overcoat and hid them in the back room                                yrs etc                                              sam        a little later he had headed for the esmeralda hills  some time in      february he was established there in a camp with a young man by the      name of horatio phillips raish  later he camped with bob howland      who as city marshal of aurora became known as the most fearless      man in the territory and still later with calvin h higbie cal      to whom roughing it would one day be dedicated  his own funds      were exhausted by this time and orion with his rather slender      salary became the financial partner of the firm       it was a comfortless life there in the esmeralda camp  snow covered      everything  there was nothing to do and apparently nothing to      report for there are no letters until april  then the first one is      dated carson city where he seems to be making a brief sojourn  it      is a rather heavy attempt to be lighthearted its playfulness      suggests that of a dancing bear    to mrs jane clemens in st louis                                          carson city april 2 1862  my dear motheryours of march 2nd has just been received i see i am in for it againwith annie but she ought to know that i was always stupid she used to try to teach me lessons from the bible but i never could understand them doesnt she remember telling me the story of moses one sunday last spring and how hard she tried to explain it and simplify it so that i could understand itbut i couldnt and how she said it was strange that while her ma and her grandma and her uncle orion could understand anything in the world i was so dull that i couldnt understand the easiest thing and doesnt she remember that finally a light broke in upon me and i said it was all rightthat i knew old moses himselfand that he kept a clothing store in market street and then she went to her ma and said she didnt know what would become of her uncle sam he was too dull to learn anythingever and im just as dull yet now i have no doubt her letter was spelled right and was correct in all particularsbut then i had to read it according to my lights and they being inferior she ought to overlook the mistakes i make specially as it is not my fault that i wasnt born with good sense i am sure she will detect an encouraging ray of intelligence in that last argument  i am waiting here trying to rent a better office for orion i have got the refusal after next week of a room on first

esmeralda when the next letter was written and      we begin now to get pictures of that cheerless miningcamp and to      know something of the alternate hopes and discouragements of the      hunt for goldthe miner one day soaring on wings of hope on the      next becoming excited irritable profane  the names of new mines      appear constantly and vanish almost at a touch suggesting the      fairylike evanescence of their riches       but a few of the letters here will best speak for themselves not      all of them are needed  it is perhaps unnecessary to say that there      is no

they left behind them fell into the hands of the indians they had a pitched battle with the savages some fifty miles from the fort in which scott sheriff and another man was killed this was the day before the soldiers came up with them i mean nobles men and those under cols evans and mayfield from los angeles evans assumed the chief commandand next morning the forces were divided into three parties and marched against the enemy col mayfield was killed and sergeant gillespie also nobles colonel was wounded the california troops went back home and noble remained to help drive the stock

it is nothing but bedrock croppingstoo much work to find the ledge if there is one shant record the farnum until i know more about itperhaps not at all  governor under the snow  douglas and red bird are both recorded  i have had opportunities to get into several ledges but refused all but threeexpect to back out of two of them  stir yourself as much as possible and lay up 100 or 15000 subject to my call i go to work tomorrow with pick and shovel somethings got to come by g before i let go here  col youngs says you must rent kinkeads room by all meansgovernment would rather pay 150 a month for your office than 75 for gen norths says you are playing your hand very badly for either the governments good opinion or anybodys else in keeping your office in a shanty says put gov nye in your place and he would have a stylish office and no objections would ever be made either when old col youngs talks this way i think it time to get a fine office i wish you would take that office and fit it up handsomely so that i can omit telling people that by this time you are handsomely located when i know it is no such thing  i am living with ratio phillips send him one of those black portfoliosby the stage and put a couple of penholders and a dozen steel pens in it  if you should have occasion to dispose of the long desk before i return dont forget to break open the middle drawer and take out my

the wars mentioned in the opening paragraph of this letter      were incident to the trouble concerning the boundary line      between california and nevada  the trouble continued for      some time with occasional bloodshed  the next letter is an      exultant one  there were few enough of this sort  we      cannot pretend to keep track of the multiplicity of mines      and shares which lure the goldhunters pecking away at the      flinty ledges usually in the snow  it has been necessary      to abbreviate this letter for much of it has lost all      importance with the years and is merely confusing  hope is      still high in the writers heart and confidence in his      associates still unshaken  later he was to lose faith in      raish whether with justice or not we cannot know now

capitalists in spite of anything therefore we need fret and fume and worry and doubt no more but just lie still and put up with privations for six months perhaps three months will let us out then if government refuses to pay the rent on your new office we can do it ourselves we have got to wait six weeks anyhow for a dividend maybe longerbut that it will come there is no shadow of a doubt i have got the thing sifted down to a dead moral certainty i own oneeighth of the new monitor ledge clemens company and money cant buy a foot of it because i know it to contain our fortune the ledge is six feet wide and one needs no glass to see gold and silver in it phillips and i own one half of a segregated claim in the flyaway discovery and good interests in two extensions on it we put men to work on our part of the discovery yesterday and last night they brought us some fine specimens rock taken from ten feet below the surface on the other part of the discovery has yielded 15000 to the ton in the mill and we are at work 300 feet from their shaft  may 12yours by the mail received last night eighteen hundred feet in the c t rices company well i am glad you did not accept of the 200 feet tell rice to give it to some poor man  but hereafter when anybody holds up a glittering prospect before you just argue in this wise viz that if all spare change be devoted to working the monitor and flyaway 12 months or 24 at furthest will find all our earthly wishes satisfied so far as money is concernedand the more feet we have the more anxiety we must beartherefore why not say nodn your prospects i wait on a sure thingand a man is less than a man if he cant wait 2 years for a fortune when you and i came out here we did not expect 63 or 64 to find us rich menand if that proposition had been made we would have accepted it gladly now it is made  well i am willing now that nearys tunnel or anybody elses tunnel shall succeed some of them may beat us a few months but we shall be on hand in the fullness of time as sure as fate i would hate to swap chances with any member of the tribein fact i am so lost to all sense and reason as to be capable of refusing to trade flyaway with but 200 feet in the company of four foot for foot for that splendid lady washington with its lists of capitalist proprietors and its 35000 feet of priceless ground  i wouldnt mind being in some of those clear creek claims if i lived in carson and we could spare the money but i have struck my tent in esmeralda and i care for no mines but those which i can superintend myself i am a citizen here now and i am satisfiedalthough r and i are strapped and we havent three days rations in the house  raish is looking anxiously for money and so am i send me whatever you can spare convenientlyi want it to work the flyaway with my fourth of that claim only cost me 50 which isnt paid yet though and i suppose i could sell it here in town for ten times that amount today but i shall probably hold onto it till the cows come home i shall work the monitor and the other claims with my own hands i prospected of a pound of m yesterday and raish reduced it with the blowpipe and got about ten or twelve cents in gold and silver besides the other half of it which we spilt on the floor and didnt get the specimen came from the croppings but was a choice one and showed much free gold to the naked eye  well i like the corner upstairs office amazinglyprovided it has one fine large front room superbly carpeted for the safe and a 150 desk or such a matterone handsome room amidships less handsomely gotten up perhaps for records and consultations and one goodsized bedroom and adjoining it a kitchen neither of which latter can be entered by anybody but yourselfand finally when one of the ledges begins to pay the whole to be kept in parlor order by two likely contrabands at big wages the same to be free of expense to the government you want the entire second storyno less room than you would have had in harris and cos make them fix for you before the 1st of julyfor maybe you might want to come out strong on the 4th you know  no the post office is all right and kept by a gentleman but w f express isnt they charge 25 cts to express a letter from here but i believe they have quit charging twice for letters that arrive prepaid  the flyaway specimen i sent you taken by myself from dekays shaft 300 feet from where we are going to sink cannot be called choice exactlysay something above medium to be on the safe side but i have seen exceedingly choice chunks from that shaft my intention at first in sending the antelope specimen was that you might see that it resembles the monitorbut come to think a man can tell absolutely nothing about that without seeing both ledges themselves i tried to break a handsome chunk from a huge piece of my darling monitor which we brought from the croppings yesterday but it all splintered up and i send you the scraps i call that choiceany dd fool would dont ask if it has been assayed for it hasnt it dont need it it is amply able to speak for itself it is six feet wide on top and traversed through and through with veins whose color proclaims their worth what the devil does a man want with any more feet when he owns in the flyaway and the invincible bombproof monitor  if i had anything more to say i have forgotten what it was unless perhaps that i want a sum of moneyanywhere from 20 to 150 as soon as possible  raish sends regards he or i one will drop a line to the age occasionally i suppose you saw my letters in the enterprise

 you see bixby is on the flagship he always was the best pilot on the mississippi and deserves his posish they have done a reckless thing though in putting sam bowen on the swanfor if a bombshell happens to come his way he will infallibly jump overboard  send me another package of those envelopes per bagleys coat pocket        we see how anxious he was for his brother to make a good official      showing  if a niggardly government refused to provide decent      quartersno matter the miners with gold pouring in would      themselves pay for a suite superbly carpeted and all kept in      order by two likely contrabandsthat is to say negroes  samuel      clemens in those days believed in expansion and impressive      surroundings  his brother though also mining mad was rather      inclined to be penny wise in the matter of office luxurynot a bad      idea as it turned out       orion by the way was acquiring feet on his own account and in      one instance at least seems to have won his brothers      commendation       the enterprise letters mentioned we shall presently hear of again    to orion clemens in carson city                                          esmeralda sunday may 1862  my dear brotherwell if you havent struck it rich that is if the piece of rock you sent me came from a bona fide ledgeand it looks as if it did if that is a ledge and you own 200 feet in it why its a big thingand i have nothing more to say if you have actually made something by helping to pay somebodys prospecting expenses it is a wonder of the first magnitude and deserves to rank as such  if that rock came from a welldefined ledge that particular vein must be at least an inch wide judging from this specimen which is fully that thick  when i came in the other evening hungry and tired and illnatured and threw down my pick and shovel raish gave me your specimensaid bagley brought it and asked me if it were cinnabar i examined it by the waning daylight and took the specks of fine gold for sulphuretswrote you i did not think much of itand posted the letter immediately  but as soon as i looked at it in the broad light of day i saw my mistake during the week we have made three horns got a blowpipe c and yesterday all prepared we prospected the mountain house i broke the specimen in two and found it full of fine gold inside then we washed out onefourth of it and got a noble prospect this we reduced with the blowpipe and got about two cents herewith enclosed in pure gold  as the fragment prospected weighed rather less than an ounce this would give about 500 to the ton we were eminently well satisfied therefore hold on to the mountain house for it is a big thing touch it lightly as far as money is concerned though for it is well to reserve the code of justice in the matter of quartz ledgesthat is consider them all and their owners guilty of shenanigan until they are proved innocent  p smondayratio and i have bought onehalf of a segregated claim in the original flyaway for 10050 down we havent a cent in the house we two will work the ledge and have full control and pay all expenses if you can spare 100 conveniently let me have itor 50 anyhow considering that i own one fourth of this it is of course more valuable than one 17 of the mountain house although not so rich        there is too much of a sameness in the letters of this period to use      all of them  there are always new claims and work done apparently      without system or continuance hoping to uncover sudden boundless      affluence       in the next letter and the one following it we get a hint of an      episode or rather of two incidents which he combined into an      episode in roughing it  the story as told in that book is an      account of what might have happened rather than history  there was      never really any money in the blind lead of the wide west claim      except that which was sunk in it by unfortunate investors  only      extracts from these letters are given  the other portions are      irrelevant and of slight value    extract from a letter to orion clemens in carson city                                                              1862  two or three of the old salina company entered our hole on the monitor yesterday morning before our men got there and took possession armed with revolvers and according to the dd laws of this forever dd country nothing but the district court and there aint any can touch the matter unless it assumes the shape of an infernal humbug which they call forcible entry and detainer and in order to bring that about you must compel the jumpers to use personal violence toward you we went up and demanded possession and they refused said they were in the hole armed and meant to die for it if necessary  i got in with them and again demanded possession they said i might stay in it as long as i pleased and work but they would do the same i asked one of our company to take my place in the hole while i went to consult a lawyer he did so the lawyer said it was no go they must offer some force  our boys will try to be there first in the morningin which case they may get possession and keep it now you understand the shooting scrape in which gebhart was killed the other day the clemens companyall of ushate to resort to arms in this matter and it will not be done until it becomes a forced handbut i think that will be the end of it nevertheless        the mine relocated in this letter was not the wide west but it      furnished the proper incident  the only mention of the wide west      is found in a letter written in july    extract from a letter to orion clemens in carson city 1862  if i do not forget it i will send you per next mail a pinch of decom decomposed rock which i pinched with thumb and finger from wide west ledge awhile ago raish and i have secured 200 out of a 400 ft in it which perhaps the ledge i mean is a spur from the w wour shaft is about 100 ft from the w w shaft in order to get in we agreed to sink 30 ft we have sublet to another man for 50 ft and we pay for powder and sharpening tools        the wide west claim was forfeited but there is no evidence to      show that clemens and his partners were ever except in fiction      millionaires for ten days  the background the local color and      the possibilities are all real enough but mark twains aim in this      as in most of his other reminiscent writing was to arrange and      adapt his facts to the needs of a good story       the letters of this summer 1862 most of them bear evidence of      waning confidence in mining as a source of fortunethe miner has      now little faith in his own judgment and none at all in that of his      brother who was without practical experience    letter to orion clemens in carson city                                               esmeralda thursday  my dear broyours of the 17th per express just received part of it pleased me exceedingly and part of it didnt concerning the letter for instance you have promised me that you would leave all mining matters and everything involving an outlay of money in my hands  sending a man fooling around the country after ledges for gods sake when there are hundreds of feet of them under my nose here begging for owners free of charge i dont want any more feet and i wont touch another footso you see orion as far as any ledges of perrys are concerned or any other except what i examine first with my own eyes i freely yield my right to share ownership with you  the balance of your letter i say pleases me exceedingly especially that about the h and d being worth from 30 to 50 in cal it pleases me because if the ledges prove to be worthless it will be a pleasant reflection to know that others were beaten worse than ourselves raish sold a man 30 feet yesterday at 20 a foot although i was present at the sale and told the man the ground wasnt worth a dn he said he had been hankering after a few feet in the h and d for a long time and he had got them at last and he couldnt help thinking he had secured a good thing we went and looked at the ledges and both of them acknowledged that there was nothing in them but good indications yet the owners in the h and d will part with anything else sooner than with feet in these ledges well the work goes slowlyvery slowly on in the tunnel and well strike it some day butif we strike it richive lost my guess thats all i expect that the way it got so high in cal was that raishs brother over there was offered 75000 for 20 feet of it and he refused  couldnt go on the hill today it snowed it always snows here i expect  dont you suppose they have pretty much quit writing at home  when you receive your next 14 yrs salary dont send any of it here until after you have told me you have got it remember this i am afraid of that h and d  they have struck the ledge in the live yankee tunnel and i told the president mr allen that it wasnt as good as the croppings he said that was true enough but they would hang to it until it did prove rich he is much of a gentleman that man allen  and ask gaslerie why the devil he dont send along my commission as deputy sheriff the fact of my being in california and out of his country wouldnt amount to a dn with me in the performance of my official duties  i have nothing to report at present except that i shall find out all i want to know about this locality before i leave it  how do the records pay                                yr  bro                                         sam        in one of the foregoing lettersthe one dated may 11 there is a      reference to the writers enterprise letters  sometimes during      idle days in the camp the miner had followed old literary impulses      and written an occasional burlesque sketch which he had signed      josh and sent to the territorial enterprise at virginia city      one contribution was sent to a keokuk paper the gate city and a      letter written by mrs jane clemens at the time would indicate that      mark twains mother did not always approve of her sons literary      efforts  she hopes that he will do better and some time write      something that his kin will be proud ofthe rough vigorous      humor of these had attracted some attention and orion pleased with      any measure of success that might come to his brother had allowed      the authorship of them to become known  when in july the      financial situation became desperate the esmeralda miner was moved      to turn to literature for relief  but we will let him present the      situation himself    to orion clemens in carson city                                          esmeralda july 23d 1862  my dear brono i dont own a foot in

johnson himself has contracted to find the ledge for 100 feet contract signed yesterday but as the ledge will be difficult to find he is allowed six months to find it in an eighteenth of the ophir was a fortune to john d wintersand the ophir cant beat the johnson any  my debts are greater than i thought for i bought 25 worth of clothing and sent 25 to higbie in the cement diggings i owe about 45 or 50 and have got about 45 in my pocket but how in the hl i am going to live on something over 100 until october or november is singular the fact is i must have something to do and that shortly too  now

and other papersand the enterprise california is full of people who have interests here and its dd seldom they hear from this country i cant write a specimen letternow at any rateid rather undertake to write a greek poem tell em the mail and express leave three times a week and it costs from 25 to 50 cents to send letters by the blasted express if they want letters from here wholl run from morning till night collecting materials cheaper ill write a short letter twice a week for the present for the age for 5 per week now it has been a long time since i couldnt make my own living and it shall be a long time before i loaf another year  if i get the other 25 feet in the johnson ex i shant care a dn ill be willing to curse awhile and wait and if i cant move the bowels of those hills

 sam        the territorial enterprise at virginia city was at this time owned      by joseph t goodman who had bought it on the eve of the great      comstock silvermining boom and from a struggling starving sheet      had converted it into one of the most importantcertainly the most      picturesquepapers on the coast  the sketches which the esmeralda      miner had written over the name of josh fitted into it exactly      and when a young man named barstow in the business office urged      goodman to invite josh to join their staff the enterprise owner      readily fell in with the idea  among a lot of mining matters of no      special interest clemens july 30th wrote his brother barstow      has offered me the post as local reporter for the enterprise at 25      a week and i have written him that i will let him know next mail      if possible       in roughing it we are told that the miner eagerly accepted the      proposition to come to virginia city but the letters tell a      different story  mark twain was never one to abandon any      undertaking easily  his unwillingness to surrender in a lost cause      would cost him more than one fortune in the years to come  a

alone and on foot for a walk of 60 or 70 miles through a totally uninhabited country and it is barely possible that mail facilities may prove infernally slow during the few weeks i expect to spend out there but do you write barstow that i have left here for a week or so and in case he should want me he must write me here or let me know through you  the contractors say they will strike the fresno next week after fooling with those assayers a week they concluded not to buy mr flower at 50 although they would have given five times the sum for it four months ago so i have made out a deed for one half of all johnnys ground and acknowledged and left in judge f k becktels hands and if judge turner wants it he must write to becktel and pay him his notary fee of 150 i would have paid that fee myself but i want money now as i leave town tonight however if you think it isnt right you can pay the fee to judge turner yourself  hang to your money now i may want some when i get back  see that you keep out of debtto anybody bully for b write him that i would write him myself but i am to take a walk tonight and havent time tell him to bring his family out with him he can rely upon what i sayand i say the land has lost its ancient desolate appearance the rose and the oleander have taken the place of the departed sagebush a rich black loam garnished with moss and flowers and the

perspective on the situation  he was a great      walker in those days and sometimes with higbie sometimes alone      made long excursions  one such is recorded in roughing it the trip      to mono

letter to you and ma this morning but since then i have received yours to orion and me therefore i must answer right away else i may leave town without doing it at all what in thunder are pilots wages to me which question i beg humbly to observe is of a general nature and not discharged particularly at you but it is singular isnt it that such a matter should interest orion when it is of no earthly consequence to me i never have once thought of returning home to go on the river again and i never expect to do any more piloting at any price my livelihood must be made in this countryand if i have to wait longer than i expected let it be soi have no fear of failure you know i have extravagant hopes for orion tells you everything which he ought to keep to himselfbut its his nature to do that sort of thing and i let him alone i did think for awhile of going home this fallbut when i found that that was and had been the cherished intention and the darling aspiration every year of these old careworn californians for twelve weary yearsi felt a little uncomfortable but i stole a march on disappointment and said i would not go home this fall i will spend the winter in san francisco if possible do not tell any one that i had any idea of piloting again at presentfor it is all a mistake this country suits me andit shall suit me whether or no  dan twing and i and dans dog cabin

waterproof we went outside to keep from getting wet dan makes the bed when it is his turn to do itand when it is my turn i dont you know the dog is not a good hunter and he isnt worth shucks to watchbut he scratches up the dirt floor of the cabin and catches flies and makes himself generally useful in the way of washing dishes dan gets up first in the morning and makes a fireand i get up last and sit by it while he cooks breakfast we have a cold lunch at noon and i cook suppervery much against my will however one must have one good meal a day and if i were to live on dans abominable cookery i should lose my appetite you know dan attended dr chorpennings funeral yesterday and he felt as though he ought to wear a white shirtand we had a jolly good time finding such an article we turned over all our traps and he found one at lastbut i shall always think it was suffering from yellow fever he also found an old black coat greasy and wrinkled to that degree that it appeared to have been quilted at some time or other in this gorgeous costume he attended the funeral and when he returned his own dog drove him away from the cabin not recognizing him this is true  you would not like to live in a country where flour was 40 a barrel very well then i suppose you would not like to live here where flour was 100 a barrel when i first came here and shortly afterwards it couldnt be had at any priceand for one month the people lived on barley beans and beefand nothing beside oh nowe didnt luxuriate then perhaps not but we said wise and severe things about the vanity and wickedness of high living we preached our doctrine and practised it which course i respectfully recommend to the clergymen of st louis  where is beack jollya pilotand bixby

correspondence here  for a      space of many months there is but one letter to continue the      story  others were written of course but for some reason      they have not survived  it was about the end of august      1862 when the miner finally abandoned the struggle and      with his pack on his shoulders walked the one and thirty      miles over the mountains to virginia city arriving dusty      lame and travelstained to claim at last his rightful      inheritance  at the enterprise office he was welcomed and      in a brief time entered into his own  goodman the      proprietor himself a man of great ability had surrounded      himself with a group of gayhearted fellows whose fresh      wild way of writing delighted the comstock pioneers far more      than any sober presentation of mere news  samuel clemens      fitted exactly into this group  by the end of the year he      had become a leader of it  when he asked to be allowed to      report the coming carson legislature goodman consented      realizing that while clemens knew nothing of parliamentary      procedure he would at least make the letters picturesque       it was in the midst of this work that he adopted the name      which he was to make famous throughout the world  the story      of its adoption has been fully told elsewhere and need not      be repeated heresee mark twain a biography by the same      author chapter xl       mark twain was first signed to a carson letter february      2 1863 and from that time was attached to all of samuel      clemenss work  the letters had already been widely copied      and the name now which gave them personality quickly      obtained vogue  it was attached to himself as well as to      the letters heretofore he had been called sam or clemens      now he became almost universally mark twain and mark       this early period of mark twains journalism is full of      delicious history but we are permitted here to retell only      such of it as will supply connection to the infrequent      letters  he wrote home briefly in february but the letter      contained nothing worth preserving  then two months later      he gives us at least a hint of his employment    to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                               virginia april 11 1863  my dear mother and sisterit is very late at night and i am writing in my room which is not quite as large or as nice as the one i had at home my board washing and lodging cost me seventyfive dollars a month  i have just received your letter ma from carsonthe one in which you doubt my veracity about the statements i made in a letter to you thats right i dont recollect what the statements were but i suppose they were mining statistics i have just finished writing up my report for the morning paper and giving the unreliable a column of advice about how to conduct himself in church and now i will tell you a few more lies while my hand is in for instance some of the boys made me a present of fifty feet in the east india g and s m company ten days ago i was offered ninetyfive dollars a foot for it yesterday in gold i refused itnot because i think the claim is worth a cent for i dont but because i had a curiosity to see how high it would go before people find out how worthless it is besides what if one mining claim does fool me i have got plenty more i am not in a particular hurry to get rich i suppose i couldnt well help getting rich here some time or other whether i wanted to or not you folks do not believe in nevada and i am glad you dont just keep on thinking so  i was at the gould and curry mine the other day and they had two or three tons of choice rock piled up which was valued at 20000 a ton i gathered up a hatfull of chunks on account of their beauty as specimensthey dont let everybody supply themselves so liberally i send mr moffett a little specimen of it for his cabinet if you dont know what the white stuff on it is i must inform you that it is purer silver than the minted coin there is about as much gold in it as there is silver but it is not visible i will explain to you some day how to detect it  pamela you wouldnt do for a local reporterbecause you dont appreciate the interest that attaches to names an item is of no use unless it speaks of some person and not then unless that persons name is distinctly mentioned the most interesting letter one can write to an absent friend is one that treats of persons he has been acquainted with rather than the public events of the day now you speak of a young lady who wrote to hollie benson that she had seen me and you didnt mention her name it was just a mere chance that i ever guessed who she wasbut i did finally though i dont remember her name now i was introduced to her in san francisco by hon a b paul and saw her afterwards in gold hill they were a very pleasant lot of girlsshe and her sisters  p s i have just heard five pistol shots down streetas such things are in my line i will go and see about it  p s no 25 amthe pistol did its work wellone mana jackson county missourian shot two of my friends police officers through the heartboth died within three minutes murderers name is john campbell       the unreliable of this letter was a rival reporter on whom mark      twain had conferred this name during the legislative session  his      real name was rice and he had undertaken to criticize clemenss      reports  the brisk reply that rices letters concealed with a show      of parliamentary knowledge a festering mass of misstatements the      author of whom should be properly termed the unreliable fixed      that name upon him for life  this burlesque warfare delighted the      frontier and it did not interfere with friendship  clemens and rice      were constant associates though continually firing squibs at each      other in their respective papersa form of personal journalism much      in vogue on the comstock       in the next letter we find these two journalistic blades enjoying      themselves together in the coast metropolis  this letter is labeled      no 2 meaning probably the second from san francisco but no 1      has disappeared and even no 2 is incomplete    to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis  no 22000 enclosed                                        lick house s f june 1 63  my dear mother and sisterthe unreliable and myself are still here and still enjoying ourselves i suppose i know at least a thousand people herea great many of them citizens of san francisco but the majority belonging in washoeand when i go down montgomery street shaking hands with tom dick and harry it is just like being in main street in hannibal and meeting the old familiar faces i do hate to go back to washoe we fag ourselves completely out every day and go to sleep without rocking every night we dine out and we lunch out and we eat drink and are happyas it were after breakfast i dont often see the hotel again until midnightor after i am going to the dickens mighty fast i know a regular village of families here in the house but i never have time to call on them thunder well know a little more about this town before we leave than some of the people who live in it we take trips across the bay to oakland and down to san leandro and alameda and those places and we go out to the willows and hayes park and fort point and up to benicia and yesterday we were invited out on a yachting excursion and had a sail in the fastest yacht on the pacific coast rice says oh nowe are not having any fun markoh no i reckon notits somebody elseits probably the gentleman in the wagon popular slang phrase when i invite rice to the lick house to dinner the proprietors send us champagne and claret and then we do put on the most disgusting airs rice says our calibre is too lightwe cant stand it to be noticed  i rode down with a gentleman to the ocean house the other day to see the sea horses and also to listen to the roar of the surf and watch the ships drifting about here and there and far away at sea when i stood on the beach and let the surf wet my feet i recollected doing the same thing on the shores of the atlanticand then i had a proper appreciation of the vastness of this countryfor i had traveled from ocean to ocean across it                         remainder missing        not

boast of having the widest reputation as a local editor of any man on the pacific coast and you gravely come forward and tell me if i work hard and attend closely to my business i may aspire to a place on a big san francisco daily some day theres a comment on human vanity for you why blast it i was under the impression that i could get such a situation as that any time i asked for it but i dont want it no paper in the united states can afford to pay me what my place on the enterprise is worth if i were not naturally a lazy idle goodfornothing vagabond i could make it pay me 20000 a year but i dont suppose i shall ever be any account i lead an easy life though and i dont care a cent whether school keeps or not everybody knows me and i fare like a prince wherever i go be it on this side of the mountains or the other and i am proud to say i am the most conceited ass in the territory  you think that picture looks old well i cant help itin reality i am not as old as i was when i was eighteen  i took a desperate cold more than a week ago and i seduced wilson a missouri boy reporter of the daily union from his labors and we went over to lake bigler but i failed to cure my cold i found the lake house crowded with the wealth and fashion of virginia and i could not resist the temptation to take a hand in all the fun going those virginiansmen and women bothare a stirring set and i found if i went with them on all their eternal excursions i should bring the consumption home with meso i left day before yesterday and came back into the territory again a lot of them had purchased a site for a town on the lake shore and they gave me a lot when you come out ill build you a house on it the lake seems more supernaturally beautiful now than ever it is the masterpiece of the creation  the hotel here at the springs is not so much crowded as usual and i am having a very comfortable time of it the hot white steam puffs up out of fissures in the earth like the jets that come from a steamboats scape pipes and it makes a boiling surging noise like a steamboat toohence the name we put eggs in a handkerchief and dip them in the springsthey soft boil in 2 minutes and boil as hard as a rock in 4 minutes these fissures extend more than a quarter of a mile and the long line of steam columns looks very pretty a large bath house is built over one of the springs and we go in it and steam ourselves as long as we can stand it and then come out and take a cold shower bath you get baths board and lodging all for 25 a weekcheaper than living in virginia without baths

reputation as a gaily      original newspaper writer  thus far however he had absolutely no      literary standing nor is there any evidence that he had literary      ambitions his work was unformed uncultivatedall of which seems      strange now when we realize that somewhere behind lay the      substance of immortality  rudyard kipling at twentyeight had done      his greatest work       even joseph goodman who had a fine literary perception and a deep      knowledge of men intimately associated with mark twain as he was      received at this time no hint of his greater powers  another man on      the staff of the enterprise william wright who called himself dan      de quille a graceful humorist gave far more promise goodman      thought of future distinction       it was artemus ward who first suspected the value of mark twains      gifts and urged him to some more important use of them  artemus in      the course of a transcontinental lecture tour stopped in virginia      city and naturally found congenial society on the enterprise staff      he had intended remaining but a few days but lingered three weeks      a period of continuous celebration closing only with the holiday      season  during one night of final festivities ward slipped away      and gave a performance on his own account  his letter to mark      twain from austin nevada written a day or two later is most      characteristic    artemus wards letter to mark twain                                               austin jan 1 64  my dearest lovei arrived here yesterday am at 2 oclock it is a wild untamable place full of lionhearted boys i speak tonight see small bills  why did you not go with me and save me that nighti mean the night i left you after that dinner party i went and got drunker beating i may say alexander the great in his most drinkinist days and i blackened my face at the melodeon and made a gibbering idiotic speech goddam it i suppose the union will have it but let it go i shall always remember virginia as a bright spot in my existence as all others must or rather cannot be as it were  love to jo goodman and dan i shall write soon a powerfully convincing note to my friends of the mercury your notice by the way did much good here as it doubtlessly will elsewhere the miscreants of the union will be batted in the snout if they ever dare pollute this rapidly rising city with their loathsome presence  some of the finest intellects in the world have been blunted by liquor  do not sirdo not flatter yourself that you are the only chastelyhumorous writer onto the pacific slopes  goodbye old boyand god bless you the matter of which i spoke to you so earnestly shall be just as earnestly attended toand again with very many warm regards for jo and dan and regards to many of the good friends we met                           i am faithfully gratefully yours                                                   artemus ward        the union which ward mentions was the rival virginia  city paper      the mercury was the new york sunday mercury to which he had urged      mark twain to contribute  ward wrote a second letter after a siege      of illness at salt lake city  he was a frail creature and three      years later in london died of consumption  his genius and      encouragement undoubtedly exerted an influence upon mark twain      wards second letter here follows    artemus ward to s l clemens                                          salt lake city jan 21 64  my dear marki have been dangerously ill for the past two weeks here of congestive fever very grave fears were for a time entertained of my recovery but happily the malady is gone though leaving me very very weak i hope to be able to resume my journey in a week or so i think i shall speak in the theater here which is one of the finest establishments of the kind in america  the saints have been wonderfully kind to me i could not have been better or more tenderly nursed at homegod bless them  i am still exceedingly weakcant write any more love to jo and dan and all the rest write me at st louis                                          always yours                                                   artemus ward        if one could only have mark twains letters in reply to these  but      they have vanished and are probably long since dust  a letter which      he wrote to his mother assures us that he undertook to follow wards      advice  he was not ready however for serious literary effort      the article sent to the mercury was distinctly of the comstock      variety it was accepted but it apparently made no impression and      he did not follow it up       for one thing he was just then too busy reporting the legislature      at carson city and responding to social demands  from having been a      scarcely considered unit during the early days of his arrival in      carson mark twain had attained a high degree of importance in the      little nevada capital  in the legislature he was a power as      correspondent for the enterprise he was feared and respected as well      as admired  his humor his satire and his fearlessness were      dreaded weapons       also he was of extraordinary popularity  orions wife with her      little daughter jennie had come out from the states  the governor      of nevada had no household in carson city and was generally absent      orion clemens reigned in his stead and indeed was usually addressed      as governor clemens  his home became the social center of the      capital and his brilliant brother its chief ornament  from the      roughest of miners of a year before he had become once more almost      a dandy in dress and no occasion was complete without him  when      the two houses of the legislature assembled in january 1864 a      burlesque third house was organized and proposed to hold a session      as a church benefit  after very brief consideration it was decided      to select mark twain to preside at this third house assembly under      the title of governor and a letter of invitation was addressed to      him  his reply to it follows    to s pixley and g a sears trustees                                          carson city january 23 1864  gentlemen certainly if the public can find anything in a grave state paper worth paying a dollar for i am willing that they should pay that amount or any other and although i am not a very dusty christian myself i take an absorbing interest in religious affairs and would willingly inflict my annual message upon the church itself if it might derive benefit thereby you can charge what you please i promise the public no amusement but i do promise a reasonable amount of instruction i am responsible to the third house only and i hope to be permitted to make it exceedingly warm for that body without caring whether the sympathies of the public and the church be enlisted in their favor and against myself or not                                     respectfully                                              mark twain        there is a quality in this letter more suggestive of the later mark      twain than anything that has preceded it  his third house address      unfortunately has not been preserved but those who heard it      regarded it as a classic  it probably abounded in humor of the      frontier sortunsparing ridicule of the governor the legislature      and individual citizens  it was all taken in good part of course      and as a recognition of his success he received a gold watch with      the case properly inscribed to the governor of the third house      this was really his first public appearance in a field in which he      was destined to achieve very great fame     v letters 186466 san francisco and hawaii       life on the comstock came to an end for mark twain in may 1864  it      was the time of the flour sack sanitary fund the story of which he      has told in roughing it  he does not however refer to the      troubles which this special fund brought upon himself  coming into      the enterprise office one night after a gay day of fund      celebration clemens wrote for next days paper a paragraph      intended to be merely playful but which proved highly offending to      certain ladies concerned with the floursack enterprise  no files      of the paper exist today so we cannot judge of the quality of humor      that stirred up trouble       the trouble however was genuine enough virginias rival paper      seized upon the chance to humiliate its enemy and presently words      were passed back and forth until nothing was left to write but a      challenge  the story of this duel which did not come off has been      quite fully told elsewhere both by mark twain and the present      writer but the following lettera revelation of his inner feelings      in the matter of his offensehas never before been published    to mrs cutler in carson city                                          virginia may 23rd 1864  mrs w k cutler  madami address a lady in every sense of the term mrs clemens has informed me of everything that has occurred in carson in connection with that unfortunate item of mine about the sanitary funds accruing from the ball and from what i can understand you are almost the only lady in your city who has understood the circumstances under which my fault was committed or who has shown any disposition to be lenient with me had the note of the ladies been properly worded i would have published an ample apology instantlyand possibly i might even have done so anyhow had that note arrived at any other timebut it came at a moment when i was in the midst of what ought to have been a deadly quarrel with the publishers of the union and i could not come out and make public apologies to any one at such a time it is bad policy to do it even now as challenges have already passed between myself and a proprietor of the union and the matter is still in abeyance but i suppose i had better say a word or two to show the ladies that i did not wilfully and maliciously do them a wrong  but my chief object mrs cutler in writing you this note and you will pardon the liberty i have taken was to thank you very kindly and sincerely for the consideration you have shown me in this matter and for your continued friendship for mollie while others are disposed to withdraw theirs on account of a fault for which i alone am responsible                                very truly yours                                              sam l clemens        the matter did not end with the failure of the duel  a very strict      law had just been passed making it a felony even to send or accept      a challenge  clemens on the whole rather tired of virginia city      and carson thought it a good time to go across the mountains to san      francisco  with steve gillis a printer of whom he was very fond      an inveterate joker who had been more than half responsible for      the proposed duel and was to have served as his secondhe took the      stage one morning and in due time was in the california metropolis      at work on the morning call       clemens had been several times in san francisco and loved the      place  we have no letter of that summer the first being dated      several months after his arrival  he was still working on the call      when it was written and contributing literary articles to the      californian of which bret harte unknown to fame was editor      harte had his office just above the rooms of the call and he and      clemens were good friends  san francisco had a real literary group      that for a time at least centered around the offices of the golden      era  in a letter that follows clemens would seem to have scorned      this publication but he was a frequent contributor to it at one      period  joaquin miller was of this band of literary pioneers also      prentice mulford charles warren stoddard

picture that this superb climate agrees with me and it ought after living where i was never out of sight of snow peaks twentyfour hours during three years here we have neither snow nor cold weather fires are never lighted and yet summer clothes are never wornyou wear spring clothing the year round  steve gillis who has been my comrade for two years and who came down here with me is to be married in a week or two to a very pretty girl worth 130000 in her own rightand then i shall be alone again until they build a house which they will do shortly  we have been here only four months yet we have changed our lodgings five times and our hotel twice we are very comfortably fixed where we are now and have no fault to find with the rooms or with the peoplewe are the only lodgers in a welltodo private family with one grown daughter and a piano in the parlor adjoining our room but i need a change and must move again i have taken rooms further down the street i shall stay in this little quiet street because it is full of gardens and shrubbery and there are none but dwelling houses in it  i am taking life easy now and i mean to keep it up for awhile i dont work at night any more i told the call folks to pay me 25 a week and let me work only in daylight so i get up at ten every morning and quit work at five or six in the afternoon you ask if i work for greenbacks hardly what do you suppose i could do with greenbacks here  i have engaged to write for the new literary paperthe californiansame pay i used to receive on the golden eraone article a week fifty dollars a month i quit the era long ago it wasnt hightoned enough the californian circulates among the highest class of the community and is the best weekly literary paper in the united statesand i suppose i ought to know  i work as i always didby fits and starts i wrote two articles last night for the californian so that lets me out for two weeks that would be about seventyfive dollars in greenbacks wouldnt it  been down to san jose generally pronounced sannozayemphasis on last syllabletoday fifty miles from here by railroad town of 6000 inhabitants buried in flowers and shrubbery the climate is finer than ours here because it is not so close to the ocean and is protected from the winds by the coast range  i had an invitation today to go down on an excursion to san luis obispo and from thence to the city of mexico to be gone six or eight weeks or possibly longer but i could not accept on account of my contract to act as chief mourner or groomsman at steves wedding  i have triumphed they refused me and other reporters some information at a branch of the coroners officemasseys undertaker establishment a few weeks ago i published the wickedest article on them i ever wrote in my life and you can rest assured we got all the information we wanted after that  by the new census san francisco has a population of 130000 they dont count the hordes of chinamen                                     yrs aftly

   not in the manner described in roughing it  mark twain loved to      make fiction of his mishaps and to show himself always in a bad      light  as a matter of fact he left the call with great      willingness and began immediately contributing a daily letter to      the enterprise which brought him a satisfactory financial return       in the biographical sketch with which this volume opens and more      extendedly elsewhere has been told the story of the trouble growing      out of the enterprise letters and of mark twains sojourn with      james gillis in the tuolumne hills  also how in the frowsy hotel      at angels camp he heard the frog anecdote that would become the      cornerstone of his fame  there are no letters of this periodonly      some notebook entries  it is probable that he did not write home      believing no doubt that he had very little to say       for more than a year there is not a line that has survived  yet it      had been an important year the jumping frog story published in new      york had been reprinted east and west and laughed over in at least      a million homes  fame had not come to him but it was on the way       yet his outlook seems not to have been a hopeful one    to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                          san francisco jan 20 1866  my dear mother and sisteri do not know what to write my life is so uneventful i wish i was back there piloting up and down the river again verily all is vanity and little worthsave piloting  to think that after writing many an article a man might be excused for thinking tolerably good those new york people should single out a villainous backwoods sketch to compliment me on jim smiley and his jumping froga squib which would never have been written but to please artemus ward and then it reached new york too late to appear in his book  but no matter his book was a wretchedly poor one generally speaking and it could be no credit to either of us to appear between its covers  this paragraph is from the new york correspondence of the san francisco alta  clipping pasted in       mark twains story in the saturday press of november 18th called      jim smiley and his jumping frog has set all new york in a roar      and he may be said to have made his mark  i have been asked fifty      times about it and its author and the papers are copying it far and      near  it is voted the best thing of the day  cannot the      californian afford to keep mark all to itself  it should not let      him scintillate so widely without first being filtered through the      california press  the new york publishing house of carleton  co gave the sketch to the saturday press when they found it was too late for the book  though i am generally placed at the head of my breed of scribblers in this part of the country the place properly belongs to bret harte i think though he denies it along with the rest he wants me to club a lot of old sketches together with a lot of his and publish a book i wouldnt do it only he agrees to take all the trouble but i want to know whether we are going to make anything out of it first however he has written to a new york publisher and if we are offered a bargain that will pay for a months labor we will go to work and prepare the volume for the press                                     yours affy                                              sam        bret harte and clemens had by this time quit the californian      expecting to contribute to eastern periodicals  clemens however      was not yet through with coast journalism  there was much interest      just at this time in the sandwich islands and he was selected by      the foremost sacramento paper to spy out the islands and report      aspects and conditions there  his letters home were still      infrequent but this was something worth writing    to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                     san francisco march 5th 1866  my dear mother and sisteri start to do sandwich islands day after tomorrow i suppose annie is geographer enough by this time to find them on the map in the steamer ajax we shall arrive there in about twelve days my friends seem determined that i shall not lack acquaintances for i only decided today to go and they have already sent me letters of introduction to everybody down there worth knowing i am to remain there a month and ransack the islands the great cataracts and the volcanoes completely and write twenty or thirty letters to the sacramento unionfor which they pay me as much money as i would get if i staid at home  if i come back here i expect to start straight across the continent by way of the columbia river the pend doreille lakes through montana and down the missouri riveronly 200 miles of land travel from san francisco to new orleans                                goodbye for the present                                         yours

from one of these battlefieldsi guess i will bring you some of them i went with the american minister and took dinner this evening with the kings grand chamberlain who is related to the royal family

sister11 oclock at nightthis is the infernalist darkest country when the moon dont shine i stumbled and fell over my horses lariat a minute ago and hurt my leg so i must stay here tonight  i got the same leg hurt last week i said i hadnt got hold of a spirited horse since i had been on the island and one of the proprietors loaned me a big vicious colt he was altogether too spirited i went to tighten the cinch before mounting him when he let out with his left leg  and kicked me across a tenacre lot a native rubbed and doctored me so well that i was able to stand on my feet in half an hour it was then half after four and i had an appointment to go seven miles and get a girl and take her to a card party at five  i have been clattering around among the plantations for three weeks now and next week i am going to visit the extinct crater of mount haleakalathe largest in the world it is ten miles to the foot of the mountain it rises 10000 feet above the valley the crater is 29 miles in circumference and 1000 feet deep seen from the summit the city of st louis would look like a picture in the bottom of it  as soon as i get back from haleakala pronounced hallyekkalah i will sail for honolulu again and thence to the island of hawaii pronounced hahwyye to see the greatest active volcano in the worldthat of kilauea pronounced keelowwayahand from thence back to san franciscoand then

spent five weeks there riding backwards and forwards among the sugar plantationslooking up the splendid scenery and visiting the lofty crater of haleakala it has been a perfect jubilee to me in the way of pleasure  i have not written a single line and have not once thought of business or care or human toil or trouble or sorrow or weariness few such months come in a lifetime  i set sail again a week hence for the island of hawaii to see the great active volcano of kilauea i shall not get back here for four or five weeks and shall not reach san francisco before the latter part of july  so it is no use to wait for me to go home go on yourselves  if i were in the east now i could stop the publication of a piratical book which has stolen some of my sketches  it is lategoodbye mollie

211866  my dear mother and sisteri have just got back from a hard trip through the island of hawaii begun on the 26th of may and finished on the 18th of juneonly six or seven days at seaall the balance horseback and the hardest mountain road in the world i staid at the volcano about a week and witnessed the greatest eruption that has occurred for years i lived well there they charge 4 a day for board and a dollar or two extra for guides and horses i had a pretty good time they didnt charge me anything i have got back sickwent to bed as soon as i arrived hereshall not be strong again for several days yet i rushed too fast i ought to have taken five or six weeks on that trip  a week hence i start for the island of kauai to be gone three weeks and then i go back to california  the crown princess is dead and thousands of natives cry and wail and dance and dance for the dead around the kings palace all night and every night they will keep it up for a month and then she will be buried  hon anson burlingame u s minister to china and gen van valkenburgh minister to japan with their families and suites have just arrived here en route they were going to do me the honor to call on me this morning and that accounts for my being out of bed now you know what condition my room is always in when you are not aroundso i climbed out of bed and dressed and shaved pretty quick and went up to the residence of the american minister and called on them mr burlingame told me a good deal about hon jere clemens and that virginia clemens who was wounded in a duel he was in congress years with both of them mr b sent for his son to introduce himsaid he could tell that frog story of mine as well as anybody i told him i was glad to hear it for i never tried to tell it myself without making a botch of it at his request i have loaned mr burlingame pretty much everything i ever wrote i guess he will be an almighty wise man by the time he wades through that lot  if the new united states minister to the sandwich islands hon edwin mccook were only here now so that i could get his views on this new condition of sandwich island politics i would sail for california at once but he will not arrive for two weeks yet and so i am going to spend that interval on the island of kauai  i stopped three days with hon mr cony deputy marshal of the kingdom at hilo hawaii last week and by a funny circumstance he knew everybody that i ever knew in hannibal and palmyra we used to sit up all night talking and then sleep all day he lives like a prince confound that island i had a streak of fat and a streak of lean all over itgot lost several times and had to sleep in huts with the natives and live like a dog  of course i couldnt speak fifty words of the language take it altogether though it was a mighty hard trip                                          yours affect                                                        sam        burlingame and van valkenburgh were on their way to their posts      and their coming to the islands just at this time proved a most      important circumstance to mark twain  we shall come to this      presently in a summary of the newspaper letters written to the      union  june 27th he wrote to his mother and sister a letter only a      fragment of which survives in which he tells of the arrival in      honolulu of the survivors of the ship hornet burned on the line      and of his securing the first news report of the lost vessel    part of a letter to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                               honolulu june 27 1866   with a gill of water a day to each man i got the whole story from the third mate and two of the sailors if my account gets to the sacramento union first it will be published first all over the united states france england russia and germanyall over the world i may say you will see it mr burlingame went with me all the time and helped me question the menthrowing away invitations to dinner with the princes and foreign dignitaries and neglecting all sorts of things to accommodate me you know how i appreciate that kind of thingespecially from such a man who is acknowledged to have no superior in the diplomatic circles of the world and obtained from china concessions in favor of america which were refused to sir frederick bruce and envoys of france and russia until procured for them by burlingame himselfwhich service was duly acknowledged by those dignitaries he hunted me up as soon as he came here and has done me a hundred favors since and says if i will come to china in the first trip of the great mail steamer next january and make his house in pekin my home he will afford me facilities that few men can have there for seeing and learning he will give me letters to the chiefs of the great mail steamship company which will be of service to me in this matter i expect to do all this but i expect to go to the states firstand from china to the paris worlds fair  dont show this letter                                     yours affly                                                   sam  p s the crown princess of this kingdom will be buried tomorrow with great ceremonyafter that i sail in two weeks for california        this concludes mark twains personal letters from the islands      of his descriptive news letters there were about twenty and they      were regarded by the readers of the union as distinctly notable      rereading those old letters today it is not altogether easy to      understand why  they were set in fine nonpareil type for one      thing which presentday eyes simply refuse at any price and the      reward by presentday standards is not especially tempting       the letters began in the union with the issue of april the 16th      1866  the firstof date march 18thtells of the writers arrival      at honolulu  the humor in it is not always of a high order it      would hardly pass for humor today at all  that the same man who      wrote the hawaiian letters in 1866 he was then over thirty years      old could two years later have written that marvelous book the      innocents abroad is a phenomenon in literary development       the hawaiian letters however do show the transition stage between      the rough elemental humor of the comstock and the refined and subtle      style which flowered in the innocents abroad  certainly mark      twains genius was finding itself and his association with the      refined and cultured personality of anson burlingame undoubtedly      aided in that discovery  burlingame pointed out his faults to him      and directed him to a better way  no more than that was needed at      such a time to bring about a transformation       the sandwich islands letters however must have been precisely      adapted to their audiencea little more refined than the log      comstock a little less subtle than the atlantic publicand they      added materially to his coast prestige  but let us consider a      sample extract from the first sandwich islands letter   our little band of passengers were as well and thoughtfully cared for by the friends they left weeping upon the wharf as ever were any similar body of pilgrims the traveling outfit conferred upon me began with a naval uniform continued with a case of wine a small assortment of medicinal liquors and brandy several boxes of cigars a bunch of matches a finetoothed comb and a cake of soap and ended with a pair of socks n b i gave the soap to brown who bit into it and then shook his head and said that as a general thing he liked to prospect curious foreign dishes and find out what they were made of but he couldnt go that and threw it overboard       it is nearly impossible to imagine humor in this extract yet it is      a fair sample of the entire letter       he improves in his next at least in description and gives us a      picture of the crater  in this letter also he writes well and      seriously in a prophetic strain of the great trade that is to be      established between san francisco and hawaii and argues for a line      of steamers between the ports in order that the islands might be      populated by americans by which course european trade in that      direction could be superseded  but the humor in this letter such      as it is would scarcely provoke a smile today       as the letters continue he still urges the fostering of the island      trade by the united states finds himself impressed by the work of      the missionaries who have converted cannibals to christians and      gives picturesque bits of the life and scenery       hawaii was then dominated chiefly by french and english though the      american interests were by no means small    extract from letter no 4   cap fitch said theres the king thats him in the buggy i know him as far as i can see him  i had never seen a king and i naturally took out a notebook and put him down tall slender dark fullbearded green frockcoat with lapels and collar bordered with gold band an inch wide plug hat broad gold band around it royal costume looks too much like livery this man is not as fleshy as i thought he was  i had just got these notes when cap fitch discovered that hed got hold of the wrong king or rather that hed got hold of the kings driver or a carriage driver of one of the nobility the king wasnt present at all it was a great disappointment to me i heard afterwards that the comfortable easygoing king kamehameha v had been seen sitting on a barrel on the wharf the day before fishing but there was no consolation in that that did not restore me my lost king        this has something of the flavor of the man we were to know later      the quaint gentle resignation to disappointment which is one of the      finest touches in his humor       further on he says i had not shaved since i left san francisco      as soon as i got ashore i hunted up a striped pole and shortly      found one  i always had a yearning to be a king  this may never      be i suppose but at any rate it will always be a satisfaction to      me to know that if i am not a king i am the next thing to it      i have been shaved by the kings barber       honolulu was a place of cats  he saw cats of every shade and      variety  he says i saw catstomcats maryann cats bobtailed      cats blind cats oneeyed cats walleyed cats crosseyed cats      gray cats black cats white cats yellow cats striped cats      spotted cats tame cats wild cats singed cats individual cats      groups of cats platoons of cats companies of cats armies of cats      multitudes of cats millions of cats and all of them sleek fat      and lazy and sound asleep  which illustrates another      characteristic of the humor we were to know laterthe humor of      grotesque exaggeration in which he was always strong       he found the islands during his periods of inaction conducive to      indolence  if i were not so fond of looking into the rich mass of      green leaves he says that swathe the stately tamarind right      before my door i would idle less and write more i think       the union made good use of his letters  sometimes it printed them      on the front page  evidently they were popular from the beginning      the union was a fine handsome paperbeautiful in its minute      typography and in its presswork more beautiful than most papers      of today with their machineset type their vulgar illustrations      and their chainlightning presses  a few more extracts       the only cigars here are those trifling insipid tasteless      flavorless things they call manilasten for twentyfive centsand      it would take a thousand of them to be worth half the money  after      you have smoked about thirtyfive dollars worth of them in the      forenoon you feel nothing but a desperate yearning to go out      somewhere and take a smoke       captains and ministers form about half the population  the third      fourth is composed of kanakas and mercantile foreigners and their      families  the final fourth is made up of high officers of the      hawaiian government and there are just about enough cats to go      round       in no 6 april the 2d he says an excursion to diamond head and      the kings cocoanut grove was planned today at 430 p m the      party to consist of half a dozen gentlemen and three ladies  they      all started at the appointed hour except myself  somebody remarked      that it was twenty minutes past five oclock and that woke me up      it was a fortunate circumstance that cap phillips was there with      his turnout as he calls his top buggy that cap cook brought      here in 1778 and a horse that was here when cap cook came       this bit has something the savor of his subsequent work but as a      rule the humor compares poorly with that which was to come later       in no 7 he speaks of the natives singing american songsnot always      to his comfort  marching through georgia was one of their      favorite airs  he says if it had been all the same to gen      sherman i wish he had gone around by the way of the gulf of mexico      instead of marching through georgia       letters nos 8 9 and 10 were not of special importance  in no 10      he gives some advice to san francisco as to the treatment of      whalers  he says       if i were going to advise san francisco as to the best strategy to      employ in order to secure the whaling trade i should say cripple      your facilities for pulling sea captains on any pretence that      sailors can trump up and show the whaler a little more      consideration when he is in port       in no 11 may 24th he tells of a trip to the kalehi valley and      through historic points  at one place he looked from a precipice      over which old kamehameha i drove the army of oahu threequarters      of a century before       the vegetation and glory of the tropics attracted him  in one open      spot a vine of a species unknown had taken possession of two tall      dead stumps and wound around and about them and swung out from      their tops and twined their meeting tendrils together into a      faultless arch  man with all his art could not improve upon its      symmetry       he saw sam brannans palace the bungalow built by one shillaber      of san francisco at a cost of from thirty to forty thousand dollars      in its day it had outshone its regal neighbor the palace of the      king but had fallen to decay after passing into brannans hands      and had become a picturesque theban ruin by the time of mark twains      visit       in no 12 june 20th written may 23d he tells of the hawaiian      legislature and of his trip to the island of maui where as he      says he never spent so pleasant a month before or bade any place      goodby so regretfully       in no 13 he continues the legislature and gives this picture of      minister harris he is six feet high bony and rather slender      long ungainly arms stands so straight he leans back a little has      small side whiskers his head long up and down he has no command      of language or ideas oratory all show and pretence a big washing      and a small hangout weak insipid and a damn fool in general       in no 14 june 22d published july 16th he tells of the death and      burial ceremonies of the princess victoria k k and what was to      be of more importance to him of the arrival of anson burlingame      u s minister to china and gen van valkenburgh u s minister to      japan  they were to stay ten or fourteen days he said but an      effort would be made to have them stay over july 4th       speaking of burlingame burlingame is a man who could be esteemed      respected and popular anywhere no matter whether he was among      christians or cannibals  then in the same letter comes the great      incident  a letter arrived here yesterday giving a meagre account      of the arrival on the island of hawaii of nineteen poor starving      wretches who had been buffeting a stormy sea in an open boat for      fortythree days  their ship the hornet from new york with a      quantity of kerosene on board had taken fire and burned in lat 2d      north and long 35d west  when they had been entirely out of      provisions for a day or two and the cravings of hunger become      insufferable they yielded to the shipwrecked mariners fearful and      awful alternative and solemnly drew lots to determine who of their      number should die to furnish food for his comrades and then the      morning mists lifted and they saw land  they are being cared for      at sanpahoe not yet corroborated       the hornet disaster was fully told in his letter of june 27th  the      survivors were brought to honolulu and with the assistance of the      burlingame party clemens laid up with saddle boils was carried on      a stretcher to the hospital where aided by burlingame he      interviewed the shipwrecked men securing material for the most      important piece of serious writing he had thus far performed      letter no 15 to the unionof date june 25thoccupied the most of      the first page in the issue of july 19  it was a detailed account      of the sufferings of officers and crew as given by the third      officer and members of the crew    from letter no 15  in the postscript of a letter which i wrote two or three days ago and sent by the ship live yankee i gave you the substance of a letter received here from hilo by walker allen and co informing them that a boat containing fifteen men in a helpless and starving condition had drifted ashore at sanpahoe island of hawaii and that they had belonged to the clipper ship hornetcap mitchell masterhad been afloat since the burning of that vessel about one hundred miles north of the equator on the third of mayfortythree days  the third mate and ten of the seamen have arrived here and are now in the hospital cap mitchell one seaman named antonio passene and two passengers samuel and henry ferguson of new york city eighteen and twentyeight years are still at hilo but are expected here within the week in the captains modest epitome of the terrible romance you detect the fine old hero through it it reads like grant        here follows the whole terrible narrative which has since been      published in more substantial form and has been recognized as      literature  it occupied three and a half columns on the front page      of the union and of course constituted a great beat for that      papera fact which they appreciated to the extent of one hundred      dollars the column upon the writers return from the islands       in letters nos 14 and 15 he gives further particulars of the      month of mourning for the princess and funeral ceremonials  he      refers to burlingame who was still in the islands  the remaining      letters are unimportant       the hawaiian episode in mark twains life was one of those spots      that seemed to him always filled with sunlight  from beginning to      end it had been a long luminous dream in the next letter written      on the homewardbound ship becalmed under a cloudless sky we      realize the fitting end of the experience    to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis

then i shall have no time for other thingsthough truth to say i have nothing now to write which will be calculated to interest you much we left the sandwich islands eight or ten daysor twelve days agoi dont know which i have been so hard at work until today at least part of each day that the time has slipped away almost unnoticed the first few days we came at a whooping gait being in the latitude of the northeast trades but we soon ran out of them we used them as long as they lastedhundred of milesand came dead straight north until exactly abreast of san francisco precisely straight west of the city in a beelinebut a long beeline as we were about two thousand miles at seaconsequently we are not a hundred yards nearer san francisco than you are and here we lie becalmed on a glassy seawe do not move an inchwe throw banana and orange peel overboard and it lies still on the water by the vessels side sometimes the ocean is as dead level as the mississippi river and glitters glassily as if polishedbut usually of course no matter how calm the weather is we roll and surge over the grand groundswell we amuse ourselves tying pieces of tin to the ships log and sinking them to see how far we can distinguish them under water86 feet was the deepest we could see a small piece of tin but a white plate would show about as far down as the steeple of dr bullards church would reach i guess the sea is very dark and blue here  ever since we got becalmedfive daysi have been copying the diary of one of the young fergusons the two boys who starved and suffered with thirteen others in an open boat at sea for fortythree days lately after their ship the hornet was burned on the equator both these boys and captain mitchell are passengers with us i am copying the diary to publish in harpers magazine if i have time to fix it up properly when i get to san francisco  i suppose from present appearanceslight winds and calmsthat we shall be two or three weeks at sea yetand i hope soi am in no hurry to go to work                                                sunday morning aug 6  this is rather slow we still drift drift drift alongat intervals a spanking breeze and thendrift againhardly move for half a day but i enjoy it we have such snowy moonlight and such gorgeous sunsets and the ship is so easyeven in a gale she rolls very little compared to other vesselsand in this calm we could dance on deck if we chose you can walk a crack so steady is she very different from the ajax my trunk used to get loose in the stateroom and rip and tear around the place as if it had life in it and i always had to take my clothes off in bed because i could not stand up and do it  there is a ship in sightthe first object we have seen since we left honolulu we are still 1300 or 1400 miles from land and so anything like this that varies the vast solitude of the ocean makes all hands lighthearted and cheerful we think the ship is the comet which left honolulu several hours before we did she is about twelve miles away and so we cannot see her hull but the sailors think it is the comet because of some peculiarity about her foretopgallant sails we have watched her all the forenoon  afternoon we had preaching on the quarterdeck by rev mr rising of virginia city old friend of mine spread a flag on the boobyhatch which made a very good pulpit and then ranged the chairs on either side against the bulwarks last sunday we had the shadow of the mainsail but today we were on the opposite tack close hauled and had the sun i am leader of the choir on this ship and a sorry lead it is i hope they will have a better opinion of our music in heaven than i have down here if they dont a thunderbolt will come down and knock the vessel endways  the other ship is the cometshe is right abreast three miles away sailing on our courseboth of us in a dead calm with the glasses we can see what we take to be men and women on her decks i am well acquainted with nearly all her passengers and being so close seems right sociable  monday 7i had just gone to bed a little after midnight when the 2d mate came and roused up the captain and said the comet has come round and is standing away on the other tack i went up immediately and so did all our passengers without waiting to dressmen women and children there was a perceptible breeze pretty soon the other ship swept down upon us with all her sails set and made a fine show in the luminous starlight she passed within a hundred yards of us so we could faintly see persons on her decks we had two minutes chat with each other through the medium of hoarse shouting and then she bore away to windward  in the morning she was only a little black peg standing out of the glassy sea in the distant horizonan almost invisible mark in the bright sky dead calm so the ships have stood all day longhave not moved 100 yards  aug 8the calm continues magnificent weather the gentlemen have all turned boys they play boyish games on the poop and quarterdeck for instance they lay a knife on the fiferail of the mainmaststand off three steps shut one eye walk up and strike at it with the forefinger seldom hit it also they lay a knife on the deck and walk seven or eight steps with eyes close shut and try to find it they kneelplace elbows against kneesextend hands in front along the deckplace knife against end of fingersthen clasp hands behind back and bend forward and try to pick up the knife with their teeth and rise up from knees without rolling over or losing their balance they tie a string to the shroudsstand with back against it walk three steps eyes shutturn around three times and go and put finger on the string only a military man can do it if you want to know how perfectly ridiculous a grown man looks performing such absurdities in the presence of ladies get one to try it  afternoonthe calm is no more there are three vessels in sight it is so sociable to have them hovering about us on this broad waste of water it is sunny and pleasant but blowing hard every rag about the ship is spread to the breeze and she is speeding over the sea like a bird there is a large brig right astern of us with all her canvas set and chasing us at her best she came up fast while the winds were light but now it is hard to tell whether she gains or not we can see the people on the forecastle with the glass the race is exciting i am sorry to know that we shall soon have to quit the vessel and go ashore if she keeps up this speed  friday aug 10we have breezes and calms alternately the brig is two miles to three astern and just stays there we sail directly eastthis brings the brig with all her canvas set almost in the eye of the sun when it setsbeautiful she looks sharply cut and black as a coal against a background of fire and in the midst of a sea of blood  san francisco aug 20we never saw the comet again till the 13th in the morning three miles away at three oclock that afternoon 25 days out from honolulu both ships entered the golden gate of san francisco side by side and 300 yards apart there was a gale blowing and both vessels clapped on every stitch of canvas and swept up through the channel and past the fortresses at a magnificent gait  i have been up to sacramento and squared accounts with the union they paid me a great deal more than they promised me

uncertainties      of his future depressed himfilled him with forebodings  at one      moment he felt himself on the verge of suicidethe world seemed so      little worth while       he wished to make a trip around the world a project that required      money  he contemplated making a book of his island letters and      experiences and the acceptance by harpers magazine of the revised      version of the hornet shipwreck story encouraged this thought       friends urged him to embody in a lecture the picturesque aspect of      hawaiian life  the thought frightened him but it also appealed to      him strongly  he believed he could entertain an audience once he      got started on the right track  as governor of the third house at      carson city he had kept the audience in hand  men in whom he had      the utmost confidence insisted that he follow up the lecture idea      and engage the largest house in the city for his purpose  the      possibility of failure appalled him but he finally agreed to the      plan       in roughing it and elsewhere has been told the story of this      venturethe tale of its splendid success  he was no longer      concerned now as to his immediate future  the lecture field was      profitable  his audience laughed and shouted  he was learning the      flavor of real success and exulting in it  with dennis mccarthy      formerly one of the partners in the enterprise as manager he made      a tour of california and nevada    to mrs jane clemens and others in st louis                                          virginia city nov 1 1866  all the folks

same authorit paid him well he could go home now      without shame  indeed from his next letter full of the      boyish elation which always to his last years was the      complement of his success

afraid i shant lecture much in the states  the china mail steamer is getting ready and everybody says i am throwing away a fortune in not going in her i firmly believe it myself  i sail for the states

arriving in new york after an adventurous voyage he met a number      of old californiansmen who believed in himand urged him to      lecture  he also received offers of newspaper engagements and from      charles henry webb who had published the californian which bret      harte had edited came the proposal to collect his published      sketches including the jumping frog story in book form  webb      himself was in new york and offered the sketches to several      publishers including canton who had once refused the frog story by      omitting it from artemus wards book  it seems curious that canton      should make a second mistake and refuse it again but publishers      were wary in those days and even the newspaper success of the frog      story did not tempt him to venture it as the title tale of a book      webb finally declared he would publish the book himself and      clemens after a few weeks of new york joined his mother and family      in st louis and gave himself up to a considerable period of      visiting lecturing meantime in both hannibal and keokuk       fate had great matters in preparation for him  the quaker city      mediterranean excursion the first great ocean picnic was announced      that spring and mark twain realized that it offered a possible      opportunity for him to see something of the world  he wrote at once      to the proprietors of the altacalifornia and proposed that they      send him as their correspondent  to his delight his proposition was      accepted the alta agreeing to the twelve hundred dollars passage      money and twenty dollars each for letters       the quaker city was not to sail until the 8th of june but the alta      wished some preliminary letters from new york  furthermore webb      had the frog book in press and would issue it may 1st  clemens      therefore returned to new york in april and now once more being      urged by the californians to lecture he did not refuse  frank      fuller formerly governor of utah took the matter in hand and      engaged cooper union for the venture  he timed it for may 6th      which would be a few days after the appearance of webbs book      clemens was even more frightened at the prospect of this lecture      than he had been in san francisco and with more reason for in new      york his friends were not many and competition for public favor was      very great  there are two letters written may 1st one to his      people and one to bret harte in san francisco that give us the      situation           mark twains letters 18671875  by mark twain

inform you that i am well and hope these few lines will find you enjoying the same gods blessing  the book is out and is handsome it is full of damnable errors of grammar and deadly inconsistencies of

everything looks shady at least if not dark i have got a good agentbut now after we have hired cooper institute and gone to an expense in one way or another of 500 it comes out that i have got to play against speaker colfax at irving hall ristori and also the double troupe of japanese jugglers the latter opening at the great academy of musicand with all this against me i have taken the largest

of complimentaries to the      schoolteachers of new york city and the surrounding      districts  no one seems to have declined them  clemens      lectured to a jammed house and acquired much reputation      lecture proposals came from several directions but he could      not accept them now he wrote home that he was eighteen alta      letters behind and had refused everything  thos nast the      cartoonist then in his first fame propped a joint tour      clemens to lecture while he nast would illustrate with      lightning sketches but even this could not be considered      now  in a little while he would sail and the days were      overfull  a letter written a week before he sailed is full      of the hurry and strain of these last days      to mrs jane clemens and family in st

preparation whatevershall not pack my trunk till the morning we sail yet my hands are full of what i am going to do the day before we sailand what isnt done that day will go undone  all i do know or feel is that i am wild with impatience to movemovemove half a dozen times i have wished i had sailed long ago in some ship that wasnt going to keep me chained here to chafe for lagging ages while she got ready to go curse the endless delays they always kill methey make me neglect every duty and then i have a conscience that tears me like a wild beast i wish i never had to stop anywhere a month i

his lifethe period of aimless wanderingadventure      youth       perhaps a paragraph of explanation should precede this letter      political changes had eliminated orion in nevada and he was now

unspeakably glad of it  i havent got anything to write else i would write it i have just written myself clear out in letters to the alta and i think they are the stupidest letters that were ever written from new york corresponding has been a perfect drag ever since i got to the states if it continues abroad i dont know what the tribune and alta folks will think i have withdrawn the sandwich island bookit would be useless to publish it in these dull publishing times as for the frog book i dont believe that will ever pay anything worth a cent i published it simply to advertise myselfnot with the hope of making anything out of it  well i havent anything to write except that i am tired of staying in one placethat i am in a fever to get away read my alta lettersthey contain everything i could possibly write to you tell zeb and john leavenworth to write me they can get plenty of gossip from the pilots  an importing house sent two cases of exquisite champagne aboard the ship for me todayveuve clicquot and lac dor i and my roommate have set apart every saturday as a solemn fast day wherein we will entertain no light matters of frivolous conversation but only get drunk that is a joke his mother and sisters are the best and most homelike people i have yet found in a brown stone front there is no style about them except in house and furniture  i wish orion were going on this voyage for i believe he could not help but be cheerful and jolly i often wonder if his law business is going satisfactorily to him but knowing that the dull season is setting in now it looked like it had already set in before i have felt as if i could almost answer the question myselfwhich is to say in plain words i was afraid to ask i wish i had gone to washington in the winter instead of going west i could have gouged an office out of bill stewart for him and that would atone for the loss of my home visit but i am so worthless that it seems to me i never do anything or accomplish anything that lingers in my mind as a pleasant memory my mind is stored full of unworthy conduct toward orion and towards you all and an accusing conscience gives me peace only in excitement and restless moving from place to place if i could say i had done one thing for any of you that entitled me to your good opinion i say nothing of your love for i am sure of that no matter how unworthy of it i may make myself from orion down you have always given me that all the days of my life when god almighty knows i seldom deserve it i believe i could go home and stay there and i know i would care little for the worlds praise or blame there is no satisfaction in the worlds praise anyhow and it has no worth to me save in the way of business i tried to gather up its compliments to send to you but the work was distasteful and i dropped it  you observe that under a cheerful exterior i have got a spirit that is angry with me and gives me freely its contempt i can get away from that at sea and be tranquil and satisfiedand so with my parting love and benediction for orion and all of you i say goodbye and god bless you alland welcome the wind that wafts a weary soul to the sunny lands of the

hand the next letter adds something of interest to the      bookcircumstances which a modest author would necessarily omit      to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis                                          yalta russia aug  25 1867  dear folkswe have been representing the united states all we knew how today we went to sebastopol after we got tired of constantinople got your letter there and one at naples and there the commandant and the whole town came aboard and were as jolly and sociable as old friends they said the emperor of russia was at yalta 30 miles or 40 away and urged us to go there with the ship and visit himpromised us a cordial welcome they insisted on sending a telegram to the emperor and also a courier overland to announce our coming but we knew that a great english excursion party and also the viceroy of egypt in his splendid yacht had been refused an audience within the last fortnight so we thought it not safe to try it they said no differencethe emperor would hardly visit our ship because that would be a most extraordinary favor and one which he uniformly refuses to accord under any circumstances but he would certainly receive us at his palace we still declined but we had to go to odessa 250 miles away and there the governor general urged us and sent a telegram to the emperor which we hardly expected to be answered but it was and promptly so we sailed back to yalta  we all went to the palace at noon today 3 miles in carriages and on horses sent by the emperor and we had a jolly time instead of the usual formal audience of 15 minutes we staid 4 hours and were made a good deal more at home than we could have been in a new york drawingroom the whole tribe turned out to receive our partyemperor empress the oldest daughter grandduchess marie a pretty girl of 14 a little grand duke her brother and a platoon of admirals princes peers of the empire etc and in a little while an aiddecamp arrived with a request from the grand duke michael the emperors brother that we would visit his palace and breakfast with him the emperor also invited us on behalf of his absent eldest son and heir aged 22 to visit his palace and consider it a visit to him they all talk english and they were all very neatly but very plainly dressed you all dress a good deal finer than they were dressed the emperor and his family threw off all reserve and showed us all over the palace themselves it is very rich and very elegant but in no way gaudy  i had been appointed chairman of a committee to draught an address to the emperor in behalf of the passengers and as i fully expected and as they fully intended i had to write the address myself i didnt mind it because i have no modesty and would as soon write to an emperor as to anybody elsebut considering that there were 5 on the committee i thought they might have contributed one paragraph among them anyway they wanted me to read it to him too but i declined that honornot because i hadnt cheek enough and some to spare but because our consul at odessa was along and also the secretary of our legation at st petersburgh and of course one of those ought to read it the emperor accepted the addressit was his business to do itand so many others have praised it warmly that i begin to imagine it must be a wonderful sort of document and herewith send you the original draught of it to be put into alcohol and preserved forever like a curious reptile  they live right well at the grand duke michaels their breakfasts are not gorgeous but very excellentand if mike were to say the word i would go there and breakfast with him tomorrow                                     yrs aff                                              sam  p s written across the face of the last page they had told us it would be polite to invite the emperor to visit the ship though he would not be likely to do it but he didnt give us a chancehe has requested permission to come on board with his family and all his relations tomorrow and take a sail in case it is calm weather i can entertain them my hand is in now and if you want any more emperors feted in style trot them out        the next letter is of interest in that it gives us the program and      volume of his work  with all the sight seeing he was averaging a      full four letters a weeklong letters requiring careful      observation and inquiry  how fresh and impressionable and full of      vigor he was even in that fierce southern heat  no one makes the      mediterranean trip in summer today and the thought of adding      constant letterwriting to steady travel through southern france      italy greece and turkey in blazing midsummer is stupefying  and      syria and egypt in september      to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis

horseback a long days and thence by rail and diligence to cadiz i will not mail this till i see the gibraltar lightsi begin to think they wont let us in anywhere  1130 p mgibraltar  at anchor and all

all night in a swinging trot and at daylight took a caleche a wheeled vehicle and rode 5 hoursthen took cars and traveled till twelve at night that landed us at seville and we were over the hard part of our trip and somewhat tired since then we have taken things comparatively easy drifting around from one town to another and attracting a good deal of attention for i guess strangers do not wander through andalusia and the other southern provinces of spain often the country is precisely as it was when don quixote and sancho panza were possible characters  but i see now what the glory of spain must have been when it was under moorish domination no i will not say that but then when one is carried away infatuated entranced with the wonders of the alhambra and the supernatural beauty of the alcazar he is apt to overflow with admiration for the splendid intellects that created them  i cannot write now i am only dropping a line to let you know i am well the ship will call for us here tomorrow we may stop at lisbon and shall at the bermudas and will arrive in new york ten days after this letter gets there                                     sam       this is the last personal letter written during that famous first      seagipsying and reading it our regret grows that he did not put      something of his spanish excursion into his book  he never returned      to spain and he never wrote of it  only the barest mention of      seven beautiful days is found in the innocents abroad     viii letters 186768 washington and san francisco the proposed book of travel a new lecture       from mark twains home letters we get several important sidelights      on this first famous book  we learn for in stance that it was he      who drafted the ship address to the emperorthe opening lines of      which became so wearisome when repeated by the sailors      furthermore we learn something of the scope and extent of his      newspaper correspondence which must have kept him furiously busy      done as it was in the midst of superheated and continuous      sightseeing  he wrote fifty three letters to the altacalifornia      six to the new york tribune and at least two to the new york      herald more than sixty all told of an average length of three to      four thousand words each mark twain always claimed to be a lazy      man and certainly he was likely to avoid an undertaking not suited      to his gifts but he had energy in abundance for work in his chosen      field to have piled up a correspondence of that size in the time      and under the circumstances already noted quality considered may      be counted a record in the history of travel letters       they made him famous  arriving in new york november 19 1867 mark      twain found himself no longer unknown to the metropolis or to any      portion of america  papers east and west had copied his alta and      tribune letters and carried his name into every corner of the states      and territories  he had preached a new gospel in travel literature      the gospel of frankness and sincerity that americans could      understand  also his literary powers had awakened at last  his      work was no longer trivial crude and showy it was full of      dignity beauty and power his humor was finer worthier  the      difference in quality between the quaker city letters and those      written from the sandwich islands only a year before can scarcely be      measured       he did not remain in new york but went down to washington where he      had arranged for a private secretaryship with senator william m      stewartthe bill stewart mentioned in the preceding chapter      whom he had known in nevada  such a position he believed would make      but little demand upon his time and would afford him an insight      into washington life which he could make valuable in the shape of      newspaper correspondence       but fate had other plans for him  he presently received the      following letter                     from elisha bliss jr in hartford                  office of the american publishing company                                          hartford

knowing your arrival home was expected so soon we are desirous of obtaining from you a work of some kind perhaps compiled from your letters from the east c with such interesting additions as may be proper we are the publishers of a d richardsons works and flatter ourselves that we can give an author as favorable terms and do as full justice to his productions as any other house in the country we are perhaps the oldest subscription house in the country and have never failed to give a book an immense circulation we sold about 100000 copies of richardsons f d  e field dungeon and escape and are now printing 41000 of beyond the mississippi and large orders ahead if you have any thought of writing a book or could be induced to do so we should be pleased to see you and will do so will you do us

          washington dec  2 1867 e bliss jr esq  secy american publishing co  dear siri only received your favor of nov 21st last night at the rooms of the tribune bureau here it was forwarded from the tribune office new york where it had lain eight or ten days this will be a sufficient apology for the seeming discourtesy of my silence  i wrote fiftytwo three letters for the san francisco alta california during the quaker city excursion about half of which number have been printed thus far the alta has few exchanges in the east and i suppose scarcely any of these letters have been copied on this side of the rocky mountains i could weed them of their chief faults of construction and inelegancies of expression and make a volume that would be more acceptable in many respects than any i could now write when those letters were written my impressions were fresh but now they have lost that freshness they were warm thenthey are cold now i could strike out certain letters and write new ones wherewith to supply their places if you think such a book would suit your purpose please drop me a line specifying the size and general style of the volume when the matter ought to be ready whether it should have pictures in it or not and particularly what your terms with me would be and what amount of money i might possibly make out of it the latter clause has a degree of importance for me which is almost beyond my own comprehension but you understand that of course  i have other propositions for a book but have doubted the propriety of interfering with good newspaper engagements except my way as an author could be demonstrated to be plain before me but i know richardson and learned from him some months ago something of an idea of the subscription plan of publishing if that is your plan invariably it looks safe  i am on the n y tribune staff here as an occasional among other things and a note from you addressed to                                     very truly c

notable publishing connections in american literary history      the book however was not begun immediately  bliss was in poor      health and final arrangements were delayed it was not until late in      january that clemens went to hartford and concluded the arrangement       meantime fate had disclosed another matter of even greater      importance we get the first hint of it in the following letter      though to him its beginning had been earlieron a day in the blue      harbor of smyrna when young charles langdon a fellowpassenger on      the quaker city had shown to mark twain a miniature of young      langdons sister at home        to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                     224 f street wash jan 8 1868  my dear mother and sisterand so

miss alice hooker another beautiful girl a niece of henry ward beechers we sent the old folks home early with instructions not to send the carriage till midnight and then i just staid there and worried the life out of those girls i am going to spend a few days with the langdons in elmira new york as soon as i get time and a few days at mrs hookers in hartford conn shortly  henry ward beecher

night at mr beachs henry ward is a brick  i found out at 10 oclock last night that i was to lecture tomorrow evening and so you must be aware that i have been working like sin all night to get a lecture written i have finished it i call it frozen truth it is a little topheavy though because there is more truth in the title than there is in the lecture  but thunder i mustnt sit here writing

langdon again in the letters of that time      but it was not because she was absent from his thoughts  he had      first seen her with her father and brother at the old st nicholas      hotel on lower broadway where soon after the arrival of the      quaker city in new york he had been invited to dine  long      afterward he said it is forty years ago from that day to this she      has never

st louis                                          hartford conn  jan 2468  dear mother and sisterthis is a good week for me i stopped in the herald office as i came through new york to see the boys on the staff and young james gordon bennett asked me to write twice a week impersonally for the herald and said if i would i might have full swing and write about anybody and everybody i wanted to i said i must have the very fullest possible swing and he said all right i said its a contract and that settled that matter  ill make it a point to write one letter a week anyhow  but the best thing that has happened was here this great american publishing company kept on trying to bargain with me for a book till i thought i would cut the matter short by coming up for a talk i met rev henry ward beecher in brooklyn and with his usual wholesouled way of dropping his own work to give other people a lift when he gets a chance he said now here you are one of the talented men of the agenobody is going to deny thatbut in matters of business i dont suppose you know more than enough to came in when it rains ill tell you what to do and how to do it and he did  and i listened well and then came up here and made a splendid contract for a quaker city book of 5 or 600 large pages with illustrations the manuscript to be placed in the publishers hands by the middle of july my percentage is to be a fifth more than they have ever paid any author except horace greeley beecher will be surprised i guess when he hears this  but i had my mind made up to one thingi wasnt going to touch a book unless there was money in it and a good deal of it i told them so i had the misfortune to bust out one author of standing they had his manuscript with the understanding that they would publish his book if they could not get a book from me they only publish two books at a time and so my book and richardsons life of grant will fill the bill for next fall and winterso that manuscript was sent back to its author today  these publishers get off the most tremendous editions of their books you can imagine i shall write to the enterprise and alta every week as usual i guess and to the herald twice a weekoccasionally to the tribune and the magazines i have a stupid article in the galaxy just issued but i am not going to write to this that and the other paper any more  the chicago tribune wants letters but i hope and pray i have charged them so much that they will not close the contract i am gradually getting out of debt but these trips to new york do cost like sin i hope you have cut out and forwarded my printed letters to washingtonplease continue to do so as they arrive  i have had a tiptop time here for a few days guest of mr jno hookers familybeechers relativesin a general way of mr bliss also who is head of the publishing firm puritans are mighty straightlaced and they wont let me smoke in the parlor but the almighty dont make any better people  love to allgoodbye i shall be in new york 3 daysthen go on to the capital                      yrs affly especially ma                                                   yr sam  i have to make a speech at the annual herald dinner on the 6th of may        no formal contract for the book had been made when this letter was      written  a verbal agreement between bliss and clemens had been      reached to be ratified by an exchange of letters in the near      future  bliss had made two propositions viz ten thousand      dollars cash in hand or a 5percent royalty on the selling price      of the book  the cash sum offered looked very large to mark twain      and he was sorely tempted to accept it  he had faith however in      the book and in blisss ability to sell it  he agreed therefore      to the royalty proposition the best business judgment i ever      displayed he often declared in after years  five per cent      royalty sounds rather small in these days of more liberal contracts      but the american publishing company sold its books only by      subscription and the agents commissions and delivery expenses ate      heavily into the profits  clemens was probably correct in saying      that his percentage was larger than had been paid to any previous      author except horace greeley  the john hooker mentioned was the      husband of henry ward beechers sister isabel  it was easy to

yrs truly                               sam clemens        mark twain in washington was in line for political preferment his      wide acquaintance on the pacific slope his new fame and growing      popularity his powerful and dreaded pen all gave him special      distinction at the capital  from time to time the offer of one      office or another tempted him but he wisely or luckily resisted      in his letters home are presented some of his problems       to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in st louis                                224 f street washington feb  6 1868  my dear mother and sisterfor two months there have been some fifty applications before the government for the postmastership of san francisco which is the heaviest concentration of political power on the coast and consequently is a post which is much coveted  when i found that a personal friend of mine the chief editor of the alta was an applicant i said i didnt want iti would not take 10000 a year out of a friends pocket  the two months have passed i heard day before yesterday that a new and almost unknown candidate had suddenly turned up on the inside track and was to be appointed at once i didnt like that and went after his case in a fine passion i hunted up all our senators and representatives and found that his name was actually to come from the president early in the morning  then judge field said if i wanted the place he could pledge me the presidents appointmentand senator conness said he would guarantee me the senates confirmation it was a great temptation but it would render it impossible to fill my book contract and i had to drop the idea  i have to spend august and september in hartford which isnt san francisco mr conness offers me any choice out of five influential california offices now some day or other i shall want an office and then just my luck i cant get it i suppose  they want to send me abroad as a consul or a minister i said i didnt want any of the pie god knows i am mean enough and lazy enough now without being a foreign consul  sometime in the course of the present century i think they will create a commissioner of patents and then i hope to get a berth for orion  i published 6 or 7 letters in the tribune while i was gone now i cannot get them i suppose i must have them copied                                     love to all                                                sam        orion clemens was once more a candidate for office nevada      had become a state with regularly elected officials and      orion had somehow missed being chosen  his day of authority      had passed and the law having failed to support him he was      again back at his old occupation setting type in st louis      he was as ever full of dreams and inventions that would      some day lead to fortune  with the gift of the sellers      imagination inherited by all the family he lacked the      driving power which means achievement  more and more as the      years went by he would lean upon his brother for moral and      physical support  the chances for him in washington do not      appear to have been bright  the political situation under      andrew johnson was not a happy one       to orion clemens in st louis                                224 f street wash feb 21 1868  my dear broi am glad you do not want the clerkship for that patent office is in such a muddle that there would be no security for the permanency of a place in it the same remark will apply to all offices here now and no doubt will till the close of the present administration  any man who holds a place here now stands prepared at all times to vacate it you are doing now exactly what i wanted you to do a year ago  we chase phantoms half the days of our lives  it is well if we learn wisdom even then and save the other half  i am in for it i must go on chasing them until i marrythen i am done with literature and all other boshthat is literature wherewith to please the general public  i shall write to please myself then i hope you will set type till you complete that invention for surely government pap must be nauseating food for a mana man whom god has enabled to saw wood and be independent it really seemed to me a falling from grace the idea of going back to san francisco nothing better than a mere postmaster albeit the public would have thought i came with gilded honors and in great glory  i only retain correspondence enough now to make a living for myself and have discarded all else so that i may have time to spare for the book drat the thing i wish it were done or that i had no other writing to do  this is the place to get a poor opinion of everybody in there isnt one man in washington in civil office who has the brains of anson burlingameand i suppose if china had not seized and saved his great talents to the world this government would have discarded him when his time was up  there are more pitiful intellects in this congress oh geeminy there are few of them that i find pleasant enough company to visit  i am most infernally tired of wash and its attractions to be busy is a mans only happinessand i amotherwise i should die                                               yrs  aff                                                   sam        the secretarial position with senator stewart was shortlived  one      cannot imagine mark twain as anybodys secretary and doubtless      there was little to be gained on either side by the arrangement      they parted without friction though in later years when stewart      had become old and irascible he used to recount a list of      grievances and declare that he had been obliged to threaten violence      in order to bring mark to terms but this was because the author of      roughing it had in that book taken liberties with the senator to      the extent of an anecdote and portrait which though certainly      harmless enough had for some reason given deep offense       mark twain really had no time for secretary work  for one thing he      was associated with john swinton in supplying a washington letter to      a list of newspapers and then he was busy collecting his quaker      city letters and preparing the copy for his book  matters were      going well enough when trouble developed from an unexpected      quarter  the altacalifornia had copyrighted the letters and      proposed to issue them in book form  there had been no contract      which would prevent this and the correspondence which clemens      undertook with the alta management led to nothing  he knew that he      had powerful friends among the owners if he could reach them      personally and he presently concluded to return to san francisco      make what arrangement he could and finish his book there  it was      his fashion to be prompt in his next letter we find him already on      the way       to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis

they had received full value in the      newspaper use of the letters and that the book rights      remained with the author  a letter to bliss conveys the      situation        to elisha bliss jr in

to think of publishing them themselves in book form i am steadily at work and shall start east with the completed manuscript about the middle of june  i lectured here on the trip the other nightover

sail in june  his friends persuaded him to cover his      lecture circuit of two years before telling the story of his      travels  this he did with considerable profit being everywhere      received with great honors  he ended this tour with a second      lecture in san francisco announced in a droll and characteristic      fashion which delighted his pacific admirers and insured him a      crowded housesee mark twain a biography chap  xlvi and      appendix h       his agreement had been to deliver his ms about august 1st      returning by the chauncey july 28th he was two days later in      hartford and had placid the copy for the new book in blisss hands      it was by no means a compilation of his newspaper letters  his      literary vision was steadily broadening  all of the letters had      been radically edited some had been rewritten some entirely      eliminated  he probably thought very well of the book an opinion      shared by bliss but it is unlikely that either of them realized      that it was to become a permanent classic and the best selling book      of travel for at least fifty years     ix letters 186870 courtship and the innocents abroad       the story of mark twains courtship has been fully told in the      completer story of his life it need only be briefly sketched here      as a setting for the letters of this period  in his letter of      january 8th we note that he expects to go to elmira for a few days      as soon as he has time       but he did not have time or perhaps did not receive a pressing      invitation until he had returned with his ms from california      then through young charles langdon his quaker city shipmate he      was invited to elmira  the invitation was given for a week but      through a subterfugeunpremeditated and certainly fair enough in      a matter of lovehe was enabled to considerably prolong his visit      by the end of his stay he had become really like one of the      family though certainly not yet accepted as such  the fragmentary      letter that follows reflects something of his pleasant situation      the mrs fairbanks mentioned in this letter had been something more      than a shipmother to mark twain  she was a woman of fine literary      taste and quaker city correspondent for her husbands paper the      cleveland herald  she had given mark twain sound advice as to his      letters which he had usually read to her and had in no small      degree modified his early natural tendency to exaggeration and      outlandish humor  he owed her much and never failed to pay her      tribute       fragment of a letter to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis                                     elmira ny  aug  26 1868  dear folksyou see i am progressingthough slowly i shall be here a week yet maybe twofor charlie langdon cannot get away until his fathers chief business man returns from a journeyand a visit to mrs fairbanks at cleveland would lose half its pleasure if charlie were not along moulton of st louis ought to be there too we three were mrs fs cubs in the quaker city she took good care that we were at church regularly on sundays at the 8bells prayer meeting every night and she kept our buttons sewed on and our clothing in orderand in a word was as busy and considerate and as watchful over her family of uncouth and unruly cubs and as patient and as longsuffering withal as a natural mother so we expect                                          aug  25th  didnt finish yesterday something called me away i am most comfortably situated here this is the pleasantest family i ever knew i only have one trouble and that is they give me too much thought and too much time and invention to the object of making my visit pass delightfully it needs       just how and when he left the langdon home the letters do not      record  early that fall he began a lecture engagement with james      redpath proprietor of the boston lyceum bureau and his engagements      were often within reach of elmira  he had a standing invitation now      to the langdon home and the end of the week often found him there      yet when at last he proposed for the hand of livy langdon the      acceptance was by no means prompt  he was a favorite in the langdon      household but his suitability as a husband for the frail and gentle      daughter was questioned       however he was carrying everything just then by storm  the      largest houses everywhere were crowded to hear him  papers spoke of      him as the coming man of the age people came to their doors to see      him pass  there is but one letter of this period but it gives us      the picture        to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis                                               cleveland nov 20 1868  dear folksi played against the eastern favorite fanny kemble in pittsburgh last night she had 200 in her house and i had upwards of 1500 all the seats were sold in a driving rain storm 3 days ago as reserved seats at 25 cents extra even those in the second and third tiersand when the last seat was gone the box office had not been open more than 2 hours when i reached the theatre they were turning people away and the house was crammed 150 or 200 stood up all the evening  i go to elmira tonight i am simply lecturing for societies at 100 a pop                           yrs                                    sam        it would be difficult for any family to refuse relationship with one      whose star was so clearly ascending especially when every      inclination was in his favor and the young lady herself encouraged      his suit  a provisional engagement was presently made but it was      not finally ratified until february of the following year  then in      a letter from one of his lecture points he tells his people      something of his happiness        to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis                                          lockport n y  feb 27 1868  dear folksi enclose 20 for ma i thought i was getting ahead of her little assessments of 35 a month but find i am falling behind with her instead and have let her go without money well i did not mean to do it but you see when people have been getting ready for months in a quiet way to get married they are bound to grow stingy and go to saving up money against that awful day when it is sure to be needed i am particularly anxious to place myself in a position where i can carry on my married life in good shape on my own hook because i have paddled my own canoe so long that i could not be satisfied now to let anybody help meand my proposed fatherinlaw is naturally so liberal that it would be just like him to want to give us a start in life but i dont want it that way i can start myself i dont want any help i can run this institution without any outside assistance and i shall have a wife who will stand by me like a soldier through thick and thin and never complain she is only a little body but she hasnt her peer in christendom i gave her only a plain gold engagement ring when fashion imperatively demands a twohundred dollar diamond one and told her it was typical of her future lotnamely that she would have to flourish on substantials rather than luxuries but you see i know the girlshe dont care anything about luxuries she is a splendid girl she spends no money but her usual years allowance and she spends nearly every cent of that on other people she will be a good sensible little wife without any airs about her i dont make intercession for her beforehand and ask you to love her for there isnt any use in thatyou couldnt help it if you were to try  i warn you that whoever comes within the fatal influence of her beautiful nature is her willing slave for evermore i take my affidavit on that statement her father and mother and brother embrace and pet her constantly precisely as if she were a sweetheart instead of a blood relation she has unlimited power over her father and yet she never uses it except to make him help people who stand in need of help  but if i get fairly started on the subject of my bride i never shall get throughand so i will quit right here i went to elmira a little over a week ago and staid four days and then had to go to new york on business                                no further letters have been preserved until june when he is in      elmira and with his fiancee reading final proofs on the new book      they were having an idyllic good time of course but it was a      useful time too for olivia langdon had a keen and refined literary      instinct and the innocents abroad as well as mark twains other      books are better today for her influence       it has been stated that mark twain loved the lecture platform but      from his letters we see that even at this early date when he was at      the height of his first great vogue as a public entertainer he had      no love for platform life  undoubtedly he rejoiced in the brief      periods when he was actually before his audience and could play upon      it with his master touch but the dreary intermissions of travel and      broken sleep were too heavy a price to pay        to mrs jane clemens and family in st louis                                          elmira june 4 1868  dear folkslivy sends you her love and loving good wishes and i send you mine the last 3 chapters of the book came tonightwe shall read it in the morning and then thank goodness we are done  in twelve months or rather i believe it is fourteen i have earned just eighty dollars by my pentwo little magazine squibs and one newspaper letteraltogether the idlest laziest 14 months i ever spent in my life and in that time my absolute and necessary expenses have been scorchingly heavyfor i have now less than three thousand six hundred dollars in bank out of the eight or nine thousand i have made during those months lecturing my expenses were something frightful during the winter i feel ashamed of my idleness and yet i have had really no inclination to do anything but court livy i havent any other inclination yet i have determined not to work as hard traveling any more as i did last winter and so i have resolved not to lecture outside of the 6 new england states next winter my western course would easily amount to 10000 but i would rather make 2 or 3 thousand in new england than submit again to so much wearing travel i have promised to talk ten nights for a thousand dollars in the state of new york provided the places are close together but after all if i get located in a newspaper in a way to suit me in the meantime i dont want to lecture at all next winter and probably shant i most cordially hate the lecture field and after all i shudder to think that i may never get out of it  in all conversations with gough and anna dickinson nasby oliver wendell holmes wendell phillips and the other old stagers i could not observe that they ever expected or hoped to get out of the business i dont want to get wedded to it as they are livy thinks we can live on a very moderate sum and that well not need to lecture i know very well that she can live on a small allowance but i am not so sure about myself i cant scare her by reminding her that her fathers family expenses are forty thousand dollars a year because she produces the documents at once to show that precious little of this outlay is on her account but i must not commence writing about livy else i shall never stop there isnt such another little piece of perfection in the world as she is  my time is become so short now that i doubt if i get to california this summer if i manage to buy into a paper i think i will visit you a while and not go to cal at all i shall know something about it after my next trip to hartford we all go there on the 10ththe whole familyto attend a wedding on the 17th i am offered an interest in a cleveland paper which would pay me 2300 to 2500 a year and a salary added of 3000 the salary is fair enough but the interest is not large enough and so i must look a little further the cleveland folks say they can be induced to do a little better by me and urge me to come out and talk business but it dont strike mei feel little or no inclination to go  i believe i havent anything else to write and it is bedtime i want to write to orion but i keep putting it offi keep putting everything off day after day livy and i are together all day long and until 10 at night and then i feel dreadfully sleepy if orion will bear with me and forgive me i will square up with him yet i will even let him kiss livy  my love to mollie and annie and sammie and all goodbye                                affectionately                                                   sam        it is curious with his tendency to optimism and general expansion      of futures that he says nothing of the possible sales of the new      book or of his expectations in that line  it was issued in july      and by june the publishers must have had promising advance orders      from their canvassers but apparently he includes none of these      chickens in his financial forecast  even when the book had been out      a full month and was being shipped at the rate of several hundreds      a day he makes no reference to it in a letter to his sister other      than to ask if she has not received a copy  this however was a      mark twain peculiarity  writing was his trade the returns from it      seldom excited him  it was only when he drifted into strange and      untried fields that he began to chase rainbows to blow iridescent      bubbles and count unmined gold        to mrs moffett in st louis                                          buffalo aug 20 1869  my dear sisteri have only time to write a line i got your letter this morning and mailed it to livy she will be expecting me tonight and i am sorry to disappoint her so but then i couldnt well get away i will go next saturday  i have bundled up livys picture and will try and recollect to mail it tomorrow it is a porcelaintype and i think you will like it  i am sorry i never got to st louis because i may be too busy to go for a long time but i have been busy all the time and st louis is clear out of the way and remote from the world and all ordinary routes of travel you must not place too much weight upon this idea of moving the capital from washington st louis is in some respects a better place for it than washington though there isnt more than a tossup between the two after all one is dead and the other in a trance washington is in the centre of population and business while st louis is far removed from both and you know there is no geographical centre any more the railroads and telegraph have done away with all that it is no longer a matter of sufficient importance to be gravely considered by thinking men the only centres now are narrowed down to those of intelligence capital and population as i said before washington is the nearest to those and you dont have to paddle across a river on ferry boats of a pattern popular in the dark ages to get to it nor have to clamber up vilely paved hills in rascally omnibuses along with a herd of all sorts of people after you are there secondly the removal of the capital is one of those old regular reliable dodges that are the breadand meat of back country congressmen it is agitated every year it always has been it always will be it is not new in any respect thirdly the capitol has cost 40000000 already and lacks a good deal of being finished yet there are single stones in the treasury building and a good many of them that cost twentyseven thousand dollars apieceand millions were spent in the construction of that and the patent office and the other great government buildings to move to st louis the country must throw away a hundred millions of capital invested in those buildings and go right to work to spend a hundred millions on new buildings in st louis shall we ever have a congress a majority of whose members are hopelessly insane probably not but it is possibleunquestionably such a thing is possible only i dont believe it will happen in our time and i am satisfied the capital will not be moved until it does happen but if st louis would donate the ground and the buildings it would be a different matter no pamela i dont see any good reason to believe you or i will ever see the capital moved  i have twice instructed the publishers to send you a bookit was the first thing i didlong before the proofs were finished write me if it is not yet done  livy says we must have you all at our marriage and i say we cant it will be at christmas or new years when such a trip across the country would be equivalent to murder  arson  everything elseand it would cost five hundred dollarsan amount of money she dont know the value of now but will before a year is gone she grieves over it poor little rascal but it cant be helped she must wait awhile till i am firmly on my legs  then she shall see you she says her father and mother will invite you just as soon as the wedding date is definitely fixed anyway she thinks thats bound to settle it but the ice  snow  the long hard journey  the injudiciousness of laying out any money except what we are obliged to part with while we are so much in debt settles the case differently for it is a debt   mr langdon is just as good as bound for 25000 for me and has already advanced half of it in cash i wrote and asked whether i had better send him my note or a duebill or how he would prefer to have the indebtedness made of record and he answered every other topic in the letter pleasantly but never replied to that at all still i shall give my note into the hands of his business agent here and pay him the interest as it falls due we must go slow we are not in the cleveland herald we are a hundred thousand times better off but there isnt so much money in it  remainder missing        in spite of the immediate success of his booka success the like of      which had scarcely been known in americamark twain held himself to      be not a literary man but a journalist he had no plans for      another book as a newspaper owner and editor he expected with his      marriage to settle down and devote the rest of his life to      journalism  the paper was the buffalo express his interest in it      was onethirdthe purchase price twentyfive thousand dollars of      which he had paid a part jervis langdon his future fatherinlaw      having furnished cash and security for the remainder  he was      already in possession in august but he was not regularly in buffalo      that autumn for he had agreed with redpath to deliver his quaker      city lecture and the tour would not end until a short time before      his weddingday february 2 1870       our next letter hardly belongs in this collection as it was      doubtless written with at least the possibility of publication in      view  but it is too amusing too characteristic of mark twain to      be omitted  it was sent in response to an invitation from the new      york society of california pioneers to attend a banquet given in new      york city october 13 1869 and was of course read to the      assembled diners       to the new york society of california pioneers in new york city                                          elmira october 11 1869  gentlemencircumstances render it out of my power to take advantage of the invitation extended to me through mr simonton and be present at your dinner at new york i regret this very much for there are several among you whom i would have a right to join hands with on the score of old friendship and i suppose i would have a sublime general right to shake hands with the rest of you on the score of kinship in california ups and downs in search of fortune  if i were to tell some of my experience you would recognize california blood in me i fancy the old old story would sound familiar no doubt i have the usual stock of reminiscences for instance i went to esmeralda early i purchased largely in the wide west winnemucca and other fine claims and was very wealthy i fared sumptuously on bread when flour was 200 a barrel and had beans for dinner every sunday when none but bloated aristocrats could afford such grandeur but i finished by feeding batteries in a quartz mill at 15 a week and wishing i was a battery myself and had somebody to feed me my claims in esmeralda are there yet i suppose i could be persuaded to sell  i went to humboldt district when it was new i became largely interested in the alba nueva and other claims with gorgeous names and was rich againin prospect i owned a vast mining property there i would not have sold out for less than 400000 at that time but i will now finally i walked home200 miles partly for exercise and partly because stage fare was expensive next i entered upon an affluent career in virginia city and by a judicious investment of labor and the capital of friends became the owner of about all the worthless wild cat mines there were in that part of the country assessments did the business for me there there were a hundred and seventeen assessments to one dividend and the proportion of income to outlay was a little against me my financial barometer went down to 32 fahrenheit and the subscriber was frozen out  i took up extensions on the main leadextensions that reached to british america in one direction and to the isthmus of panama in the otherand i verily believe i would have been a rich man if i had ever found those infernal extensions but i didnt i ran tunnels till i tapped the arctic ocean and i sunk shafts till i broke through the roof of perdition but those extensions turned up missing every time i am willing to sell all that property and throw in the improvements  perhaps you remember that celebrated north ophir i bought that mine it was very rich in pure silver you could take it out in lumps as large as a filbert but when it was discovered that those lumps were melted half dollars and hardly melted at that a painful case of salting was apparent and the undersigned adjourned to the poorhouse again  i paid assessments on hale and norcross until they sold me out and i had to take in washing for a livingand the next month that infamous stock went up to 7000 a foot  i own millions and millions of feet of affluent silver leads in nevadain fact the entire undercrust of that country nearly and if congress would move that state off my property so that i could get at it i would be wealthy yet but no there she squatsand here am i failing health persuades me to sell if you know of any one desiring a permanent investment i can furnish one that will have the virtue of being eternal  i have been through the california mill with all its dips spurs and angles variations and sinuosities i have worked there at all the different trades and professions known to the catalogues i have been everything from a newspaper editor down to a cowcatcher on a locomotive and i am encouraged to believe that if there had been a few more occupations to experiment on i might have made a dazzling success at last and found out what mysterious designs providence had in creating me  but you perceive that although i am not a pioneer i have had a sufficiently variegated time of it to enable me to talk pioneer like a native and feel like a fortyniner therefore i cordially welcome you to your oldremembered homes and your long deserted firesides and close this screed with the sincere hope that your visit here will be a happy one and not embittered by the sorrowful surprises that absence and lapse of years are wont to prepare for wanderers surprises which come in the form of old friends missed from their places silence where familiar voices should be the young grown old change and decay everywhere home a delusion and a disappointment strangers at hearthstone sorrow where gladness was tears for laughter the melancholypomp of death where the grace of life has been  with all good wishes for the returned prodigals and regrets that i cannot partake of a small piece of the fatted calf rare and no gravy                           i am yours cordially                                         mark twain        in the next letter we find him in the midst of a sort of confusion      of affairs which in one form or another would follow him      throughout the rest of his life  it was the price of his success      and popularity combined with his general gift for being concerned      with a number of things and a natural tendency for getting into hot      water which becomes more evident as the years and letters pass in      review  orion clemens in his attempt to save money for the      government had employed methods and agents which the officials at      washington did not understand and refused to recognize  instead of      winning the credit and commendation he had expected he now found      himself pursued by claims of considerable proportions  the land      referred to is the tennessee tract the heritage which john clemens      had provided for his children  mark twain had long since lost faith      in it and was not only willing but eager to renounce his rights       nasby is of course david r  locke of the toledo blade whose      popularity at this time both as a lecturer and writer was very      great  clemens had met him here and there on their platform tour      and they had become good friends  clemens in fact had once      proposed to nasby a joint trip to the pacific coast       the california idea had been given up but both mark twain and nasby      found engagements enough and sufficient profit east of the      mississippi  boston was often their headquarters that winter 69      and 70 and they were much together  josh billings another of      redpaths lecturers was likewise often to be found in the lyceum      offices  there is a photograph of mark twain nasby and josh      billings together       clemens also that winter met william dean howells then in the      early days of his association with the atlantic monthly  the two      men so widely different became firm friends at sight and it was      to howells in the years to come that mark twain would write more      letters and more characteristic letters than to any other living      man  howells had favorably reviewed the innocents abroad and      after the first moment of their introduction had passed clemens      said when i read that review of yours i felt like the woman who      said that she was so glad that her baby had come white  it was not      the sort of thing that howells would have said but it was the sort      of thing that he could understand and appreciate from mark twain       in company with nasby clemens that season also met oliver wendell      holmes  later he had sent holmes a copy of his book and received a      pleasantly appreciative reply  i always like wrote holmes to      hear what one of my fellow countrymen who is not a hebrew scholar      or a reader of hieroglyphics but a goodhumored traveler with a      pair of sharp twinkling yankee in the broader sense eyes in his      head has to say about the things that learned travelers often make      unintelligible and sentimental ones ridiculous or absurd  i      hope your booksellers will sell a hundred thousand copies of your      travels  a wish that was realized in due time though it is      doubtful if doctor holmes or any one else at the moment believed      that a book of that nature and price it was 350 a copy would      ever reach such a sale       to mrs moffett in st louis                                                    boston nov 9 1869  my dear sisterthree or four letters just received from home my first impulse was to send orion a check on my publisher for the money he wants but a sober second thought suggested that if he has not defrauded the government out of money why pay simply because the government chooses to consider him in its debt no right is right the idea dont suit me let him write the treasury the state of the case and tell them he has no money if they make his sureties pay then i will make the sureties whole but i wont pay a cent of an unjust claim you talk of disgrace to my mind it would be just as disgraceful to allow ones self to be bullied into paying that which is unjust  ma thinks it is hard that orions share of the land should be swept away just as it is right on the point as it always has been of becoming valuable let her rest easy on that point this letter is his ample authority to sell my share of the land immediately and appropriate the proceedsgiving no account to me but repaying the amount to ma first or in case of her death to you or your heirs whenever in the future he shall be able to do it now i want no hesitation in this matter i renounce my ownership from this date for this purpose provided it is sold just as suddenly as he can sell it  in the next placemr langdon is old and is trying hard to withdraw from business and seek repose i will not burden him with a purchasebut i will ask him to take full possession of a coal tract of the land without paying a cent simply conditioning that he shall mine and throw the coal into market at his own cost and pay to you and all of you what he thinks is a fair portion of the profits accruingyou can do as you please with the rest of the land therefore send me to elmira information about the coal deposits so framed that he can comprehend the matter and can intelligently instruct an agent how to find it and go to work  tomorrow night i appear for the first time before a boston audience4000 criticsand on the success of this matter depends my future success in new england but i am not distressed nasby is in the same boat tonight decides the fate of his brandnew lecture he has just left my roombeen reading his lecture to mewas greatly depressed i have convinced him that he has little to fear  i get just about five hundred more applications to lecture than i can possibly filland in the west they say charge all you please but come i shant go west at all i stop lecturing the 22d of january sure but i shall talk every night up to that time they flood me with highpriced invitations to write for magazines and papers and publishers besiege me to write books cant do any of these things  i am twentytwo thousand dollars in debt and shall earn the money and pay it within two yearsand therefore i am not spending any money except when it is necessary  i had my life insured for 10000 yesterday what ever became of mr moffett s life insurance for the benefit of my natural heirsthe same being my mother for livy wouldnt claim it you may be sure of that this has taken 200 out of my pocket which i was going to send to ma but i will send her some soon tell orion to keep a stiff upper lipwhen the worst comes to the worst i will come forward must talk in providence r i tonight must leave now i thank mollie and orion and the rest for your letters but you see how i am pushedought to have 6 clerks                                affectionately                                                   sam        by the end of january 1870 more than thirty thousand copies of the      innocents had been sold and in a letter to his publisher the author      expressed his satisfaction       to elisha bliss in hartford                                          elmira jan 28 70  friend bliss yes i am satisfied with the way you are running the book you are running it in staving tiptop firstclass style i never wander into any corner of the country but i find that an agent has been there before me and many of that community have read the book and on an average about ten people a day come and hunt me up to thank me and tell me im a benefactor i guess this is a part of the programme we didnt expect in the first place  i think you are rushing this book in a manner to be proud of and you will make the finest success of it that has ever been made with a subscription book i believe what with advertising establishing agencies c you have got an enormous lot of machinery under way and hard at work in a wonderfully short space of time it is easy to see when one travels around that one must be endowed with a deal of genuine generalship in order to maneuvre a publication whose line of battle stretches from end to end of a great continent and whose foragers and skirmishers invest every hamlet and besiege every village hidden away in all the vast space between  ill back you against any publisher in america blissor elsewhere                                          yrs as ever                                                   clemens        there is another letter written just at this time which of all      letters must not be omitted here  only five years earlier mark      twain poor and comparatively unknown had been carrying water      while jim gillis and dick stoker washed out the pans of dirt in      search of the gold pocket which they did not find  clemens must      have received a letter from gillis referring to some particular      occasion but it has disappeared the reply however always      remained one of james gilliss treasured possessions       to james gillis in his cabin on jackass hill tuolumne co california                                          elmira ny  jan  26 70  dear jimi remember that old night just as well and somewhere among my relics i have your remembrance stored away it makes my heart ache yet to call to mind some of those days still it shouldntfor right in the depths of their poverty and their pockethunting vagabondage lay the germ of my coming good fortune you remember the one gleam of jollity that shot across our dismal sojourn in the rain and mud of angels camp i mean that day we sat around the tavern stove and heard that chap tell about the frog and how they filled him with shot and you remember how we quoted from the yarn and laughed over it out there on the hillside while you and dear old stoker panned and washed i jotted the story down in my notebook that day and would have been glad to get ten or fifteen dollars for iti was just that blind but then we were so hard up i published that story and it became widely known in america india china englandand the reputation it made for me has paid me thousands and thousands of dollars since four or five months ago i bought into the express i have ordered it sent to you as long as you liveand if the book keeper sends you any bills you let me hear of it i went heavily in debt never could have dared to do that jim if we hadnt heard the jumping frog story that day  and wouldnt i love to take old stoker by the hand and wouldnt i love to see him in his great specialty his wonderful rendition of rinalds in the burning shame where is dick and what is he doing give him my fervent love and warm old remembrances  a week from today i shall be married to a girl even better and lovelier than the peerless chapparal quails you cant come so far jim but still i cordially invite you to come anyhowand i invite dick too and if you two boys were to land here on that pleasant occasion we would make you right royally welcome                                truly your friend                                         saml l clemens  p s california plums are good jimparticularly when they are stewed        steve gillis who sent a copy of his letter to the writer added      dick stokerdear gentle unselfish old dickdied over three years      ago aged 78  i am sure it will be a melancholy pleasure to mark to      know that dick lived in comfort all his later life sincerely loved      and respected by all who knew him  he never left jackass hill  he      struck a pocket years ago containing enough not only to build      himself a comfortable house near his old cabin but to last him      without work to his painless end  he was a mason and was buried      by the order in sonora       the quailsthe beautiful the innocent the wild little quails      lived way out in the chapparal on a little ranch near the      stanislaus river with their father and mother  they were famous      for their beauty and had many suitors       the mention of california plums refers to some inedible fruit      which gillis once out of pure goodness of heart bought of a poor      wandering squaw and then to conceal his motive declared that they      were something rare and fine and persisted in eating them though      even when stewed they nearly choked him     x letters 187071 mark twain in buffalo marriage the

            mark        the reference to the galaxy in the foregoing letter has to do with a      department called memoranda which he had undertaken to conduct for      the new magazine  this work added substantially to his income and      he believed it would be congenial  he was allowed free hand to      write and print what he chose and some of his best work at this      time was published in the new department which he continued for a      year       mark twain now seemed to have his affairs well regulated  his      mother and sister were no longer far away in st louis  soon after      his marriage they had by his advice taken up residence at      fredonia new york where they could be easily visited from buffalo       altogether the outlook seemed bright to mark twain and his wife      during the first months of their marriage  then there came a      change  in a letter which clemens wrote to his mother and sister we      get the first chapter of disaster        to mrs jane

devotion to her father took her to his bedside where she      insisted upon standing long hard watches the strain of which told      upon her severely  meantime work must go on the daily demand of      the newspaper and the monthly call of the memoranda could not go      unheeded  also bliss wanted a new book and met mark twain at      elmira to arrange for it  in a letter to orion we learn of this

kept me under the weather and as a general thing i have been chilly and uncomfortable  i am not corpulent nor am i robust in any way at birth i only weighed 4 12 pounds with my clothes onand the clothes were the chief feature of the weight too i am obliged to confess but i am doing finely all things considered i was at a standstill for 3 days and a half but during the last 24 hours i have gained nearly an ounce avoirdupois  they all say i look very old and venerableand i am aware myself that i never smile life seems a serious thing what i have seen of itand my observation teaches me that it is made up mainly of hiccups unnecessary washings and colic but no doubt you who are old have long since grown accustomed and reconciled to what seems to me such a disagreeable novelty  my father said this morning when my face was in repose and thoughtful that i looked precisely as young edward twichell of hartford used to look some is months agochin mouth forehead expressioneverything  my little mother is very bright and cheery and i guess she is pretty happy but i dont know what about she laughs a great deal notwithstanding she is sick abed and she eats a great deal though she says that is because the nurse desires it and when she has had all the nurse desires her to have she asks for more she is getting along very well indeed  my aunt susie crane has been here some ten days or two weeks but goes home today and granny fairbanks of cleveland arrives to take her placemrs fairbanks of the quaker city excursion                                     very lovingly                                              langdon clemens  p s father said i had better write because you would be more interested in me just now than in the rest of the family        clemens had made the acquaintance of the rev joseph hopkins      twichell and his wife during his several sojourns in hartford in      connection with his book publication and the two men had      immediately become firm friends  twichell had come to elmira in      february to the wedding to assist rev thos k beecher in the      marriage ceremony  joseph twichell was a devout christian while      mark twain was a doubter even a scoffer where orthodoxy was      concerned yet the sincerity and humanity of the two men drew them      together their friendship was lifelong       a second letter to twichell something more than a month later      shows a somewhat improved condition in the clemens household       to rev twichell in hartford                                               buf dec 19th 1870  dear j hall is well with us i believethough for some days the baby was quite ill we consider him nearly restored to health now however ask my brother about usyou will find him at blisss publishing office where he is gone to edit blisss new paperleft here last monday make his and his wifes acquaintance take mrs t to see them as soon as they are fixed  livy is up and the prince keeps her busy and anxious these latter days and nights but i am a bachelor up stairs and dont have to jump up and get the soothing syrupthough i would as soon do it as not i assure you livy will be certain to read this letter  tell harmony mrs t that i do hold the baby and do it pretty handily too although with occasional apprehensions that his loose head will fall off i dont have to quiet himhe hardly ever utters a cry he is always thinking about something he is a patient good little baby  smoke i always smoke from 3 till 5 sunday afternoonsand in new york the other day i smoked a week day and night but when livy is well i smoke only those two hours on sunday im boss of the habit now and shall never let it boss me any more originally i quit solely on livys account not that i believed there was the faintest reason in the matter but just as i would deprive myself of sugar in my coffee if she wished it or quit wearing socks if she thought them immoral and i stick to it yet on livys account and shall always continue to do so without a pang but somehow it seems a pity that you quit for mrs t didnt mind it if i remember rightly ah it is turning ones back upon a kindly providence to spurn away from us the good creature he sent to make the breath of life a luxury as well as a necessity enjoyable as well as useful to go and quit smoking when then aint any sufficient excuse for it why my old boy when they use to tell me i would shorten my life ten years by smoking they little knew the devotee they were wasting their puerile word uponthey little knew how trivial and valueless i would regard a decade that had no smoking in it but i wont persuade you twichelli wont until i see you againbut then well smoke for a week together and then shut off again  i would have gone to hartford from new york last saturday but i got so homesick i couldnt but maybe ill come soon  no sir catch me in the metropolis again to get homesick  i didnt know warner had a book out  we send oceans and continents of lovei have worked myself down today                                yrs always                                         mark        with his establishment in buffalo clemens as already noted had      persuaded his sister now a widow and his mother to settle in      fredonia not far away  later he had found a position for orion      as editor of a small paper which bliss had established  what with      these several diversions and the sorrows and sicknesses of his own      household we can readily imagine that literary work had been      performed under difficulties  certainly humorous writing under      such disturbing conditions could not have been easy nor could we      expect him to accept an invitation to be present and make a comic      speech at an agricultural dinner even though horace greeley would      preside  however he sent to the secretary of the association a      letter which might be read at the gathering       to a b crandall in woodberry falls n y to be read at an agricultural dinner                                          buffalo dec 26 1870  gentlemeni thank you very much for your invitation to the agricultural dinner and would promptly accept it and as promptly be there but for the fact that mr greeley is very busy this month and has requested me to clandestinely continue for him in the tribune the articles what i know about farming consequently the necessity of explaining to the readers of that journal why buttermilk cannot be manufactured profitably at 8 cents a quart out of butter that costs 60 cents a pound compels my stay at home until the article is written                           with reiterated thanks i am                                     yours truly                                              mark twain        in this letter mark twain made the usual mistake as to the title of      the greeley farming series what i know of farming being the      correct form       the buffalo express under mark twains management had become a      sort of repository for humorous efforts often of an indifferent      order  some of these things signed by nom de plumes were charged      to mark twain  when bret hartes heathen chinee devastated the      country and was so widely parodied an imitation of it entitled      three aces and signed carl byng was printed in the express      thomas bailey aldrich then editor of every saturday had not met      mark twain and noticing the verses printed in the exchanges over      his signature was one of those who accepted them as mark twains      work  he wrote rather an uncomplimentary note in every saturday      concerning the poem and its authorship characterizing it as a      feeble imitation of bret hartes heathen chinee  clemens promptly      protested to aldrich then as promptly regretted having done so      feeling that he was making too much of a small matter  hurriedly he      sent a second brief note       to thomas bailey aldrich editor of every saturday boston massachusetts                                          buffalo jan 22 1870  dear sirplease do not publish the note i sent you the other day about hy slocums plagiarism entitled three acesit is not important enough for such a long paragraph webb writes me that he has put in a paragraph about it tooand i have requested him to suppress it if you would simply state in a line and a half under literary notes that you mistook one hy slocum no it was one carl byng i perceive carl byng for mark twain and that it was the former who wrote the plagiarism entitled three aces i think that would do a fair justice without any unseemly display but it is hard to be accused of plagiarisma crime i never have committed in my life                                yrs  truly                                         mark twain        but this came too late  aldrich replied that he could not be      prevented from doing him justice as fortytwo thousand copies of      the first note with the editors apology duly appended were      already in press  he would withdraw his apology in the next number      of every saturday if mark twain said so  mark twains response      this time assumed the proportions of a letter       to thomas bailey aldrich in boston                                     472 delaware st buffalo jan 28  dear mr aldrichno indeed dont take back the apology hang it i dont want to abuse a mans civility merely because he gives me the chance  i hear a good deal about doing things on the spur of the momenti invariably regret the things i do on the spur of the moment that disclaimer of mine was a case in point i am ashamed every time i think of my bursting out before an unconcerned public with that bombastic powwow about burning publishers letters and all that sort of imbecility and about my not being an imitator etc who would find out that i am a natural fool if i kept always cool and never let nature come to the surface nobody  but i did hate to be accused of plagiarizing bret harte who trimmed and trained and schooled me patiently until he changed me from an awkward utterer of coarse grotesquenesses to a writer of paragraphs and chapters that have found a certain favor in the eyes of even some of the very decentest people in the landand this grateful remembrance of mine ought to be worth its face seeing that bret broke our long friendship a year ago without any cause or provocation that i am aware of  well it is funny the reminiscences that glare out from murky corners of ones memory now and then without warning just at this moment a picture flits before me sceneprivate room in barnums restaurant virginia nevada present artemus ward joseph t goodman editor and proprietor daily enterprise and dan de quille and myself reporters for same remnants of the feast thin and scattering but such tautology and repetition of empty bottles everywhere visible as to be offensive to the sensitive eye time 230 am artemus thickly reciting a poem about a certain infant you wot of and interrupting himself and being interrupted every few lines by poundings of the table and shouts of splendid by shorzhe finally a long vociferous poundiferous and vitreous jingling of applause announces the conclusion and then artemus let every man at loves his fellow man and preciates a poet at loves his fellow man stan upstan up and drink health and long life to thomas bailey aldrichand drink it stanning on all hands fervent enthusiastic and sincerely honest attempts to comply then artemus wellconsider it stanning and drink it just as ye are which was done  you must excuse all this stuff from a stranger for the present and when i see you i will apologize in full  do you know the prettiest fancy and the neatest that ever shot through hartes brain it was this when they were trying to decide upon a vignette for the cover of the overland a grizzly bear of the arms of the state of california was chosen nahl bras carved him and the page was printed with him in it looking thus rude sketch of a grizzly bear  as a bear he was a successhe was a good bear but then it was objected that he was an objectless beara bear that meant nothing in particular signified nothingsimply stood there snarling over his shoulder at nothingand was painfully and manifestly a boorish and illnatured intruder upon the fair page all hands said thatnone were satisfied they hated badly to give him up and yet they hated as much to have him there when there was no paint to him but presently harte took a pencil and drew these two simple lines under his feet and behold he was a magnificent successthe ancient symbol of california savagery snarling at the approaching type of high and progressive civilization the first overland locomotive sketch of a small section of railway track  i just think that was nothing less than inspiration itself  once more i apologize and this time i do it stanning                           yrs  truly                               saml l clemens        the two simple lines of course were the train rails under the      bears feet and completed the striking cover design of the overland      monthly       the brief controversy over the three aces was the beginning of      along and happy friendship between aldrich and mark twain  howells      aldrich twichell and charles dudley warnerthese were mark      twains intimates men that he loved each for his own special charm      and worth       aldrich he considered the most brilliant of living men       in his reply to clemenss letter aldrich declared that he was glad      now that for the sake of such a letter he had accused him falsely      and added       mem  always abuse people       when you come to boston if you do not make your presence manifest      to me ill put in a in every saturday to the effect that      though you are generally known as mark twain your favorite nom de      plume is barry gray       clemens did not fail to let aldrich know when he was in boston      again and the little coterie of younger writers forgathered to give      him welcome       buffalo agreed with neither mrs clemens nor the baby  what with      nursing and anguish of mind mark twain found that he could do      nothing on the new book and that he must give up his magazine      department  he had lost interest in his paper and his surroundings      in general  journalism and authorship are poor yokemates  to      onion clemens at this time editing blisss paper at hartford he      explained the situation       to onion clemens in hartford                                               buffalo 4th 1871  my dear browhat i wanted of the liar sketch was to work it into the california bookwhich i shall do but day before yesterday i concluded to go out of the galaxy on the strength of it so i have turned it into the last memoranda i shall ever write and published it as a specimen chapter of my forthcoming book  i have written the galaxy people that i will never furnish them another article long or short for any price but 50000 cashand have requested them not to ask me for contributions any more even at that price  i hope that lets them out for i will stick to that now do try and leave me clear out of the publisher for the present for i am endangering my reputation by writing too muchi want to get out of the public view for awhile  i am still nursing livy night and day and cannot write anything i am nearly worn out we shall go to elmira ten days hence if livy can travel on a mattress then and stay there till i have finished the california booksay three months but i cant begin work right away when i get theremust have a weeks rest for i have been through 30 days terrific siege  that makes it after the middle of march before i can go fairly to workand then ill have to hump myself and not lose a moment you and bliss just put yourselves in my place and you will see that my hands are full and more than full  when i told bliss in n y that i would write something for the publisher i could not know that i was just about to lose fifty days do you see the difference it makes just as soon as ever i can i will send some of the book ms but right in the first chapter i have got to alter the whole style of one of my characters and rewrite him clear through to where i am now it is no fool of a job i can tell you but the book will be greatly bettered by it hold on a few daysfour or fiveand i will see if i can get a few chapters fixed to send to bliss  i have offered this dwelling house and the express for sale and when we go to elmira we leave here for good i shall not select a new home till the book is finished but we have little doubt that hartford will be the place  we are almost certain of that ask bliss how it would be to ship our furniture to hartford rent an upper room in a building and unbox it and store it there where somebody can frequently look after it is not the idea good the furniture is worth 10000 or 12000 and must not be jammed into any kind of a place and left unattended to for a year  the first man that offers 25000 for our house can take itit cost that what are taxes there here all bunched togetherof all kinds they are 7 per centsimply ruin  the things you have written in the publisher are tiptop                           in haste                                    yr bro                                              sam        there are no further letters until the end of april by which time      the situation had improved  clemens had sold his interest in the      express though at a loss had severed his magazine connection and      was located at quarry farm on a beautiful hilltop above elmira the      home of mrs clemenss sister mrs theodore crane  the pure air      and rest of that happy place where they were to spend so many      idyllic summers had proved beneficial to the sick ones and work on      the new book progressed in consequence  then mark twains old      editor joe goodman came from virginia city for a visit and his      advice and encouragement were of the greatest value  clemens even      offered to engage goodman on a salary to remain until he had      finished his book  goodman declined the salary but extended his      visit and mark twain at last seems to have found himself working      under ideal conditions  he jubilantly reports his progress       to elisha bliss in hartford                                     elmira monday  may 15th 1871  friend blissyrs recd enclosing check for 70335 the old innocents holds out handsomely  i have ms enough on hand now to make allowing for engravings about 400 pages of the bookconsequently am twothirds done i intended to run up to hartford about the middle of the week and take it along because it has chapters in it that ought by all means to be in the prospectus but i find myself so thoroughly interested in my work now a thing i have not experienced for months that i cant bear to lose a single moment of the inspiration so i will stay here and peg away as long as it lasts my present idea is to write as much more as i have already written and then cull from the mass the very best chapters and discard the rest i am not half as well satisfied with the first part of the book as i am with what i am writing now when i get it done i want to see the man who will begin to read it and not finish it if it falls short of the innocents in any respect i shall lose my guess  when i was writing the innocents my daily stunt was 30 pages of ms and i hardly ever got beyond it but i have gone over that nearly every day for the last ten that shows that i am writing with a redhot interest nothing grieves me nownothing troubles me nothing bothers me or gets my attentioni dont think of anything but the book and i dont have an hours unhappiness about anything and dont care two cents whether school keeps or not it will be a bully book if i keep up my present lick three weeks more i shall be able and willing to scratch out half of the chapters of the overland narrativeand shall do it  you do not mention having received my second batch of ms sent a week or two agoabout 100 pages  if you want to issue a prospectus and go right to canvassing say the word and i will forward some more msor send it by handspecial messenger whatever chapters you think are unquestionably good we will retain of course so they can go into a prospectus as well one time as another the book will be done soon now i have 1200 pages of ms already written and am now writing 200 a weekmore than that in fact during the past week wrote 23 one day then 30 33 35 52 and 65hows that  it will be a starchy book and should be full of snappy picturesespecially pictures worked in with the letterpress the dedication will be worth the price of the volumethus                             to the late cain                         this book is dedicated  not on account of respect for his memory for it merits little respect not on account of sympathy with him for his bloody deed placed him without the pale of sympathy strictly speaking but out of a mere human commiseration for him that it was his misfortune to live in a dark age that knew not the beneficent insanity plea  i think it will do                         yrs  clemens  p sthe reaction is beginning and my stock is looking up i am getting the bulliest offers for books and almanacs am flooded with lecture invitations and one periodical offers me 6000 cash for 12 articles of any length and on any subject treated humorously or otherwise        the suggested dedication to the late cain may have been the      humoristic impulse of the moment  at all events it did not      materialize       clemenss enthusiasm for work was now such that he agreed with      redpath to return to the platform that autumn and he began at once      writing lectures  his disposal of the buffalo paper had left him      considerably in debt and platforming was a sure and quick method of      retrenchment  more than once in the years ahead mark twain would      return to travel and onenight stands to lift a burden of debt      brief letters to redpath of this time have an interest and even a      humor of their own       letters to james redpath in boston                                          elmira june 27 1871  dear redwrote another lecturea third onetoday it is

likely to give rigid instructions to confine me to new england next week send me to arizona the next week withdraw my name the next week give you full untrammelled swing and the week following modify it you must try to keep the run of my mind redpath it is your business being the agent and it always was too many for me it appears to me to be one of the finest pieces of mechanism i have ever met

then and laughed easily  howells      has written of one such luncheon given by ralph keeler a young      californiana gathering at which james t fields was present      nothing remains to me of the happy time but a sense of idle and      aimless and joyful talkplay beginning and ending nowhere of eager      laughter of countless good stories from fields of a heatlightning      shimmer of wit

pennsylvanians with this lecture  have paid up 4000 indebtedness you are the last on my list shall begin to pay you in a few days and then i shall be a free man again                                yours                                         mark        with his debts paid clemens was anxious to be getting home  two      weeks following the above he wrote redpath that he would accept no      more engagements at any price outside of new england and added      the fewer engagements i have from this time forth the better i      shall be pleased  by the end of february he was back in hartford      refusing an engagement in boston and announcing to redpath if i      had another engagement id rot before id fill it  from which we      gather that he was not entirely happy in the lecture field       as a matter of fact mark twain loathed the continuous travel and      nightly drudgery of platform life  he was fond of entertaining and      there were moments of triumph that repaid him for a good deal but      the tyranny of a schedule and timetables was a constant      exasperation       meantime roughing it had appeared and was selling abundantly  mark      twain free of debt and in pleasant circumstances felt that the      outlook was bright  it became even more so when in march the      second child a little girl susy was born with no attending      misfortunes  but then in the early summer little langdon died      it was seldom during all of mark twains life that he enjoyed more      than a brief period of unmixed happiness       it was in june of that year that clemens wrote his first letter to      william dean howells the first of several hundred that would follow      in the years to come and has in it something that is characteristic      of nearly all the clemenshowells lettersa kind of tender      playfulness that answered to something in howellss makeup his      sense of humor his wide knowledge of a humanity which he pictured      so amusingly to the world       to william dean howells in boston                                               hartford june 15 1872  friend howellscould you tell me how i could get a copy of your portrait as published in hearth and home i hear so much talk about it as being among the finest works of art which have yet appeared in that journal that i feel a strong desire to see it is it suitable for framing i have written the publishers of h  h time and again but they say that the demand for the portrait immediately exhausted the edition and now a copy cannot be had even for the european demand which has now begun bret harte has been here and says his family would not be without that portrait for any consideration he says his children get up in the night and yell for it i would give anything for a copy of that portrait to put up in my parlor i have oliver wendell holmes and bret hartes as published in every saturday and of all the swarms that come every day to gaze upon them none go away that are not softened and humbled and made more resigned to the will of god if i had yours to put up alongside of them i believe the combination would bring more souls to earnest reflection and ultimate conviction of their lost condition than any other kind of warning would where in the nation can i get that portrait here are heaps of people that want itthat need it there is my uncle he wants a copy he is lying at the point of death he has been lying at the point of death for two years he wants a copyand i want him to have a copy and i want you to send a copy to the man that shot my dog i want to see if he is dead to every human instinct  now you send me that portrait i am sending you mine in this letter and am glad to do it for it has been greatly admired people who are judges of art find in the execution a grandeur which has not been equalled in this country and an expression which has not been approached in any                                     yrs truly

was prescribed for mrs clemens and the baby and      they went to saybrook connecticut to fenwick hall  clemens wrote      very little though he seems to have planned tom sawyer and perhaps      made its earliest beginning which was in dramatic form       his mind however was otherwise active  he was always more or less      given to inventions and in his next letter we find a description of      one which he brought to comparative perfection       he had also conceived the idea of another book of travel and this      was his purpose of a projected trip to england       to orion clemens in

wish to put on record now is my new inventionhence this note which you will preserve it is thisa selfpasting scrapbookgood enough idea if some juggling tailor does not come along and antedate me a couple of months as in the case of the elastic veststrap  the nuisance of keeping a scrapbook is 1 one never has paste or gum tragacanth handy 2 mucilage wont stick or stay 4 weeks 3 mucilage sucks out the ink and makes the scraps unreadable 4 to daub and paste 3 or 4 pages of scraps is tedious slow nasty and tiresome my idea is this make a scrapbook with leaves veneered or coated with gumstickum of some kind wet the page with sponge brush rag or tongue and dab on your scraps like postage stamps  lay on the gum in columns of stripes  each stripe of gum the length of say 20 ems small pica and as broad as your finger a blank about as broad as your finger between each 2 stripesso in wetting the paper you need not wet any more of the gum than your scrap or scraps will coverthen you may shut up the book and the leaves wont stick together  preserve also the envelope of this letterpostmark ought to be good evidence of the date of this great humanizing and civilizing invention  ill put it into dan slotes hands and tell him he must send you all over america to urge its use upon stationers and booksellersso dont buy into a newspaper the name of this thing is mark twains

letters 187273 mark twain in england london honors acquaintance with dr john brown a lecture triumph the gilded age       clemens did in fact sail for england on the given date and was      lavishly received there  all literary london joined in giving him a      good time  he had not as yet been received seriously by the older      american men of letters but england made no question as to his      title to first rank  already too they classified him as of the      human type of lincoln and reveled in him without stint  howells      writes in england rank fashion and culture rejoiced in him      lord mayors lord chief justices and magnates of many kinds were      his hosts       he was treated so well and enjoyed it all so much that he could not      write a bookthe kind of book he had planned  one could not poke      fun at a country or a people that had welcomed him with open arms      he made plenty of notes at first but presently gave up the book      idea and devoted himself altogether to having a good time       he had one grievancea publisher by the name of hotten a sort of      literary harpy of which there were a great number in those days of      defective copyright not merely content with pilfering his early      work had reprinted under the name of mark twain the work of a      mixed assortment of other humorists an offensive volume bearing the      title screamers and eyeopeners by mark twain       they besieged him to lecture in london and promised him overflowing      houses  artemus ward during his last days had earned london by      storm with his platform humor and they promised mark twain even      greater success  for some reason however he did not welcome the      idea perhaps there was too much gaiety  to mrs clemens he wrote       to mrs clemens in hartford                                               london sep 15 1872  livy darling everybody says lecturelecturelecturebut i have not the least idea of doing itcertainly not at present

much sociabilityi do not get along fast enough with work tomorrow i lunch with mr toole and a member of parliamenttoole is the most able comedian of the day and then i am done for a while on tuesday i

delightful razor i have a notion to buy some for charley theodore and sleefor i know they have no such razors there i have got a neat little watchchain for annie20  i love you my darling my love to all of you                                                  saml        that mark twain should feel and privately report something of his      triumphs we need not wonder at  certainly he was never one to give      himself airs but to have the worlds great literary center paying      court to him who only ten years before had been penniless and      unknown and who once had been a barefoot tom sawyer in hannibal      was quite startling  it is gratifying to find evidence of human      weakness in the following hearttoheart letter to his publisher      especially in view of the relating circumstances        to elisha bliss in hartford                                               london sept 28 1872  friend blissi have been received in a sort of tremendous way tonight by the brains of london assembled at the annual dinner of the sheriffs of londonmine being between you and me a name which was received with a flattering outburst of spontaneous applause when the long list of guests was called  i might have perished on the spot but for the friendly support and assistance of my excellent friend sir john bennettand i want you to paste the enclosed in a couple of the handsomest copies of the innocents and roughing it and send them to him his address is            sir john bennett                cheapside                     london                           yrs truly                               s l clemens        the relating circumstances were these at the abovementioned      dinner there had been a rollcall of the distinguished guests      present and each name had been duly applauded  clemens conversing      in a whisper with his neighbor sir john bennett did not give very      close attention to the names applauding mechanically with the      others       finally a name was read that brought out a vehement handclapping      mark twain not to be outdone in cordiality joined vigorously and      kept his hands going even after the others finished  then      remarking the general laughter he whispered to sir john whose      name was that we were just applauding       mark twains       we may believe that the friendly support of sir john bennett was      welcome for the moment  but the incident could do him no harm the      diners regarded it as one of his jokes and enjoyed him all the more      for it       he was ready to go home by november but by no means had he had      enough of england  he really had some thought of returning there      permanently  in a letter to mrs crane at quarry farm he wrote       if you and theodore will come over in the spring with livy and me      and spend the summer you will see a country that is so beautiful      that you will be obliged to believe in fairyland and theodore      can browse with me among dusty old dens that look now as they looked      five hundred years ago and puzzle over books in the british museum      that were made before christ was born and in the customs of their      public dinners and the ceremonies of every official act and the      dresses of a thousand dignitaries trace the speech and manners of      all the centuries that have dragged their lagging decades over      england since the heptarchy fell asunder  i would a good deal      rather live here if i could get the rest of you over       in a letter home to his mother and sister we get a further picture      of his enjoyment       to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett                                               london nov 6 1872  my dear mother and sisteri have been so everlasting busy that i couldnt writeand moreover i have been so unceasingly lazy that i couldnt have written anyhow i came here to take notes for a book but i havent done much but attend dinners and make speeches but have had a jolly good time and i do hate to go away from these english folks they make a stranger feel entirely at homeand they laugh so easily that it is a comfort to make afterdinner speeches here i have made hundreds of friends and last night in the crush of the opening of the new guildhall library and museum i was surprised to meet a familiar face every few steps nearly 4000 people of both sexes came and went during the evening so i had a good opportunity to make a great many new acquaintances  livy is willing to come here with me next april and stay several monthsso i am going home next tuesday i would sail on saturday but that is the day of the lord mayors annual grand state dinner when they say 900 of the great men of the city sit down to table a great many of them in their fine official and court paraphernalia so i must not miss it however i may yet change my mind and sail saturday i am looking at a fine magic lantern which will cost a deal of money and if i buy it sammy may come and learn to make the gas and work the machinery and paint pictures for it on glass i mean to give exhibitions for charitable purposes in hartford and charge a dollar a head

there had been a presidential election in his absence      general grant had defeated horace greeley a result in some measure      at least attributed to the amusing and powerful pictures of the      cartoonist thomas nast  mark twain admired greeleys talents but      he regarded him as poorly qualified for the nations chief      executive  he wrote       to th nast in morristown n j                                               hartford nov 1872  nast you more than any other man have won a prodigious victory for granti mean rather for civilization and progress those pictures were simply marvelous and if any man in the land has a right to hold his head up and be honestly proud of his share in this years vast events that man is unquestionably yourself we all do sincerely honor you and are proud of you                                     mark twain        perhaps mark twain was too busy at this time to write letters  his      success in england had made him more than ever popular in america      and he could by no means keep up with the demands on him  in      january he contributed to the new york tribune some letters on the      sandwich islands but as these were more properly articles they do      not seem to belong here       he refused to go on the lecture circuit though he permitted redpath      to book him for any occasional appearance and it is due to one of      these special engagements that we have the only letter preserved      from this time  it is to howells and written with that      exaggeration with which he was likely to embellish his difficulties      we are not called upon to believe that there were really any such      demonstrations as those ascribed to warner and himself       to w d howells in boston                                     farmington ave hartford feb 27  my dear howellsi am in a sweat and warner is in another i told redpath some time ago i would lecture in boston any two days he might choose provided they were consecutive days  i never dreamed of his choosing days during lent since that was his special horrorbut all at once he telegraphs me and hollers at me in all manner of ways that i am booked for boston march 5 of all days in the yearand to make matters just as mixed and uncertain as possible i cant find out to save my life whether he means to lecture me on the 6th or not  warners been in here swearing like a lunatic and saying he had written you to come on the 4thand i said you leatherhead if i talk in boston both afternoon and evening march 5 ill have to go to boston the 4thand then he just kicked up his heels and went off cursing after a fashion i never heard of before  now lets just leave this thing to providence for 24 hoursyou bet it will come out all right                                     yours ever                                              mark        he was writing a book with warner at this timethe gilded age      the two authors having been challenged by their wives one night at      dinner to write a better book than the current novels they had been      discussing with some severity  clemens already had a story in his      mind and warner agreed to collaborate in the writing  it was begun      without delay  clemens wrote the first three hundred and      ninetynine pages and read there aloud to warner who took up the      story at this point and continued it through twelve chapters after      which they worked alternately and with great enjoyment  they also      worked rapidly and in april the story was completed  for a      collaboration by two men so different in temperament and literary      method it was a remarkable performance       another thing mark twain did that winter was to buy some land on      farmington avenue and begin the building of a home  he had by no      means given up returning to england and made his plans to sail with      mrs clemens and susy in may  miss clara spaulding of elmira      later mrs john b stanchfield of new yorka girlhood friend      of mrs clemenswas to accompany them       the daily graphic heard of the proposed journey and wrote asking      for a farewell word  his characteristic reply is the only letter of      any kind that has survived from that spring       to the editor of the daily graphic in new york city                                          hartford apl 17 1873  ed graphicyour note is received if the following two lines which i have cut from it are your natural handwriting then i understand you to ask me for a farewell letter in the name of the american people bless you the joy of the american people is just a little premature i havent gone yet and what is more i am not going to stay when i do go  yes it is true i am only going to remain beyond the sea six months that is all i love stir and excitement and so the moment the spring birds begin to sing and the lagging weariness of summer to threaten i grow restless i get the fidgets i want to pack off somewhere where theres something going on but you know how that isyou must have felt that way this very day i saw the signs in the air of the coming dullness and i said to myself how glad i am that i have already chartered a steamship there was absolutely nothing in the morning papers you can see for yourself what the telegraphic headings were        by telegraph       a father killed by his son       a bloody fight in kentucky       a court house fired and      negroes therein shot      while escaping       a louisiana massacre       an eightyearold murderer      two to three hundred men roasted alive       a town in a state of general riot       a lively skirmish in indiana      and thirty other similar headings  the items under those headings all bear date yesterday apl 16 refer to your own paperand i give you my word of honor that that string of commonplace stuff was everything there was in the telegraphic columns that a body could call news well said i to myself this is getting pretty dull this is getting pretty dry there dont appear to be anything going on anywhere has this progressive nation gone to sleep have i got to stand another month of this torpidity before i can begin to browse among the lively capitals of europe  but never mindthings may revive while i am away during the last two months my nextdoor neighbor chas dudley warner has dropped his backlog studies and he and i have written a bulky novel in partnership he has worked up the fiction and i have hurled in the facts i consider it one of the most astonishing novels that ever was written night after night i sit up reading it over and over again and crying it will be published early in the fall with plenty of pictures do you consider this an advertisementand if so do you charge for such things when a man is your friend                           yours truly                                    saml  l  clemens                                    mark twain        an amusing even if annoying incident happened about the time of      mark twains departure  a man named chew related to twichell a most      entertaining occurrence  twichell saw great possibilities in it      and suggested that mark twain be allowed to make a story of it      sharing the profits with chew  chew agreed and promised to send      the facts carefully set down  twichell in the mean time told the      story to clemens who was delighted with it and strongly tempted to      write it at once while he was in the spirit without waiting on      chew  fortunately he did not do so for when chews material came      it was in the form of a clipping the story having been already      printed in some newspaper  chews knowledge of literary ethics      would seem to have been slight  he thought himself entitled to      something under the agreement with twichell  mark twain by this      time in london naturally had a different opinion       to rev j h twichell in hartford                                                    london june 9 73  dear old joei consider myself wholly at liberty to decline to pay chew anything and at the same time strongly tempted to sue him into the bargain for coming so near ruining me if he hadnt happened to send me that thing in print i would have used the story like an innocent fool and would straightway have been hounded to death as a plagiarist it would have absolutely destroyed me i cannot conceive of a man being such a hopeless ass after serving as a legislative reporter too as to imagine that i or any other literary man in his senses would consent to chew over old stuff that had already been in print if that man werent an infant in swaddling clothes his only reply to our petition would have been it has been in print it makes me as mad as the very old harry every time i think of mr chew and the frightfully narrow escape i have had at his hands confound mr chew with all my heart im willing that he should have ten dollars for his trouble of warming over his cold victualscheerfully willing to thatbut no more if i had had him near when his letter came i would have got out my tomahawk and gone for him he didnt tell the story half as well as you did anyhow  i wish to goodness you were here this momentnobody in our parlor but livy and meand a very good view of london to the fore we have a luxuriously ample suite of apartments in the langham hotel 3rd floor our bedroom looking straight up portland place and our parlor having a noble array of great windows looking out upon both streets portland place and the crook that joins it to regent street  9 pm full twilightrich sunset tints lingering in the west  i am not going to write anythingrather tell it when i get back i love you and harmony and that is all the fresh news ive got anyway and i mean to keep that fresh all the time                                     lovingly                                              mark  p sam luxuriating in glorious old pepys diary and smoking        letters are exceedingly scarce through all this period  mark twain      now on his second visit to london was literally overwhelmed with      honors and entertainment his rooms at the langham were like a      court  such men as robert browning turgenieff sir john millais      and charles kingsley hastened to call  kingsley and others gave him      dinners  mrs clemens to her sister wrote it is perfectly      discouraging to try to write you       the continuous excitement presently told on her  in july all      further engagements were canceled and clemens took his little      family to scotland for quiet and rest  they broke the journey at      york and it was there that mark twain wrote the only letter      remaining from this time      fragment of a letter to mrs jervis langdon of elmira n y  for the present we shall remain in this queer old walled town with its crooked narrow lanes that tell us of their old day that knew no wheeled vehicles its plasterandtimber dwellings with upper stories far overhanging the street and thus marking their date say three hundred years ago the stately city walls the castellated gates the ivygrown foliagesheltered most noble and picturesque ruin of st marys abbey suggesting their date say five hundred years ago in the heart of crusading times and the glory of english chivalry and romance the vast cathedral of york with its worn carvings and quaintly pictured windows preaching of still remoter days the outlandish names of streets and courts and byways that stand as a record and a memorial all these centuries of danish dominion here in still earlier times the hint here and there of king arthur and his knights and their bloody fights with saxon oppressors round about this old city more than thirteen hundred years gone by and last of all the melancholy old stone coffins and sculptured inscriptions a venerable arch and a hoary tower of stone that still remain and are kissed by the sun and caressed by the shadows every day just as the sun and the shadows have kissed and caressed them every lagging day since the roman emperors soldiers placed them here in the times when jesus the son of mary walked the streets of nazareth a youth with no more name or fame than the yorkshire boy who is loitering down this street this moment       their destination was edinburgh where they remained a month  mrs      clemenss health gave way on their arrival there and her husband      knowing the name of no other physician in the place looked up dr      john brown author of rab and his friends and found in him not only      a skilful practitioner but a lovable companion to whom they all      became deeply attached  little susy now seventeen months old      became his special favorite  he named her megalops because of her      great eyes       mrs clemens regained her strength and they returned to london      clemens still urged to lecture finally agreed with george dolby to      a weeks engagement and added a promise that after taking his wife      and daughter back to america he would return immediately for a more      extended course  dolby announced him to appear at the queens      concert rooms hanover square for the week of october 1318 his      lecture to be the old sandwich islands talk that seven years before      had brought him his first success  the great hall the largest in      london was thronged at each appearance and the papers declared      that mark twain had no more than whetted the public appetite for      his humor  three days later october 1873 clemens with his      little party sailed for home  halfway across the ocean he wrote      the friend they had left in scotland       to dr john brown in edinburgh                                          midatlantic oct 30 1873  our dear friend the doctorwe have plowed a long way over the sea and theres twentytwo hundred miles of restless water between us now besides the railway stretch and yet you are so present with us so close to us that a span and a whisper would bridge the distance  the first three days were stormy and wife child maid and miss spaulding were all seasick 25 hours out of the 24 and i was sorry i ever started however it has been smooth and balmy and sunny and altogether lovely for a day or two now and at night there is a broad luminous highway stretching over the sea to the moon over which the spirits of the sea are traveling up and down all through the secret night and having a genuine good time i make no doubt  today they discovered a collie on board i find as per advertisement which i sent you that they wont carry dogs in these ships at any price this one has been concealed up to this time now his owner has to pay l10 or heave him overboard fortunately the doggie is a performing doggie and the money will be paid so after all it was just as well you didnt intrust your collie to us  a poor little child died at midnight and was buried at dawn this morningsheeted and shotted and sunk in the middle of the lonely ocean in water three thousand fathoms deep pity the poor mother                                          with our love                                                   s l clemens        mark twain was back in london lecturing again at the queens      concert rooms after barely a months absence  charles warren      stoddard whom he had known in california shared his apartment at      the langham and acted as his secretarya very necessary office      for he was besieged by callers and bombarded with letters       he remained in london two months lecturing steadily at hanover      square to full houses  it is unlikely that there is any other      platform record to match it  one letter of this period has been      preserved  it is written to twichell near the end of his      engagement      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               london jan 5 1874  my dear old joei knew you would be likely to graduate into an ass if i came away and so you haveif you have stopped smoking however i have a strong faith that it is not too late yet and that the judiciously managed influence of a bad example will fetch you back again  i wish you had written me some newslivy tells me precious little she mainly writes to hurry me home and to tell me how much she respects me but shes generally pretty slow on news i had a letter from her along with yours today but she didnt tell me the book is out however its all right i hope to be home 20 days from today and then ill see her and that will make up for a whole years dearth of news i am right down grateful that she is looking strong and lovelier than ever i only wish i could see her look her level best oncei think it would be a vision  i have just spent a good part of this day browsing through the royal academy exhibition of landseers paintings they fill four or five great salons and must number a good many hundreds this is the only opportunity ever to see them because the finest of them belong to the queen and she keeps them in her private apartments ah theyre wonderfully beautiful there are such rich moonlights and dusks in the challenge and the combat and in that long flight of birds across a lake in the subdued flush of sunset or sunrisefor no man can ever tell tother from which in a picture except it has the filmy morning mist breathing itself up from the water and there is such a grave analytical profundity in the faces of the connoisseurs and such pathos in the picture of the fawn suckling its dead mother on a snowy waste with only the blood in the footprints to hint that she is not asleep and the way he makes animals absolute flesh and bloodinsomuch that if the room were darkened ever so little and a motionless living animal placed beside a painted one no man could tell which was which  i interrupted myself here to drop a line to shirley brooks and suggest a cartoon for punch it was this in one of the academy salons in the suite where these pictures are a fine bust of landseer stands on a pedestal in the centre of the room i suggest that some of landseers best known animals be represented as having come down out of their frames in the moonlight and grouped themselves about the bust in mourning attitudes  well old man i am powerful glad to hear from you and shall be powerful glad to see you and harmony i am not going to the provinces because i cannot get halls that are large enough i always felt cramped in hanover square rooms but i find that everybody here speaks with awe and respect of that prodigious place and wonder that i could fill it so long  i am hoping to be back in 20 days but i have so much to go home to and enjoy with a jubilant joy that it seems hardly possible that it can ever come to pass in so uncertain a world as this  i have read the novelthe gilded age published during his absence december 1873here and i like it i have made no inquiries about it though my interest in a book ceases with the printing of it                                     with a world of love                                              saml     xiii letters 1874 hartford and elmira a

                                         feby  28 1874  my dear friendwe are all delighted with your commendations of the gilded ageand the more so because some of our newspapers have set forth the opinion that warner really wrote the book and i only added my name to the title page in order to give it a larger sale i wrote the first eleven chapters every word and every line i also wrote chapters 24 25 27 28 30 32 33 34 36 37 21 42 43 45 51 52 53 57 59 60 61 62 and portions of 35 49 and 56 so i wrote 32 of the 63 chapters entirely and part of 3 others beside  the fearful financial panic hit the book heavily for we published it in the midst of it but nevertheless in the 8 weeks that have now elapsed since the day we published we have sold 40000 copies which gives l3000 royalty to be divided between the authors this is really the largest twomonths sale which any american book has ever achieved unless one excepts the cheaper editions of uncle toms cabin the average price of our book is 16 shillings a copyuncle tom was 2 shillings a copy but for the panic our sale would have been doubled i verily believe i do not believe the sale will ultimately go over 100000 copies  i

unceasingly happy than i am i defy the world to produce him and prove him in my opinion he doesnt exist i was a mighty rough coarse unpromising subject when livy took charge of me 4 years ago and i

and clemens families began      visiting back and forth between boston and hartford and sometimes      aldrich came though less frequently and the gatherings at the      homes of warner and clemens were full of nevertobeforgotten      happiness  of one such visit howells wrote       in the goodfellowship of that cordial neighborhood we had two such      days as the aging sun no longer shines on in his round  there was      constant running in and out of friendly houses where the lively      hosts and guests called one another by their christian names or      nicknames and no such vain ceremony as knocking or ringing at      doors  clemens was then building the stately mansion in which he      satisfied his love of magnificence as if it had been another      sealskin coat and he was at the crest of the prosperity which      enabled him to humor every whim or extravagance       it was the delight of such a visit that kept clemens constantly      urging its repetition  one cannot but feel the genuine affection of      these letters       to w d howells in boston                                                    mch 1 1876  my dear howellsnow you will find us the most

members of our family they are but ill close the door against them allwhich will fix all of the lot except twichell who will no more hesitate to climb in at the back window than nothing  and you shall go to bed when you please get up when you please talk when you please read when you please mrs howells may even go to new york saturday if she feels that she must but if some gentle unannoying coaxing can beguile her into putting that off a few days we shall be more than glad for i do wish she and mrs clemens could have a good square chance to get acquainted with each other but first and last and all the time we want you to feel untrammeled and wholly free from restraint here  the date suitsall dates suit                                yrs ever                                         mark

well here as in cambridge cant you come will one of you boys buy that house now say yes  mrs clemens is an invalid yet but is getting along pretty fairly  we send best regards                              mark        april found the clemens family in elmira  mrs clemens was not      overstrong and the cares of housebuilding were many  they went      early therefore remaining at the langdon home in the city until      quarry farm should feel a touch of warmer sun clemens wrote the      news to doctor brown      to dr john brown in edinburgh                                     elmira n y april 27 86  dear doctorthis town is in the interior of the state of new yorkand was my wifes birthplace we are here to spend the whole summer although it is so near summer we had a great snowstorm yesterday and one the day before this is rather breaking in upon our plans as it may keep us down here in the valley a trifle longer than we desired it gets fearfully hot here in the summer so we spend our summers on top of a hill 6 or 700 feet high about two or three miles from hereit never gets hot up there  mrs clemens is pretty strong and so is the little wifie barring a desperate cold in the head the child grows in grace and beauty marvellously i wish the nations of the earth would combine in a baby show and give us a chance to compete i must try to find one of her latest photographs to enclose in this and this reminds me that mrs clemens keeps urging me to ask you for your photograph and last night she said and be sure to ask him for a photograph of his sister and jockbut say master jockdo not be headless and forget that courtesy he is jock in our memories and our talk but he has a right to his title when a body uses his name in a letter now i have got it all ini cant have made any mistake this time miss clara spaulding looked in a moment yesterday morning as bright and good as ever she would like to lay her love at your feet if she knew i was writingas would also fifty friends of ours whom you have never seen and whose homage is as fervent as if the cold and clouds and darkness of a mighty sea did not lie between their hearts and you poor old rab had not many friends at first but if all his friends of today could gather to his grave from the four corners of the earth what a procession there would be and rabs friends are your friends  i am going to work when we get on the hilltill then ive got to lie fallow albeit against my will we join in love to you and yours                                     your friend ever                                              saml l clemens  p s i enclose a specimen of villainy a man pretends to be my brother and my lecture agentgathers a great audience together in a city more than a thousand miles from here and then pockets the money and elopes leaving the audience to wait for the imaginary lecturer i am after him with the law        it was a historic summer at the farm  a new baby arrived in june a      new study was built for mark twain by mrs crane on the hillside      near the old quarry a new book was begun in itthe adventures of      tom sawyerand a play the first that mark twain had really      attempted was completedthe dramatization of the gilded age       an early word went to hartford of conditions at the farm       to rev and mrs twichell in hartford                                               elmira june 11 1874  my dear old joe and harmonythe baby is here and is the great american giantessweighing 7 34 pounds we had to wait a good long time for her but she was full compensation when she did come  the modoc was delighted with it and gave it her doll at once there is nothing selfish about the modoc she is fascinated with the new baby the modoc rips and tears around out doors most of the time and consequently is as hard as a pine knot and as brown as an indian she is bosom friend to all the ducks chickens turkeys and guinea hens on the place yesterday as she marched along the winding path that leads up the hill through the red clover beds to the summerhouse there was a long procession of these fowls stringing contentedly after her led by a stately rooster who can look over the modocs head the devotion of these vassals has been purchased with daily largess of indian meal and so the modoc attended by her bodyguard moves in state wherever she goes  susie crane has built the loveliest study for me you ever saw it is octagonal with a peaked roof each octagon filled with a spacious window and it sits perched in complete isolation on top of an elevation that commands leagues of valley and city and retreating ranges of distant blue hills it is a cosy nest with just room in it for a sofa and a table and three or four chairsand when the storms sweep down the remote valley and the lightning flashes above the hills beyond and the rain beats upon the roof over my head imagine the luxury of it it stands 500 feet above the valley and 2 12 miles from it  however one must not write all day we send continents of love to you and yours                           affectionately                                         mark        we have mentioned before that clemens had settled his mother and      sister at fredonia new york and when mrs clemens was in condition      to travel he concluded to pay them a visit       it proved an unfortunate journey the hot weather was hard on mrs      clemens and harder still perhaps on mark twains temper  at any      period of his life a bore exasperated him and in these earlier days      he was far more likely to explode than in his mellower age  remorse      always followedthe price he paid was always costly  we cannot      know now who was the unfortunate that invited the storm but in the      next letter we get the echoes of it and realize something of its      damage      to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in fredonia                                               elmira aug 15  my dear mother and sisteri came away from fredonia ashamed of myselfalmost too much humiliated to hold up my head and say goodbye for i began to comprehend how much harm my conduct might do you socially in your village i would have gone to that detestable oysterbrained bore and apologized for my inexcusable rudeness to him but that i was satisfied he was of too small a calibre to know how to receive an apology with magnanimity  pamela appalled me by saying people had hinted that they wished to visit livy when she came but that she had given them no encouragement i feared that those people would merely comprehend that their courtesies were not wanted and yet not know exactly why they were not wanted  i came away feeling that in return for your constant and tireless efforts to secure our bodily comfort and make our visit enjoyable i had basely repaid you by making you sad and sorehearted and leaving you so and the natural result has fallen to me likewisefor a guilty conscience has harassed me ever since and i have not had one short quarter of an hour of peace to this moment  you spoke of middletown why not go there and live mr crane says it is only about a hundred miles this side of new york on the erie road the fact that one or two of you might prefer to live somewhere else is not a valid objectionthere are no 4 people who would all choose the same placeso it will be vain to wait for the day when your tastes shall be a unit i seriously fear that our visit has damaged you in fredonia and so i wish you were out of it  the baby is fat and strong and susie the same susie was charmed with the donkey and the doll                      ys affectionately                                         saml  p sdear ma and pamelai am mainly grieved because i have been rude to a man who has been kind to youand if you ever feel a desire to apologize to him for me you may be sure that i will endorse the apology no matter how strong it may be i went to his bank to apologize to him but my conviction was strong that he was not man enough to know how to take an apology and so i did not make it        william dean howells was in those days writing those vividly      realistic indeed photographic stories which fixed his place among      american men of letters  he had already written their wedding      journey and a chance acquaintance when a foregone conclusion      appeared  for the reason that his own work was so different and      perhaps because of his fondness for the author clemens always      greatly admired the books of howells  howellss exact observation      and his gift for human detail seemed marvelous to mark twain who      with a bigger brush was inclined to record the larger rather than      the minute aspects of life  the sincerity of his appreciation of      howells however need not be questioned nor for that matter his      detestation of scott       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira aug 22 1874  dear howellsi have just finished reading the foregone conclusion to mrs clemens and we think you have even outdone yourself i should think that this must be the daintiest truest most admirable workmanship that was ever put on a story the creatures of god do not act out their natures more unerringly than yours do if your genuine stories can die i wonder by what right old walter scotts artificialities shall continue to live  i brought mrs clemens back from her trip in a dreadfully brokendown conditionso by the doctors orders we unpacked the trunks sorrowfully to lie idle here another month instead of going at once to hartford and proceeding to furnish the new house which is now finished we hate to have it go longer desolate and tenantless but cannot help it  by and by if the madam gets strong again we are hoping to have the grays there and you and the aldrich households and osgood down to engage in an orgy with them                                ys ever                                         mark        howells was editor of the atlantic by this time and had been urging      clemens to write something suitable for that magazine  he had done      nothing however until this summer at quarry farm  there one      night in the moonlight mrs cranes colored cook who had been a      slave was induced to tell him her story  it was exactly the story      to appeal to mark twain and the kind of thing he could write  he      set it down next morning as nearly in her own words and manner as      possible without departing too far from literary requirements       he decided to send this to howells  he did not regard it very      highly but he would take the chance  an earlier offering to the      magazine had been returned  he sent the true story with a brief      note       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira sept 2 74 my dear howellsi enclose also a true story which has no humor in it you can pay as lightly as you choose for that if you want it for it is rather out of my line i have not altered the old colored womans story except to begin at the beginning instead of the middle as she didand traveled both ways                                     yrs ever                                              mark       but howells was delighted with it  he referred to its realest kind      of black talk and in another place added this little story      delights me more and more  i wish you had about forty of them       along with the true story mark twain had sent the fable for good      old boys and girls but this howells returned not as he said      because he didnt like it but because the atlantic on matters of      religion was just in that good lord good devil condition when a      little fable like yours wouldnt leave it a single presbyterian      baptist unitarian episcopalian methodist or millerite paying      subscriber while all the deadheads would stick to it and abuse it      in the denominational newspapers       but the shorter ms had been only a brief diversion  mark twain was      bowling along at a book and a play  the book was tom sawyer as      already mentioned and the play a dramatization from the gilded age      clemens had all along intended to dramatize the story of colonel      sellers and was one day thunderstruck to receive word from      california that a san francisco dramatist had appropriated his      character in a play written for john t raymond  clemens had taken      out dramatic copyright on the book and immediately stopped the      performance by telegraph  a correspondence between the author and      the dramatist followed leading to a friendly arrangement by which      the latter agreed to dispose of his version to mark twain  a good      deal of discussion from time to time having arisen over the      authorship of the sellers play as presented by raymond certain      among the letters that follow may be found of special interest      meanwhile we find clemens writing to dr john brown of edinburgh      on these matters and events in general  the book ms which he      mentions as having put aside was not touched again for nearly a      year       to dr john brown in edinburgh                                     quarry farm near elmira n y                                     sept  4 1874  dear friendi have been writing fifty pages of manuscript a day on an average for sometime now on a book a story and consequently have been so wrapped up in it and so dead to anything else that i have fallen mighty short in letterwriting but night before last i discovered that that days chapter was a failure in conception moral truth to nature and executionenough blemish to impair the excellence of almost any chapterand so i must burn up the days work and do it all over again it was plain that i had worked myself out pumped myself dry so i knocked off and went to playing billiards for a change i havent had an idea or a fancy for two days nowan excellent time to write to friends who have plenty of ideas and fancies of their own and so will prefer the offerings of the heart before those of the head day after tomorrow i go to a neighboring city to see a fiveactdrama of mine brought out and suggest amendments in it and would about as soon spend a night in the spanish inquisition as sit there and be tortured with all the adverse criticisms i can contrive to imagine the audience is indulging in but whether the play be successful or not i hope i shall never feel obliged to see it performed a second time my interest in my work dies a sudden and violent death when the work is done  i have invented and patented a pretty good sort of scrapbook i think but i have backed down from letting it be known as mine just at presentfor i cant stand being under discussion on a play and a scrapbook at the same time  i shall be away two days and then return to take our tribe to new york where we shall remain five days buying furniture for the new house and then go to hartford and settle solidly down for the winter after all that fallow time i ought to be able to go to work again on the book we shall reach hartford about the middle of september i judge  we have spent the past four months up here on top of a breezy hill six hundred feet high some few miles from elmira n y and overlooking that town elmira is my wifes birthplace and that of susie and the new baby this little summer house on the hilltop named quarry farm because theres a quarry on it belongs to my wifes sister mrs crane  a photographer came up the other day and wanted to make some views and i shall send you the result per this mail  my study is a snug little octagonal den with a coalgrate 6 big windows one little one and a wide doorway the latter opening upon the distant town on hot days i spread the study wide open anchor my papers down with brickbats and write in the midst of the hurricanes clothed in the same thin linen we make shirts of the study is nearly on the peak of the hill it is right in front of the little perpendicular wall of rock left where they used to quarry stones on the peak of the hill is an old arbor roofed with bark and covered with the vine you call the american creeperits green is almost bloodied with red the study is 30 yards below the old arbor and 200 yards above the dwellinghouseit is remote from all noises  now isnt the whole thing pleasantly situated  in the picture of me in the study you glimpse through the lefthand window the little rock bluff that rises behind the pond and the bases of the little trees on top of it the small square window is over the fireplace the chimney divides to make room for it without the stereoscope it looks like a framed picture all the study windows have venetian blinds they long ago went out of fashion in america but they have not been replaced with anything half as good yet  the study is built on top of a tumbled rockheap that has morningglories climbing about it and a stone stairway leading down through and dividing it  there nowif you have not time to read all this turn it over to jock and drag in the judge to help  mrs clemens must put in a late picture of susiea picture which she maintains is good but which i think is slander on the child  we revisit the rutland street home many a time in fancy for we hold every individual in it in happy and grateful memory                                goodbye                                    your friend                                         saml l clemens  p si gave the po department a blast in the papers about sending misdirected letters of mine back to the writers for reshipment and got a blast in return through a new york daily from the new york postmaster but i notice that misdirected letters find me now without any unnecessary fooling around        the new house in hartford was now ready to be occupied and in a      letter to howells written a little more than a fortnight after the      foregoing we find them located in part of it  but what seems      more interesting is that paragraph of the letter which speaks of      close friendly relations still existing with the warners in that it      refutes a report current at this time that there was a break between      clemens and warner over the rights in the sellers play  there was      in fact no such rupture  warner realizing that he had no hand in      the character of sellers and no share in the work of dramatization      generously yielded all claim to any part of the returns       to w d howells in boston                           farmington avenue hartford sept 20 1876  my dear howellsall right my boy send proof sheets here i amend dialect stuff by talking and talking and talking it till it sounds rightand i had difficulty with this negro talk because a negro sometimes rarely says goin and sometimes gwyne and they make just such discrepancies in other wordsand when you come to reproduce them on paper they look as if the variation resulted from the writers carelessness but i want to work at the proofs and get the dialect as nearly right as possible  we are in part of the new house goodness knows when well get in the rest of itfull of workmen yet  i worked a month at my play and launched it in new york last wednesday i believe it will go the newspapers have been complimentary it is simply a setting for the one character col sellersas a play i guess it will not bear a critical assault in force  the warners are as charming as ever they go shortly to the devil for a yearwhich is but a poetical way of saying they are going to afflict themselves with the unsurpassablebad word of travel for a spell i believe they mean to go and see you firstso they mean to start from heaven to the other place not from earth how is that  i think that is no slouch of a complimentkind of a dim religious light about it i enjoy that sort of thing                                     yrs ever                                              mark        raymond in a letter to the sun stated that not one line of the      california dramatization had been used by mark twain except that      which was taken bodily from the gilded age  clemens himself in a      statement that he wrote for the hartford post but suppressed      probably at the request of his wife gave a full history of the      plays origin a matter of slight interest today       sellers on the stage proved a great success  the play had no      special merit as a literary composition but the character of      sellers delighted the public and both author and actor were richly      repaid for their entertainment     xiv letters 1874 mississippi chapters visits to boston a joke on aldrich       couldnt you send me some such story as that colored one      for our january numberthat is within a month wrote      howells at the end of september and during the week      following mark twain struggled hard to comply but without      result  when the month was nearly up he wrote       to w d howells in boston                                               hartford oct 23 1874  my dear howellsi have delayed thus long hoping i might do something for the january number and mrs clemens has diligently persecuted me day by day with urgings to go to work and do that something but its no usei find i cant we are in such a state of weary and endless confusion that my head wont go so i give it up                                yrs ever                                         mark        but two hours later when he had returned from one of the long walks      which he and twichell so frequently took together he told a      different story   later pm home 24th 74  my dear howellsi take back the remark that i cant write for the jan number for twichell and i have had a long walk in the woods and i got to telling him about old mississippi days of steamboating glory and grandeur as i saw them during 5 years from the pilothouse he said what a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine i hadnt thought of that before would you like a series of papers to run through 3 months or 6 or 9or about 4 months say                           yrs ever                                    mark        howells himself had come from a family of pilots and rejoiced in      the idea  a few days later mark twain forwarded the first      instalment of the new seriesthose wonderful chapters that begin      now with chapter four in the mississippi book  apparently he was      not without doubt concerning the manuscript and accompanied it with      a brief line       to w d howells in boston  dear howellscut it scarify it reject it handle it with entire freedom                           yrs ever                                    mark        but howells had no doubts as to the quality of the new find  he      declared that the piece about the mississippi was capital that it      almost made the water in their icepitcher turn muddy as he read it      the sketch of the lowlived little town was so good that i could      have wished that there was more of it  i want the sketches if you      can make them every month       the lowlived little town was hannibal and the reader can turn to      the vivid description of it in the chapter already mentioned       in the same letter howells refers to a letter from limerick which      he declares he shall keep until he has shown it aroundespecially      to aldrich and osgood       the letter from limerick has to do with a special episode      mention has just been made of mark twains walk with twichell      frequently their walks were extended tramps and once in a daring      moment one or the other of them proposed to walk to boston  the      time was november and the bracing air made the proposition seem      attractive  they were off one morning early twichell carrying a      little bag and clemens a basket of luncheon  a few days before      clemens had written redpath that the rev j h twichell and he      expected to start at eight oclock thursday morning to walk to      boston in twentyfour hoursor more  we shall telegraph youngs      hotel for rooms saturday night in order to allow for a low average      of pedestrianism       they did not get quite to boston  in fact they got only a little      farther than the twentyeight miles they made the first day      clemens could hardly walk next morning but they managed to get to      north ashford where they took a carriage for the nearest railway      station  there they telegraphed to redpath and howells that they      would be in boston that evening  howells of course had a good      supper and good company awaiting them at his home and the      pedestrians spent two happy days visiting and recounting their      adventures       it was one morning at his hotel that mark twain wrote the limerick      letter  it was addressed to mrs clemens but was really intended      for howells and twichell and the others whom it mentions  it was an      amusing fancy rather than a letter but it deserves place here       to mrs clemensintended for howells aldrich etc                                     boston nov 16 1935 1874  dear livy you observe i still call this beloved old place by the name it had when i was young limerick it is enough to make a body sick  the gentlemeninwaiting stare to see me sit here telegraphing this letter to you and no doubt they are smiling in their sleeves but let them the slow old fashions are good enough for me thank god and i will none other when i see one of these modern fools sit absorbed holding the end of a telegraph wire in his hand and reflect that a thousand miles away there is another fool hitched to the other end of it it makes me frantic with rage and then am i more implacably fixed and resolved than ever to continue taking twenty minutes to telegraph you what i communicate in ten sends by the new way if i would so debase myself and when i see a whole silent solemn drawingroom full of idiots sitting with their hands on each others foreheads communing i tug the white hairs from my head and curse till my asthma brings me the blessed relief of suffocation in our old day such a gathering talked pure drivel and rot mostly but better that a thousand times than these dreary conversational funerals that oppress our spirits in this mad generation  it is sixty years since i was here before i walked hither then with my precious old friend it seems incredible now that we did it in two days but such is my recollection i no longer mention that we walked back in a single day it makes me so furious to see doubt in the face of the hearer men were men in those old times think of one of the puerile organisms in this effeminate age attempting such a feat  my airship was delayed by a collision with a fellow from china loaded with the usual cargo of jabbering coppercolored missionaries and so i was nearly an hour on my journey but by the goodness of god thirteen of the missionaries were crippled and several killed so i was content to lose the time i love to lose time anyway because it brings soothing reminiscences of the creeping railroad days of old now lost to us forever  our game was neatly played and successfullynone expected us of course you should have seen the guards at the ducal palace stare when i said announce his grace the archbishop of dublin and the rt hon the earl of hartford arrived within we were all eyes to see the duke of cambridge and his duchess wondering if we might remember their faces and they ours in a moment they came tottering in he bent and withered and bald she blooming with wholesome old age he peered through his glasses a moment then screeched in a reedy voice come to my arms away with titlesill know ye by no names but twain and twichell then fell he on our necks and jammed his trumpet in his ear the which we filled with shoutings to this effect god bless you old howells what is left of you  we talked late that nightnone of your silent idiot communings for usof the olden time we rolled a stream of ancient anecdotes over our tongues and drank till the lord archbishop grew so mellow in the mellow past that dublin ceased to be dublin to him and resumed its sweeter forgotten name of new york in truth he almost got back into his ancient religion too good jesuit as he has always been since omulligan the first established that faith in the empire  and we canvassed everybody bailey aldrich marquis of ponkapog came in got nobly drunk and told us all about how poor osgood lost his earldom and was hanged for conspiring against the second emperorbut he didnt mention how near he himself came to being hanged too for engaging in the same enterprise he was as chaffy as he was sixty years ago too and swore the archbishop and i never walked to bostonbut there was never a day that ponkapog wouldnt lie so be it by the grace of god he got the opportunity  the lord high admiral came in a hale gentleman close upon seventy and bronzed by the suns and storms of many climes and scarred with the wounds got in many battles and i told him how i had seen him sit in a high chair and eat fruit and cakes and answer to the name of johnny his granddaughter the eldest is but lately warned to the youngest of the grand dukes and so who knows but a day may come when the blood of the howellss may reign in the land i must not forget to say while i think of it that your new false teeth are done my dear and your wig keep your head well bundled with a shawl till the latter comes and so cheat your persecuting neuralgias and rheumatisms would you believe itthe duchess of cambridge is deafer than youdeafer than her husband they call her to breakfast with a salvo of artillery and usually when it thunders she looks up expectantly and says come in  the monument to the author of gloverson and his silent partners is finished it is the stateliest and the costliest ever erected to the memory of any man this noble classic has now been translated into all the languages of the earth and is adored by all nations and known to all creatures yet i have conversed as familiarly with the author of it as i do with my own greatgrandchildren  i wish you could see old cambridge and ponkapog i love them as dearly as ever but privately my dear they are not much improvement on idiots it is melancholy to hear them jabber over the same pointless anecdotes three and four times of an evening forgetting that they had jabbered them over three or four times the evening before ponkapog still writes poetry but the oldtime fire has mostly gone out of it perhaps his best effort of late years is this                 o soul soul soul of mine                soul soul soul of thine                thy soul my soul two souls entwine                and sing thy lauds in crystal wine  this he goes about repeating to everybody daily and nightly insomuch that he is become a sore affliction to all that know him  but i must desist there are drafts here everywhere and my gout is something frightful my left foot hath resemblance to a snuffbladder                           god be with you                                         hartford  these to lady hartford in the earldom of hartford in the upper portion of the city of dublin        one may imagine the joy of howells and the others in this ludicrous      extravaganza which could have been written by no one but mark      twain  it will hardly take rank as prophecy though certainly true      forecast in it is not wholly lacking       clemens was now pretty well satisfied with his piloting story but      he began to have doubts as to its title old times on the      mississippi  it seemed to commit him to too large an undertaking       to w d howells in boston                                                    dec 3 1874  my dear howellslet us change the heading to piloting on the miss in the old timesor to steamboating on the m in old timesor to personal old times on the misswe could change it for feb if now too late for jani suggest it because the present heading is too pretentious too broad and general it seems to command me to deliver a second book of revelation to the world and cover all the old times the mississippi dang that word it is worse than type or egypt  ever sawwhereas here i have finished article no iii and am about to start on no 4 and yet i have spoken of nothing but of piloting as a science so far and i doubt if i ever get beyond that portion of my subject and i dont care to any muggins can write about old times on the miss of 500 different kinds but i am the only man alive that can scribble about the piloting of that dayand no man ever has tried to scribble about it yet its newness pleases me all the timeand it is about the only new subject i know of if i were to write fifty articles they would all be about pilots and pilotingtherefore lets get the word piloting into the heading theres a sort of freshness about that too                                                ys ever                                                    mark        but howells thought the title satisfactory and indeed it was the      best that could have been selected for the series  he wrote every      few days of his delight in the papers and cautioned the author not      to make an attempt to please any supposed atlantic audience      adding yarn it off into my sympathetic ear  clemens replied       to w d howells in boston                                               htfd  dec 8 1874  my dear howellsit isnt the atlantic audience that distresses me for it is the only audience that i sit down before in perfect serenity for the simple reason that it doesnt require a humorist to paint himself striped and stand on his head every fifteen minutes the trouble was that i was only bent on working up an atmosphere and that is to me a most fidgety and irksome thing sometimes i avoid it usually but in this case it was absolutely necessary else every reader would be applying the atmosphere of his own or sea experiences and that shirt wouldnt fit you know  i could have sent this article ii a week ago or more but i couldnt bring myself to the drudgery of revising and correcting it i have been at that tedious work 3 hours now and by george but i am glad it is over  sayi am as prompt as a clock if i only know the day a thing is wantedotherwise i am a natural procrastinaturalist tell me what day and date you want nos 3 and 4 and i will tackle and revise them and theyll be there to the minute  i could wind up with no 4 but there are some things more which i am powerfully moved to write which is natural enough since i am a person who would quit authorizing in a minute to go to piloting if the madam would stand it i would rather sink a steamboat than eat any time  my wife was afraid to write youso i said with simplicity i will give you the languageand ideas through the infinite grace of god there has not been such another insurrection in the family before as followed this however the letter was written and promptly toowhereas heretofore she has remained afraid to do such things  with kind regards to mrs howells                           yrs ever                                    mark        the old times papers appeared each month in the atlantic until      july 1875 and take rank today with mark twains best work  when      the first number appeared john hay wrote it is perfect no more      nor less  i dont see how you do it  which was reported to      howells who said what business has hay i should like to know      praising a favorite of mine  its interfering       these were the days when the typewriter was new  clemens and      twichell during their stay in boston had seen the marvel in      operation and clemens had been unable to resist owning one  it was      far from being the perfect machine of today the letters were all      capitals and one was never quite certain even of those  mark      twain however began with enthusiasm and practised faithfully  on      the day of its arrival he wrote two letters that have survived the      first to his brother the other to howells       typewritten letter to w d howells in boston                                     hartford dec 9 1874  my dear howellsi want to add a short paragraph to article no 1 when the proof comes merely a line or two however  i dont know whether i am going to make this typewriting machine go or nto that last word was intended for nnot but i guess i shall make some sort of a succss of it before i run it very long i am so thickfingered that i miss the keys  you neednt a swer this i am only practicing to get three another slipup there only practicing to get the hang of the thing i notice i miss fire  get in a good many unnecessary letters and punctuation marks i am simply using you for a target to bang at blame my cats but this thing requires genius in order to work it just right                           yours ever                                         mark         knowing mark twain howells wrote when you get tired of the      machine send it to me  clemens naturally did get tired of the      machine it was ruining his morals he said  he presently offered      it to howells who by this time hesitated but eventually yielded      and accepted it  if he was blasted by its influence the fact has      not been recorded       one of the famous atlantic dinners came along in december  dont      you dare to refuse that invitation wrote howells to meet      emerson aldrich and all those boys at the parker house at six      oclock tuesday december 15th  come       clemens had no desire to refuse he sent word that he would come      and followed it with a characteristic line       to w d howells in boston                                                    hartford sunday  my dear howellsi want you to ask mrs howells to let you stay all night at the parker house and tell lies and have an improving time and take breakfast with me in the morning i will have a good room for you and a fire cant you tell her it always makes you sick to go home late at night or something like that that sort of thing rouses mrs clemenss sympathies easily the only trouble is to keep them up twichell and i talked till 2 or 3 in the morning the night we supped at your house and it restored his health on account of his being drooping for some time and made him much more robuster than what he was before will mrs howells let you                                yrs ever                                         s l c       aldrich had issued that year a volume of poems and he presented      clemens with a copy of it during this boston visit  the letter of      appreciation which follows contains also reference to an amusing      incident but we shall come to that presently       to t b aldrich in ponkapog mass                                          farmington avenue hartford                                          dec  18 1874  my dear aldrichi read the cloth of gold through coming down in the cars and it is just lightning poetrya thing which it gravels me to say because my own efforts in that line have remained so persistently unrecognized in consequence of the envy and jealousy of this generation baby bell always seemed perfection before but now that i have children it has got even beyond that about the hour that i was reading it in the cars twichell was reading it at home and forthwith fell upon me with a burst of enthusiasm about it when i saw him this was pleasant because he has long been a lover of it  thos bailey aldrich responded etc in one of the brightest speeches of the evening  that is what the tribune correspondent says and that is what everybody that heard it said therefore you keep still dont ever be so unwise as to go on trying to unconvince those people  ive been skating around the place all day with some girls with mrs clemens in the window to do the applause there would be a power of fun in skating if you could do it with somebody elses musclesthere are about twenty boys booming by the house now and it is mighty good to look at  im keeping you in mind you see in the matter of photographs i have a couple to enclose in this letter and i want you to say you got them and then i shall know i have been a good truthful child  i am going to send more as i ferret them out about the placeand i wont forget that you are a subscriber  the wife and i unite in warm regards to you and mrs aldrich                                yrs ever                                         s l clemens        a letter bearing the same date as the above went back to howells we      find in reference to still another incident which perhaps should      come first       mark twain up to this time had worn the black string necktie of      the westa decoration which disturbed mrs clemens and invited      remarks from his friends  he had persisted in it however up to      the date of the atlantic dinner when howells and aldrich decided      that something must be done about it       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford dec  18 1874  my dear howellsi left no 3 miss chapter in my eldests reach and it may have gone to the postman and it likewise may have gone into the fire i confess to a dread that the latter is the case and that that stack of ms will have to be written over again if so o for the return of the lamented herod  you and aldrich have made one woman deeply and sincerely gratefulmrs clemens for monthsi may even say yearsshe had shown unaccountable animosity toward my necktie even getting up in the night to take it with the tongs and blackguard itsometimes also going so far as to threaten it  when i said you and aldrich had given me two new neckties and that they were in a paper in my overcoat pocket she was in a fever of happiness until she found i was going to frame them then all the venom in her nature gathered itself togetherinsomuch that i being near to a door went without perceiving danger  now i wear one of the new neckties nothing being sacred in mrs clemenss eyes that can be perverted to a gaud that shall make the person of her husband more alluring than it was aforetime  jo twichell was the delightedest old boy i ever saw when he read the words you had written in that book he and i went to the concert of the yale students last night and had a good time  mrs clemens dreads our going to new orleans but i tell her shell have to give her consent this time  with kindest regards unto ye both                                yrs ever                                         s l clemens        the reference to new orleans at the end of this letter grew      naturally out of the enthusiasm aroused by the mississippi papers      the more clemens wrote about the river the more he wished to revisit      it and take howells with him  howells was willing enough to go and      they eventually arranged to take their wives on the excursion  this      seemed all very well and possible so long as the time was set for      some date in the future still unfixed  but howells was a busy      editor and it was much more easy for him to promise goodnaturedly      than to agree on a definite time of departure  he explained at      length why he could not make the journey and added forgive me      having led you on to fix a time i never thought it would come to      that i supposed you would die or something  i am really more      sorry and ashamed than i can make it appear  so the beautiful plan      was put aside though it was not entirely abandoned for a long time       we now come to the incident mentioned in mark twains letter to      aldrich of december the 18th  it had its beginning at the atlantic      dinner where aldrich had abused clemens for never sending him any      photographs of himself  it was suggested by one or the other that      his name be put down as a regular subscriber for all mark twain      photographs as they came out  clemens returned home and hunted up      fiftytwo different specimens put each into an envelope and began      mailing them to him one each morning  when a few of them had      arrived aldrich wrote protesting       the police he said have a way of swooping down on that kind of      publication  the other day they gobbled up an entire edition of      the life in new york       whereupon clemens bundled up the remaining collectionfortyfive      envelopes of photographs and printsand mailed them together       aldrich wrote now violently declaring the perpetrator of the      outrage to be known to the police that a sprawling yellow figure      against a green background had been recognized as an admirable      likeness of mark twain alias the jumping frog a wellknown      californian desperado formerly the chief of henry plummers band of      road agents in montana  the letter was signed t bayleigh chief      of police  on the back of the envelope t bayleigh had also      written that it was no use for the person to send any more letters      as the postoffice at that point was to be blown up  fortyeight      hogshead of nitroglycerine had been syrupticiously introduced into      the cellar of the building and more was expected  rwe  hwl      owh and other conspirators in masks have been seen flitting      about the town for some days past  the greatest excitement combined      with the most intense quietness reigns at ponkapog     xv letters from hartford 1875 much correspondence with howells  orion clemens had kept his job with bliss only a short time his mental makeup was such that it was difficult for him to hold any position long he meant to do well but he was unfortunate in his efforts his ideas were seldom practical his nature was yielding and fickle he had returned to keokuk presently and being convinced there was a fortune in chickens had prevailed upon his brother to purchase for him a little farm not far from the town but the chicken business was not lively and orion kept the mail hot with manuscripts and propositions of every sort which he wanted his brother to take under advisement  certainly to mark twain orion clemens was a trial the letters of the latter show that scarcely one of them but contains the outline of some rainbowchasing scheme full of wild optimism and the certainty that somewhere just ahead lies the pot of gold only now and then there is a letter of abject humiliation and complete surrender when some golden vision some iridescent soapbubble had vanished at his touch such depression did not last by sunrise he was ready with a new dream new enthusiasm and with a new letter inviting his brother sams interest and investment yet his fear of incurring his brothers displeasure was pitiful regardless of the fact that he constantly employed the very means to insure that result at one time clemens made him sign a sworn agreement that he would not suggest any plan or scheme of investment for the period of twelve months orion must have kept this agreement he would have gone to the stake before he would have violated an oath but the stake would have probably been no greater punishment than his sufferings that year  on the whole samuel clemens was surprisingly patient and considerate with orion and there was never a time that he was not willing to help yet there were bound to be moments of exasperation and once when his mother or sister had written suggesting that he encourage his brothers efforts he felt moved to write at considerable freedom       to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in fredonia n y                                               hartford sunday 1875  my dear mother and sisteri saw gov newell today and he said he was still moving in the matter of sammys appointmentas a west point cadetand would stick to it till he got a result of a positive nature one way or the other but thus far he did not know whether to expect success or defeat  ma whenever you need money i hope you wont be backward about saying soyou can always have it we stint ourselves in some ways but we have no desire to stint you and we dont intend to either  i cant encourage orion nobody can do that conscientiously for the reason that before ones letter has time to reach him he is off on some new wildgoose chase would you encourage in literature a man who the older he grows the worse he writes would you encourage orion in the glaring insanity of studying law if he were packed and crammed full of law it would be worthless lumber to him for his is such a capricious and illregulated mind that he would apply the principles of the law with no more judgment than a child of ten years i know what i am saying i laid one of the plainest and simplest of legal questions before orion once and the helpless and hopeless mess he made of it was absolutely astonishing nothing aggravates me so much as to have orion mention law or literature to me  well i cannot encourage him to try the ministry because he would change his religion so fast that he would have to keep a traveling agent under wages to go ahead of him to engage pulpits and board for him  i cannot conscientiously encourage him to do anything but potter around his little farm and put in his odd hours contriving new and impossible projects at the rate of 365 a yearwhich is his customary average he says he did well in hannibal now there is a man who ought to be entirely satisfied with the grandeurs emoluments and activities of a hen farm  if you ask me to pity orion i can do that i can do it every day and all day long but one cant encourage quicksilver because the instant you put your finger on it it isnt there no i am saying too muchhe does stick to his literary and legal aspirations and he naturally would select the very two things which he is wholly and preposterously unfitted for if i ever become able i mean to put orion on a regular pension without revealing the fact that it is a pension that is best for him let him consider it a periodical loan and pay interest out of the principal within a years time he would be looking upon himself as a benefactor of mine in the way of furnishing me a good permanent investment for money and that would make him happy and satisfied with himself if he had money he would share with me in a moment and i have no disposition to be stingy with him                                     affly                                         sam  livy sends love        the new orleans plan was not wholly dead at this time  howells      wrote near the end of january that the matter was still being      debated now and then but was far from being decided upon  he      hoped to go somewhere with mrs howells for a brief time in march      he said  clemens in haste replied                             \ to w d howells in boston                                               hartford jan  26 1875  my dear howellswhen mrs clemens read your letter she said well then wherever they go in march the direction will be southward and so they must give us a visit on the way i do not know what sort of control you may be under but when my wife speaks as positively as that i am not in the habit of talking back and getting into trouble situated as i am i would not be able to understand now how you could pass by this town without feeling that you were running a wanton risk and doing a daredevil thing i consider it settled that you are to come in march and i would be sincerely sorry to learn that you and mrs howells feel differently about it  the piloting material has been uncovering itself by degrees until it has exposed such a huge hoard to my view that a whole book will be required to contain it if i use it so i have agreed to write the book for blissthe book idea was later given up for the time beingi wont be able to run the articles in the atlantic later than the september number for the reason that a subscription book issued in the fall has a much larger sale than if issued at any other season of the year it is funny when i reflect that when i originally wrote you and proposed to do from 6 to 9 articles for the magazine the vague thought in my mind was that 6 might exhaust the material and 9 would be pretty sure to do it or rather it seems to me that that was my thoughtcant tell at this distance but in truth 9 chapters dont now seem to more than open up the subject fairly and start the yarn to wagging  i have been sick abed several days for the first time in 21 years how little confirmed invalids appreciate their advantages i was able to read the english edition of the greville memoirs through without interruption take my meals in bed neglect all business without a pang and smoke 18 cigars a day i try not to look back upon these 21 years with a feeling of resentment and yet the partialities of providence do seem to me to be slathered around as one may say without that gravity and attention to detail which the real importance of the matter would seem to suggest                                yrs ever                                         mark        the new orleans idea continued to haunt the letters  the thought of      drifting down the mississippi so attracted both clemens and howells      that they talked of it when they met and wrote of it when they were      separated  howells beset by uncertainties playfully tried to put      the responsibility upon his wife  once he wrote she says in the      noblest way well go to new orleans if you want to so much you      know the tone  i suppose it will do if i let you know about the      middle of february       but they had to give it up in the end  howells wrote that he had      been under the weather and on half work the whole winter  he did      not feel that he had earned his salary he said or that he was      warranted in taking a three weeks pleasure trip  clemens offered      to pay all the expenses of the trip but only indefinite      postponement followed  it would be seven years more before mark      twain would return to the river and then not with howells       in a former chapter mention has been made of charles warren      stoddard whom mark twain had known in his california days  he was      fond of stoddard who was a facile and pleasing writer of poems and      descriptive articles  during the period that he had been acting as      mark twains secretary in london he had taken pleasure in      collecting for him the news reports of the celebrated tichborn      claimant case then in the english courts  clemens thought of      founding a story on it and did in fact use the idea though the      american claimant which he wrote years later had little or no      connection with the tichborn episode       to c w stoddard                                          hartford feb 1 1875  dear charleyall right about the tichborn scrapbooks send them along when convenient i mean to have the beechertilton trial scrapbook as a companion  i am writing a series of 7page articles for the atlantic at 20 a page but as they do not pay anybody else as much as that i do not complain though at the same time i do swear that i am not content however the awful respectability of the magazine makes up  i have cut your articles about san marco out of a new york paper joe twichell saw it and brought it home to me with loud admiration and sent it to howells it is too bad to fool away such good literature in a perishable daily journal  do remember us kindly to lady hardy and all that rare familymy wife and i so often have pleasant talks about them                           ever your friend                                    saml l clemens        the price received by mark twain for the mississippi papers as      quoted in this letter furnishes us with a realizing sense of the      improvement in the literary market with the advent of a flood of      cheap magazines and the sunday newspaper  the atlantic page      probably contained about a thousand words which would make his      price average say two cents per word  thirty years later when      his fame was not much more extended his pay for the same matter      would have been fifteen times as great that is to say at the rate      of thirty cents per word  but in that early time there were no      sunday magazinesno literary magazines at all except the atlantic      and harpers and a few fashion periodicals  probably there were      newsstands but it is hard to imagine what they must have looked      like without the gay pictorial coverfemininity that today pleases      and elevates the public and makes author and artist affluent       clemens worked steadily on the river chapters and howells was      always praising him and urging him to go on  at the end of january      he wrote youre doing the science of piloting splendidly  every      words interesting  and dont you drop the series til youve got      every bit of anecdote and reminiscence into it      to w d howells in boston                                          hartford feb 10 1875  my dear howellsyour praises of my literature gave me the solidest gratification but i never did have the fullest confidence in my critical penetration and now your verdict on s has knocked what little i did have gullywest i didnt enjoy his gush but i thought a lot of his similes were ever so vivid and good but its just my luck every time i go into convulsions of admiration over a picture and want to buy it right away before ive lost the chance some wretch who really understands art comes along and damns it but i dont mind i would rather have my ignorance than another mans knowledge because i have got so much more of it  i send you no 5 today i have written and rewritten the first half of it three different times yesterday and today and at last mrs clemens says it will do i never saw a woman so hard to please about things she doesnt know anything about                                yours ever                                         mark        of course the reference to his wifes criticism in this is tenderly      playful as alwaysof a pattern with the severity which he pretends      for her in the next       to mrs w d howells in boston                                                              1875  dear mrs howellsmrs clemens is delighted to get the pictures and so am i i can perceive in the group that mr howells is feeling as i so often feel viz well no doubt i am in the wrong though i do not know how or where or whybut anyway it will be safest to look meek and walk circumspectly for a while and not discuss the thing and you look exactly as mrs clemens does after she has said indeed i do not wonder that you can frame no reply for you know only too well that your conduct admits of no excuse palliation or argumentnone  i shall just delight in that group on account of the good old human domestic spirit that pervades itbother these family groups that put on a state aspect to get their pictures taken in  we want a heliotype made of our eldest daughter how soft and rich and lovely the picture is mr howells must tell me how to proceed in the matter                      truly yours                          sam l clemens        in the next letter we have a picture of susythis spelling of the      name was adopted somewhat later and much preferred  it appears as      susie in most of the earlier lettersclemenss third birthday      certainly a pretty picture and as sweet and luminous and tender      today as it was forty years agoas it will be a hundred years hence      if these lines should survive that long  the letter is to her uncle      charles langdon the charlie of the quaker city  atwater was      associated with the langdon coal interests in elmira  the play      is of course the gilded age       to charles langdon in elmira                                                    mch 19 1875  dear charlielivy after reading your letter used her severest form of expression about mr atwaterto wit she did not approve of his conduct this made me shudder for it was equivalent to allie spauldings saying mr atwater is a mean thing or rev thomas beechers saying damn that atwater or my saying i wish atwater was three hundred million miles in  however livy does not often get into one of these furies god be thanked  in brooklyn baltimore washington cincinnati st louis and chicago the play paid me an average of nine hundred dollars a week in smaller towns the average is 400 to 500  this is susies birthday lizzie brought her in at 830 this morning before we were up hooded with a blanket red curlpapers in her hair a great red japonica in one hand for livy and a yellow rosebud nestled in violets for my buttonhole in the otherand she looked wonderfully pretty she delivered her memorials and received her birthday kisses livy laid her japonica down to get a better holt for kissingwhich susie presently perceived and became thoughtful then said sorrowfully turning the great deeps of her eyes upon her mother dont you care for you wow  right after breakfast we got up a rousing wood fire in the main hall it is a cold morning illuminated the place with a rich glow from all the globes of the newell chandelier spread a bright rug before the fire set a circling row of chairs pink ones and dovecolored and in the midst a low invalidtable covered with a fanciful cloth and laden with the presentsa pink azalia in lavish bloom from rosa a gold inscribed russialeather bible from patrick and mary a gold ring inscribed from maggy cook a silver thimble inscribed with motto and initials from lizzie a rattling mob of sunday clad dolls from livy and annie and a noahs ark from me containing 200 wooden animals such as only a human being could create and only god call by name without referring to the passenger list then the family and the seven servants assembled there and susie and the bay arrived in state from above the bays head being fearfully and wonderfully decorated with a profusion of blazing red flowers and overflowing cataracts of lycopodium wee congratulatory notes accompanied the presents of the servants i tell you it was a great occasion and a striking and cheery group taking all the surroundings into account and the wintry aspect outside  remainder missing        there was to be a centennial celebration that year of the battles of      lexington and concord and howells wrote urging clemens and his      wife to visit them and attend it  mrs clemens did not go and      clemens and howells did not go eitherto the celebration  they      had their own ideas about getting there but found themselves unable      to board the thronged train at concord and went tramping about in      the cold and mud hunting a conveyance only to return at length to      the cheer of the home defeated and rather low in spirits       twichell who went on his own hook had no such difficulties  to      howells mark twain wrote the adventures of this athletic and      strenuous exponent of the gospel       the winnie mentioned in this letter was howellss daughter      winifred  she had unusual gifts but did not live to develop them       to w d howells in boston                           farmington avenue hartford  apl 23 1875  my dear howellsive got mrs clemenss picture before me and hope i shall not forget to send it with this  joe twichell preached morning and evening here last sunday took midnight train for boston got an early breakfast and started by rail at 730 a m for concord swelled around there until 1 p m seeing everything then traveled on top of a train to lexington saw everything there traveled on top of a train to boston with hundreds in company deluged with dust smoke and cinders yelled and hurrahed all the way like a schoolboy lay flat down to dodge numerous bridges and sailed into the depot howling with excitement and as black as a chimneysweep got to youngs hotel at 7 p m sat down in readingroom and immediately fell asleep was promptly awakened by a porter who supposed he was drunk wandered around an hour and a half then took 9 p m train sat down in smoking car and remembered nothing more until awakened by conductor as the train came into hartford at 130 a m thinks he had simply a glorious timeand wouldnt have missed the centennial for the world he would have run out to see us a moment at cambridge but was too dirty i wouldnt have wanted him therehis appalling energy would have been an insufferable reproach to mild adventurers like you and me  well he is welcome to the good time he hadi had a deal better one my narrative has made mrs clemens wish she could have been therewhen i think over what a splendid good sociable time i had in your house i feel ever so thankful to the wise providence that thwarted our several ablyplanned and ingenious attempts to get to lexington i am coming again before long and then she shall be of the party  now you said that you and mrs howells could run down here nearly any saturday very well then let us call it next saturday for a starter can you do that by that time it will really be spring and you wont freeze the birds are already out a small one paid us a visit yesterday we entertained it and let it go again susie protesting  the spring laziness is already upon meinsomuch that the spirit begins to move me to cease from mississippi articles and everything else and give myself over to idleness until we go to new orleans i have one article already finished but somehow it doesnt seem as proper a chapter to close with as the one already in your hands i hope to get in a mood and rattle off a good one to finish withbut just now all my moods are lazy ones  winnies literature sings through me yet surely that child has one of these futures before her  now try to comewill you  with the warmest regards of the two of us                           yrs ever                               s l clemens  mrs clemens sent a note to mrs howells which will serve as a pendant to the foregoing       from mrs clemens to mrs howells in boston  my dear mrs howellsdont dream for one instant that my not getting a letter from you kept me from boston i am too anxious to go to let such a thing as that keep me  mr clemens did have such a good time with you and mr howells he evidently has no regret that he did not get to the centennial i was driven nearly distracted by his long account of mr howells and his wanderings i would keep asking if they ever got there he would never answer but made me listen to a very minute account of everything that they did at last i found them back where they started from  if you find misspelled words in this note you will remember my infirmity and not hold me responsible                           affectionately yours                                          livy l clemens        in spite of his success with the sellers play and his itch      to follow it up mark twain realized what he believed to be      his literary limitations all his life he was inclined to      consider himself wanting in the finer gifts of character      shading and delicate portrayal  remembering huck finn and      the rare presentation of joan of arc we may not altogether      agree with him  certainly he was never qualified to      delineate those fine artificialities of life which we are      likely to associate with culture and perhaps it was      something of this sort that caused the hesitation confessed      in the letter that follows  whether the plan suggested      interested howells or not we do not know  in later years      howells wrote a novel called the story of a play this may      have been its beginning       to w d howells in boston                           farmington avenue hartford apl 26 1875  my dear howellsan actor named d h harkins has been here to ask me to put upon paper a 5act play which he has been mapping out in his mind for 3 or 4 years he sat down and told me his plot all through in a clear bright way and i was a deal taken with it but it is a line of characters whose fine shading and artistic development requires an abler hand than mine so i easily perceived that i must not make the attempt but i liked the man and thought there was a good deal of stuff in him and therefore i wanted his play to be written and by a capable hand too so i suggested you and said i would write and see if you would be willing to undertake it if you like the idea he will call upon you in the course of two or three weeks and describe his plot and his characters then if it doesnt strike you favorably of course you can simply decline but it seems to me well worth while that you should hear what he has to say you could also average him while he talks and judge whether he could play your priestthough i doubt if any man can do that justice  shant i write him and say he may call if you wish to communicate directly with him instead his address is larchmont manor westchester co n y  do you know the chill of that 19th of april seems to be in my bones yet i am inert and drowsy all the time that was villainous weather for a couple of wandering children to be out in                                          ys ever                                                   mark        the sinister typewriter did not find its way to howells for nearly a      year  meantime mark twain had refused to allow the manufacturers      to advertise his ownership  he wrote to them                                           hartford march 19 1875  please do not use my name in any way please do not even divulge the fact that i own a machine i have entirely stopped using the typewriter for the reason that i never could write a letter with it to anybody without receiving a request by return mail that i would not only describe the machine but state what progress i had made in the use of it etc etc i dont like to write letters and so i dont want people to know i own this curiositybreeding little joker        three months later the machine was still in his possession  bliss      had traded a twelvedollar saddle for it but apparently showed      little enthusiasm in his new possession       to w d howells in boston                                                    june 25 1875  my dear howellsi told patrick to get some carpenters and box the machine and send it to youand found that bliss had sent for the machine and earned it off  i have been talking to you and writing to you as if you were present when i traded the machine to bliss for a twelvedollar saddle worth 25 cheating him outrageously of coursebut conscience got the upper hand again and i told him before i left the premises that id pay for the saddle if he didnt like the machineon condition that he donate said machine to a charity  this was a little over five weeks agoso i had long ago concluded that bliss didnt want the machine and did want the saddlewherefore i jumped at the chance of shoving the machine off onto you saddle or no saddle so i got the blamed thing out of my sight  the saddle hangs on taras walls down below in the stable and the machine is at blisss grimly pursuing its appointed mission slowly and implacably rotting away another mans chances for salvation  i have sent bliss word not to donate it to a charity though it is a pity to fool away a chance to do a charity an ill turn but to let me know when he has got his dose because ive got another candidate for damnation you just wait a couple of weeks and if you dont see the typewriter come tilting along toward cambridge with an unsatisfied appetite in its eye i lose my guess  dont you be mad about this blunder howellsit only comes of a bad memory and the stupidity which is inseparable from true genius nothing intentionally criminal in it                                yrs ever                                         mark        it was november when howells finally fell under the baleful      influence of the machine  he wrote       the typewriter came wednesday night and is already beginning to      have its effect on me  of course it doesnt work if i can      persuade some of the letters to get up against the ribbon they wont      get down again without digital assistance  the treadle refuses to      have any part or parcel in the performance and i dont know how to      get the roller to turn with the paper  nevertheless i have begun      several letters to my dar lemans as it prefers to spell your      respected name and i dont despair yet of sending you something in      its beautiful handwritingafter ive had a man out from the agents      to put it in order  its fascinating in the meantime and it wastes      my time like an old friend       the clemens family remained in hartford that summer with the      exception of a brief season at batemans point r i near      newport  by this time mark twain had taken up and finished the tom      sawyer story begun two years before  naturally he wished howells to      consider the ms       to w d howells in boston                                               hartford july 5th 1875  my dear howellsi have finished the story and didnt take the chap beyond boyhood i believe it would be fatal to do it in any shape but autobiographicallylike gil blas i perhaps made a mistake in not writing it in the first person if i went on now and took him into manhood he would just like like all the onehorse men in literature and the reader would conceive a hearty contempt for him it is not a boys book at all it will only be read by adults it is only written for adults  moreover the book is plenty long enough as it stands it is about 900 pages of ms and may be 1000 when i shall have finished working up vague places so it would make from 130 to 150 pages of the atlanticabout what the foregone conclusion made isnt it  i would dearly like to see it in the atlantic but i doubt if it would pay the publishers to buy the privilege or me to sell it bret harte has sold his novel same size as mine i should say to scribners monthly for 6500 publication to begin in september i think and he gets a royalty of 7 12 per cent from bliss in book form afterwards he gets a royalty of ten per cent on it in england issued in serial numbers and the same royalty on it in book form afterwards and is to receive an advance payment of five hundred pounds the day the first no of the serial appears if i could do as well here and there with mine it might possibly pay me but i seriously doubt it though it is likely i could do better in england than bret who is not widely known there  you see i take a vile mercenary view of thingsbut then my household expenses are something almost ghastly  by and by i shall take a boy of twelve and run him on through life in the first person but not tom sawyerhe would not be a good character for it  i wish you would promise to read the ms of tom sawyer some time and see if you dont really decide that i am right in closing with him as a boyand point out the most glaring defects for me it is a tremendous favor to ask and i expect you to refuse and would be ashamed to expect you to do otherwise but the thing has been so many months in my mind that it seems a relief to snake it out i dont know any other person whose judgment i could venture to take fully and entirely dont hesitate about saying no for i know how your time is taxed and i would have honest need to blush if you said yes  osgood and i are going for the puppy g on infringement of trademark to win one or two suits of this kind will set literary folks on a firmer bottom i wish osgood would sue for stealing holmess poem wouldnt it be gorgeous to sue r for petty larceny i will promise to go into court and swear i think him capable of stealing peanuts from a blind pedlar                           yrs ever                                    clemens        of course howells promptly replied that he would read the story      adding youve no idea what i may ask you to do for me some day      im sorry that you cant do it for the atlantic but i      succumb perhaps you will do boy no 2 for us  clemens      consciencestricken meantime hastily put the ms out of reach      of temptation       to w d howells in boston                                                    july 13 1875  my dear howellsjust as soon as you consented i realized all the atrocity of my request and straightway blushed and weakened i telegraphed my theatrical agent to come here and carry off the ms and copy it  but i will gladly send it to you if you will do as follows dramatize it if you perceive that you can and take for your remuneration half of the first 6000 which i receive for its representation on the stage you could alter the plot entirely if you chose i could help in the work most cheerfully after you had arranged the plot i have my eye upon two young girls who can play tom and huck i believe a good deal of a drama can be made of it comecant you tackle this in the odd hours of your vacation or later if you prefer  i do wish you could come down once more before your holiday id give anything                      yrs ever                               mark       howells wrote that he had no time for the dramatization and      urged clemens to undertake it himself  he was ready to read      the story whenever it should arrive  clemens did not      hurry however the publication of tom sawyer could wait      he already had a book in pressthe volume of sketches new      and old which he had prepared for bliss several years      before       sketches was issued that autumn and howells gave it a good      noticepossibly better than it deserved       considered among mark twains books today the collection      of sketches does not seem especially important  with the      exception of the frog story and the true story most of      those includedmight be spared  clemens himself confessed      to howells that he wished when it was too late that he had      destroyed a number of them  the book however was      distinguished in a special way it contains mark twains      first utterance in print on the subject of copyright a      matter in which he never again lost interest the absurdity      and injustice of the copyright laws both amused and      irritated him and in the course of time he would be largely      instrumental in their improvement  in the book his open      petition to congress that all property rights as well as      literary ownership should be put on the copyright basis and      limited to a beneficent term of fortytwo years was more      or less of a joke but like so many of mark twains jokes      it was founded on reason and justice       he had another idea that was not a joke an early plan in      the direction of international copyright  it was to be a      petition signed by the leading american authors asking the      united states to declare itself to be the first to stand for      right and justice by enacting laws against the piracy of      foreign books  it was a rather utopian scheme as most      schemes for moral progress are in their beginning  it      would not be likely ever to reach congress but it would      appeal to howells and his cambridge friends  clemens wrote      outlining his plan of action       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford sept 18 1875  my dear howellsmy plan is thisyou are to get mr lowell and mr longfellow to be the first signers of my copyright petition you must sign it yourself and get mr whittier to do likewise then holmes will signhe said he would if he didnt have to stand at the head then im fixed i will then put a gentlemanly chap under wages and send him personally to every author of distinction in the country and corral the rest of the signatures then ill have the whole thing lithographed about a thousand copies and move upon the president and congress in person but in the subordinate capacity of a party who is merely the agent of better and wiser menmen whom the country cannot venture to laugh at  i will ask the president to recommend the thing in his message and if he should ask me to sit down and frame the paragraph for him i should blushbut still i would frame it  next i would get a prime leader in congress i would also see that votes enough to carry the measure were privately secured before the bill was offered this i would try through my leader and my friends there  and then if europe chose to go on stealing from us we would say with noble enthusiasm american lawmakers do steal but not from foreign authorsnot from foreign authors  you see what i want to drive into the congressional mind is the simple fact that the moral law is thou shalt not stealno matter what europe may do  i swear i cant see any use in robbing european authors for the benefit of american booksellers anyway  if we can ever get this thing through congress we can try making copyright perpetual some day there would be no sort of use in it since only one book in a hundred millions outlives the present copyright termno sort of use except that the writer of that one book have his rightswhich is something  if we only had some god in the countrys laws instead of being in such a sweat to get him into the constitution it would be better all around  the only man who ever signed my petition with alacrity and said that the fact that a thing was right was allsufficient was rev dr bushnell  i have lost my old petition which was brief but will draft and enclose anothernot in the words it ought to be but in the substance i want mr lowell to furnish the words and the ideas too if he will do it  sayredpath beseeches me to lecture in boston in novembertelegraphs that beechers and nasts withdrawal has put him in the tightest kind of a place so i guess ill do that old roughing it lecture over again in november and repeat it 2 or 3 times in new york while i am at it  can i take a carriage after the lecture and go out and stay with you that night provided you find at that distant time that it will not inconvenience you is aldrich home yet                                with love to you all                                         yrs ever                                              s l c        of course the petition never reached congress  holmess comment      that governments were not in the habit of setting themselves up as      high moral examples except for revenue was shared by too many      others  the petition was tabled but clemens never abandoned his      purpose and lived to see most of his dream fulfilled  meantime      howellss notice of the sketches appeared in the atlantic and      brought grateful acknowledgment from the author       to w d howells in boston                                     hartford oct 19 1875  my dear howellsthat is a perfectly superb notice you can easily believe that nothing ever gratified me so much before the newspaper praises bestowed upon the innocents abroad were large and generous but somehow i hadnt confidence in the critical judgement of the parties who furnished them you know how that is yourself from reading the newspaper notices of your own books they gratify a body but they always leave a small pang behind in the shape of a fear that the critics good words could not safely be depended upon as authority yours is the recognized critical court of last resort in this country from its decision there is no appeal and so to have gained this decree of yours before i am forty years old i regard as a thing to be right down proud of mrs clemens says tell him i am just as grateful to him as i can be it sounds as if she were grateful to you for heroically trampling the truth under foot in order to praise me but in reality it means that she is grateful to you for being bold enough to utter a truth which she fully believes all competent people know but which none has heretofore been brave enough to utter you see the thing that gravels her is that i am so persistently glorified as a mere buffoon as if that entirely covered my casewhich she denies with venom  the other day mrs clemens was planning a visit to you and so i am waiting with a pleasurable hope for the result of her deliberations we are expecting visitors every day now from new york and afterward some are to come from elmira i judge that we shall then be free to go bostonward i should be just delighted because we could visit in comfort since we shouldnt have to do any shoppingdid it all in new york last week and a tremendous pull it was too  mrs c said the other day we will go to cambridge if we have to walk for i dont believe we can ever get the howellses to come here again until we have been there i was gratified to see that there was one string anyway that could take her to cambridge but i will do her the justice to say that she is always wanting to go to cambridge independent of the selfish desire to get a visit out of you by it i want her to get started now before childrens diseases are fashionable again because they always play such hob with visiting arrangements                                with love to you all                                         yrs ever                                              s l clemens        mark twains trips to boston were usually made alone  women require      more preparation to go visiting and mrs clemens and mrs howells      seem to have exchanged visits infrequently  for mark twain      perhaps it was just as well that his wife did not always go with      him his absentmindedness and boyish ingenuousness often led him      into difficulties which mrs clemens sometimes found embarrassing      in the foregoing letter they were planning a visit to cambridge  in      the one that follows they seem to have made itwith certain      results perhaps not altogether amusing at the moment      to w d howells in boston                                                    oct 4 75  my dear howellswe had a royal good time at your house and have had a royal good time ever since talking about it both privately and with the neighbors  mrs clemenss bodily strength came up handsomely under that cheery respite from household and nursery cares i do hope that mrs howellss didnt go correspondingly down under the added burden to her cares and responsibilities of course i didnt expect to get through without committing some crimes and hearing of them afterwards so i have taken the inevitable lashings and been able to hum a tune while the punishment went on i caught it for letting mrs howells bother and bother about her coffee when it was a good deal better than we get at home i caught it for interrupting mrs c at the last moment and losing her the opportunity to urge you not to forget to send her that ms when the printers are done with it i caught it once more for personating that drunken col james i caught it for mentioning that mr longfellows picture was slightly damaged and when after a lull in the storm i confessed shamefacedly that i had privately suggested to you that we hadnt any frames and that if you wouldnt mind hinting to mr houghton c c c the madam was simply speechless for the space of a minute then she said  how could you youth the idea of sending mr howells with his sensitive nature upon such a repulsive er  oh howells wont mind it you dont know howells howells is a man who she was gone but george was the first person she stumbled on in the hall so she took it out of george i was glad of that because it saved the babies  ive got another rattling good character for my novel that great work is mulling itself into shape gradually  mrs clemens sends love to mrs howellsmeantime she is diligently laying up material for a letter to her                                                                      yrs ever                                         mark        the george of this letter was mark twains colored butler a      valued and even beloved member of the householda most picturesque      character who one day came to wash windows as clemens used to      say and remained eighteen years  the fiction of mrs clemenss      severity he always found amusing because of its entire contrast      with the reality of her gentle heart       clemens carried the tom sawyer ms to boston himself and placed it      in howellss hands  howells had begged to be allowed to see the      story and mrs clemens was especially anxious that he should do so      she had doubts as to certain portions of it and had the fullest      faith in howellss opinion       it was a gratifying one when it came  howells wrote i finished      reading tom sawyer a week ago sitting up till one am to get to      the end simply because it was impossible to leave off  its      altogether the best boys story i ever read  it will be an immense      success  but i think you ought to treat it explicitly as a boys      story  grownups will enjoy it just as much if you do and if you      should put it forth as a study of boy character from the grownup      point of view you give the wrong key to it  the adventures      are enchanting  i wish i had been on that island  the      treasurehunting the loss in the caveits all exciting and      splendid i shouldnt think of publishing this story serially      give me a hint when its to be out and ill start the sheep to      jumping in the right placesmeaning that he would have an advance      review ready for publication in the atlantic which was a leader of      criticism in america       mark twain was writing a great deal at this time  howells was      always urging him to send something to the atlantic declaring a      willingness to have his name appear every month in their pages and      clemens was generally contributing some story or sketch  the      proof referred to in the next letter was of one of these articles       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford nov 23 75  my dear howellsherewith is the proof in spite of myself how awkwardly i do jumble words together and how often i do use three words where one would answera thing i am always trying to guard against i shall become as slovenly a writer as charles francis adams if i dont look out that is said in jest because of course i do not seriously fear getting so bad as that i never shall drop so far toward his and bret hartes level as to catch myself saying it must have been wiser to have believed that he might have accomplished it if he could have felt that he would have been supported by those who should have c c c the reference to bret harte reminds me that i often accuse him of being a deliberate imitator of dickens and this in turn reminds me that i have charged unconscious plagiarism upon charley warner and this in turn reminds me that i have been delighting my soul for two weeks over a bran new and ingenious way of beginning a noveland behold all at once it flashes upon me that charley warner originated the idea 3 years ago and told me about it aha so much for selfrighteousness i am well repaid here are 108 pages of ms new and clean lying disgraced in the waste paper basket and i am beginning the novel over again in an unstolen way i would not wonder if i am the worst literary thief in the world without knowing it  it is glorious news that you like tom sawyer so well i mean to see to it that your review of it shall have plenty of time to appear before the other notices mrs clemens decides with you that the book should issue as a book for boys pure and simpleand so do i it is surely the correct idea as to that last chapter i think of just leaving it off and adding nothing in its place something told me that the book was done when i got to that pointand so the strong temptation to put hucks life at the widows into detail instead of generalizing it in a paragraph was resisted just send sawyer to me by expressi enclose money for it if it should get lost it will be no great matter  company interfered last night and so private theatricals goes over till this evening to be read aloud mrs clemens is mad but the story will take that all out this is going to be a splendid winter night for fireside reading anyway  i am almost at a dead standstill with my new story on account of the misery of having to do it all over again weall send love to youall                              yrs ever                                         mark        the story referred to may have been any one of several      begun by him at this time  his head was full of ideas for      literature of every sort many of his beginnings came to      nothing for the reason that he started wrong or with no      definitely formed plan  others of his literary enterprises      were condemned by his wife for their grotesqueness or for      the offense they might give in one way or another however      worthy the intention behind them  once he wrote a burlesque      on family history the autobiography of a damned fool      livy wouldnt have it he said later so i gave it up      the world is indebted to mark twains wife for the check she      put upon his fantastic or violent impulses  she was his      public his best publicclearheaded and wise  that he      realized this and was willing to yield was by no means the      least of his good fortunes we may believe that he did not      always yield easily and perhaps sometimes only out of love      for her  in the letter which he wrote her on her thirtieth      birthday we realize something of what she had come to mean      in his life       to mrs clemens on her thirtieth birthday                                          hartford november 27 1875  livy darling six years have gone by since i made my first great success in life and won you and thirty years have passed since providence made preparation for that happy success by sending you into the world every day we live together adds to the security of my confidence that we can never any more wish to be separated than that we can ever imagine a regret that we were ever joined you are dearer to me today my child than you were upon the last anniversary of this birthday you were dearer then than you were a year beforeyou have grown more and more dear from the first of those anniversaries and i do not doubt that this precious progression will continue on to the end  let us look forward to the coming anniversaries with their age and their gray hairs without fear and without depression trusting and believing that the love we bear each other will be sufficient to make them blessed  so with abounding affection for you and our babies i hail this day that brings you the matronly grace and dignity of three decades                                always yours                                         s l

with bret harte       the monday evening club of hartford was an association of most of      the literary talent of that city and it included a number of very      distinguished members  the writers the editors the lawyers and      the ministers of the gospel who composed it were more often than not      men of national or international distinction  there was but one      paper at each meeting and it was likely to be a paper that would      later find its way into some magazine       naturally mark twain was one of its favorite members and his      contributions never failed to arouse interest and discussion  a      mark twain night brought out every member  in the next letter we      find the first mention of one of his most memorable contributionsa      story of one of lifes moral aspects  the tale now included in his      collected works is for some reason little read today yet the      curious allegory so vivid in its seeming reality is well worth      consideration       to w d howells in boston                                               hartford jan 11 76  my dear howellsindeed we havent forgotten the howellses nor scored up a grudge of any kind against them but the fact is i was under the doctors hands for four weeks on a stretch and have been disabled from working for a week or so beside i thought i was well about ten days ago so i sent for a shorthand writer and dictated answers to a bushel or so of letters that had been accumulating during my illness getting everything shipshape and cleared up i went to work next day upon an atlantic article which ought to be worth 20 per page which is the price they usually pay for my work i believe for although it is only 70 pages ms less than two days work counting by bulk i have spent 3 more days trimming altering and working at it i shall put in one more days polishing on it and then read it before our club which is to meet at our house monday evening the 24th inst i think it will bring out considerable discussion among the gentlemen of the clubthough the title of the article will not give them much notion of what is to followthis title being the facts concerning the recent carnival of crime in connecticutwhich reminds me that todays tribune says there will be a startling article in the current atlantic in which a being which is tangible bud invisible will figureexactly the case with the sketch of mine which i am talking about however mine can lie unpublished a year or two as well as notthough i wish that contributor of yours had not interfered with his coincidence of heroes  but what i am coming at is this wont you and mrs howells come down saturday the 22nd and remain to the club on monday night we always have a rattling good time at the club and we do want you to come ever so much will you now say you will mrs clemens and i are persuading ourselves that you twain will come  my volume of sketches is doing very well considering the times received my quarterly statement today from bliss by which i perceive that 20000 copies have been soldor rather 20000 had been sold 3 weeks ago a lot more by this time no doubt  i am on the sick list againand was day before yesterdaybut on the whole i am getting along                                yrs ever                                         mark        howells wrote that he could not come down to the club meeting      adding that sickness was quite out of character for mark twain      and hardly fair on a man who had made so many other people feel      well  he closed by urging that bliss hurry out tom sawyer      that boy is going to make a prodigious hit  clemens answered       to w d howells in boston                                               hartford jan 18 76  my dear howellsthanks and ever so many for the good opinion of tom sawyer williams has made about 300 rattling pictures for itsome of them very dainty poor devil what a genius he has and how he does murder it with rum he takes a book of mine and without suggestion from anybody builds no end of pictures just from his reading of it  there was never a man in the world so grateful to another as i was to you day before yesterday when i sat down in still rather wretched health to set myself to the dreary and hateful task of making final revision of tom sawyer and discovered upon opening the package of ms that your pencil marks were scattered all along this was splendid and swept away all labor instead of reading the ms i simply hunted out the pencil marks and made the emendations which they suggested i reduced the boy battle to a curt paragraph i finally concluded to cut the sunday school speech down to the first two sentences leaving no suggestion of satire since the book is to be for boys and girls i tamed the various obscenities until i judged that they no longer carried offense so at a single sitting i began and finished a revision which i had supposed would occupy 3 or 4 days and leave me mentally and physically fagged out at the end i was careful not to inflict the ms upon you until i had thoroughly and painstakingly revised it therefore the only faults left were those that would discover themselves to others not meand these you had pointed out  there was one expression which perhaps you overlooked when huck is complaining to tom of the rigorous system in vogue at the widows he says the servants harass him with all manner of compulsory decencies and he winds up by saying and they comb me all to hell no exclamation point long ago when i read that to mrs clemens she made no comment another time i created occasion to read that chapter to her aunt and her mother both sensitive and loyal subjects of the kingdom of heaven so to speak and they let it pass i was glad for it was the most natural remark in the world for that boy to make and he had been allowed few privileges of speech in the book when i saw that you too had let it go without protest i was glad and afraid tooafraid you hadnt observed it did you and did you question the propriety of it since the book is now professedly and confessedly a boys and girls hook that darn word bothers me some nights but it never did until i had ceased to regard the volume as being for adults  dont bother to answer now for youve writing enough to do without allowing me to add to the burden but tell me when you see me again  which we do hope will be next saturday or sunday or monday couldnt you come now and mull over the alterations which you are going to make in your ms and make them after you go back wouldnt it assist the work if you dropped out of harness and routine for a day or two and have that sort of revivification which comes of a holidayforgetfulness of the workshop i can always work after ive been to your house and if you will come to mine now and hear the club toot their various horns over the exasperating metaphysical question which i mean to lay before them in the disguise of a literary extravaganza it would just brace you up like a cordial  i feel sort of mean trying to persuade a man to put down a critical piece of work at a critical time but yet i am honest in thinking it would not hurt the work nor impair your interest in it to come under the circumstances mrs clemens says maybe the howellses could come monday if they cannot come saturday ask them it is worth trying well hows that could you it would be splendid if you could drop me a postal cardi should have a twinge of conscience if i forced you to write a letter i am honest about thatand if you find you cant make out to come tell me that you bodies will come the next saturday if the thing is possible and stay over sunday                                     yrs ever                                              mark        howells however did not come to the club meeting but promised to      come soon when they could have a quiet time to themselves together      as to hucks language he declared       id have that swearing out in an instant  i suppose i didnt      notice it because the locution was so familiar to my western sense      and so exactly the thing that huck would say  clemens changed the      phrase to they comb me all to thunder and so it stands today       the carnival of crime having served its purpose at the club      found quick acceptance by howells for the atlantic  he was so      pleased with it in fact that somewhat later he wrote urging that      its author allow it to be printed in a dainty book by osgood who      made a specialty of fine publishing  meantime howells had written      his atlantic notice of tom sawyer and now inclosed clemens a proof      of it  we may judge from the reply that it was satisfactory       to w d howells in boston                                                    apl 3 76  my dear howellsit is a splendid notice and will embolden weakkneed journalistic admirers to speak out and will modify or shut up the unfriendly to fear god and dread the sunday school exactly described that old feeling which i used to have but i couldnt have formulated it i want to enclose one of the illustrations in this letter if i do not forget it of course the book is to be elaborately illustrated and i think that many of the pictures are considerably above the american average in conception if not in execution  i do not reenclose your review to you for you have evidently read and corrected it and so i judge you do not need it about two days after the atlantic issues i mean to begin to send books to principal journals and magazines  i read the carnival of crime proof in new york when worn and witless and so left some things unamended which i might possibly have altered had i been at home for instance i shall always address you in your own sniveling drawl baby i saw that you objected to something there but i did not understand what was it that it was too personal should the language be alteredor the hyphens taken out wont you please fix it the way it ought to be altering the language as you choose only making it bitter and contemptuous  deuced was not strong enough so i met you halfway with devilish  mrs clemens has returned from new york with dreadful sore throat and bones racked with rheumatism she keeps her bed aloha nui as the kanakas say                         mark        henry irving once said to mark twain you made a mistake by not      adopting the stage as a profession  you would have made even a      greater actor than a writer       mark twain would have made an actor certainly but not a very      tractable one  his appearance in hartford in the loan of a lover      was a distinguished event and his success complete though he made      so many extemporaneous improvements on the lines of thickheaded      peter spuyk that he kept the other actors guessing as to their      cues and nearly broke up the performance  it was of course an      amateur benefit though augustin daly promptly wrote offering to      put it on for a long run       the skeleton novelette mentioned in the next letter refers to a      plan concocted by howells and clemens by which each of twelve      authors was to write a story using the same plot blindfolded as      to what the others had written  it was a regular mark twain      notion and it is hard today to imagine howellss continued      enthusiasm in it  neither he nor clemens gave up the idea for a      long time  it appears in their letters again and again though      perhaps it was just as well for literature that it was never carried      out       to w d howells in boston                                               apl  22 1876  my dear howells youll see per enclosed slip that i appear for the first time on the stage next wednesday you and mrs h come down and you shall skip in free  i wrote my skeleton novelette yesterday and today it will make a little under 12 pages  please tell aldrich ive got a photographer engaged and triweekly issue is about to begin show him the canvassing specimens and beseech him to subscribe                      ever yours                               s l c        in his next letter mark twain explains why tom sawyer is not to      appear as soon as planned  the reference to the literary      nightmare refers to the punch conductor punch with care sketch      which had recently appeared in the atlantic  many other versifiers      had had their turn at horsecar poetry and now a publisher was      anxious to collect it in a book provided he could use the atlantic      sketch  clemens does not tell us here the nature of carltons      insult forgiveness of which he was not yet qualified to grant but      there are at least two stories about it or two halves of the same      incident as related afterward by clemens and canton  clemens said      that when he took the jumping frog book to carlton in 1867 the      latter pointing to his stock said rather scornfully books      i dont want your book my shelves are full of books now though      the reader may remember that it was carlton himself who had given      the frog story to the saturday press and had seen it become famous      carltons half of the story was that he did not accept mark twains      book because the author looked so disreputable  long afterward      when the two men met in europe the publisher said to the now rich      and famous author mr clemens my one claim on immortality is that      i declined your first book       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford apl 25 1876  my dear howellsthanks for giving me the place of honor  bliss made a failure in the matter of getting tom sawyer ready on timethe engravers assisting as usual i went down to see how much of a delay there was going to be and found that the man had not even put a canvasser on or issued an advertisement yetin fact that the electrotypes would not all be done for a month but of course the main fact was that no canvassing had been donebecause a subscription harvest is before publication not after when people have discovered how bad ones book is  well yesterday i put in the courant an editorial paragraph stating that tam sawyer is ready to issue but publication is put off in order to secure english copyright by simultaneous publication there and here the english edition is unavoidably delayed  you see part of that is true very well when i observed that my sketches had dropped from a sale of 6 or 7000 a month down to 1200 a month i said this aint no time to be publishing books therefore let tom lie still till autumn mr bliss and make a holiday book of him to beguile the young people withal  i shall print items occasionally still further delaying tom till i ease him down to autumn without shock to the waiting world  as to that literary nightmare proposition im obliged to withhold consent for what seems a good reasonto wit a single page of horsecar poetry is all that the average reader can stand without nausea now to stack together all of it that has been written and then add it to my article would be to enrage and disgust each and every reader and win the deathless enmity of the lot  even if that reason were insufficient there would still be a sufficient reason left in the fact that mr carlton seems to be the publisher of the magazine in which it is proposed to publish this horsecar matter carlton insulted me in feb 1867 and so when the day arrives that sees me doing him a civility i shall feel that i am ready for paradise since my list of possible and impossible forgivenesses will then be complete  mrs clemens says my version of the blindfold novelette a murder and a marriage is good pretty strong languagefor her  the fieldses are coming down to the play tomorrow and they promise to get you and mrs howells to come too but i hope youll do nothing of the kind if it will inconvenience you for im not going to play either strikingly bad enough or well enough to make the journey pay you  my wife and i think of going to boston may 7th to see anna dickinsons debut on the 8th if i find we can go ill try to get a stage box and then you and mrs howells must come to parkers and go with us to the crucifixion  is that spelt rightsomehow it doesnt look right  with our very kindest regards to the whole family                                     yrs ever                                         mark        the mention of anna dickinson at the end of this letter recalls a      prominent reformer and lecturer of the civil war period  she had      begun her crusades against temperance and slavery in 1857 when she      was but fifteen years old when her success as a speaker had been      immediate and extraordinary  now in this later period at the age      of thirtyfour she aspired to the stageunfortunately for her as      her gifts lay elsewhere  clemens and howells knew miss dickinson      and were anxious for the success which they hardly dared hope for      clemens arranged a box party       to w d howells in boston                                                         may 4 76  my dear howellsi shall reach boston on monday the 8th either at 430 pm or 6 pm which is best and go straight to parkers if you and mrs howells cannot be there by half past 4 ill not plan to arrive till the later traintime 6 because i dont want to be there aloneeven a minute still joe twichell will doubtless go with me forgot that he is going to try hard to mrs clemens has given up going because susy is just recovering from about the savagest assault of diphtheria a child ever did recover from and therefore will not be entirely her healthy self again by the 8th  would you and mrs howells like to invite mr and mrs aldrich i have a large proscenium boxplenty of room use your own pleasure about iti mainly that is honest suggest it because i am seeking to make matters pleasant for you and mrs howells i invited twichell because i thought i knew youd like that i want you to fix it so that you and the madam can remain in boston all night for i leave next day and we cant have a talk otherwise i am going to get two rooms and a parlor and would like to know what you decide about the aldriches so as to know whether to apply for an additional bedroom or not  dont dine that evening for i shall arrive dinnerless and need your help  ill bring my blindfold novelette but shant exhibit it unless you exhibit yours you would simply go to work and write a novelette that would make mine sick because you would know all about where my weak points lay no sir im one of these old wary birds  dont bother to write a letter3 lines on a postal card is all that i can permit from a busy man                         yrs ever                                    mark  p s good youll not have to feel any call to mention that debut in the atlantictheyve made me pay the grand cash for my boxa thing which most managers would be too worldlywise to do with journalistic folks but im most honestly glad for id rather pay three prices any time than to have my tongue half paralyzed with a deadhead ticket  hang that anna dickinson a body can never depend upon her debuts she has made five or six false starts already if she fails to debut this time i will never bet on her again        in his book my mark twain howells refers to the tragedy of miss      dickinsons appearance  she was the author of numerous plays some      of which were successful but her career as an actress was never      brilliant       at elmira that summer the clemenses heard from their good friend      doctor brown of edinburgh and sent eager replies      to dr john brown in edinburgh                                elmira new york u s june 22 1876  dear friend the doctorit was a perfect delight to see the wellknown handwriting again but we so grieve to know that you are feeling miserable it must not lastit cannot last the regal summer is come and it will smile you into high good cheer it will charm away your pains it will banish your distresses i wish you were here to spend the summer with us we are perched on a hilltop that overlooks a little world of green valleys shining rivers sumptuous forests and billowy uplands veiled in the haze of distance we have no neighbors it is the quietest of all quiet places and we are hermits that eschew caves and live in the sun doctor if youd only come  i will carry your letter to mrs c now and there will be a glad woman i tell you and she shall find one of those pictures to put in this for mrs barclays and if there isnt one here well send right away to hartford and get one come over doctor john and bring the barclays the nicolsons and the browns one and all                           affectionately                                         saml l clemens        from may until august no letters appear to have passed between      clemens and howells the latter finally wrote complaining of the      lack of news  he was in the midst of campaign activities he said      writing a life of hayes and gaily added you know i wrote the life      of lincoln which elected him  he further reported a comedy he had      completed and gave clemens a general stirring up as to his own      work       mark twain in his hillside study was busy enough  summer was his      time for work and he had tried his hand in various directions  his      mention of huck finn in his reply to howells is interesting in that      it shows the measure of his enthusiasm or lack of it as a gauge of      his ultimate achievement       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira aug 9 1876  my dear howellsi was just about to write you when your letter cameand not one of those obscene postal cards either but reverently upon paper  i shall read that biography though the letter of acceptance was amply sufficient to corral my vote without any further knowledge of the man which reminds me that a campaign club in jersey city wrote a few days ago and invited me to be present at the raising of a tilden and hendricks flag there and to take the stand and give them some counsel well i could not go but gave them counsel and advice by letter and in the kindliest terms as to the raising of the flagadvised them not to raise it  get your book out quick for this is a momentous time if tilden is elected i think the entire country will go pretty straight tomrs howellss bad place  i am infringing on your patenti started a record of our childrens sayings last night which reminds me that last week i sent down and got susie a vast pair of shoes of a most villainous pattern for i discovered that her feet were being twisted and cramped out of shape by a smaller and prettier article she did not complain but looked degraded and injured at night her mamma gave her the usual admonition when she was about to say her prayersto wit  now susiethink about god  mamma i cant with those shoes  the farm is perfectly delightful this season it is as quiet and peaceful as a south sea island some of the sunsets which we have witnessed from this commanding eminence were marvelous one evening a rainbow spanned an entire range of hills with its mighty arch and from a black hub resting upon the hilltop in the exact centre black rays diverged upward in perfect regularity to the rainbows arch and created a very strongly defined and altogether the most majestic magnificent and startling halfsunk wagon wheel you can imagine after that a world of tumbling and prodigious clouds came drifting up out of the west and took to themselves a wonderfully rich and brilliant green colorthe decided green of new spring foliage close by them we saw the intense blue of the skies through rents in the cloudrack and away off in another quarter were drifting clouds of a delicate pink color in one place hung a pall of dense black clouds like compacted pitchsmoke and the stupendous wagon wheel was still in the supremacy of its unspeakable grandeur so you see the colors present in the sky at once and the same time were blue green pink black and the varicolored splendors of the rainbow all strong and decided colors too i dont know whether this weird and astounding spectacle most suggested heaven or hell the wonder with its constant stately and always surprising changes lasted upwards of two hours and we all stood on the top of the hill by my study till the final miracle was complete and the greatest day ended that we ever saw  our farmer who is a grave man watched that spectacle to the end and then observed that it was dam funny  the doublebarreled novel lies torpid i found i could not go on with it the chapters i had written were still too new and familiar to me i may take it up next winter but cannot tell yet i waited and waited to see if my interest in it would not revive but gave it up a month ago and began another boys bookmore to be at work than anything else i have written 400 pages on ittherefore it is very nearly half done it is huck finns autobiography i like it only tolerably well as far as i have got and may possibly pigeonhole or burn the ms when it is done  so the comedy is done and with a fair degree of satisfaction that rejoices me and makes me mad toofor i cant plan a comedy and what have you done that god should be so good to you i have racked myself baldheaded trying to plan a comedy harness for some promising characters of mine to work in and had to give it up it is a noble lot of blooded stock and worth no end of money but they must stand in the stable and be profitless i want to be present when the comedy is produced and help enjoy the success  warners book is mighty readable i think                           love to yez                               yrs ever                                              mark        howells promptly wrote again urging him to enter the campaign for      hayes  there is not another man in this country he said who      could help him so much as you  the farce which clemens refers to      in his reply was the parlor car which seems to have been about      the first venture of howells in that field       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira august 23 1876  my dear howellsi am glad you think i could do hayes any good for i have been wanting to write a letter or make a speech to that end ill be careful not to do either however until the opportunity comes in a natural justifiable and unlugged way and shall not then do anything unless ive got it all digested and worded just right in which case i might do some goodin any other i should do harm when a humorist ventures upon the grave concerns of life he must do his job better than another man or he works harm to his cause  the farce is wonderfully bright and delicious and must make a hit you read it to me and it was mighty good i read it last night and it was better i read it aloud to the household this morning and it was better than ever so it would be worth going a long way to see it well played for without any question an actor of genius always adds a subtle something to any mans work that none but the writer knew was there before even if he knew it i have heard of readers convulsing audiences with my aurelias unfortunate young man if there is anything really funny in the piece the author is not aware of it  all rightadvertise me for the new volume i send you herewith a sketch which will make 3 pages of the atlantic if you like it and accept it you should get it into the december no because i shall read it in public in boston the 13th and 14th of nov if it went in a month earlier it would be too old for me to read except as old matter and if it went in a month later it would be too old for the atlanticdo you see and if you wish to use it will you set it up now and send me three proofsone to correct for atlantic one to send to temple bar shall i tell them to use it not earlier than their november no and one to use in practising for my boston readings  we must get up a less elaborate and a much better skeletonplan for the blindfold novels and make a success of that idea david gray spent sunday here and said we could but little comprehend what a rattling stir that thing would make in the country he thought it would make a mighty strike so do i but with only 8 pages to tell the tale in the plot must be less elaborate doubtless what do you think  when we exchange visits ill show you an unfinished sketch of elizabeths time which shook david grays system up pretty exhaustively                                          yrs ever                                                   mark        the ms sketch mentioned in the foregoing letter was the      canvassers tale later included in the volume tom sawyer abroad      and other stories  it is far from being mark twains best work but      was accepted and printed in the atlantic  david gray was an able      journalist and editor whom mark twain had known in buffalo       the sketch of elizabeths time is a brilliant piece of writing      an imaginary record of conversation and court manners in the good      old days of free speech and performance phrased in the language of      the period  gray john hay twichell and others who had a chance      to see it thought highly of it and hay had it set in type and a few      proofs taken for private circulation  some years afterward a west      point officer had a special font of antique type made for it and      printed a hundred copies  but the presentday reader would hardly      be willing to include fireside conversation in the time of queen      elizabeth in mark twains collected works       clemens was a strong republican in those days as his letters of      this period show  his mention of the caves in the next is another      reference to the canvassers tale       to w d howells in boston                                               sept  14 1876  my dear howellsyes the collection of caves was the origin of it i changed it to echoes because these being invisible and intangible constituted a still more absurd species of property and yet a man could really own an echo and sell it too for a high figuresuch an echo as that at the villa siminetti two miles from milan for instance my first purpose was to have the man make a collection of caves and afterwards of echoes but perceived that the element of absurdity and impracticability was so nearly identical as to amount to a repetition of an idea  i will not and do not believe that there is a possibility of hayess defeat but i want the victory to be sweeping  it seems odd to find myself interested in an election i never was before and i cant seem to get over my repugnance to reading or thinking about politics yet but in truth i care little about any partys politicsthe man behind it is the important thing  you may well know that mrs clemens liked the parlor carenjoyed it ever so much and was indignant at you all through and kept exploding into rages at you for pretending that such a woman ever existedclosing each and every explosion with but it is just what such a woman would doit is just what such a woman would say they all voted the parlor car perfectionexcept me i said they wouldnt have been allowed to court and quarrel there so long uninterrupted but at each critical moment the odious trainboy would come in and pile foul literature all over them four or five inches deep and the lover would turn his head aside and curseand presently that trainboy would be back again as on all those western roads to take up the literature and leave prize candy  of course the thing is perfect in the magazine without the trainboy but i was thinking of the stage and the groundlings if the dainty touches went over their heads the trainboy and other possible interruptions would fetch them every time would it mar the flow of the thing too much to insert that devil i thought it over a couple of hours and concluded it wouldnt and that he ought to be in for the sake of the groundlings and to get new copyright on the piece  and it seemed to me that now that the fourth act is so successfully written why not go ahead and write the 3 preceding acts and then after it is finished let me put into it a lowcomedy character the girls or the lovers father or uncle and gobble a big pecuniary interest in your work for myself do not let this generous proposition disturb your restbut do write the other 3 acts and then it will be valuable to managers and dont go and sell it to anybody like harte but keep it for yourself  hartes play can be doctored till it will be entirely acceptable and then it will clear a great sum every year i am out of all patience with harte for selling it the play entertained me hugely even in its present crude state                           love to you all                                    yrs ever                                              mark        following the sellers success clemens had made many attempts at      dramatic writing  such undertakings had uniformly failed but he      had always been willing to try again  in the next letter we get the      beginning of what proved his first and last direct literary      association that is to say collaboration with bret harte      clemens had great admiration for hartes ability and believed that      between them they could turn out a successful play  whether or not      this belief was justified will appear later  howellss biography of      hayes meanwhile had not gone well  he reported that only two      thousand copies had been sold in what was now the height of the      campaign  theres success for you he said it makes me despair      of the republic       clemens on his part had made a speech for hayes that howells      declared had put civilservice reform in a nutshell he added you      are the only republican orator quoted without distinction of party      by all the newspapers       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford oct 11 1876  my dear howells this is a secret to be known to nobody but you of course i comprehend that mrs howells is part of you that bret harte came up here the other day and asked me to help him write a play and divide the swag and i agreed i am to put in scotty briggs see buck fanshaws funeral in roughing it and he is to put in a chinaman a wonderfully funny creature as bret presents himfor 5 minutesin his sandy bar play this chinaman is to be the character of the play and both of us will work on him and develop him bret is to draw a plot and i am to do the same we shall use the best of the two or gouge from both and build a third my plot is builtfinished it yesterdaysix days work 8 or 9 hours a day and has nearly killed me  now the favor i ask of you is that you will have the words ah sin a drama printed in the middle of a notepaper page and send the same to me with bill we dont want anybody to know that we are building this play i cant get this title page printed here without having to lie so much that the thought of it is disagreeable to one reared as i have been and yet the title of the play must be printedthe rest of the application for copyright is allowable in penmanship  we have got the very best gang of servants in america now when george first came he was one of the most religious of men he had but one faultyoung george washingtons but i have trained him and now it fairly breaks mrs clemenss heart to hear george stand at that front door and lie to the unwelcome visitor but your time is valuable i must not dwell upon these thingsill ask warner and harte if theyll do blindfold novelettes some time ill simplify that plot all it needs is that the hanging and the marriage shall not be appointed for the same day i got over that difficulty but it required too much ms to reconcile the thingso the movement of the story was clogged  i came near agreeing to make political speeches with our candidate for governor the 16th and 23 inst but i had to give up the idea for harte and i will be here at work then                              yrs ever                                         mark        mark twain was writing few letters these days to any one but      howells yet in november he sent one to an old friend of his youth      burrough the literary chairmaker who had roomed with him in the      days when he had been setting type for the st louis evening news       to mr burrough of st louis                                               hartford nov 1 1876  my dear burroughsas you describe me i can picture myself as i was 20 years ago the portrait is correct you think i have grown some upon my word there was room for it you have described a callow fool a selfsufficient ass a mere human tumblebug imagining that he is remodeling the world and is entirely capable of doing it right ignorance intolerance egotism selfassertion opaque perception dense and pitiful chuckleheadednessand an almost pathetic unconsciousness of it all that is what i was at 19 and 20 and that is what the average southerner is at 60 today northerners too of a certain grade it is of children like this that voters are made and such is the primal source of our government a man hardly knows whether to swear or cry over it  i think i comprehend the position thereperfect freedom to vote just as you choose provided you choose to vote as other people thinksocial ostracism otherwise the same thing exists here among the irish an irish republican is a pariah among his people yet that race find fault with the same spirit in knownothingism  fortunately a good deal of experience of men enabled me to choose my residence wisely i live in the freest corner of the country there are no social disabilities between me and my democratic personal friends we break the bread and eat the salt of hospitality freely together and never dream of such a thing as offering impertinent interference in each others political opinions  dont you ever come to new york again and not run up here to see me i suppose we were away for the summer when you were east but no matter you could have telegraphed and found out we were at elmira n y and right on your road and could have given you a good time if you had allowed us the chance  yes will bowen and i have exchanged letters now and then for several years but i suspect that i made him mad with my lastshortly after you saw him in st louis i judge there is one thing which i cant stand and wont stand from many people that is sham sentimentalitythe kind a schoolgirl puts into her graduating composition the sort that makes up the original poetry column of a country newspaper the rot that deals in the happy days of yore the sweet yet melancholy past with its blighted hopes and its vanished dreams and all that sort of drivel wills were always of this stamp i stood it years when i get a letter like that from a grown man and he a widower with a family it gives me the stomach ache and i just told will bowen so last summer i told him to stop being 16 at 40 told him to stop drooling about the sweet yet melancholy past and take a pill i said there was but one solitary thing about the past worth remembering and that was the fact that it is the pastcant be restored well i exaggerated some of these truths a littlebut only a littlebut my idea was to kill his sham sentimentality once and forever and so make a good fellow of him again i went to the unheardof trouble of rewriting the letter and saying the same harsh things softly so as to sugarcoat the anguish and make it a little more endurable and i asked him to write and thank me honestly for doing him the best and kindliest favor that any friend ever had done himbut he hasnt done it yet maybe he will sometime i am grateful to god that i got that letter off before he was married i get that news from you else he would just have slobbered all over me and drowned me when that event happened  i enclose photograph for the young ladies i will remark that i do not wear sealskin for grandeur but because i found when i used to lecture in the winter that nothing else was able to keep a man warm sometimes in these high latitudes i wish you had sent pictures of yourself and familyill trade picture for picture with you straight through if you are commercially inclined                      your old friend                               saml l clemens     xvii letters 1877 to bermuda with twichell proposition to th nast the whittier dinner       mark twain must have been too busy to write letters that winter      those that have survived are few and unimportant  as a matter of      fact he was writing the play ah sin with bret harte and      getting it ready for production harte was a guest in the clemens      home while the play was being written and not always a pleasant      one  he was full of requirements critical as to the menage to      the point of sarcasm  the long friendship between clemens and harte      weakened under the strain of collaboration and intimate daily      intercourse never to renew its old fiber  it was an unhappy      outcome of an enterprise which in itself was to prove of little      profit  the play ah sin had many good features and with      charles t parsloe in an amusing chinese part might have been made a      success if the two authors could have harmoniously undertaken the      needed repairs  it opened in washington in may and a letter from      parsloe written at the moment gives a hint of the situation       from charles t parsloe to s l clemens                                     washington d c  may 11th 1877  mr clemensi forgot whether i acknowledged receipt of check by telegram harte has been here since monday last and done little or nothing yet but promises to have something fixed by tomorrow morning we have been making some improvements among ourselves the last act is weak at the end and i do hope mr harte will have something for a good finish to the piece the other acts i think are all right now  hope you have entirely recovered i am not very well myself the excitement of a first night is bad enough but to have the annoyance with harte that i have is too much for a beginner i aint used to it the houses have been picking up since tuesday mr ford has worked well and hard for us                 yours in haste                     chas thos  parsloe        the play drew some good houses in washington but it could not hold      them for a run  never mind what was the matter with it perhaps a      very small change at the right point would have turned it into a      fine success  we have seen in a former letter the obligation which      mark twain confessed to hartea debt he had tried in many ways to      repayobtaining for him a liberal book contract with bliss      advancing him frequent and large sums of money which harte could      not or did not repay seeking to advance his fortunes in many      directions  the mistake came when he introduced another genius into      the intricacies of his daily life  clemens went down to washington      during the early rehearsals of ah sin       meantime rutherford b hayes had been elected president and      clemens one day called with a letter of introduction from howells      thinking to meet the chief executive  his own letter to howells      later probably does not give the real reason of his failure but it      will be amusing to those who recall the erratic personality of      george francis train  train and twain were sometimes confused by      the very unlettered or pretendedly by mark twains friends      to w d howells in boston                                          baltimore may 1 77  my dear howellsfound i was not absolutely needed in washington so i only staid 24 hours and am on my way home now i called at the white house and got admission to col rodgers because i wanted to inquire what was the right hour to go and infest the president it was my luck to strike the place in the dead waste and middle of the day the very busiest time i perceived that mr rodgers took me for george francis train and had made up his mind not to let me get at the president so at the end of half an hour i took my letter of introduction from the table and went away it was a great pity all round and a great loss to the nation for i was brim full of the eastern question i didnt get to see the president or the chief magistrate either though i had sort of a glimpse of a lady at a window who resembled her portraits                                         yrs ever                                              mark       howells condoled with him on his failure to see the president      but he added if you and i had both been there our combined      skill would have no doubt procured us to be expelled from the white      house by fred douglass  but the thing seems to be a complete      failure as it was  douglass at this time being the marshal of      columbia gives special point to howellss suggestion       later in may clemens took twichell for an excursion to bermuda      he had begged howells to go with them but howells as usual was      full of literary affairs  twichell and clemens spent four glorious      days tramping the length and breadth of the beautiful island and      remembered it always as one of their happiest adventures  put it      down as an oasis wrote twichell on his return im afraid i shall      not see as green a spot again soon  and it was your invention and      your gift  and your company was the best of it  indeed i never      took more comfort in being with you than on this journey which my      boy is saying a great deal        to howells clemens triumphantly reported the success of the      excursion       to w d howells in boston                                farmington avenue hartford may 29 1877  confound you joe twichell and i roamed about bermuda day and night and never ceased to gabble and enjoy about half the talk wasit is a burning shame that howells isnt here nobody could get at the very meat and marrow of this pervading charm and deliciousness like howells how howells would revel in the quaintness and the simplicity of this people and the sabbath repose of this land what an imperishable sketch howells would make of capt west the whaler and capt hope with the patient pathetic face wanderer in all the oceans for 42 years lucky in none coming home defeated once more now minus his shipresigned uncomplaining being used to this what a rattling chapter howells would make out of the small boy alfred with his alert eye and military brevity and exactness of speech and out of the old landlady and her sacred onions and her daughter and the visiting clergyman and the ancient pianos of hamilton and the venerable music in vogue thereand forty other things which we shall leave untouched or touched but lightly upon we not being worthy dam howells for not being here this usually from me not twichell  o your insufferable pride which will have a fall some day if you had gone with us and let me pay the 50 which the trip and the board and the various nicknacks and mementoes would cost i would have picked up enough droppings from your conversation to pay me 500 per cent profit in the way of the several magazine articles which i could have written whereas i can now write only one or two and am therefore largely out of pocket by your proud ways ponder these things lord what a perfectly bewitching excursion it was i traveled under an assumed name and was never molested with a polite attention from anybody                           love to you all                                         yrs ever                                                   mark        aldrich meantime had invited the clemenses to ponkapog during the      bermuda absence and clemens hastened to send him a line expressing      regrets  at the close he said       to t b aldrich in ponkapog mass                                farmington avenue hartford june 3 1877  day after tomorrow we leave for the hills beyond elmira n y for the summer when i shall hope to write a book of some sort or other to beat the people with a work similar to your new one in the atlantic is what i mean though i have not heard what the nature of that one is immoral i suppose well you are right such books sell best howells says howells says he is going to make his next book indelicate he says he thinks there is money in it he says there is a large class of the young in schools and seminaries whobut you let him tell you he has ciphered it all down to a demonstration  with the warmest remembrances to the pair of you                                     ever yours                                         samuel l clemens        clemens would naturally write something about bermuda and began at      once random notes of an idle excursion and presently completed      four papers which howells eagerly accepted for the atlantic  then      we find him plunging into another play this time alone       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira june 27 1877  my dear howellsif you should not like the first 2 chapters send them to me and begin with chapter 3or part 3 i believe you call these things in the magazine i have finished no 4 which closes the series and will mail it tomorrow if i think of it i like this one i liked the preceding one already mailed to you some time ago but i had my doubts about 1 and 2 do not hesitate to squelch them even with derision and insult  today i am deep in a comedy which i began this morningprincipal character that old detectivei skeletoned the first act and wrote the second today and am dogtired now fiftyfour close pages of ms in 7 hours once i wrote 55 pages at a sittingthat was on the opening chapters of the gilded age novel when i cool down an hour from now i shall go to zero i judge                                yrs ever                                         mark        clemens had doubts as to the quality of the bermuda papers and with      some reason  they did not represent him at his best  nevertheless      they were pleasantly entertaining and howells expressed full      approval of them for atlantic use  the author remained troubled       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira july 41877  my dear howellsit is splendid of you to say those pleasant things but i am still plagued with doubts about parts 1 and 2 if you have any dont print if otherwise please make some cold villain like lathrop read and pass sentence on them mind i thought they were good at firstit was the second reading that accomplished its hellish purpose on me put them up for a new verdict part 4 has lain in my pigeonhole a good while and when i put it there i had a christians confidence in 4 aces in it and you can be sure it will skip toward connecticut tomorrow before any fatal fresh reading makes me draw my bet  ive piled up 151 ms pages on my comedy the first second and fourth acts are done and done to my satisfaction too tomorrow and next day will finish the 3rd act and the play i have not written less than 30 pages any day since i began never had so much fun over anything in my lifenever such consuming interest and delight but lord bless you the second reading will fetch it and just thinki had sol smith russell in my minds eye for the old detectives part and hang it he has gone off pottering with oliver optic or else the papers lie  i read everything about the presidents doings there with exultation  i wish that old ass of a private secretary hadnt taken me for george francis train if ignorance were a means of grace i wouldnt trade that gorillas chances for the archbishop of canterburys  i shall call on the president again by and by i shall go in my war paint and if i am obstructed the nation will have the unusual spectacle of a private secretary with a pen over one ear a tomahawk over the other  i read the entire atlantic this time wonderful number mrs rose terry cookes story was a tenstrike i wish she would write 12 oldtime new england tales a year  good times to you all mind if you dont run here for a few days you will go to hence without having had a foreglimpse of heaven                                               mark        the play ah sin that had done little enough in washington was      that summer given another trial by augustin daly at the fifth      avenue theater new york with a fine company  clemens had      undertaken to doctor the play and it would seem to have had an      enthusiastic reception on the opening night  but it was a summer      audience unspoiled by many attractions  ah sin was never a      success in the new york seasonnever a moneymaker on the road       the reference in the first paragraph of the letter that follows is      to the bermuda chapters which mark twain was publishing      simultaneously in england and america                                                elmira aug 31877  my dear howellsi have mailed one set of the slips to london and told bentley you would print sept 15 in october atlantic and he must not print earlier in temple bar have i got the dates and things right  i am powerful glad to see that no 1 reads a nation sight better in print than it did in ms i told bentley wed send him the slips each time 6 weeks before day of publication we can do that cant we two months ahead would be still better i suppose but i dont know  ah sin went abooming at the fifth avenue the reception of col sellers was calm compared to it  the criticisms were just the criticisms of the great new york dailies are always just intelligent and square and honestnotwithstanding by a blunder which nobody was seriously to blame for i was made to say exactly the opposite of this in a newspaper some time ago never said it at all and moreover i never thought it i could not publicly correct it before the play appeared in new york because that would look as if i had really said that thing and then was moved by fears for my pocket and my reputation to take it back but i can correct it now and shall do it for now my motives cannot be impugned when i began this letter it had not occurred to me to use you in this connection but it occurs to me now your opinion and mine uttered a year ago and repeated more than once since that the candor and ability of the new york critics were beyond question is a matter which makes it proper enough that i should speak through you at this time therefore if you will print this paragraph somewhere it may remove the impression that i say unjust things which i do not think merely for the pleasure of talking  there now cant you say       in a letter to mr howells of the atlantic monthly mark      twain describes the reception of the new comedy ali sin      and then goes on to say etc  beginning at the star with the words the criticisms were just mrs clemens says dont ask that of mr howellsit will be disagreeable to him i hadnt thought of it but i will bet two to one on the correctness of her instinct we shall see  will you cut that paragraph out of this letter and precede it with the remarks suggested or with better ones and send it to the globe or some other paper you cant do me a bigger favor and yet if it is in the least disagreeable you mustnt think of it but let me know right away for i want to correct this thing before it grows stale again i explained myself to only one critic the worldthe consequence was a noble notice of the play this one called on me else i shouldnt have explained myself to him  i have been putting in a deal of hard work on that play in new york but it is full of incurable defects  my old plunkett family seemed wonderfully coarse and vulgar on the stage but it was because they were played in such an outrageously and inexcusably coarse way the chinaman is killingly funny i dont know when i have enjoyed anything as much as i did him the people say there isnt enough of him in the piece thats a triumphtherell never be any more of him in it  john brougham said read the list of things which the critics have condemned in the piece and you have unassailable proofs that the play contains all the requirements of success and a long life  that is true nearly every time the audience roared i knew it was over something that would be condemned in the morning justly too but must be left infor low comedies are written for the drawingroom the kitchen and the stable and if you cut out the kitchen and the stable the drawingroom cant support the play by itself  there was as much money in the house the first two nights as in the first ten of sellers havent heard from the thirdi came away                                     yrs ever                                              mark        in a former letter we have seen how mark twain working on a story      that was to stand as an example of his best work and become one of      his surest claims to immortality the adventures of huckleberry      finn displayed little enthusiasm in his undertaking  in the      following letter which relates the conclusion of his detective      comedy we find him at the other extreme on very tiptoe with      enthusiasm over something wholly without literary value or dramatic      possibility  one of the hallmarks of genius is the inability to      discriminate as to the value of its output  simon wheeler amateur      detective was a dreary absurd impossible performance as wild and      unconvincing in incident and dialogue as anything out of an asylum      could well be  the title which he first chose for it balaams      ass was properly in keeping with the general scheme  yet mark      twain still warm with the creative fever had the fullest faith in      it as a work of art and a winner of fortune  it would never see the      light of production of course  we shall see presently that the      distinguished playwright dion boucicault goodnaturedly      complimented it as being better than ahi sin  one must wonder      what that skilled artist really thought and how he could do even      this violence to his conscience       to w d howells in boston                                          elmira wednesday pm  1877  my dear howellsits finished i was misled by hurried mispaging there were ten pages of notes and over 300 pages of ms when the play was done did it in 42 hours by the clock 40 pages of the atlanticbut then of course its very fat those are the figures but i dont believe them myself because the things impossible  but let that pass all day long and every day since i finished in the rough i have been diligently altering amending rewriting cutting down i finished finally today cant think of anything else in the way of an improvement i thought i would stick to it while the interest was hotand i am mighty glad i did a week from now it will be frozenthen revising would be drudgery you see i learned something from the fatal blunder of putting ah sin aside before it was finished  shes all right now she reads in two hours and 20 minutes and will play not longer than 2 34 hours nineteen characters 3 acts i bunched 2 into 1  tomorrow i will draw up an exhaustive synopsis to insert in the printed titlepage for copyrighting and then on friday or saturday i go to new york to remain a week or ten days and lay for an actor wish you could run down there and have a holiday twould be fun  my wife wont have balaams ass therefore i call the piece capn simon wheeler the amateur detective                                     yrs                                         mark       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira aug  29 1877  my dear howellsjust got your letter last night no dern that articleone of the bermuda chaptersit made me cry when i read it in proof it was so oppressively and ostentatiously poor skim your eye over it again and you will think as i do if isaac and the prophets of baal can be doctored gently and made permissible it will redeem the thing but if it cant lets burn all of the articles except the tailend of it and use that as an introduction to the next articleas i suggested in my letter to you of day before yesterday i had this proof from cambridge before yours came  boucicault says my new play is ever so much better than ah sin says the amateur detective is a bully character too an actor is chawing over the play in new york to see if the old detective is suited to his abilities havent heard from him yet  if youve got that paragraph by you yet and if in your judgment it would be good to publish it and if you absolutely would not mind doing it then i think id like to have you do itor else put some other words in my mouth that will be properer and publish them but mind dont think of it for a moment if it is distastefuland doubtless it is i value your judgment more than my own as to the wisdom of saying anything at all in this matter to say nothing leaves me in an injurious positionand yet maybe i might do better to speak to the men themselves when i go to new york this was my latest idea and it looked wise  we expect to leave here for home sept 4 reaching there the 8thbut we may be delayed a week  curious thing i read passages from my play and a full synopsis to boucicault who was rewriting a play which he wrote and laid aside 3 or 4 years ago my detective is about that age you know then he read a passage from his play where a real detective does some things that are as idiotic as some of my old wheelers performances showed me the passages and behold his mans name is wheeler however his wheeler is not a prominent character so well not alter the names my wheelers name is taken from the old jumping frog sketch  i am rereading ticknors diary and am charmed with it though i still say he refers to too many good things when he could just as well have told them think of the man traveling 8 days in convoy and familiar intercourse with a band of outlaws through the mountain fastnesses of spainhe the fourth stranger they had encountered in thirty yearsand compressing this priceless experience into a single colorless paragraph of his diary they spun yarns to this unworthy devil too  i wrote you a very long letter a day or two ago but susy crane wanted to make a copy of it to keep so it has not gone yet it may go today possibly  we unite in warm regards to you and yours                                yrs ever                                         mark        the ticknor referred to in a former letter was professor george      ticknor of harvard college a historywriter of distinction  on      the margin of the diary mark twain once wrote ticknor is a      millet who makes all men fall in love with him  and adds millet      was the cause of lovable qualities in people and then he admired      and loved those persons for the very qualities which he without      knowing it had created in them  perhaps it would be strictly truer      of these two men to say that they bore within them the divine      something in whose presence the evil in people fled away and hid      itself while all that was good in them came spontaneously forward      out of the forgotten walls and comers in their systems where it was      accustomed to hide       it is frank millet the artist he is speaking ofa knightly soul      whom all the clemens household loved and who would one day meet his      knightly end with those other brave men that found death together      when the titanic went down       the clemens family was still at quarry farm at the end of august      and one afternoon there occurred a startling incident which mark      twain thought worth setting down in practically duplicate letters to      howells and to dr john brown  it may be of interest to the reader      to know that john t lewis the colored man mentioned lived to a      good old agea pensioner of the clemens family and in the course      of time of h h rogers  howellss letter follows  it is the      very long letter referred to in the foregoing       to w d howells and wife in boston                                               elmira aug 25 77  my dear howellsesi thought i ought to make a sort of record of it for further reference the pleasantest way to do that would be to write it to somebody but that somebody would let it leak into print and that we wish to avoid the howellses would be safeso let us tell the howellses about it  day before yesterday was a fine summer day away up here on the summit aunt marsh and cousin may marsh were here visiting susie crane and livy at our farmhouse by and by mother langdon came up the hill in the high carriage with nora the nurse and little jervis charley langdons little boytimothy the coachman driving behind these came charleys wife and little girl in the buggy with the new young spry gray horsea highstepper theodore crane arrived a little later  the bay and susy were on hand with their nurse rosa i was on hand too susy cranes trio of colored servants dittothese being josie housemaid aunty cord cook aged 62 turbaned very tall very broad very fine every way see her portrait in a true story just as i heard it in my sketches chocklate the laundress as the bay calls hershe cant say charlotte still taller still more majestic of proportions turbaned very black straight as an indianage 24 then there was the farmers wife colored and her little girl susy  wasnt it a good audience to get up an excitement before good excitable inflammable material  lewis was still down town three miles away with his twohorse wagon to get a load of manure lewis is the farmer colored he is of mighty frame and muscle stocky stooping ungainly has a good manly face and a clear eye age about 45and the most picturesque of men when he sits in his fluttering workday rags humped forward into a bunch with his aged slouch hat mashed down over his ears and neck it is a spectacle to make the brokenhearted smile lewis has worked mighty hard and remained mighty poor at the end of each whole years toil he cant show a gain of fifty dollars he had borrowed money of the cranes till he owed them 700 and he being conscientious and honest imagine what it was to him to have to carry this stubborn helpless load year in and year out  well sunset came and ida the young and comely charley langdons wife and her little julia and the nurse nora drove out at the gate behind the new gray horse and started down the long hillthe high carriage receiving its load under the porte cochere ida was seen to turn her face toward us across the fence and intervening lawntheodore waved goodbye to her for he did not know that her sign was a speechless appeal for help  the next moment livy said idas driving too fast down hill she followed it with a sort of scream her horse is running away  we could see two hundred yards down that descent the buggy seemed to fly it would strike obstructions and apparently spring the height of a man from the ground  theodore and i left the shrieking crowd behind and ran down the hill bareheaded and shouting a neighbor appeared at his gatea tenth of a second too late the buggy vanished past him like a thought my last glimpse showed it for one instant far down the descent springing high in the air out of a cloud of dust and then it disappeared as i flew down the road my impulse was to shut my eyes as i turned them to the right or left and so delay for a moment the ghastly spectacle of mutilation and death i was expecting  i ran on and on still spared this spectacle but saying to myself i shall see it at the turn of the road they never can pass that turn alive when i came in sight of that turn i saw two wagons there bunched togetherone of them full of people i said just sothey are staring petrified at the remains  but when i got amongst that bunch there sat ida in her buggy and nobody hurt not even the horse or the vehicle ida was pale but serene as i came tearing down she smiled back over her shoulder at me and said well were alive yet arent we a miracle had been performednothing else  you see lewis the prodigious humped upon his front seat had been toiling up on his load of manure he saw the frantic horse plunging down the hill toward him on a full gallop throwing his heels as high as a mans head at every jump so lewis turned his team diagonally across the road just at the turn thus making a v with the fencethe running horse could not escape that but must enter it then lewis sprang to the ground and stood in this v he gathered his vast strength and with a perfect creedmoor aim he seized the gray horses bit as he plunged by and fetched him up standing  it was down hill mind you ten feet further down hill neither lewis nor any other man could have saved them for they would have been on the abrupt turn then but how this miracle was ever accomplished at all by human strength generalship and accuracy is clean beyond my comprehensionand grows more so the more i go and examine the ground and try to believe it was actually done i know one thing well if lewis had missed his aim he would have been killed on the spot in the trap he had made for himself and we should have found the rest of the remains away down at the bottom of the steep ravine  ten minutes later theodore and i arrived opposite the house with the servants straggling after us and shouted to the distracted group on the porch everybody safe  believe it why how could they they knew the road perfectly we might as well have said it to people who had seen their friends go over niagara  however we convinced them and then instead of saying something or going on crying they grew very stillwords could not express it i suppose  nobody could do anything that night or sleep either but there was a deal of moving talk with long pauses between pictures of that flying carriage these pauses representedthis picture intruded itself all the time and disjointed the talk  but yesterday evening late when lewis arrived from down town he found his supper spread and some presents of books there with very complimentary writings on the flyleaves and certain very complimentary letters and more or less greenbacks of dignified denomination pinned to these letters and flyleavesand one said among other things signed by the cranes we cancel 400 of your indebtedness to us c c  the end thereof is not yet of course for charley langdon is west and will arrive ignorant of all these things today  the supperroom had been kept locked and imposingly secret and mysterious until lewis should arrive but around that part of the house were gathered lewiss wife and child chocklate josie aunty cord and our rosa canvassing things and waiting impatiently they were all on hand when the curtain rose  now aunty cord is a violent methodist and lewis an implacable dunkerbaptist those two are inveterate religious disputants the revealments having been made aunty cord said with effusion  now let folks go on saying there aint no god lewis the lord sent you there to stop that horse  says lewis  then who sent the horse there in sich a shape  but i want to call your attention to one thing when lewis arrived the other evening after saving those lives by a feat which i think is the most marvelous of any i can call to mindwhen he arrived hunched up on his manure wagon and as grotesquely picturesque as usual everybody wanted to go and see how he looked they came back and said he was beautiful it was so tooand yet he would have photographed exactly as he would have done any day these past 7 years that he has occupied this farm                                                         aug 27  p s our little romance in real life is happily and satisfactorily completed charley has come listened actedand now john t lewis has ceased to consider himself as belonging to that class

wearer aggrandizes the watch not the watch the wearer  i was asked beforehand if this would be a wise gift and i said yes the very wisest of all i know the colored race and i know that in lewiss eyes this fine toy will throw the other more valuable testimonials far away into the shade if he lived in england the humane society would give him a gold medal as costly as this watch and nobody would say it is out of character if lewis chose to wear a town clock who would become it better  lewis has sound common sense and is not going to be spoiled the instant he found himself possessed of money he forgot himself in a plan to make his old father comfortable who is wretchedly poor and lives down in maryland his next act on the spot was the proffer to the cranes of the 300 of his remaining indebtedness to them this was put off by them to the indefinite future for he is not going to be allowed to pay that at all though he doesnt know it  a letter of acknowledgment from lewis contains a sentence which raises it to the dignity of literature  but i beg to say humbly that inasmuch as divine providence saw fit to use me as a instrument for the saving of those presshious lives the honner conferd upon me was greater than the feat performed  that is well said                      yrs ever                                    mark        howells was moved to use the story in the contributors club      and warned clemens against letting it get into the newspapers  he      declared he thought it one of the most impressive things he had ever      read  but clemens seems never to have allowed it to be used in any      form  in its entirety therefore it is quite new matter       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford sept  19 1877  my dear howellsi dont really see how the story of the runaway horse could read well with the little details of names and places and things left out they are the true life of all narrative it wouldnt quite do to print them at this time well talk about it when you come delicacya sad sad false delicacyrobs literature of the best two things among its belongings familycircle narrative and obscene stories but no matter in that better world which i trust we are all going to i have the hope and belief that they will not be denied us  saytwichell and i had an adventure at sea 4 months ago which i did not put in my bermuda articles because there was not enough to it but the press dispatches bring the sequel today and now theres plenty to it a sailless wasteless chartless compassless grubless old condemned tub that has been drifting helpless about the ocean for 4 months and a half begging bread and water like any other tramp flying a signal of distress permanently and with 13 innocent marveling chuckleheaded bermuda niggers on board taking a pleasure excursion our ship fed the poor devils on the 25th of last may far out at sea and left them to bullyrag their way to new yorkand now they aint as near new york as they were then by 250 miles they have drifted 750 miles and are still drifting in the relentless gulf stream what a delicious magazine chapter it would makebut i had to deny myself i had to come right out in the papers at once with my details so as to try to raise the governments sympathy sufficiently to have better succor sent them than the cutter colfax which went a little way in search of them the other day and then struck a fog and gave it up  if the president were in washington i would telegraph him  when i hear that the jonas smith has been found again i mean to send for one of those darkies to come to hartford and give me his adventures for an atlantic article  likely you will see my todays article in the newspapers                                     yrs ever                                              mark  the revenue cutter colfax went after the jonas smith thinking there was mutiny or other crime on board it occurs to me now that since there is only mere suffering and misery and nobody to punish it ceases to be a matter which a republican form of government will feel authorized to interfere in further dam a republican form of government        clemens thought he had given up lecturing for good he was      prosperous and he had no love for the platform  but one day an idea      popped into his head thomas nast the father of the american      cartoon had delivered a successful series of illustrated lectures      talks for which he made the drawings as he went along  mark      twains idea was to make a combination with nast  his letter gives      us the plan in full       to thomas nast morristown n j                                               hartford conn 1877  my dear nasti did not think i should ever stand on a platform again until the time was come for me to say i die innocent but the same old offers keep arriving i have declined them all just as usual though sorely tempted as usual  now i do not decline because i mind talking to an audience but because 1 traveling alone is so heartbreakingly dreary and 2 shouldering the whole show is such a cheerkilling responsibility  therefore i now propose to you what you proposed to me in 1867 ten years ago when i was unknown viz that you stand on the platform and make pictures and i stand by you and blackguard the audience i should enormously enjoy meandering around to big townsdont want to go to the little ones with you for company  my idea is not to fatten the lecture agents and lyceums on the spoils but put all the ducats religiously into two equal piles and say to the artist and lecturer absorb these  for instancehere follows a plan and a possible list of cities to be visited the letter continues  call the gross receipts 100000 for four months and a half and the profit from 60000 to 75000 i try to make the figures large enough and leave it to the public to reduce them  i did not put in philadelphia because pugh owns that town and last winter when i made a little readingtrip he only paid me 300 and pretended his concert i read fifteen minutes in the midst of a concert cost him a vast sum and so he couldnt afford any more i could get up a better concert with a barrel of cats  i have imagined two or three pictures and concocted the accompanying remarks to see how the thing would go i was charmed  well you think it over nast and drop me a line we should have some fun                      yours truly                          samuel l clemens        the plan came to nothing  nast like clemens had no special taste      for platforming and while undoubtedly there would have been large      profits in the combination the promise of the venture did not      compel his acceptance       in spite of his distaste for the platform mark twain was always      giving readings and lectures without charge for some worthy      hartford cause  he was ready to do what he could to help an      entertainment along if he could do it in his own wayan original      way sometimes and not always gratifying to the committee whose      plans were likely to be prearranged       for one thing clemens supersensitive in the matter of putting      himself forward in his own town often objected to any special      exploitation of his name  this always distressed the committee who      saw a large profit to their venture in the prestige of his fame      the following characteristic letter was written in selfdefense      when on one such occasion a committee had become sufficiently      peevish to abandon a worthy enterprise       to an entertainment committee in hartford                                          nov 9 e s sykes esq  dr sirmr burtons note puts upon me all the blame of the destruction of an enterprise which had for its object the succor of the hartford poor that is to say this enterprise has been dropped because of the dissatisfaction with mr clemenss stipulations therefore i must be allowed to say a word in my defense  there were two stipulationsexactly two i made one of them if the other was made at all it was a joint one from the choir and me  my individual stipulation was that my name should be kept out of the newspapers the joint one was that sufficient tickets to insure a good sum should be sold before the date of the performance should be set understand we wanted a good sumi do not think any of us bothered about a good house it was money we were after  now you perceive that my concern is simply with my individual stipulation did that break up the enterprise  eugene burton said he would sell 300 worth of the tickets himselfmr smith said he would sell 200 or 300 worth himself my plan for asylum hill church would have ensured 150 from that quarterall this in the face of my stipulation it was proposed to raise 1000 did my stipulation render the raising of 400 or 500 in a dozen churches impossible  my stipulation is easily defensible when a mere reader or lecturer has appeared 3 or 4 times in a town of hartfords size he is a good deal more than likely to get a very unpleasant snub if he shoves himself forward about once or twice more therefore i long ago made up my mind that whenever i again appeared here it should be only in a minor capacity and not as a chief attraction  now i placed that harmless and very justifiable stipulation before the committee the other day they carried it to headquarters and it was accepted there i am not informed that any objection was made to it or that it was regarded as an offense it seems late in the day now after a good deal of trouble has been taken and a good deal of thankless work done by the committees to suddenly tear up the contract and then turn and bowl me down from long range as being the destroyer of it  if the enterprise has failed because of my individual stipulation here you have my proper and reasonable reasons for making that stipulation  if it has failed because of the joint stipulation put the blame there and let us share it collectively  i think our plan was a good one i do not doubt that mr burton still approves of it too i believe the objections come from other quarters and not from him mr twichell used the following words in last sundays sermon if i remember correctly  my hearers the prophet deuteronomy says this wise thing though ye plan a goodly house for the poor and plan it with wisdom and do take off your coats and set to to build it with high courage yet shall the croaker presently come and lift up his voice having his coat on and say verily this plan is not well plannedand he will go his way and the obstructionist will come and lift up his voice having his coat on and say behold this is but a sick planand he will go his way and the man that knows it all will come and lift up his voice having his coat on and say lo call they this a plan then will he go his way and the places which knew him once shall know him no more forever because he was not for god took him now therefore i say unto you verily that house will not be budded and i say this also he that waiteth for all men to be satisfied with his plan let him seek eternal life for he shall need it  this portion of mr twichells sermon made a great impression upon me and i was grieved that some one had not wakened me earlier so that i might have heard what went before                                     s l clemens        mr sykes of the firm of sykes  newton the allen house pharmacy      replied that he had read the letter to the committee and that it had      set those gentlemen right who had not before understood the      situation  if others were as ready to do their part as yourself      our poor would not want assistance he said in closing       we come now to an incident which assumes the proportions of an      episodeeven of a catastrophein mark twains career  the disaster      was due to a condition noted a few pages earlierthe inability of      genius to judge its own efforts  the story has now become history      printed historyit having been sympathetically told by howells in      my mark twain and more exhaustively with a report of the speech      that invited the lightning in a former work by the present writer       the speech was made at john greenleaf whittiers seventieth birthday      dinner given by the atlantic staff on the evening of december 17      1877  it was intended as a huge jokea joke that would shake the      sides of these venerable boston deities longfellow emerson      holmes and the rest of that venerated group  clemens had been a      favorite at the atlantic lunches and dinnersa speech by him always      an event  this time he decided to outdo himself       he did that but not in the way he had intended  to use one of his      own metaphors he stepped out to meet the rainbow and got struck by      lightning  his joke was not of the boston kind or size  when its      full nature burst upon the companywhen the ears of the assembled      diners heard the sacred names of longfellow emerson and holmes      lightly associated with human aspects removedoh very far removed     from cambridge and concord a chill fell upon the diners that      presently became amazement and then creeping paralysis  nobody      knew afterward whether the great speech that he had so gaily planned      ever came to a natural end or not  somebodythe next on the      programattempted to follow him but presently the company melted      out of the doors and crept away into the night       it seemed to mark twain that his career had come to an end  back in      hartford sweating and suffering through sleepless nights he wrote      howells his anguish       to w d howells in boston                                                    sunday night  1877  my dear howellsmy sense of disgrace does not abate it grows i see that it is going to add itself to my list of permanenciesa list of humiliations that extends back to when i was seven years old and which keep on persecuting me regardless of my repentancies  i feel that my misfortune has injured me all over the country therefore it will be best that i retire from before the public at present it will hurt the atlantic for me to appear in its pages now so it is my opinion and my wifes that the telephone story had better be suppressed will you return those proofs or revises to me so that i can use the same on some future occasion  it seems as if i must have been insane when i wrote that speech and saw no harm in it no disrespect toward those men whom i reverenced so much and what shame i brought upon you after what you said in introducing me it burns me like fire to think of it  the whole matter is a dreadful subjectlet me drop it hereat least on paper                           penitently yrs                                         mark        howells sent back a comforting letter  i have no idea of dropping      you out of the atlantic he wrote and mr houghton has still      less if possible  you are going to help and not hurt us many a      year yet if you will  you are not going to be floored by it      there is more justice than that even in this world       howells added that charles elliot norton had expressed just the      right feeling concerning the whole affair and that many who had not      heard the speech but read the newspaper reports of it had found it      without offense       clemens wrote contrite letters to holmes emerson and longfellow      and received most gracious acknowledgments  emerson indeed had      not heard the speech his faculties were already blurred by the      mental mists that would eventually shut him in  clemens wrote again      to howells this time with less anguish       to w d howells in boston                                               hartford friday 1877  my dear howellsyour letter was a godsend and perhaps the welcomest part of it was your consent that i write to those gentlemen for you discouraged my hints in that direction that morning in bostonrightly too for my offense was yet too new then warner has tried to hold up our hands like the good fellow he is but poor twichell could not say a word and confessed that he would rather take nearly any punishment than face livy and me he hasnt been here since  it is curious but i pitched early upon mr norton as the very man who would think some generous thing about that matter whether he said it or not it is splendid to be a man like thatbut it is given to few to be  i wrote a letter yesterday and sent a copy to each of the three i wanted to send a copy to mr whittier also since the offense was done also against him being committed in his presence and he the guest of the occasion besides holding the wellnigh sacred place he does in his peoples estimation but i didnt know whether to venture or not and so ended by doing nothing it seemed an intrusion to approach him and even livy seemed to have her doubts as to the best and properest way to do in the case i do not reverence mr emerson less but somehow i could approach him easier  send me those proofs if you have got them handy i want to submit them to wylie he wont show them to anybody  had a very pleasant and considerate letter from mr houghton today and was very glad to receive it  you cant imagine how brilliant and beautiful that new brass fender is and how perfectly naturally it takes its place under the carved oak how they did scour it up before they sent it i lied a good deal about it when i came homeso for once i kept a secret and surprised livy on a christmas morning  i havent done a stroke of work since the atlantic dinner have only moped around but im going to try tomorrow how could i ever have  ah well i am a great and sublime fool but then i am gods fool and all his works must be contemplated with respect  livy and i join in the warmest regards to you and yours                                          yrs ever                                                   mark       longfellow in his reply said i do not believe anybody      was much hurt certainly i was not and holmes tells me he      was not so i think you may dismiss the matter from your      mind without further remorse       holmes wrote it never occurred to me for a moment to take      offense or feel wounded by your playful use of my name       miss ellen emerson replied for her father in a letter to      mrs clemens that the speech had made no impression upon      him giving at considerable length the impression it had      made on herself and other members of the family       clearly it was not the principals who were hurt but only those who      held them in awe though one can realize that this would not make it      much easier for mark twain     xviii letters from europe 187879 tramping with twichell writing a new travel book life in munich       whether the unhappy occurrence at the whittier dinner had anything      to do with mark twains resolve to spend a year or two in europe      cannot be known now  there were other good reasons for going one      in particular being a demand for another book of travel  it was      also true as he explains in a letter to his mother that his days      were full of annoyances making it difficult for him to work  he      had a tendency to invest money in almost any glittering enterprise      that came along and at this time he was involved in the promotion      of a variety of patent rights that brought him no return other than      assessment and vexation       clemenss mother was by this time living with her son onion and his      wife in iowa       to mrs jane clemens in keokuk iowa                                               hartford feb 17 1878  my dear motheri suppose i am the worst correspondent in the whole world and yet i grow worse and worse all the time my conscience blisters me for not writing you but it has ceased to abuse me for not writing other folks  life has come to be a very serious matter with me i have a badgered harassed feeling a good part of my time it comes mainly of business responsibilities and annoyances and the persecution of kindly letters from well meaning strangersto whom i must be rudely silent or else put in the biggest half of my time bothering over answers there are other things also that help to consume my time and defeat my projects well the consequence is i cannot write a book at home this cuts my income down therefore i have about made up my mind to take my tribe and fly to some little corner of europe and budge no more until i shall have completed one of the half dozen books that lie begun up stairs please say nothing about this at present  we propose to sail the 11th of april i shall go to fredonia to meet you but it will not be well for livy to make that trip i am afraid however we shall see i will hope she can go  mr twichell has just come in so i must go to him we are all well and send love to you all                                affly                                         sam        he was writing few letters at this time and doing but little work      there were always many social events during the winter and what      with his european plans and a diligent study of the german language      which the entire family undertook his days and evenings were full      enough  howells wrote protesting against the european travel and      berating him for his silence       i never was in berlin and dont know any family hotel there      i should be glad i didnt if it would keep you from going  you      deserve to put up at the sign of the savage in vienna  really its      a great blow to me to hear of that prospected sojourn  its a      shame  i must see you somehow before you go  im in dreadfully      low spirits about it       i was afraid your silence meant something wicked       clemens replied promptly urging a visit to hartford adding a      postscript for mrs howells characteristic enough to warrant      preservation    p s to mrs howells in boston                                                         feb 78 dear mrs howells mrs clemens wrote you a letter and handed it to me half an hour ago while i was folding mine to mr howells i laid that letter on this table before me while i added the paragraph about rs application since then i have been hunting and swearing and swearing and hunting but i cant find a sign of that letter it is the most astonishing disappearance i ever heard of mrs clemens has gone off drivingso i will have to try and give you an idea of her communication from memory mainly it consisted of an urgent desire that you come to see us next week if you can possibly manage it for that will be a reposeful time the turmoil of breaking up beginning the week after she wants you to tell her about italy and advise her in that connection if you will then she spoke of her planshers mind you for i never have anything quite so definite as a plan she proposes to stop a fortnight in confound the place ive forgotten what it was then go and live in dresden till sometime in the summer then retire to switzerland for the hottest season then stay a while in venice and put in the winter in munich this program subject to modifications according to circumstances she said something about some little bytrips here and there but they didnt stick in my memory because the idea didnt charm me  they have just telephoned me from the courant office that bayard taylor and family have taken rooms in our ship the holsatia for the 11th april  do come if you possibly canand remember and dont forget to avoid letting mrs clemens find out i lost her letter just answer her the same as if you had got it                                sincerely yours                                              s l clemens        the howellses came as invited for a final reunion before the      breaking up  this was in the early half of march the clemenses      were to sail on the 11th of the following month       orion clemens meantime had conceived a new literary idea and was      piling in his ms as fast as possible to get his brothers judgment      on it before the sailingdate  it was not a very good time to send      ms but mark twain seems to have read it and given it some      consideration  the journey in heaven of his own which he      mentions was the story published so many years later under the      title of captain stormfields visit to heaven  he had began it in      1868 on his voyage to san francisco it having been suggested by      conversations with capt  ned wakeman of one of the pacific      steamers  wakeman also appears in roughing it chap  l as capt      ned blakely and again in one of the rambling notes of an idle      excursion as captain hurricane jones       to orion clemens in keokuk                                               hartford mch  23 1878  my dear broevery man must learn his tradenot pick it up god requires that he learn it by slow and painful processes the apprenticehand in blacksmithing in medicine in literature in everything is a thing that cant be hidden it always shows  but happily there is a market for apprentice work else the innocents abroad would have had no sale happily too theres a wider market for some sorts of apprentice literature than there is for the very best of journeywork this work of yours is exceedingly crude but i am free to say it is less crude than i expected it to be and considerably better work than i believed you could do it is too crude to offer to any prominent periodical so i shall speak to the n y weekly people to publish it there will be to bury it why could not same good genius have sent me to the n y weekly with my apprentice sketches  you should not publish it in book form at allfor this reason it is only an imitation of verneit is not a burlesque but i think it may be regarded as proof that verne cannot be burlesqued  in accompanying notes i have suggested that you vastly modify the first visit to hell and leave out the second visit altogether nobody would or ought to print those things you are not advanced enough in literature to venture upon a matter requiring so much practice let me show you what a man has got to go through  nine years ago i mapped out my journey in heaven i discussed it with literary friends whom i could trust to keep it to themselves  i gave it a deal of thought from time to time after a year or more i wrote it up it was not a success five years ago i wrote it again altering the plan that ms is at my elbow now it was a considerable improvement on the first attempt but still it wouldnt dolast year and year before i talked frequently with howells about the subject and he kept urging me to do it again  so i thought and thought at odd moments and at last i struck what i considered to be the right plan mind i have never altered the ideas from the firstthe plan was the difficulty when howells was here last i laid before him the whole story without referring to my ms and he said you have got it sure this time but drop the idea of making mere magazine stuff of it dont waste it print it by itselfpublish it first in englandask dean stanley to endorse it which will draw some of the teeth of the religious press and then reprint in america i doubt my ability to get dean stanley to do anything of the sort but i shall do the restand this is all a secret which you must not divulge  now look herei have tried all these years to think of some way of doing hell tooand have always had to give it up hell in my book will not occupy five pages of ms i judgeit will be only covert hints i suppose and quickly dropped i may end by not even referring to it  and mind you in my opinion you will find that you cant write up hell so it will stand printing neither howells nor i believe in hell or the divinity of the savior but no matter the savior is none the less a sacred personage and a man should have no desire or disposition to refer to him lightly profanely or otherwise than with the profoundest reverence  the only safe thing is not to introduce him or refer to him at all i suspect i have entirely rewritten one book 3 perhaps 4 times changing the plan every time1200 pages of ms wasted and burnedand shall tackle it again one of these years and maybe succeed at last therefore you need not expect to get your book right the first time go to work and revamp or rewrite it god only exhibits his thunder and lightning at intervals and so they always command attention these are gods adjectives you thunder and lightning too much the reader ceases to get under the bed by and by  mr perkins will send you and ma your checks when we are gone but dont write him ever except a single line in case he forgets the checksfor the man is driven to death with work  i see you are half promising yourself a monthly return for your book in my experience previously counted chickens never do hatch how many of mine i have counted and never a one of them but failed it is much better to hedge disappointment by not countingunexpected money is a delight the same sum is a bitterness when you expected more  my time in america is growing mighty short perhaps we can manage in this way imprimis if the n y weekly people know that you are my brother they will turn that fact into an advertisementa thing of value to them but not to you and me this must be prevented i will write them a note to say you have a friend near keokuk charles s miller who has a ms for sale which you think is a pretty clever travesty on verne and if they want it they might write to him in your care then if any correspondence ensues between you and them let mollie write for you and sign your nameyour own hand writing representing millers keep yourself out of sight till you make a strike on your own merits there is no other way to get a fair verdict upon your merits  laterive written the note to smith and with nothing in it which he can use as an advertisement im

taylor      dinner mentioned was a farewell banquet given to bayard taylor who      had been appointed minister to germany and was to sail on the ship      with mark twain  mark twains mother was visiting in fredonia when      this letter was written       to mrs jane clemens in fredonia                                                    apr  7 78  my dear motheri have told livy all about annies beautiful house and about sam and charley and about charleys ingenious manufactures and his strong manhood and good promise and how glad i am that he and annie married and i have told her about annies excellent housekeeping also about the great bacon conflict i told you it was a hundred to one that neither livy nor the european powers had heard of that desolating struggle  and i have told her how beautiful you are in your age and how bright your mind is with its oldtime brightness and how she and the children would enjoy you and i have told her how singularly young pamela is looking and what a fine large fellow sam is and how ill the lingering syllable my to his name fits his port and figure  well pamela after thinking it over for a day or so i came near inquiring about a stateroom in our ship for sam to please you but my wiser former resolution came back to me it is not for his good that he have friends in the ship his conduct in the bacon business shows that he will develop rapidly into a manly man as soon as he is cast loose from your apron strings  you dont teach him to push ahead and do and dare things for himself but you do just the reverse you are assisted in your damaging work by the tyrannous ways of a villagevillagers watch each other and so make cowards of each other after sam shall have voyaged to europe by himself and rubbed against the world and taken and returned its cuffs do you think he will hesitate to escort a guest into any whiskymill in fredonia when he himself has no sinful business to transact there no he will smile at the idea if he avoids this courtesy now from principle of course i find no fault with it at allonly if he thinks it is principle he may be mistaken a close examination may show it is only a bowing to the tyranny of public opinion  i only say it mayi cannot venture to say it will hartford is not a large place but it is broader than to have ways of that sort three or four weeks ago at a moody and sankey meeting the preacher read a letter from somebody exposing the fact that a prominent clergyman had gone from one of those meetings bought a bottle of lager beer and drank it on the premises a drug store  a tempest of indignation swept the town our clergymen and everybody else said the culprit had not only done an innocent thing but had done it in an open manly way and it was nobodys right or business to find fault with it perhaps this dangerous latitude comes of the fact that we never have any temperance rot going on in hartford  i find here a letter from orion submitting some new matter in his story for criticism when you write him please tell him to do the best he can and bang away i can do nothing further in this matter for i have but 3 days left in which to settle a deal of important business and answer a bushel and a half of letters i am very nearly tired to death  i was so jaded and worn at the taylor dinner that i found i could not remember 3 sentences of the speech i had memorized and therefore got up and said so and excused myself from speaking i arrived here at 3 oclock this morning i think the next 3 days will finish me the idea of sitting down to a job of literary criticism is simply ludicrous  a young lady passenger in our ship has been placed under livys charge livy couldnt easily get out of it and did not want to on her own account but fully expected i would make trouble when i heard of it but i didnt a girl cant well travel alone so i offered no objection she leaves us at hamburg so ive got 6 people in my care nowwhich is just 6 too many for a man of my unexecutive capacity i expect nothing else but to lose some of them overboard  we send our loving goodbyes to all the household and hope to see you again after a spell                           affly yrs                                         sam        there are no other american letters of this period  the clemens      party which included miss clara spaulding of elmira sailed as      planned on the holsatia april 11 1878  as before stated bayard      taylor was on the ship also murat halstead and family  on the eve      of departure clemens sent to howells this farewell word       and that reminds me ungrateful dog that i am that i owe as much      to your training as the rude country jobprinter owes to the city      boss who takes him in hand and teaches him the right way to handle      his art  i was talking to mrs clemens about this the other day      and grieving because i never mentioned it to you thereby seeming to      ignore it or to be unaware of it  nothing that has passed under      your eye needs any revision before going into a volume while all my      other stuff does need so much       a characteristic tribute and from the heart       the first european letter came from frankfort a rest on their way      to heidelberg       to w d howells in boston                                     frankfort on the main may 4 1878  my dear howellsi only propose to write a single line to say we are still around ah i have such a deep grateful unutterable sense of being out of it all i think i foretaste some of the advantages of being dead some of the joy of it i dont read any newspapers or care for them when people tell me england has declared war i drop the subject feeling that it is none of my business when they tell me mrs tilton has confessed and mr b denied i say both of them have done that before therefore let the worn stub of the plymouth whitewash brush be brought out once more and let the faithful spit on their hands and get to work again regardless of mefor i am out of it all  we had 2 almost devilish weeks at sea and i tell you bayard taylor is a really lovable manwhich you already knew then we staid a week in the beautiful the very beautiful city of hamburg and since then we have been fooling along 4 hours per day by rail with a courier spending the other 20 in hotels whose enormous bedchambers and private parlors are an overpowering marvel to me day before yesterday in cassel we had a love of a bedroom 31 feet long and a parlor with 2 sofas 12 chairs a writing desk and 4 tables scattered around here and there in it made of red silk too by george  the times and times i wish you were along you could throw some fun into the journey whereas i go on day by day in a smileless state of solemn admiration  what a paradise this is what clean clothes what good faces what tranquil contentment what prosperity what genuine freedom what superb government and i am so happy for i am responsible for none of it i am only here to enjoy how charmed i am when i overhear a german word which i understand with love from us 2 to you 2                                               mark  p s we are not taking six days to go from hamburg to heidelberg because we prefer it quite on the contrary mrs clemens picked up a dreadful cold and sore throat on board ship and still keeps them in stockso she could only travel 4 hours a day she wanted to dive straight through but i had different notions about the wisdom of it i found that 4 hours a day was the best she could do before i forget it our permanent address is care messrs koester  co backers heidelberg we go there tomorrow  poor susy from the day we reached german soil we have required rosa to speak german to the childrenwhich they hate with all their souls the other morning in hanover susy came to us from rosa in the nursery and said in halting syllables papa vie viel uhr ist esthen turned with pathos in her big eyes and said mamma i wish rosa was made in english  unfinished        frankfort was a brief haltingplace their destination being      heidelberg  they were presently located there in the beautiful      schloss hotel which overlooks the old castle with its forest      setting the flowing neckar and the distant valley of the rhine      clemens who had discovered the location and loved it toward the      end of may reported to howells his felicities       fragment of a letter to w d howells in boston                                     schlosshotel heidelberg                                     sunday a m may 26 1878  my dear howellsdivinely located from this airy porch among the shining groves we look down upon heidelberg castle and upon the swift neckar and the town and out over the wide green level of the rhine valleya marvelous prospect we are in a culdesac formed of hillranges and river we are on the side of a steep mountain the river at our feet is walled on its other side yes on both sides by a steep and wooded mountainrange which rises abruptly aloft from the waters edge portions of these mountains are densely wooded the plain of the rhine seen through the mouth of this pocket has many and peculiar charms for the eye  our bedroom has two great glass birdcages enclosed balconies one looking toward the rhine valley and sunset the other looking up the neckar culdesac and naturally we spend nearly all our time in thesewhen one is sunny the other is shady we have tables and chairs in them we do our reading writing studying smoking and suppering in them  the view from these birdcages is my despair the pictures change from one enchanting aspect to another in ceaseless procession never keeping one form half an hour and never taking on an unlovely one  and then heidelberg on a dark night it is massed away down there almost right under us you know and stretches off toward the valley its curved and interlacing streets are a cobweb beaded thick with lightsa wonderful thing to see then the rows of lights on the arched bridges and their glinting reflections in the water and away at the far end the eisenbahnhof with its twenty solid acres of glittering gasjets a huge garden as one may say whose every plant is a flame  these balconies are the darlingest things i have spent all the morning in this north one counting big and little it has 256 panes of glass in it so one is in effect right out in the free sunshine and yet sheltered from wind and rainand likewise doored and curtained from whatever may be going on in the bedroom it must have been a noble genius who devised this hotel lord how blessed is the repose the tranquillity of this place only two sounds the happy clamor of the birds in the groves and the muffled music of the neckar tumbling over the opposing dykes it is no hardship to lie awake awhile nights for this subdued roar has exactly the sound of a steady rain beating upon a roof it is so healing to the spirit and it bears up the thread of ones imaginings as the accompaniment bears up a song  while livy and miss spaulding have been writing at this table i have sat tilted back near by with a pipe and the last atlantic and read charley warners article with prodigious enjoyment i think it is exquisite i think it must be the roundest and broadest and completest short essay he has ever written it is clear and compact and charmingly done  the hotel grounds join and communicate with the castle grounds so we and the children loaf in the winding paths of those leafy vastnesses a great deal and drink beer and listen to excellent music  when we first came to this hotel a couple of weeks ago i pointed to a house across the river and said i meant to rent the centre room on the 3d floor for a workroom jokingly we got to speaking of it as my office and amused ourselves with watching my people daily in their small grounds and trying to make out what we could of their dress c without a glass well i loafed along there one day and found on that house the only sign of the kind on that side of the river moblirte wohnung zu vermiethen i went in and rented that very room which i had long ago selected there was only one other room in the whole doublehouse unrented  it occurs to me that i made a great mistake in not thinking to deliver a very bad german speech every other sentence pieced out with english at the bayard taylor banquet in new york i think i could have made it one of the features of the occasionhe used this plan at a gathering of the american students in heidelberg on july 4th with great effect so his idea was not wasted  we left hartford before the end of march and i have been idle ever since i have waited for a call to go to worki knew it would come well it began to come a week ago my notebook comes out more and more frequently every day since 3 days ago i concluded to move my manuscript over to my den now the call is loud and decided at last so tomorrow i shall begin regular steady work and stick to it till middle of july or 1st august when i look for twichell we will then walk about germany 2 or 3 weeks and then ill go to work againperhaps in munich  we both send a power of love to the howellses and we do wish you were here are you in the new house tell us about it                                               yrs ever                                                   mark        there has been no former mention in the letters of the coming of      twichell yet this had been a part of the european plan  mark twain      had invited his walking companion to make a tramp with him through      europe as his guest  material for the new book would grow faster      with twichell as a companion and these two in spite of their widely      opposed views concerning providence and the general scheme of      creation were wholly congenial comrades  twichell in hartford      expecting to receive the final summons to start wrote oh my do      you realize mark what a symposium it is to be  i do  to begin      with i am thoroughly tired and the rest will be worth everything      to walk with you and talk with you for weeks togetherwhy its my      dream of luxury       august 1st brought twichell and the friends set out without delay      on a tramp through the black forest making short excursions at      first but presently extending them in the direction of switzerland      mrs clemens and the others remained in heidelberg to follow at      their leisure  to mrs clemens her husband sent frequent reports of      their wanderings  it will be seen that their tramp did not confine      itself to pedestrianism though they did in fact walk a great      deal and mark twain in a note to his mother declared i loathe all      travel except on foot  the reports to mrs clemens follow       letters to mrs clemens in heidelberg                                allerheiligen  aug 5 1878   830 pm  livy darling we had a rattling good time today but we came very near being left at badenbaden for instead of waiting in the waitingroom we sat down on the platform to wait where the trains come in from the other direction we sat there full ten minutesand then all of a sudden it occurred to me that that was not the right place  on the train the principal of the big english school at nauheim of which mr scheiding was a teacher introduced himself to me and then he mapped out our day for us for today and tomorrow and also drew a map and gave us directions how to proceed through switzerland he had his entire school with him taking them on a prodigious trip through switzerlandtickets for the round trip ten dollars apiece he has done this annually for 10 years we took a post carriage from aachen to otterhofen for 7 marksstopped at the pflug to drink beer and saw that pretty girl again at a distance her father mother and two brothers received me like an ancient customer and sat down and talked as long as i had any german left the big room was full of redvested farmers the gemeindrath of the district with the burgermeister at the head drinking beer and talking public business they had held an election and chosen a new member and had been drinking beer at his expense for several hours it was intensely blackforesty  there was an australian there a student from stuttgart or somewhere and joe told him who i was and he laid himself out to make our course plain for usso i am certain we cant get lost between here and heidelberg  we walked the carriage road till we came to that place where one sees the foot path on the other side of the ravine then we crossed over and took that for a good while we were in a dense forest and judged we were lost but met a native women who said we were all right we fooled along and got there at 6 pmate supper then followed down the ravine to the foot of the falls then struck into a blind path to see where it would go and just about dark we fetched up at the devils pulpit on top of the hills then home and now to bed pretty sleepy joe sends love and i send a thousand times as much my darling                                                    s l c                                                     hotel gennin  livy darling we had a lovely day jogged right along with a good horse and sensible driverthe last two hours right behind an open carriage filled with a pleasant german familyold gentleman and 3 pretty daughters at table dhote tonight 3 dishes were enough for me and then i bored along tediously through the bill of fare with a backache not daring to get up and bow to the german family and leave i meant to sit it through and make them get up and do the bowing but at last joe took pity on me and said he would get up and drop them a curtsy and put me out of my misery i was grateful he got up and delivered a succession of frank and hearty bows accompanying them with an atmosphere of goodfellowship which would have made even an english family surrender of course the germans respondedthen i got right up and they had to respond to my salaams too so that was done  we walked up a gorge and saw a tumbling waterfall which was nothing to giessbach but it made me resolve to drop you a line and urge you to go and see giessbach illuminated dont failbut take a long days rest first i love you sweetheart                                               saml                                      over the gemmi pass                                     430 pm  saturday aug 24 1878  livy darling joe and i have had a most noble day started to climb on foot at 830 this morning among the grandest peaks every half hour carried us back a month in the season we left them harvesting 2d crop of hay at 9 we were in july and found ripe strawberries at 930 we were in june and gathered flowers belonging to that month at 10 we were in may and gathered a flower which appeared in heidelberg the 17th of that month also forgetmenots which disappeared from heidelberg about midmay at 1130 we were in april by the flowers at noon we had rain and hail mixed and wind and enveloping fogs and considered it march at 1230 we had snowbanks above us and snowbanks below us and considered it february not good february though because in the midst of the wild desolation the forgetmenot still bloomed lovely as ever  what a flower garden the gemmi pass is after i had got my hands full joe made me a paper bag which i pinned to my lapel and filled with choice specimens i gathered no flowers which i had ever gathered before except 4 or 5 kinds we took it leisurely and i picked all i wanted to i mailed my harvest to you a while ago dont send it to mrs brooks until you have looked it over flower by flower it will pay  among the clouds and everlasting snows i found a brave and bright little forgetmenot growing in the very midst of a smashed and tumbled stonedebris just as cheerful as if the barren and awful domes and ramparts that towered around were the blessed walls of heaven i thought how lilly warner would be touched by such a gracious surprise if she instead of i had seen it so i plucked it and have mailed it to her with a note  our walk was 7 hoursthe last 2 down a path as steep as a ladder almost cut in the face of a mighty precipice people are not allowed to ride down it this part of the days work taxed our knees i tell you we have been loafing about this village leukerbad for an hour now we stay here over sunday not tired at all joes hat fell over the precipiceso he came here bareheaded i love you my darling                                               saml                                           st nicholas aug 26th 78  livy darling we came through awhooping today 6 hours tramp up steep hills and down steep hills in mud and water shoedeep and in a steady pouring rain which never moderated a moment i was as chipper and fresh as a lark all the way and arrived without the slightest sense of fatigue but we were soaked and my shoes full of water so we ate at once stripped and went to bed for 2 12 hours while our traps were thoroughly dried and our boots greased in addition then we put our clothes on hot and went to table dhote  made some nice english friends and shall see them at zermatt tomorrow  gathered a small bouquet of new flowers but they got spoiled i sent you a safetymatch box full of flowers last night from leukerbad  i have just telegraphed you to wire the family news to me at riffel tomorrow i do hope you are all well and having as jolly a time as we are for i love you sweetheart and also in a measure the bayslittle susys word for babiesgive my love to clara spaulding and also to the cubs                                            saml        this as far as it goes is a truer and better account of the      excursion than mark twain gave in the book that he wrote later  a      tramp abroad has a quality of burlesque in it which did not belong      to the journey at all but was invented to satisfy the craving for      what the public conceived to be mark twains humor  the serious      portions of the book are much more pleasingmore like himself      the entire journey as will be seen lasted one week more than a      month       twichell also made his reports home some of which give us      interesting pictures of his walking partner  in one place he wrote      mark is a queer fellow  there is nothing he so delights in as a      swift strong stream  you can hardly get him to leave one when once      he is within the influence of its fascinations       twichell tells how at kandersteg they were out together one evening      where a brook comes plunging down from gasternthal and how he pushed      in a drift to see it go racing along the current  when i got back      to the path mark was running down stream after it as hard as he      could go throwing up his hands and shouting in the wildest ecstasy      and when a piece went over a fall and emerged to view in the foam      below he would jump up and down and yell  he said afterward that he      had not been so excited in three months       in other places twichell refers to his companions consideration for      the feeling of others and for animals  when we are driving his      concern is all about the horse  he cant bear to see the whip used      or to see a horse pull hard  after the walk over gemmi pass he wrote mark today was immensely absorbed in flowers he scrambled around and gathered a great variety and manifested the intensest pleasure in them he crowded a pocket of his notebook with his specimens and wanted more room  whereupon twichell got out his needle and thread and some stiff paper he had and contrived the little paper bag to hang to the front of his vest  the tramp really ended at lausanne where clemens joined his party but a short excursion to chillon and chamonix followed the travelers finally separating at geneva twichell to set out for home by way of england clemens to remain and try to write the story of their travels he hurried a goodby letter after his comrade       to rev j h twichell                                                         no date  dear old joeit is actually all over i was so lowspirited at the station yesterday and this morning when i woke i couldnt seem to accept the dismal truth that you were really gone and the pleasant tramping and talking at an end ah my boy it has been such a rich holiday to me and i feel under such deep and honest obligations to you for coming i am putting out of my mind all memory of the times when i misbehaved toward you and hurt you i am resolved to consider it forgiven and to store up and remember only the charming hours of the journeys and the times when i was not unworthy to be with you and share a companionship which to me stands first after livys it is justifiable to do this for why should i let my small infirmities of disposition live and grovel among my mental pictures of the eternal sublimities of the alps  livy cant accept or endure the fact that you are gone but you are and we cannot get around it so take our love with you and bear it also over the sea to harmony and god bless you both                                                    mark        from switzerland the clemens party worked down into italy      sightseeing a diversion in which mark twain found little enough of      interest  he had seen most of the sights ten years before when his      mind was fresh  he unburdened himself to twichell and to howells      after a period of suffering       to j h twichell in hartford                                                    rome nov 3 78  dear joei have received your several letters and we have prodigiously enjoyed them how i do admire a man who can sit down and whale away with a pen just the same as if it was fishingor something else as full of pleasure and as void of labor i cant do it else in common decency i would when i write to you joe if i can make a book out of the matter gathered in your company over here the book is safe but i dont think i have gathered any matter before or since your visit worth writing up i do wish you were in rome to do my sightseeing for me rome interests me as much as east hartford could and no more that is the rome which the average tourist feels an interest in but there are other things here which stir me enough to make life worth living livy and clara spaulding are having a royal time worshiping the old masters and i as good a time gritting my ineffectual teeth over them  a friend waits for me a power of love to you all                                                    amen                                                         mark        in his letter to howells he said i wish i could give those sharp      satires on european life which you mention but of course a man      cant write successful satire except he be in a calm judicial      goodhumor whereas i hate travel and i hate hotels and i hate the      opera and i hate the old masters  in truth i dont ever seem to      be in a goodenough humor with anything to satirize it  no i want      to stand up before it and curse it and foam at the mouth or take a      club and pound it to rags and pulp  i have got in two or three      chapters about wagners operas and managed to do it without showing      temper but the strain of another such effort would burst me       from italy the clemens party went to munich where they had arranged      in advance for winter quarters  clemens claims in his report of      the matter to howells that he took the party through without the      aid of a courier though thirty years later in some comment which      he set down on being shown the letter he wrote concerning this      paragraph probably a lie  he wrote also that they acquired a      great affection for fraulein dahlweiner acquired it at once and it      outlasted the winter we spent in her house       to w d howells in boston                                     no 1a karlstrasse 2e stock                                     care fraulein dahlweiner                                     munich nov 17 1878  my dear howellswe arrived here night before last pretty well fagged an 8hour pull from rome to florence a rest there of a day and two nights then 5 12 hours to bologna one nights rest then from noon to 1030 pm carried us to trent in the austrian tyrol where the confounded hotel had not received our message and so at that miserable hour in that snowy region the tribe had to shiver together in fireless rooms while beds were prepared and warmed then up at 6 in the morning and a noble view of snowpeaks glittering in the rich light of a full moon while the hoteldevils lazily deranged a breakfast for us in the dreary gloom of blinking candles then a solid 12 hours pull through the loveliest snow ranges and snowdraped forestand at 7 pm we hauled up in drizzle and fog at the domicile which had been engaged for us ten months before munich did seem the horriblest place the most desolate place the most unendurable placeand the rooms were so small the conveniences so meagre and the porcelain stoves so grim ghastly dismal intolerable so livy and clara spaulding sat down forlorn and cried and i retired to a private place to pray by and by we all retired to our narrow german beds and when livy and i finished talking across the room it was all decided that we would rest 24 hours then pay whatever damages were required and straightway fly to the south of france  but you see that was simply fatigue next morning the tribe fell in love with the rooms with the weather with munich and head over heels in love with fraulein dahlweiner we got a larger parloran ample onethrew two communicating bedrooms into one for the children and now we are entirely comfortable the only apprehension at present is that the climate may not be just right for the children in which case we shall have to go to france but it will be with the sincerest regret  now i brought the tribe through from rome myself we never had so little trouble before the next time anybody has a courier to put out to nurse i shall not be in the market  last night the forlornities had all disappeared so we gathered around the lamp after supper with our beer and my pipe and in a condition of grateful snugness tackled the new magazines i read your new story aloud amid thunders of applause and we all agreed that captain jenness and the old man with the accordionhat are lovely people and most skillfully drawnand that cabinboy too we like of course we are all glad the girl is gone to venicefor there is no place like venice now i easily understand that the old man couldnt go because you have a purpose in sending lyddy by herself but you could send the old man over in another ship and we particularly want him along suppose you dont need him there what of that cant you let him feed the doves cant you let him fall in the canal occasionally cant you let his goodnatured purse be a daily prey to guides and beggarboys cant you let him find peace and rest and fellowship under pere jacopos kindly wing however you are writing the book not istill i am one of the people you are writing it for you understand i only want to insist in a friendly way that the old man shall shed his sweet influence frequently upon the pagethat is all  the first time we called at the convent pere jacopo was absent the next just at this moment miss spaulding spoke up and said something about pere jacopothere is more in this acting of one mind upon another than people think time he was there and gave us preserved roseleaves to eat and talked about you and mrs howells and winnie and brought out his photographs and showed us a picture of the library of your new house but not soit was the study in your cambridge house he was very sweet and good he called on us next day the day after that we left venice after a pleasant sojourn of 3 or 4 weeks he expects to spend this winter in munich and will see us often he said  pretty soon i am going to write something and when i finish it i shall know whether to put it to itself or in the contributors club that contributors club was a most happy idea by the way i think that the man who wrote the paragraph beginning at the bottom of page 643 has said a mighty sound and sensible thing i wish his suggestion could be adopted  it is lovely of you to keep that old pipe in such a place of honor  while it occurs to me i must tell you susies last she is sorely badgered with dreams and her stock dream is that she is being eaten up by bears she is a grave and thoughtful child as you will remember last night she had the usual dream this morning she stood apart after telling it for some time looking vacantly at the floor and absorbed in meditation at last she looked up and with the pathos of one who feels he has not been dealt by with evenhanded fairness said but mamma the trouble is that i am never the bear but always the person  it would not have occurred to me that there might be an advantage even in a dream in occasionally being the eater instead of always the party eaten but i easily perceived that her point was well taken  im sending to heidelberg for your letter and winnies and i do hope they havent been lost  my wife and i send love to you all                                     yrs ever                                               mark        the howells story running at this time in the atlantic and so much      enjoyed by the clemens party was the lady of the aroostook  the      suggestions made for enlarging the part of the old man are      eminently characteristic       mark twains fortythird birthday came in munich and in his letter      conveying this fact to his mother we get a brief added outline of      the daily life in that old bavarian city  certainly it would seem      to have been a quieter and more profitable existence than he had      known amid the confusion of things left behind in america       to mrs jane clemens and mrs moffett in america

old age this fact has not produced any effect upon me that i can detect  i suppose we are located here for the winter i have a pleasant workroom a mile from here where i do my writing the walk to and from that place gives me what exercise i need and all i take we staid three weeks in venice a week in florence a fortnight in rome and arrived here a couple of weeks ago livy and miss spaulding are studying drawing and german and the children have a german daygoverness i cannot see but that the children speak german as well as they do english  susie often translates livys orders to the servants i cannot work and study german at the same time so i have dropped the latter and do not even read the language except in the morning paper to get the news  we have all pretty good health latterly and have seldom had to call the doctor the children have been in the open air pretty constantly for months now in venice they were on the water in the gondola most of the time and were great friends with our gondolier and in rome and florence they had long daily tramps for rosa is a famous hand to smell out the sights of a strange place here they wander less extensively  the family all join in love to you all and to orion and mollie                                     affly                                         your son                                                   sam     xix letters 1879 return to america the great grant reunion       life went on very well in munich  each day the family fell      more in love with fraulein dahlweiner and her house       mark twain however did not settle down to his work      readily  his pleasant workroom provided exercise but no      inspiration  when he discovered he could not find his swiss      notebook he was ready to give up his travelwriting      altogether  in the letter that follows we find him much      less enthusiastic concerning his own performances than over      the story by howells which he was following in the      atlantic       the detective chapter mentioned in this letter was not      included in a tramp abroad  it was published separately      as the stolen white elephant in a volume bearing that      title  the play which he had now found dreadfully witless      and flat was no other than simon wheeler detective      which he had once regarded so highly  the stewart      referred to was the millionaire merchant a t stewart      whose body was stolen in the expectation of reward       to w d howells in boston                                          munich jan 21 1879  my dear howellsits no use your letter miscarried in some way and is lost the consul has made a thorough search and says he has not been able to trace it it is unaccountable for all the letters i did not want arrived without a single grateful failure well i have readup now as far as you have got that is to where theres a storm at sea approachingand we three think you are clear outhowellsing howells if your literature has not struck perfection now we are not able to see what is lacking it is all such truthtruth to the life every where your pen falls it leaves a photograph i did imagine that everything had been said about life at sea that could be said but no matter it was all a failure and lies nothing but lies with a thin varnish of factonly you have stated it as it absolutely is and only you see people and their ways and their insides and outsides as they are and make them talk as they do talk i think you are the very greatest artist in these tremendous mysteries that ever lived there doesnt seem to be anything that can be concealed from your awful allseeing eye it must be a cheerful thing for one to live with you and be aware that you are going up and down in him like another conscience all the time possibly you will not be a fully accepted classic until you have been dead a hundred yearsit is the fate of the shakespeares and of all genuine prophetsbut then your books will be as common as bibles i believe youre not a weed but an oak not a summerhouse but a cathedral in that day i shall still be in the cyclopedias too thus mark twain history and occupation unknownbut he was personally acquainted with howells therei could sing your praises all day and feel and believe every bit of it  my book is half finished i wish to heaven it was done i have given up writing a detective novelcant write a novel for i lack the faculty but when the detectives were nosing around after stewarts loud remains i threw a chapter into my present book in which i have very extravagantly burlesqued the detective businessif it is possible to burlesque that business extravagantly you know i was going to send you that detective play so that you could rewrite it well i didnt do it because i couldnt find a single idea in it that could be useful to you it was dreadfully witless and flat i knew it would sadden you and unfit you for work  i have always been sorry we threw up that play embodying orion which you began it was a mistake to do that do keep that ms and tackle it again it will work out all right you will see i dont believe that that character exists in literature in so welldeveloped a condition as it exists in orions person now wont you put orion in a story then he will go handsomely into a play afterwards how deliciously you could paint himit would make fascinating readingthe sort that makes a reader laugh and cry at the same time for orion is as good and ridiculous a soul as ever was  ah to think of bayard taylor it is too sad to talk about i was so glad there was not a single sting and so many good praiseful words in the atlantics criticism of deukalion                                     love to you all                                              yrs ever                                                   mark  we remain here till middle of march        in a tramp abroad there is an incident in which the author      describes himself as hunting for a lost sock in the dark in a vast      hotel bedroom at heilbronn  the account of the real incident as      written to twichell seems even more amusing       the yarn about the limburger cheese and the box of guns like the      stolen white elephant did not find place in the travelbook but      was published in the same volume with the elephant story added to      the rambling notes of an idle excursion       with the discovery of the swiss notebook work with mark twain was      going better  his letter reflects his enthusiasm       to rev j h twichell in hartford                                                    munich jan 26 79  dear old joesunday your delicious letter arrived exactly at the right time it was laid by my plate as i was finishing breakfast at 12 noon livy and clara spaulding arrived from church 5 minutes later i took a pipe and spread myself out on the sofa and livy sat by and read and i warmed to that butcher the moment he began to swear there is more than one way of praying and i like the butchers way because the petitioner is so apt to be in earnest i was peculiarly alive to his performance just at this time for another reason to wit last night i awoke at 3 this morning and after raging to my self for 2 interminable hours i gave it up i rose assumed a catlike stealthiness to keep from waking livy and proceeded to dress in the pitch dark slowly but surely i got on garment after garmentall down to one sock i had one slipper on and the other in my hand well on my hands and knees i crept softly around pawing and feeling and scooping along the carpet and among chairlegs for that missing sock i kept that up and still kept it up and kept it up at first i only said to myself blame that sock but that soon ceased to answer my expletives grew steadily stronger and strongerand at last when i found i was lost i had to sit flat down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof off with the profane explosion that was trying to get out of me i could see the dim blur of the window but of course it was in the wrong place and could give me no information as to where i was but i had one comforti had not waked livy i believed i could find that sock in silence if the night lasted long enough so i started again and softly pawed all over the placeand sure enough at the end of half an hour i laid my hand on the missing article i rose joyfully up and butted the washbowl and pitcher off the stand and simply raisedso to speak livy screamed then said who is that what is the matter i said there aint anything the matterim hunting for my sock she said are you hunting for it with a club  i went in the parlor and lit the lamp and gradually the fury subsided and the ridiculous features of the thing began to suggest themselves so i lay on the sofa with notebook and pencil and transferred the adventure to our big room in the hotel at heilbronn and got it on paper a good deal to my satisfaction  i found the swiss notebook some time ago when it was first lost i was glad of it for i was getting an idea that i had lost my faculty of writing sketches of travel therefore the loss of that notebook would render the writing of this one simply impossible and let me gracefully out i was about to write to bliss and propose some other book when the confounded thing turned up and down went my heart into my boots but there was now no excuse so i went solidly to worktore up a great part of the ms written in heidelbergwrote and tore upcontinued to write and tear upand at last reward of patient and noble persistence my pen got the old swing again  since then im glad providence knew better what to do with the swiss notebook than i did for i like my work now exceedingly and often turn out over 30 ms pages a day and then quit sorry that heaven makes the days so short  one of my discouragements had been the belief that my interest in this tour had been so slender that i couldnt gouge matter enough out of it to make a book what a mistake ive got 900 pages written not a word in it about the sea voyage yet i stepped my foot out of heidelberg for the first time yesterdayand then only to take our party of four on our first pedestrian tourto heilbronn ive got them dressed elaborately in walking costumeknapsacks canteens fieldglasses leather leggings patent walking shoes muslin folds around their hats with long tails hanging down behind sun umbrellas and alpenstocks they go all the way to wimpfen by railthence to heilbronn in a chance vegetable cart drawn by a donkey and a cow i shall fetch them home on a raft and if other people shall perceive that that was no pedestrian excursion they themselves shall not be conscious of itthis trip will take 100 pages or moreoh goodness knows how many for the mood is everything not the material and i already seem to see 300 pages rising before me on that trip then i propose to leave heidelberg for good dont you see the book 1800 ms pages may really be finished before i ever get to switzerland  but theres one thing i want to tell frank bliss and his father to be charitable toward me inthat is let me tear up all the ms i want to and give me time to write more i shant waste the timei havent the slightest desire to loaf but a consuming desire to work ever since i got back my swing and you see this book is either going to be compared with the innocents abroad or contrasted with it to my disadvantage i think i can make a book that will be no dead corpse of a thing and i mean to do my level best to accomplish that  my crude plans are crystalizing as the thing stands now i went to europe for three purposes the first you know and must keep secret even from the blisses the second is to study art and the third to acquire a critical knowledge of the german language my ms already shows that the two latter objects are accomplished it shows that i am moving about as an artist and a philologist and unaware that there is any immodesty in assuming these titles having three definite objects has had the effect of seeming to enlarge my domain and give me the freedom of a loose costume it is three strings to my bow too  well your butcher is magnificent he wont stay out of my mindi keep trying to think of some way of getting your account of him into my book without his being offendedand yet confound him there isnt anything you have said which he would see any offense inim only thinking of his friendsthey are the parties who busy themselves with seeing things for people but im bound to have him in im putting in the yarn about the limburger cheese and the box of guns toomighty glad howells declined it it seems to gather richness and flavor with age i have very nearly killed several companies with that narrativethe american artists club here for instance and smith and wife and miss griffith they were here in this house a week or two ive got other chapters that pretty nearly destroyed the same parties too  o switzerland the further it recedes into the enriching haze of time the more intolerably delicious the charm of it and the cheer of it and the glory and majesty and solemnity and pathos of it grow those mountains had a soul they thought they spokeone couldnt hear it with the ears of the body but what a voice it wasand how real deep down in my memory it is sounding yet alp calleth unto alpthat stately old scriptural wording is the right one for gods alps and gods ocean how puny we were in that awful presenceand how painless it was to be so how fitting and right it seemed and how stingless was the sense of our unspeakable insignificance and lord how pervading were the repose and peace and blessedness that poured out of the heart of the invisible great spirit of the mountains  now what is it there are mountains and mountains and mountains in this worldbut only these take you by the heartstrings i wonder what the secret of it is well time and time again it has seemed to me that i must drop everything and flee to switzerland once more it is a longinga deep strong tugging longingthat is the word we must go again joeoctober days let us get up at dawn and breakfast at the tower i should like that first rate  livy and all of us send deluges of love to you and harmony and all the children i dreamed last night that i woke up in the library at home and your children were frolicing around me and julia was sitting in my lap you and harmony and both families of warners had finished their welcomes and were filing out through the conservatory door wrecking patricks flower pots with their dress skirts as they went peace and plenty abide with you all                                          mark  i want the blisses to know their part of this letter if possible they will see that my delay was not from choice        following the life of mark twain whether through his letters or      along the sequence of detailed occurrence we are never more than a      little while or a little distance from his brother orion  in one      form or another orion is ever present his inquiries his proposals      his suggestions his plans for improving his own fortunes command      our attention  he was one of the most human creatures that ever      lived indeed his humanity excluded every form of artificiality      everything that needs to be acquired  talented trusting      childlike carried away by the impulse of the moment despite a      keen sense of humor he was never able to see that his latest plan      or project was not bound to succeed  mark twain loved him pitied      himalso enjoyed him especially with howells  orions new plan      to lecture in the interest of religion found its way to munich      with the following result       to w d howells in boston                                          munich feb 9  1879  my dear howellsi have just received this letter from oriontake care of it for it is worth preserving i got as far as 9 pages in my answer to it when mrs clemens shut down on it and said it was cruel and made me send the money and simply wish his lecture success i said i couldnt lose my 9 pagesso she said send them to you but i will acknowledge that i thought i was writing a very kind letter  now just look at this letter of orions did you ever see the grotesquely absurd and the heartbreakingly pathetic more closely joined together mrs clemens said raise his monthly pension so i wrote to perkins to raise it a trifle  now only think of it he still has 100 pages to write on his lecture yet in one inking of his pen he has already swooped around the united states and invested the result  you must put him in a book or a play right away you are the only man capable of doing it you might die at any moment and your very greatest work would be lost to the world i could write orions simple biography and make it effective too by merely stating the bald factsand this i will do if he dies before i do but you must put him into romance this was the understanding you and i had the day i sailed  observe orions careerthat is a little of it 1 he has belonged to as many as five different religious denominations last march he withdrew from the deaconship in a congregational church and the superintendency of its sunday school in a speech in which he said that for many months it runs in my mind that he said 13 years he had been a confirmed infidel and so felt it to be his duty to retire from the flock  2 after being a republican for years he wanted me to buy him a democratic newspaper a few days before the presidential election he came out in a speech and publicly went over to the democrats he prudently hedged by voting for 6 state republicans also  the new convert was made one of the secretaries of the democratic meeting and placed in the list of speakers he wrote me jubilantly of what a tenstrike he was going to make with that speech all rightbut think of his innocent and pathetic candor in writing me something like this a week later  i was more diffident than i had expected to be and this was increased by the silence with which i was received when i came forward so i seemed unable to get the fire into my speech which i had calculated upon and presently they began to get up and go out and in a few minutes they all rose up and went away  how could a man uncover such a sore as that and show it to another not a word of complaint you seeonly a patient sad surprise  3 his next project was to write a burlesque upon paradise lost  4 then learning that the times was paying harte 100 a column for stories he concluded to write some for the same price i read his first one and persuaded him not to write any more  5 then he read proof on the n y eve post at 10 a week and meekly observed that the foreman swore at him and ordered him around like a steamboat mate  6 being discharged from that post he wanted to try agriculturewas sure he could make a fortune out of a chicken farm i gave him 900 and he went to a tenhouse village a miles above keokuk on the river bankthis place was a railway station he soon asked for money to buy a horse and light wagonbecause the trains did not run at church time on sunday and his wife found it rather far to walk  for a long time i answered demands for loans and by next mail always received his check for the interest due me to date in the most guileless way he let it leak out that he did not underestimate the value of his custom to me since it was not likely that any other customer of mine paid his interest quarterly and this enabled me to use my capital twice in 6 months instead of only once but alas when the debt at last reached 1800 or 2500 i have forgotten which the interest ate too formidably into his borrowings and so he quietly ceased to pay it or speak of it at the end of two years i found that the chicken farm had long ago been abandoned and he had moved into keokuk later in one of his casual moments he observed that there was no money in fattening a chicken on 65 cents worth of corn and then selling it for 50  7 finally if i would lend him 500 a year for two years this was 4 or 5 years ago he knew he could make a success as a lawyer and would prove it this is the pension which we have just increased to 600 the first year his legal business brought him 5 it also brought him an unremunerative case where some villains were trying to chouse some negro orphans out of 700 he still has this case he has waggled it around through various courts and made some booming speeches on it the negro children have grown up and married off now i believe and their litigated townlot has been dug up and carted off by somebodybut orion still infests the courts with his documents and makes the welkin ring with his venerable case the second year he didnt make anything the third he made 6 and i made bliss put a case in his handsabout half an hours work orion charged 50 for itbliss paid him 15 thus four or five years of slaving has brought him 26 but this will doubtless be increased when he gets done lecturing and buys that law library meantime his office rent has been 60 a year and he has stuck to that lair day by day as patiently as a spider  8 then he by and by conceived the idea of lecturing around america as mark twains brotherthat to be on the bills subject of proposed lecture on the formation of character  9 i protested and he got on his warpaint couched his lance and ran a bold tilt against total abstinence and the red ribbon fanatics it raised a fine row among the virtuous keokukians  10 i wrote to encourage him in his good work but i had let a mail intervene so by the time my letter reached him he was already winning laurels as a red ribbon howler  11 afterward he took a rabid part in a prayermeeting epidemic dropped that to travesty jules verne dropped that in the middle of the last chapter last march to digest the matter of an infidel book which he proposed to write and now he comes to the surface to rescue our noble and beautiful religion from the sacrilegious talons of bob ingersoll  now come dont fool away this treasure which providence has laid at your feet but take it up and use it one can let his imagination run riot in portraying orion for there is nothing so extravagant as to be out of character with him  wellgoodbye and a short life and a merry one be yours poor old methusaleh how did he manage to stand it so long                                          yrs ever                                                   mark       to orion clemens unsent and inclosed with the foregoing to w d howells                                               munich feb 9 1879  my dear broyours has just arrived i enclose a draft on hartford for 25 you will have abandoned the project you wanted it for by the time it arrivesbut no matter apply it to your newer and present project whatever it is you see i have an ineradicable faith in your unsteadfastnessbut mind you i didnt invent that faith you conferred it on me yourself but fire away fire away i dont see why a changeable man shouldnt get as much enjoyment out of his changes and transformations and transfigurations as a steadfast man gets out of standing still and pegging at the same old monotonous thing all the time that is to say i dont see why a kaleidoscope shouldnt enjoy itself as much as a telescope nor a grindstone have as good a time as a whetstone nor a barometer as good a time as a yardstick i dont feel like girding at you any more about fickleness of purpose because i recognize and realize at last that it is incurable but before i learned to accept this truth each new weekly project of yours possessed the power of throwing me into the most exhausting and helpless convulsions of profanity but fire away now your magic has lost its might i am able to view your inspirations dispassionately and judicially now and say this one or that one or the other one is not up to your average flight or is above it or below it  and so without passion or prejudice or bias of any kind i sit in judgment upon your lecture project and say it was up to your average it was indeed above it for it had possibilities in it and even practical ones while i was not sorry you abandoned it i should not be sorry if you had stuck to it and given it a trial but on the whole you did the wise thing to lay it aside i think because a lecture is a most easy thing to fail in and at your time of life and in your own town such a failure would make a deep and cruel wound in your heart and in your pride it was decidedly unwise in you to think for a moment of coming before a community who knew you with such a course of lectures because keokuk is not unaware that you have been a swedenborgian a presbyterian a congregationalist and a methodist on probation and that just a year ago you were an infidel if keokuk had gone to your lecture course it would have gone to be amused not instructed for when a man is known to have no settled convictions of his own he cant convince other people they would have gone to be amused and that would have been a deep humiliation to you it could have been safe for you to appear only where you were unknownthen many of your hearers would think you were in earnest and they would be right you are in earnest while your convictions are new but taking it by and large you probably did best to discard that project altogether but i leave you to judge of that for you are the worst judge i know of  unfinished        that mark twain in many ways was hardly less childlike than his      brother is now and again revealed in his letters  he was of      steadfast purpose and he possessed the driving power which orion      clemens lacked but the importance to him of some of the smaller      matters of life as shown in a letter like the following bespeaks a      certain simplicity of nature which he never outgrew       to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               munich feb 24 1879  dear old joeit was a mighty good letter joeand that idea of yours is a rattling good one but i have not sot down here to answer your letterfor it is down at my studybut only to impart some information  for a months i had not shaved without crying id spend 34 of an hour whetting away on my handno use couldnt get an edge tried a razor stropsame result so i sat down and put in an hour thinking out the mystery then it seemed plainto wit my hand cant give a razor an edge it can only smooth and refine an edge that has already been given i judge that a razor fresh from the hone is this shape vthe long point being the continuation of the edgeand that after much use the shape is this vthe attenuated edge all worn off and gone by george i knew that was the explanation and i knew that a freshly honed and freshly strapped razor wont cut but after strapping on the hand as a final operation it will cutso i sent out for an oilstone none to be had but messenger brought back a little piece of rock the size of a safetymatch boxit was bought in a shoemakers shop bad flaw in middle of it too but i put 4 drops of fine olive oil on it picked out the razor marked thursday because it was never any account and would be no loss if i spoiled itgave it a brisk and reckless honing for 10 minutes then tried it on a hairit wouldnt cut then i trotted it through a vigorous 20minute course on a razorstrap and tried it on a hairit wouldnt cuttried it on my faceit made me crygave it a 5minute stropping on my hand and my land what an edge she had we thought we knew what sharp razors were when we were tramping in switzerland but it was a mistakethey were dull beside this old thursday razor of minewhich i mean to name thursday october christian in gratitude i took my whetstone and in 20 minutes i put two more of my razors in splendid conditionbut i leave them in the boxi never use any but thursday o c and shant till its edge is goneand then ill know how to restore it without any delay  we all go to paris next thursdayaddress monroe  co bankers                                     with love                                              ys ever                                                        mark        in paris they found pleasant quarters at the hotel normandy but it      was a chilly rainy spring and the travelers gained a rather poor      impression of the french capital  mark twains work did not go      well at first because of the noises of the street  but then he      found a quieter corner in the hotel and made better progress  in a      brief note to aldrich he said i sleep like a lamb and write like a      lioni mean the kind of a lion that writesif any such  he      expected to finish the book in six weeks that is to say before      returning to america  he was looking after its illustrations      himself and a letter to frank bliss of the american publishing      company refers to the frontpiece which from time to time has      caused question as to its origin  to bliss he says it is a thing      which i manufactured by pasting a popular comic picture into the      middle of a celebrated biblical oneshall attribute it to titian      it needs to be engraved by a master       the weather continued bad in france and they left there in july to      find it little better in england  they had planned a journey to      scotland to visit doctor brown whose health was not very good  in      after years mark twain blamed himself harshly for not making the      trip which he declared would have meant so much to mrs clemens      he had forgotten by that time the real reasons for not goingthe      continued storms and uncertainty of trains which made it barely      possible for them to reach liverpool in time for their      sailingdate and with characteristic selfreproach vowed that      only perversity and obstinacy on his part had prevented the journey      to scotland  from liverpool on the eve of sailing he sent doctor      brown a goodby word       to dr john brown in edinburgh                                washington hotel lime street liverpool                                                         aug  1879  my dear mr brownduring all the 15 months we have been spending on the continent we have been promising ourselves a sight of you as our latest and most prized delight in a foreign landbut our hope has failed our plan has miscarried one obstruction after another intruded itself and our short sojourn of three or four weeks on english soil was thus frittered gradually away and we were at last obliged to give up the idea of seeing you at all it is a great disappointment for we wanted to show you how much megalopis has grown she is 7 now and what a fine creature her sister is and how prettily they both speak german there are six persons in my party and they are as difficult to cart around as nearly any other menagerie would be my wife and miss spaulding are along and you may imagine how they take to heart this failure of our long promised edinburgh trip we never even wrote you because we were always so sure from day to day that our affairs would finally so shape themselves as to let us get to scotland but noeverything went wrong we had only flying trips here and there in place of the leisurely ones which we had planned  we arrived in liverpool an hour ago very tired and have halted at this hotel by the advice of misguided friendsand if my instinct and experience are worth anything it is the very worst hotel on earth without any exception we shall move to another hotel early in the morning to spend tomorrow we sail for america next day in the gallic  we all join in the sincerest love to you and in the kindest remembrance to jockson of doctor brownand your sister                                truly yours                                    s l clemens        it was september 3 1879 that mark twain returned to america by the      steamer gallic  in the seventeen months of his absence he had taken      on a traveled look and had added gray hairs  a new york paper      said of his arrival that he looked older than when he went to      germany and that his hair had turned quite gray       mark twain had not finished his book of travel in parisin fact      it seemed to him far from completeand he settled down rather      grimly to work on it at quarry farm  when after a few days no word      of greeting came from howells clemens wrote to ask if he were dead      or only sleeping  howells hastily sent a line to say that he had      been sleeping the sleep of a torpid conscience  i will feign that      i did not know where to write you but i love you and all of yours      and i am tremendously glad that you are home again  when and where      shall we meet  have you come home with your pockets full of      atlantic papers  clemens toiling away at his book was as usual      not without the prospect of other plans  orion as literary      material never failed to excite him       to w d howells in boston                                               elmira sept 15 1879  my dear howellswhen and where here on the farm would be an elegant place to meet but of course you cannot come so far so we will say hartford or belmont about the beginning of november the date of our return to hartford is uncertain but will be three or four weeks hence i judge i hope to finish my book here before migrating  i think maybe ive got some atlantic stuff in my head but theres none in ms i believe  saya friend of mine wants to write a play with me i to furnish the broadcomedy cuss i dont know anything about his ability but his letter serves to remind me of our old projects if you havent used orion or old wakeman dont you think you and i can get together and grind out a play with one of those fellows in it orion is a field which grows richer and richer the more he mulches it with each new topdressing of religion or other guano drop me an immediate line about this wont you i imagine i see orion on the stage always gentle always melancholy always changing his politics and religion and trying to reform the world always inventing something and losing a limb by a new kind of explosion at the end of each of the four acts poor old chap he is good material i can imagine his wife or his sweetheart reluctantly adopting each of his new religious in turn just in time to see him waltz into the next one and leave her isolated once more  mem orions wife has followed him into the outer darkness after 30 years rabid membership in the presbyterian church  well with the sincerest and most abounding love to you and yours from all this family i am                           yrs ever                                    mark        the idea of the play interested howells but he had twinges of      conscience in the matter of using orion as material  he wrote      more than once i have taken the skeleton of that comedy of ours and      viewed it with tears i really have a compunction or two about      helping to put your brother into drama  you can say that he is your      brother to do what you like with him but the alien hand might      inflict an incurable hurt on his tender heart       as a matter of fact orion clemens had a keen appreciation of his      own shortcomings and would have enjoyed himself in a play as much      as any observer of it  indeed it is more than likely that he would      have been pleased at the thought of such distinguished      dramatization  from the next letter one might almost conclude that      he had received a hint of this plan and was bent upon supplying      rich material        to w d howells in boston                                                    elmira oct 9 79  my dear howellssince my return the mail facilities have enabled orion to keep me informed as to his intentions twentyeight days ago it was his purpose to complete a work aimed at religion the preface to which he had already written afterward he began to sell off his furniture with the idea of hurrying to leadville and tackling silverminingthrew up his law den and took in his sign then he wrote to chicago and st louis newspapers asking for a situation as paragrapherenclosing a taste of his quality in the shape of two stanzas of humorous rhymes by a later mail on the same day he applied to new york and hartford insurance companies for copying to do  however it would take too long to detail all his projects they comprise a removal to southwest missouri application for a reporters berth on a keokuk paper application for a compositors berth on a st louis paper a rehanging of his attorneys sign though it only creaks and catches no flies but last nights letter informs me that he has retackled the religious question hired a distant den to write in applied to my mother for 50 to rebuy his furniture which has advanced in value since the salepurposes buying 25 worth of books necessary to his labors which he had previously been borrowing and his first chapter is already on its way to me for my decision as to whether it has enough ungodliness in it or not poor orion  your letter struck me while i was meditating a project to beguile you and john hay and joe twichell into a descent upon chicago which i dream of making to witness the reunion of the great commanders of the western army corps on the 9th of next month my sluggish soul needs a fierce upstirring and if it would not get it when grant enters the meeting place i must doubtless lay for the final resurrection can you and hay go at the same time confound it i doubt if i can go myself for this book isnt done yet but i would give a heap to be there i mean to heave some holiness into the hartford primaries when i go back and if there was a solitary office in the land which majestic ignorance and incapacity coupled with purity of heart could fill i would run for it this naturally reminds me of bret hartebut let him pass  we propose to leave here for new york oct 21 reaching hartford 24th or 25th if upon reflection you howellses find you can stop over here on your way i wish you would do it and telegraph me getting pretty hungry to see you i had an idea that this was your shortest way home but like as not my geography is crippled againit usually is                                               yrs ever                                                        mark        the reunion of the great commanders mentioned in the foregoing      was a welcome to general grant after his journey around the world      grants trip had been one continuous ovationa triumphal march      in 79 most of his old commanders were still alive and they had      planned to assemble in chicago to do him honor  a presidential year      was coming on but if there was anything political in the project      there were no surface indications  mark twain once a confederate      soldier had long since been completely desouthernizedat least      to the point where he felt that the sight of old comrades paying      tribute to the union commander would stir his blood as perhaps it      had not been stirred even in that earlier time when that same      commander had chased him through the missouri swamps  grant      indeed had long since become a hero to mark twain though it is      highly unlikely that clemens favored the idea of a third term  some      days following the preceding letter an invitation came for him to be      present at the chicago reunion but by this time he had decided not      to go  the letter he wrote has been preserved       to gen william e strong in chicago                                     farmington avenue hartford                                     oct 28 1879  gen wm e strong chm and gentlemen of the committee  i have been hoping during several weeks that it might be my good fortune to receive an invitation to be present on that great occasion in chicago but now that my desire is accomplished my business matters have so shaped themselves as to bar me from being so far from home in the first half of november it is with supreme regret that i lost this chance for i have not had a thorough stirring up for some years and i judged that if i could be in the banqueting hall and see and hear the veterans of the army of the tennessee at the moment that their old commander entered the room or rose in his place to speak my system would get the kind of upheaval it needs general grants progress across the continent is of the marvelous nature of the returning napoleons progress from grenoble to paris and as the crowning spectacle in the one case was the meeting with the old guard so likewise the crowning spectacle in the other will be our great captains meeting with his old guardand that is the very climax which i wanted to witness  besides i wanted to see the general again any way and renew the acquaintance he would remember me because i was the person who did not ask him for an office however i consume your time and also wander from the pointwhich is to thank you for the courtesy of your invitation and yield up my seat at the table to some other guest who may possibly grace it better but will certainly not appreciate its privileges more than i should                                with great respect                                     i am gentlemen                                very truly yours                                          s l clemens  privatei beg to apologize for my delay gentlemen but the card of invitation went to elmira n y and hence has only just now reached me        this letter was not sent  he reconsidered and sent an acceptance      agreeing to speak as the committee had requested  certainly there      was something picturesque in the idea of the missouri private who      had been chased for a rainy fortnight through the swamps of ralls      county being selected now to join in welcome to his ancient enemy       the great reunion was to be something more than a mere banquet  it      would continue for several days with processions great      assemblages and much oratory       mark twain arrived in chicago in good season to see it all  three      letters to mrs clemens intimately present his experiences his      enthusiastic enjoyment and his own personal triumph       the first was probably written after the morning of his arrival      the doctor jackson in it was dr a reeves jackson the      guidedismaying doctor of innocents abroad      to mrs clemens in hartford                                     palmer house chicago nov 11  livy darling i am getting a trifle legweary dr jackson called and dragged me out of bed at noon yesterday and then went off i went down stairs and was introduced to some scores of people and among them an elderly german gentleman named raster who said his wife owed her life to mehurt in chicago fire and lay menaced with death a long time but the innocents abroad kept her mind in a cheerful attitude and so with the doctors help for the body she pulled through they drove me to dr jacksons and i had an hours visit with mrs jackson started to walk down michigan avenue got a few steps on my way and met an erect soldierly looking young gentleman who offered his hand said mr clemens i believei wish to introduce myselfyou were pointed out to me yesterday as i was driving down streetmy name is grant  col fred grant  yes my house is not ten steps away and i would like you to come and have a talk and a pipe and let me introduce my wife  so we turned back and entered the house next to jacksons and talked something more than an hour and smoked many pipes and had a sociable good time his wife is very gentle and intelligent and pretty and they have a cunning little girl nearly as big as bay but only three years old they wanted me to come in and spend an evening after the banquet with them and gen grant after this grand powwow is over but i said i was going home friday then they asked me to come friday afternoon when they and the general will receive a few friends and i said i would col grant said he and gen sherman used the innocents abroad as their guide book when they were on their travels  i stepped in next door and took dr jackson to the hotel and we played billiards from 7 to 1130 pm and then went to a beermill to meet some twenty chicago journaliststalked sang songs and made speeches till 6 oclock this morning nobody got in the least degree under the influence and we had a pleasant time read awhile in bed slept till 11 shaved went to breakfast at noon and by mistake got into the servants hall i remained there and breakfasted with twenty or thirty male and female servants though i had a table to myself  a temporary structure clothed and canopied with flags has been erected at the hotel front and connected with the secondstory windows of a drawingroom it was for gen grant to stand on and review the procession sixteen persons besides reporters had tickets for this place and a seventeenth was issued for me i was there looking down on the packed and struggling crowd when gen grant came forward and was saluted by the cheers of the multitude and the waving of ladies handkerchiefsfor the windows and roofs of all neighboring buildings were massed full of life gen grant bowed to the people two or three times then approached my side of the platform and the mayor pulled me forward and introduced me it was dreadfully conspicuous the general said a word or soi replied and then said but ill step back general i dont want to interrupt your speech  but im not going to make anystay where you areill get you to make it for me  general sherman came on the platform wearing the uniform of a full general and you should have heard the cheers gen logan was going to introduce me but i didnt want any more conspicuousness  when the head of the procession passed it was grand to see sheridan in his military cloak and his plumed chapeau sitting as erect and rigid as a statue on his immense black horseby far the most martial figure i ever saw and the crowd roared again  it was chilly and gen deems lent me his overcoat until night he came a few minutes ago545 pm and got it but brought gen willard who lent me his for the rest of my stay and will get another for himself when he goes home to dinner mine is much too heavy for this warm weather  i have a seat on the stage at haverleys theatre tonight where the army of the tennessee will receive gen grant and where gen sherman will make a speech at midnight i am to attend a meeting of the owl club  i love you ever so much my darling and am hoping to get a word from you yet                                     saml        following the procession which he describes came the grand      ceremonies of welcome at haverleys theatre  the next letter is      written the following morning or at least soiree time the following      day after a night of ratification       to mrs clemens in hartford                                          chicago nov 12 79  livy darling it was a great time there were perhaps thirty people on the stage of the theatre and i think i never sat elbowtoelbow with so many historic names before grant sherman sheridan schofield pope logan augur and so on what an iron man grant is he sat facing the house with his right leg crossed over his left and his right bootsole tilted up at an angle and his left hand and arm reposing on the arm of his chairyou note that position well when glowing references were made to other grandees on the stage those grandees always showed a trifle of nervous consciousnessand as these references came frequently the nervous change of position and attitude were also frequent but granthe was under a tremendous and ceaseless bombardment of praise and gratulation but as true as im sitting here he never moved a muscle of his body for a single instant during 30 minutes you could have played him on a stranger for an effigy perhaps he never would have moved but at last a speaker made such a particularly ripping and bloodstirring remark about him that the audience rose and roared and yelled and stamped and clapped an entire minutegrant sitting as serene as everwhen gen sherman stepped to him laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder bent respectfully down and whispered in his ear gen grant got up and bowed and the storm of applause swelled into a hurricane he sat down took about the same position and froze to it till by and by there was another of those deafening and protracted roars when sherman made him get up and bow again he broke up his attitude once morethe extent of something more than a hairs breadthto indicate me to sherman when the house was keeping up a determined and persistent call for me and poor bewildered sherman who did not know me was peering abroad over the packed audience for me not knowing i was only three feet from him and most conspicuously located gen sherman was chairman  one of the most illustrious individuals on that stage was ole abe the historic war eagle he stood on his perchthe old savageeyed rascalthree or four feet behind gen sherman and as he had been in nearly every battle that was mentioned by the orators his soul was probably stirred pretty often though he was too proud to let on  read logans bosh and try to imagine a burly and magnificent indian in generals uniform striking a heroic attitude and getting that stuff off in the style of a declaiming schoolboy  please put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and i will scrapbook them  i only staid at the owl club till 3 this morning and drank little or nothing went to sleep without whisky ich liebe dish                                               saml        but it is in the third letter that we get the climax  on the same      day he wrote a letter to howells which in part is very similar in      substance and need not be included here       a paragraph however must not be omitted       imagine what it was like to see a bulletshredded old battleflag      reverently unfolded to the gaze of a thousand middleaged soldiers      most of whom hadnt seen it since they saw it advancing over      victorious fields when they were in their prime  and imagine what      it was like when grant their first commander stepped into view      while they were still going mad over the flag and then right in the      midst of it all somebody struck up when we were marching through      georgia  well you should have heard the thousand voices lift that      chorus and seen the tears stream down  if i live a hundred years i      shant ever forget these things nor be able to talk about them      grand times my boy grand times       at the great banquet mark twains speech had been put last on the      program to hold the house  he had been invited to respond to the      toast of the ladies but had replied that he had already responded      to that toast more than once  there was one class of the community      he said commonly overlooked on these occasionsthe babieshe      would respond to that toast  in his letter to howells he had not      been willing to speak freely of his personal triumph but to mrs      clemens he must tell it all and with that childlike ingenuousness      which never failed him to his last day      to mrs clemens in hartford                                               chicago nov 14 79  a little after 5 in the morning  ive just come to my room livy darling i guess this was the memorable night of my life by george i never was so stirred since i was born i heard four speeches which i can never forget one by emory storrs one by gen vilas o wasnt it wonderful one by gen logan mighty stirring one by somebody whose name escapes me and one by that splendid old soul col bob ingersolloh it was just the supremest combination of english words that was ever put together since the world began my soul how handsome he looked as he stood on that table in the midst of those 500 shouting men and poured the molten silver from his lips lord what an organ is human speech when it is played by a master all these speeches may look dull in print but how the lightning glared around them when they were uttered and how the crowd roared in response it was a great night a memorable night i am so richly repaid for my journeyand how i did wish with all my whole heart that you were there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of enthusiasm as i was the army songs the military music the crashing applauselord bless me it was unspeakable  out of compliment they placed me last in the listno 15i was to hold the crowdand bless my life i was in awful terror when no 14 rose at a oclock this morning and killed all the enthusiasm by delivering the flattest insipidest silliest of all responses to woman that ever a weary multitude listened to then gen sherman chairman announced my toast and the crowd gave me a good round of applause as i mounted on top of the dinner table but it was only on account of my name nothing morethey were all tired and wretched they let my first sentence go in silence till i paused and added we stand on common groundthen they burst forth like a hurricane and i saw that i had them from that time on i stopped at the end of each sentence and let the tornado of applause and laughter sweep around meand when i closed with and if the child is but the prophecy of the man there are mighty few who will doubt that he succeeded i say it who oughtnt to say it the house came down with a crash for two hours and a half now ive been shaking hands and listening to congratulations gen sherman said lord bless you my boy i dont know how you do itits a secret thats beyond mebut it was greatgive me your hand again  and do you know gen grant sat through fourteen speeches like a graven image but i fetched him i broke him up utterly he told me he laughed till the tears came and every bone in his body ached and do you know the biggest part of the success of the speech lay in the fact that the audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out of his iron serenity  bless your soul twas immense i never was so proud in my life lots and lots of peoplehundreds i might saytold me my speech was the triumph of the eveningwhich was a lie ladies tom dick and harryeven the policemencaptured me in the halls and shook hands and scores of army officers said we shall always be grateful to you for coming general pope came to bunt me upi was afraid to speak to him on that theatre stage last night thinking it might be presumptuous to tackle a man so high up in military history gen schofield and other historic men paid their compliments sheridan was ill and could not come but im to go with a general of his staff and see him before i go to col grants gen augurwell ive talked with them all received invitations from them allfrom people living everywhereand as i said before its a memorable night i wouldnt have missed it for anything in the world  but my sakes you should have heard ingersolls speech on that table half an hour ago he ran across me in the crowded halls and put his arms about me and said mark if i live a hundred years ill always be grateful for your speechlord what a supreme thing it was but i told him it wasnt any use to talk he had walked off with the honors of that occasion by something of a majority bully boy is ingersolltraveled with him in the cars the other day and you can make up your mind we had a good time  of course i forgot to go and pay for my hotel car and so secure it but the army officers told me an hour ago to rest easy they would go at once at this unholy hour of the night and compel the railways to do their duty by me and said you dont need to request the army of the tennessee to do your desiresyou can command its services  well i bummed around that banquet hall from 8 in the evening till 2 in the morning talking with people and listening to speeches and i never ate a single bite or took a sup of anything but ice water so if i seem excited now it is the intoxication of supreme enthusiasm by george it was a grand night a historical night  and now it is a quarter past 6 amso good bye and god bless you and the baysfamily word for babiesmy darlings                                                    saml   show it to joe if you want toi saw some of his friends here  mark twains admiration for robert ingersoll was very great and we may believe that he was deeply impressed by the chicago speech when we find him a few days later writing to ingersoll for a perfect copy to read to a young girls club in hartford ingersoll sent the speech also some of his books and the next letter is mark twains acknowledgment       to col robert g ingersoll                                               hartford dec 14  my dear ingersollthank you most heartily for the booksi am devouring themthey have found a hungry place and they content it and satisfy it to a miracle i wish i could hear you speak these splendid chapters before a great audienceto read them by myself and hear the boom of the applause only in the ear of my imagination leaves a something wantingand there is also a still greater lack your manner and voice and presence  the chicago speech arrived an hour too late but i was all right anyway for i found that my memory had been able to correct all the errors i read it to the saturday club of young girls and told them to remember that it was doubtful if its superior existed in our language                                truly yours                                    s l clemens        the reader may remember mark twains whittier dinner speech of 1877      and its disastrous effects  now in 1879 there was to be another      atlantic gathering a breakfast to dr oliver wendell holmes to      which clemens was invited  he was not eager to accept it would      naturally recall memories of two years before but being urged by      both howells and warner he agreed to attend if they would permit      him to speak  mark twain never lacked courage and he wanted to      redeem himself  to howells he wrote       to w d howells in boston                                               hartford nov 28 1879  my dear howellsif anybody talks there i shall claim the right to say a word myself and be heard among the very earliestelse it would be confoundedly awkward for meand for the rest too but you may read what i say beforehand and strike out whatever you choose  of course i thought it wisest not to be there at all but warner took the opposite view and most strenuously  speaking of johnnys conclusion to become an outlaw reminds me of susies newest and very earnest longingto have crooked teeth and glasseslike mamma  i would like to look into a childs head once and see what its processes are                      yrs ever                          s l clemens        the matter turned out well  clemens once more introduced by      howellsthis time conservatively it may be saiddelivered a      delicate and fitting tribute to doctor holmes full of graceful      humor and grateful acknowledgment the kind of speech he should have      given at the whittier dinner of two years before  no reference was      made to his former disaster and this time he came away covered with      glory and fully restored in his selfrespect     xx letters of 1880 chiefly to howells the prince and the pauper mark twain mugwump society       the book of travela tramp abroadwhich mark twain had      hoped to finish in paris and later in elmira for some      reason would not come to an end  in december in hartford      he was still working on it and he would seem to have      finished it at last rather by a decree than by any natural      process of authorship  this was early in january 1880  to      howells he reports his difficulties and his drastic method      of ending them       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford jan 8 80  my dear howellsam waiting for patrick to come with the carriage mrs clemens and i are starting without the children to stay indefinitely in elmira the wear and tear of settling the house broke her down and she has been growing weaker and weaker for a fortnight all that timein fact ever since i saw youi have been fighting a lifeanddeath battle with this infernal book and hoping to get done some day i required 300 pages of ms and i have written near 600 since i saw youand tore it all up except 288 this i was about to tear up yesterday and begin again when mrs perkins came up to the billiard room and said you will never get any woman to do the thing necessary to save her life by mere persuasion you see you have wasted your words for three weeks it is time to use force she must have a change take her home and leave the children here  i said if there is one death that is painfuller than another may i get it if i dont do that thing  so i took the 288 pages to bliss and told him that was the very last line i should ever write on this book a book which required 2600 pages of ms and i have written nearer four thousand first and last  i am as soary and flighty as a rocket today with the unutterable joy of getting that old man of the sea off my back where he has been roosting for more than a year and a half next time i make a contract before writing the book may i suffer the righteous penalty and be burnt like the injudicious believer  i am mighty glad you are done your book this is from a man who above all others feels how much that sentence means and am also mighty glad you have begun the next this is also from a man who knows the felicity of that and means straightway to enjoy it the undiscovered starts off delightfullyi have read it aloud to mrs c and we vastly enjoyed it  well times about upmust drop a line to aldrich                                               yrs ever                                                        mark        in a letter which mark twain wrote to his brother orion at this      period we get the first hint of a venture which was to play an      increasingly important part in the hartford home and fortunes during      the next ten or a dozen years  this was the typesetting machine      investment which in the end all but wrecked mark twains      finances  there is but a brief mention of it in the letter to      orion and the letter itself is not worth preserving but as      references to the machine appear with increasing frequency it      seems proper to record here its first mention  in the same letter      he suggests to his brother that he undertake an absolutely truthful      autobiography a confession in which nothing is to be withheld  he      cites the value of casanovas memories and the confessions of      rousseau  of course any literary suggestion from brother sam was      gospel to orion who began at once piling up manuscript at a great      rate       meantime mark twain himself having got a tramp abroad on the      presses was at work with enthusiasm on a story begun nearly three      years before at quarry farma story for childrenits name as he      called it then the little prince and the little pauper  he was      presently writing to howells his delight in the new work       to w d howells in boston                                          hartford mch 11 80  my dear howells i take so much pleasure in my story that i am loth to hurry not wanting to get it done did i ever tell you the plot of it it begins at 9 am jan 27 1547 seventeen and a half hours before henry viiis death by the swapping of clothes and place between the prince of wales and a pauper boy of the same age and countenance and half as much learning and still more genius and imagination and after that the rightful small king has a rough time among tramps and ruffians in the country parts of kent whilst the small bogus king has a gilded and worshipped and dreary and restrained and cussed time of it on the throneand this all goes on for three weekstill the midst of the coronation grandeurs in westminster abbey feb 20 when the ragged true king forces his way in but cannot prove his genuinenessuntil the bogus king by a remembered incident of the first day is able to prove it for himwhereupon clothes are changed and the coronation proceeds under the new and rightful conditions  my idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the king himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to othersall of which is to account for certain mildnesses which distinguished edward vis reign from those that preceded and followed it  imagine this facti have even fascinated mrs clemens with this yarn for youth my stuff generally gets considerable damning with faint praise out of her but this time it is all the other way she is become the horseleechs daughter and my mill doesnt grind fast enough to suit her this is no mean triumph my dear sir  last night for the first time in ages we went to the theatreto see yoricks love the magnificence of it is beyond praise the language is so beautiful the passion so fine the plot so ingenious the whole thing so stirring so charming so pathetic but i will clip from the courantit says it right  and what a good company it is and how like live people they all acted the thees and the thous had a pleasant sound since it is the language of the prince and the pauper youve done the country a service in that admirable work                                yrs ever                                         mark        the play yoricks love mentioned in this letter was one which      howells had done for lawrence barrett       onion clemens meantime was forwarding his manuscript and for once      seems to have won his brothers approval so much so that mark twain      was willing indeed anxious that howells should run the      autobiography in the atlantic  we may imagine how onion prized      the words of commendation which follow       to orion clemens                                                         may 6 80  my dear brotherit is a model autobiography  continue to develop your character in the same gradual inconspicuous and apparently unconscious way the reader up to this time may have his doubts perhaps but he cant say decidedly this writer is not such a simpleton as he has been letting on to be keep him in that state of mind if when you shall have finished the reader shall say the man is an ass but i really dont know whether he knows it or not your work will be a triumph  stop rewriting i saw places in your last batch where rewriting had done formidable injury do not try to find those places else you will mar them further by trying to better them it is perilous to revise a book while it is under way all of us have injured our books in that foolish way  keep in mind what i told youwhen you recollect something which belonged in an earlier chapter do not go back but jam it in where you are discursiveness does not hurt an autobiography in the least  i have penciled the ms here and there but have not needed to make any criticisms or to knock out anything  the elder bliss has heart disease badly and thenceforth his life hangs upon a thread                                     yr bro                                         sam        but howells could not bring himself to print so frank a confession      as orion had been willing to make  it wrung my heart he said      and i felt haggard after i had finished it  the writers soul is      laid bare it is shocking  howells added that the best touches in      it were those which made one acquainted with the writers brother      that is to say mark twain and that these would prove valuable      material hereaftera true prophecy for mark twains early      biography would have lacked most of its vital incident and at least      half of its background without those faithful chapters fortunately      preserved  had onion continued as he began the work might have      proved an important contribution to literature but he went trailing      off into bypaths of theology and discussion where the interest was      lost  there were perhaps as many as two thousand pages of it      which few could undertake to read       mark twains mind was always busy with plans and inventions many of      them of serious intent some semiserious others of a purely      whimsical character  once he proposed a modest club of which the      first and main qualification for membership was modesty  at      present he wrote i am the only member and as the modesty      required must be of a quite aggravated type the enterprise did seem      for a time doomed to stop dead still with myself for lack of      further material but upon reflection i have come to the conclusion      that you are eligible  therefore i have held a meeting and voted      to offer you the distinction of membership  i do not know that we      can find any others though i have had some thought of hay warner      twichell aldrich osgood fields higginson and a few more      together with mrs howells mrs clemens and certain others      of the sex       howells replied that the only reason he had for not joining the      modest club was that he was too modesttoo modest to confess his      modesty  if i could get over this difficulty i should like to      join for i approve highly of the club and its object  it ought      to be given an annual dinner at the public expense  if you think i      am not too modest you may put my name down and i will try to think      the same of you  mrs howells applauded the notion of the club from      the very first  she said that she knew one thing that she was      modest enough anyway  her manner of saying it implied that the      other persons you had named were not and created a painful      impression in my mind  i have sent your letter and the rules to      hay but i doubt his modesty  he will think he has a right to      belong to it as much as you or i whereas other people ought only      to be admitted on sufferance       our next letter to howells is in the main pure foolery but we get      in it a hint what was to become in time one of mask twains      strongest interests the matter of copyright  he had both a      personal and general interest in the subject  his own books were      constantly pirated in canada and the rights of foreign authors were      not respected in america  we have already seen how he had drawn a      petition which holmes lowell longfellow and others were to sign      and while nothing had come of this plan he had never ceased to      formulate others  yet he hesitated when he found that the proposed      protection was likely to work a hardship to readers of the poorer      class  once he wrote my notions have mightily changed lately      i can buy a lot of the copyright classics in paper at from three      to thirty cents apiece  these things must find their way into the      very kitchens and hovels of the country  and even if the treaty      will kill canadian piracy and thus save me an average of 5000 a      year i am down on it anyway and id like cussed well to write an      article opposing the treaty       to w d howells in belmont mass                                               thursday june 6th 1880  my dear howellsthere you stick at belmont and now im going to washington for a few days and of course between you and providence that visit is going to get mixed and youll have been here and gone again just about the time i get back bother it all i wanted to astonish you with a chapter or two from orions latest booknot the seventeen which he has begun in the last four months but the one which he began last week  last night when i went to bed mrs clemens said george didnt take the cat down to the cellarrosa says he has left it shut up in the conservatory so i went down to attend to abner the cat about 3 in the morning mrs c woke me and said i do believe i hear that cat in the drawingroomwhat did you do with him i answered up with the confidence of a man who has managed to do the right thing for once and said i opened the conservatory doors took the library off the alarm and spread everything open so that there wasnt any obstruction between him and the cellar language wasnt capable of conveying this womans disgust but the sense of what she said was he couldnt have done any harm in the conservatoryso you must go and make the entire house free to him and the burglars imagining that he will prefer the coalbins to the drawingroom if you had had mr howells to help you i should have admired but not been astonished because i should know that together you would be equal to it but how you managed to contrive such a stately blunder all by yourself is what i cannot understand  so you see even she knows how to appreciate our gifts  brisk times heresaturday these things happened our neighbor chas smith was stricken with heart disease and came near joining the majority my publisher bliss ditto ditto a neighbors child died neighbor whitmores sixth child added to his five other cases of measles neighbor niles sent

brought home insensible warners friend max yortzburgh shot in the back by a locomotive and broken into 32 distinct pieces and his life threatened and mrs clemens after writing all these cheerful things to clara spaulding taken at midnight and if the doctor had not been pretty prompt the contemplated clemens would have called before his apartments were ready  however everybody is all right now except yortzburg and he is mendingthat is he is being mended i knocked off during these stirring times and dont intend to go to work again till we go away for the summer 3 or 6 weeks hence so i am writing to you not because i have anything to say but because you dont have to answer and i need something to do this afternoon  i have a letter from a congressman this morning and he says congress couldnt be persuaded to bother about canadian pirates at a time like this when all legislation must have a political and presidential bearing else congress wont look at it so have changed my mind and my course i go north to kill a pirate i must procure repose some way else i cannot get down to work again  pray offer my most sincere and respectful approval to the presidentis approval the proper word i find it is the one i most value here in the household and seldomest get  with our affection to you both                                     yrs ever                                              mark        it was always dangerous to send strangers with letters of      introduction to mark twain  they were so apt to arrive at the wrong      time or to find him in the wrong mood  howells was willing to risk      it and that the result was only amusing instead of tragic is the      best proof of their friendship       to w d howells in belmont mass                                                         june 9 80  well old practical joker the corpse of mr xhas been here and i have bedded it and fed it and put down my work during 24 hours and tried my level best to make it do something or say something or appreciate somethingbut no it was worse than lazarus a kindhearted wellmeaning corpse was the boston young man but lawsy bless me horribly dull company now old man unless you have great confidence in mr xs judgment you ought to make him submit his article to you before he prints it for only think how true i was to you every hour that he was here i was saying gloatingly o g d you when you are in bed and your light out i will fix you meaning to kill him but then the thought would followno howells sent himhe shall be spared he shall be respected he shall travel hellwards by his own route  breakfast is frozen by this time and mrs clemens correspondingly hot good bye                      yrs ever                               mark        i did not expect you to ask that man to live with you howells      answered  what i was afraid of was that you would turn him out of      doors on sight and so i tried to put in a good word for him      after this when i want you to board people ill ask you  i am      sorry for your suffering  i suppose i have mostly lost my smell for      bores but yours is preternaturally keen  i shall begin to be      afraid i bore you  how does that make you feel       in a letter to twichella remarkable letterwhen baby jean clemens      was about a month old we get a happy hint of conditions at quarry      farm and in the background a glimpse of mark twains unfailing      tragic reflection       to rev twichell in hartford                                               quarry farm aug 29 80  dear old joeconcerning jean clemens if anybody said he didnt see no pints about that frog thats any bettern any other frog i should think he was convicting himself of being a pretty poor sort of observer i will not go into details it is not necessary you will soon be in hartford where i have already hired a hall the admission fee will be but a trifle  it is curious to note the change in the stockquotation of the affection board brought about by throwing this new security on the market four weeks ago the children still put mamma at the head of the list right along where she had always been but now                      jean                     mamma                     motley a cat                     fraulein another                     papa  that is the way it stands now mamma is become no 2 i have dropped from no 4 and am become no 5 some time ago it used to be nip and tuck between me and the cats but after the cats developed i didnt stand any more show  ive got a swollen ear so i take advantage of it to lie abed most of the day and read and smoke and scribble and have a good time last evening livy said with deep concern o dear i believe an abscess is forming in your ear  i responded as the poet would have done if he had had a cold in the head            tis said that abscess conquers love           but o believe it not  this made a coolness  been reading daniel websters private correspondence have read a hundred of his diffuse conceited eloquent bathotic or bathostic letters written in that dim no vanished past when he was a student and lord to think that this boy who is so real to me now and so booming with fresh young blood and bountiful life and sappy cynicisms about girls has since climbed the alps of fame and stood against the sun one brief tremendous moment with the worlds eyes upon him and thenfzt where is he why the only long thing the only real thing about the whole shadowy business is the sense of the lagging dull and hoary lapse of time that has drifted by since then a vast empty level it seems with a formless spectre glimpsed fitfully through the smoke and mist that lie along its remote verge  well we are all getting along here firstrate livy gains strength daily and sits up a deal the baby is five weeks old andbut no more of this somebody may be reading this letter 80 years hence and so my friend you pitying snob i mean who are holding this yellow paper in your hand in 1960 save yourself the trouble of looking further i know how pathetically trivial our small concerns will seem to you and i will not let your eye profane them no i keep my news you keep your compassion suffice it you to know scoffer and ribald that the little child is old and blind now and once more toothless and the rest of us are shadows these many many years yes and your time cometh

 september 19th  it is a pleasant letter worth preserving  the      book by aldrich here mentioned was the stillwater tragedy       to t b aldrich in ponkapog mass                                               elmira sept 15 80  my dear aldrichthank you ever so much for the booki had already finished it and prodigiously enjoyed it in the periodical of the notorious howells but it hits mrs clemens just right for she is having a reading holiday now for the first time in same months so betweentimes when the new baby is asleep and strengthening up for another attempt to take possession of this place she is going to read it her strong friendship for you makes her think she is going to like it  i finished a story yesterday myself i counted up and found it between sixty and eighty thousand wordsabout the size of your book it is for boys and girlsbeen at work at it several years off and on  i hope howells is enjoying his journey to the pacific he wrote me that you and osgood were going also but i doubted it believing he was in liquor when he wrote it in my opinion this universal applause over his book is going to land that man in a retreat inside of two months i notice the papers say mighty fine things about your book too you ought to try to get into the same establishment with howells but applause does not affect mei am always calmthis is because i am used to it  well goodbye my boy and good luck to you mrs clemens asks me to send her warmest regards to you and mrs aldrichwhich i do and add those of                      yrs ever                               mark        while mark twain was a journalist in san francisco there was a      middleaged man named soule who had a desk near him on the morning      call  soule was in those days highly considered as a poet by his      associates most of whom were younger and less gracefully poetic      but soules gift had never been an important one  now in his old      age he found his fame still local and he yearned for wider      recognition  he wished to have a volume of poems issued by a      publisher of recognized standing  because mark twain had been one      of soules admirers and a warm friend in the old days it was      natural that soule should turn to him now and equally natural that      clemens should turn to howells       to w d howells in boston                                          sunday oct  2 80  my dear howellsheres a letter which i wrote you to san francisco the second time you didnt go there i told soule he neednt write you but simply send the ms to you o dear dear it is dreadful to be an unrecognized poet how wise it was in charles warren stoddard to take in his sign and go for some other calling while still young  im laying for that encyclopedical scotchmanand hell need to lock the door behind him when he comes in otherwise when he hears my proposed tariff his skin will probably crawl away with him he is accustomed to seeing the publisher impoverish the authorthat spectacle must be getting stale to himif he contracts with the undersigned he will experience a change in that programme that will make the enamel peel off his teeth for very surpriseand joy no that last is what mrs clemens thinksbut its not so the proposed work is growing mightily in my estimation day by day and im not going to throw it away for any mere trifle if i make a contract with the canny scot i will then tell him the plan which you and i have devised that of taking in the humor of all countriesotherwise ill keep it to myself i think why should we assist our fellowman for mere love of god                                               yrs ever                                                   mark       one wishes that howells might have found value enough in the verses      of frank soule to recommend them to osgood  to clemens he wrote      you have touched me in regard to him and i will deal gently with      his poetry  poor old fellow  i can imagine him and how he must      have to struggle not to be hard or sour       the verdict however was inevitable  soules graceful verses      proved to be not poetry at all  no publisher of standing could      afford to give them his imprint       the encyclopedical scotchman mentioned in the preceding letter was      the publisher gebbie who had a plan to engage howells and clemens      to prepare some sort of anthology of the worlds literature  the      idea came to nothing though the other plan mentionedfor a library      of humorin time grew into a book       mark twains contracts with bliss for the publication of his books      on the subscription plan had been made on a royalty basis beginning      with 5 per cent on the innocents abroad increasing to 7 per      cent on roughing it and to 10 per cent on later books  bliss      had held that these later percentages fairly represented one half      the profits  clemens however had never been fully satisfied and      his brother onion had more than once urged him to demand a specific      contract on the halfprofit basis  the agreement for the      publication of a tramp abroad was made on these terms  bliss died      before clemens received his first statement of sales  whatever may      have been the facts under earlier conditions the statement proved      to mark twains satisfaction at least that the halfprofit      arrangement was to his advantage  it produced another result it      gave samuel clemens an excuse to place his brother onion in a      position of independence      to onion clemens in keokuk iowa                                               sunday oct 24 80  my dear brobliss is dead the aspect of the balancesheet is enlightening it reveals the fact through my present contract which is for half the profits on the book above actual cost of paper printing and binding that i have lost considerably by all this nonsensesixty thousand dollars i should sayand if bliss were alive i would stay with the concern and get it all back for on each new book i would require a portion of that back pay but as it is this in the very strictest confidence i shall probably go to a new publisher 6 or 8 months hence for i am afraid frank with his poor health will lack push and drive  out of the suspicions you bred in me years ago has grown this resultto wit that i shall within the twelvemonth get 40000 out of this tramp instead of 20000 twenty thousand dollars after taxes and other expenses are stripped away is worth to the investor about 75 a monthso i shall tell mr perkins to make your check that amount per month hereafter while our income is able to afford it this ends the loan business and hereafter you can reflect that you are living not on borrowed money but on money which you have squarely earned and which has no taint or savor of charity about itand you can also reflect that the money you have been receiving of me all these years is interest charged against the heavy bill which the next publisher will have to stand who gets a book of mine  jean got the stockings and is much obliged mollie wants to know whom she most resembles but i cant tell she has blue eyes and brown hair and three chins and is very fat and happy and at one time or another she has resembled all the different clemenses and langdons in turn that have ever lived  livy is too much beaten out with the baby nights to write these times and i dont know of anything urgent to say except that a basket full of letters has accumulated in the 7 days that i have been whooping and cursing over a cold in the headand i must attack the pile this very minute                           with love from us                                         y aff                                              sam 25 enclosed         on the completion of the prince and pauper story clemens had      naturally sent it to howells for consideration  howells wrote      i have read the two ps and i like it immensely it begins well and      it ends well  he pointed out some things that might be changed or      omitted and added it is such a book as i would expect from you      knowing what a bottom of fury there is to your fun  clemens had      thought somewhat of publishing the story anonymously in the fear      that it would not be accepted seriously over his own signature       the bull story referred to in the next letter is the one later      used in the joan of arc book the story told joan by uncle laxart      how he rode a bull to a funeral      to w d howells in boston                                                    xmas eve 1880  my dear howellsi was prodigiously delighted with what you said about the bookso on the whole ive concluded to publish intrepidly instead of concealing the authorship i shall leave out that bull story  i wish you had gone to new york the company was small and we had a firstrate time smiths an enjoyable fellow i liked barrett too and the oysters were as good as the rest of the company it was worth going there to learn how to cook them  next day i attended to businesswhich was to introduce twichell to gen grant and procure a private talk in the interest of the chinese educational mission here in the u s well it was very funny joe had been sitting up nights building facts and arguments together into a mighty and unassailable array and had studied them out and got them by heartall with the trembling halfhearted hope of getting grant to add his signature to a sort of petition to the viceroy of china but grant took in the whole situation in a jiffy and before joe had more than fairly got started the old man said ill write the viceroy a lettera separate letterand bring strong reasons to bear upon him i know him well and what i say will have weight with him i will attend to it right away no no thanksi shall be glad to do itit will be a labor of love  so all joes laborious hours were for naught it was as if he had come to borrow a dollar and been offered a thousand before he could unfold his case  but its getting dark merry christmas to all of you                                     yrs ever                                              mark        the chinese educational mission mentioned in the foregoing was a      thriving hartford institution projected eight years before by a      yale graduate named yung wing  the mission was now threatened and      yung wing knowing the high honor in which general grant was held in      china believed that through him it might be saved  twichell of      course was deeply concerned and naturally overjoyed at grants      interest  a day or two following the return to hartford clemens      received a letter from general grant in which he wrote li hung      chang is the most powerful and most influential chinaman in his      country  he professed great friendship for me when i was there and      i have had assurances of the same thing since  i hope if he is      strong enough with his government that the decision to withdraw the      chinese students from this country may be changed       but perhaps li hung chang was experiencing one of his partial      eclipses just then or possibly he was not interested for the      hartford mission did not survive     xxi letters 1881 to howells and others assisting a young sculptor literary plans       with all of mark twains admiration for grant he had      opposed him as a thirdterm president and approved of the      nomination of garfield  he had made speeches for garfield      during the campaign just ended and had been otherwise      active in his support  upon garfields election however      he felt himself entitled to no special favor and the single      request which he preferred at length could hardly be classed      as personal though made for a personal friend      to presidentelect james a garfield in washington                                               hartford jany 12 81  gen garfield  dear sirseveral times since your election persons wanting office have asked me to use my influence with you in their behalf  to word it in that way was such a pleasant compliment to me that i never complied i could not without exposing the fact that i hadnt any influence with you and that was a thing i had no mind to do  it seems to me that it is better to have a good mans flattering estimate of my influenceand to keep itthan to fool it away with trying to get him an office but when my brotheron my wifes sidemr charles j langdonlate of the chicago conventiondesires me to speak a word for mr fred douglass i am not asked to use my influence consequently i am not risking anything so i am writing this as a simple citizen i am not drawing on my fund of influence at all a simple citizen may express a desire with all propriety in the matter of a recommendation to office and so i beg permission to hope that you will retain mr douglass in his present office of marshall of the district of columbia if such a course will not clash with your own preferences or with the expediencies and interest of your administration i offer this petition with peculiar pleasure and strong desire because i so honor this mans high and blemishless character and so admire his brave long crusade for the liberties and elevation of his race  he is a personal friend of mine but that is nothing to the point his history would move me to say these things without that and i feel them too                 with great respect                          i am general                                    yours truly                                         s l clemens        clemens would go out of his way any time to grant favor to the      colored race  his childhood associations were partly accountable      for this but he also felt that the white man owed the negro a debt      for generations of enforced bondage  he would lecture any time in a      colored church when he would as likely as not refuse pointblank to      speak for a white congregation  once in elmira he received a      request poorly and none too politely phrased to speak for one of      the churches  he was annoyed and about to send a brief refusal      when mrs clemens who was present said       i think i know that church and if so this preacher is a colored      man he does not know how to write a polished letterhow should      he  her husbands manner changed so suddenly that she added      i will give you a motto and it will be useful to you if you will      adopt it consider every man colored until he is proved white       to w d howells in boston

winny can come you will find us ready and most glad to see youand the longer you can stay the gladder we shall be i am not going to have a thing to do but you shall work if you want to on the evening of march 10th i am going to read to the colored folk in the african church here no whites admitted except such as i bring with me and a choir of colored folk will sing jubilee songs i count on a good time and shall hope to have you folks there and livy i read in twichells chapel friday night and had a most rattling high timebut the thing that went best of all was uncle remuss tar baby i mean to try that on my dusky audience theyve all heard that tale from childhoodat least the older members have  i arrived home in time to make a most noble blunderinvited charley warner here in livys name to dinner with the gerhardts and told him livy had invited his wife by letter and by word of mouth also i dont know where i got these impressions but i came home feeling as one does who realizes that he has done a neat thing for once and left no flaws or loopholes well livy said she had never told me to invite charley and she hadnt dreamed of inviting susy and moreover there wasnt any dinner but just one lean duck but susy warners intuitions were correctso she choked off charley and staid home herselfwe waited dinner an hour and you ought to have seen that duck when he was done drying in the oven                                mark        clemens and his wife were always privately assisting worthy and      ambitious young people along the way of achievement  young actors      were helped through dramatic schools young men and women were      assisted through college and to travel abroad  among others clemens      paid the way of two colored students one through a southern      institution and another through the yale law school       the mention of the name of gerhardt in the preceding letter      introduces the most important or at least the most extensive of      these benefactions  the following letter gives the beginning of the      story      to w d howells in boston  private and confidential                                          hartford feb 21 1881  my dear howellswell here is our romance  it happened in this way one morning a month agono three weekslivy and clara spaulding and i were at breakfast at 10 am and i was in an irritable mood for the barber was up stairs waiting and his hot water getting cold when the colored george returned from answering the bell and said theres a lady in the drawingroom wants to see you a book agent says i with heat i wont see her i will die in my tracks first  then i got up with a soul full of rage and went in there and bent scowling over that person and began a succession of rude and raspy questionsand without even offering to sit down  not even the defendants youth and beauty and seeming timidity were able to modify my savagery for a timeand meantime question and answer were going on she had risen to her feet with the first question and there she stood with her pretty face bent floorward whilst i inquired but always with her honest eyes looking me in the face when it came her turn to answer  and this was her tale and her pleadiffidently stated but straightforwardly and bravely and most winningly simply and earnestly i put it in my own fashion for i do not remember her words  mr karl gerhardt who works in pratt  whitneys machine shops has made a statue in clay and would i be so kind as to come and look at it and tell him if there is any promise in it he has none to go to and he would be so glad  o dear me i said i dont know anything about arttheres nothing i could tell him  but she went on just as earnestly and as simply as before with her pleaand so she did after repeated rebuffs and dull as i am even i began by and by to admire this brave and gentle persistence and to perceive how her heart of hearts was in this thing and how she couldnt give it up but must carry her point so at last i wavered and promised in general terms that i would come down the first day that fell idleand as i conducted her to the door i tamed more and more and said i would come during the very next weekwe shall be so gladbutbut would you please come early in the weekthe statue is just finished and we are so anxiousandandwe did hope you could come this weekandwell i came down another peg and said i would come monday as sure as death and before i got to the dining room remorse was doing its work and i was saying to myself damnation how can a man be such a hound why didnt i go with her now yes and how mean i should have felt if i had known that out of her poverty she had hired a hack and brought it along to convey me but luckily for what was left of my peace of mind i didnt know that  well it appears that from here she went to charley warners there was a better light there and the eloquence of her face had a better chance to do its office warner fought as i had done and he was in the midst of an article and very busy but no matter she won him completely he laid aside his ms and said come let us go and see your fathers statue that isis he your father no he is my husband so this child was married you see  this was a saturday next day warner came to dinner and said gogo tomorrowdont fail he was in love with the girl and with her husband too and said he believed there was merit in the statue pretty crude work maybe but merit in it  patrick and i hunted up the place next day the girl saw us driving up and flew down the stairs and received me her quarters were the second story of a little wooden houseanother family on the ground floor the husband was at the machine shop the wife kept no servant she was there alone she had a little parlor with a chair or two and a sofa and the artisthusbands hand was visible in a couple of plaster busts one of the wife and another of a neighbors child visible also in a couple of water colors of flowers and birds an ambitious unfinished portrait of his wife in oils some paint decorations on the pine mantel and an excellent human ear done in some plastic material at 16  then we went into the kitchen and the girl flew around with enthusiasm and snatched rag after rag from a tall something in the corner and presently there stood the clay statue life sizea graceful girlish creature nude to the waist and holding up a single garment with one hand the expression attempted being a modified scareshe was interrupted when about to enter the bath  then this young wife posed herself alongside the image and so remaineda thing i didnt understand but presently i didthen i said  o its you  yes she said i was the model he has no model but me i have stood for this many and many an hourand you cant think how it does tire one but i dont mind it he works all day at the shop and then nights and sundays he works on his statue as long as i can keep up  she got a big chisel to use as a lever and between us we managed to twist the pedestal round and round so as to afford a view of the statue from all points well sir it was perfectly charming this girls innocence and purityexhibiting her naked self as it were to a stranger and alone and never once dreaming that there was the slightest indelicacy about the matter and so there wasnt but it will be many along day before i run across another woman who can do the like and show no trace of selfconsciousness  well then we sat down and i took a smoke and she told me all about her people in massachusettsher father is a physician and it is an old and respectable familyi am able to believe anything she says and she told me how karl is 26 years old and how he has had passionate longings all his life toward art but has always been poor and obliged to struggle for his daily bread and how he felt sure that if he could only have one or two lessons in  lessons hasnt he had any lessons  no he had never had a lesson  and presently it was dinner time and karl arriveda slender young fellow with a marvelous head and a noble eyeand he was as simple and natural and as beautiful in spirit as his wife was but she had to do the talkingmainlythere was too much thought behind his cavernous eyes for glib speech  i went home enchanted told livy and clara spaulding all about the paradise down yonder where those two enthusiasts are happy with a yearly expense of 350 livy and clara went there next day and came away enchanted a few nights later the gerhardts kept their promise and came here for the evening it was billiard night and i had company and so was not down but livy and clara became more charmed with these children than ever  warner and i planned to get somebody to criticise the statue whose judgment would be worth something so i laid for champney and after two failures i captured him and took him around and he said this statue is full of faultsbut it has merits enough in it to make up for themwhereat the young wife danced around as delighted as a child when we came away champney said i did not want to say too much there but the truth is it seems to me an extraordinary performance for an untrained hand you ask if there is promise enough there to justify the hartford folk in going to an expense of training this young man i should say yes decidedly but still to make everything safe you had better get the judgment of a sculptor  warner was in new york i wrote him and he said he would fetch up wardwhich he did yesterday they went to the gerhardts and spent two hours and ward came away bewitched with those people and marveling at the winning innocence of the young wife who dropped naturally into modelattitude beside the statue which is stark naked from head to heel nowg had removed the drapery fearing ward would think he was afraid to try legs and hips just as she has always done before  livy and i had two long talks with ward yesterday evening he spoke strongly he said if any stranger had told me that this apprentice did not model that thing from plaster casts i would not have believed it he said it is full of crudities but it is full of genius too it is such a statue as the man of average talent would achieve after two years training in the schools and the boldness of the fellow in going straight to nature he is an apprenticehis work shows that all over but the stuff is in him sure hartford must send him to paristwo years then if the promise holds good keep him there three moreand warn him to study study work work and keep his name out of the papers and neither ask for orders nor accept them when offered  well you see thats all we wanted after ward was gone livy came out with the thing that was in her mind she said go privately and start the gerhardts off to paris and say nothing about it to any one else  so i tramped down this morning in the snowstormand there was a stirring time they will sail a week or ten days from now  as i was starting out at the front door with gerhardt beside me and the young wife dancing and jubilating behind this latter cried out impulsively tell mrs clemens i want to hug heri want to hug you both  i gave them my old french book and they were going to tackle the language straight off  now this letter is a secretkeep it quieti dont think livy would mind my telling you these things but then she might you know for she is a queer girl                                yrs ever                                         mark        champney was j wells champney a portraitpainter of distinction      ward was the sculptor j q a ward       the gerhardts were presently off to paris well provided with means      to make their dreams reality in due time the letters will report      them again       the uncle remus tales of joel chandler harris gave mark twain great      pleasure  he frequently read them aloud not only at home but in      public  finally he wrote harris expressing his warm appreciation      and mentioning one of the negro stories of his own childhood the      golden arm which he urged harris to look up and add to his      collection       you have pinned a proud feather in uncleremuss cap replied      harris  i do not know what higher honor he could have than to      appear before the hartford public arm in arm with mark twain       he disclaimed any originality for the stories adding i understand      that my relations toward uncle remus are similar to those that exist      between an almanac maker and the calendar  he had not heard the      golden arm story and asked for the outlines also for some      publishing advice out of mark twains long experience      to joel chandler harris in atlanta                                               elmira ny aug 10  my dear mr harrisyou can argue yourself into the delusion that the principle of life is in the stories themselves and not in their setting but you will save labor by stopping with that solitary convert for he is the only intelligent one you will bag in reality the stories are only alligator pearsone merely eats them for the sake of the saladdressing uncle remus is most deftly drawn and is a lovable and delightful creation he and the little boy and their relations with each other are high and fine literature and worthy to live for their own sakes and certainly the stories are not to be credited with them but enough of this i seem to be proving to the man that made the multiplication table that twice one are two  i have been thinking yesterday and today plenty of chance to think as i am abed with lumbago at our little summering farm among the solitudes of the mountaintops and i have concluded that i can answer one of your questions with full confidencethus make it a subscription book mighty few books that come strictly under the head of literature will sell by subscription but if uncle remus wont the gift of prophecy has departed out of me when a book will sell by subscription it will sell two or three times as many copies as it would in the trade and the profit is bulkier because the retail price is greater  you didnt ask me for a subscriptionpublisher if you had i should have recommended osgood to you he inaugurates his subscription department with my new book in the fall  now the doctor has been here and tried to interrupt my yarn about the golden arm but ive got through anyway  of course i tell it in the negro dialectthat is necessary but i have not written it so for i cant spell it in your matchless way it is marvelous the way you and cable spell the negro and creole dialects  two grand features are lost in print the weird wailing the rising and falling cadences of the wind so easily mimicked with ones mouth and the impressive pauses and eloquent silences and subdued utterances toward the end of the yarn which chain the attention of the children hand and foot and they sit with parted lips and breathless to be wrenched limb from limb with the sudden and appalling you got it  old uncle danl a slave of my uncles aged 60 used to tell us children yarns every night by the kitchen fire no other light and the last yarn demanded every night was this one by this time there was but a ghastly blaze or two flickering about the backlog we would huddle close about the old man and begin to shudder with the first familiar words and under the spell of his impressive delivery we always fell a prey to that climax at the end when the rigid black shape in the twilight sprang at us with a shout  when you come to glance at the tale you will recollect itit is as common and familiar as the tar baby work up the atmosphere with your customary skill and it will go in print  lumbago seems to make a body garrulousbut youll forgive it                                     truly yours                                         s l clemens        the golden arm story was one that clemens often used in his public      readings and was very effective as he gave it       in his sketch how to tell a story it appears about as he used to      tell it  harris receiving the outlines of the old missouri tale      presently announced that he had dug up its georgia relative an      interesting variant as we gather from mark twains reply      to joel chandler harris in atlanta                                               hartford 81  my dear mr harrisi was very sure you would run across that story somewhere and am glad you have a drummond lightno i mean a brush lightis thrown upon the negro estimate of values by his willingness to risk his soul and his mighty peace forever for the sake of a silver sevmpunce and this form of the story seems rather nearer the true fieldhand standard than that achieved by my florida mo negroes with their sumptuous arm of solid gold  i judge you havent received my new book yethowever you will in a day or two meantime you must not take it ill if i drop osgood a hint about your proposed story of slave life  when you come north i wish you would drop me a line and then follow it in person and give me a day or two at our house in hartford if you will i will snatch osgood down from boston and you wont have to go there at all unless you want to please to bear this strictly in mind and dont forget it                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        charles warren stoddard to whom the next letter is written was one      of the old california literary crowd a graceful writer of verse and      prose never quite arriving at the success believed by his friends      to be his due  he was a gentle irresponsible soul well loved by      all who knew him and always by one or another provided against      want  the reader may remember that during mark twains great      lecture engagement in london winter of 187374 stoddard lived with      him acting as his secretary  at a later period in his life he      lived for several years with the great telephone magnate theodore      n vail  at the time of this letter stoddard had decided that in      the warm light and comfort of the sandwich islands he could survive      on his literary earnings      to charles warren stoddard in the sandwich islands                                               hartford oct 26 81  my dear charlienow what have i ever done to you that you should not only slide off to heaven before you have earned a right to go but must add the gratuitous villainy of informing me of it  the house is full of carpenters and decorators whereas what we really need here is an incendiary if the house would only burn down we would pack up the cubs and fly to the isles of the blest and shut ourselves up in the healing solitudes of the crater of haleakala and get a good rest for the mails do not intrude there nor yet the telephone and the telegraph and after resting we would come down the mountain a piece and board with a godly breechclouted native and eat poi and dirt and give thanks to whom all thanks belong for these privileges and never housekeep any more  i think my wife would be twice as strong as she is but for this wearing and wearying slavery of housekeeping however she thinks she must submit to it for the sake of the children whereas i have always had a tenderness for parents too so for her sake and mine i sigh for the incendiary when the evening comes and the gas is lit and the wear and tear of life ceases we want to keep house always but next morning we wish once more that we were free and irresponsible boarders  workone cant you know to any purpose i dont really get anything done worth speaking of except during the three or four months that we are away in the summer i wish the summer were seven years long i keep three or four books on the stocks all the time but i seldom add a satisfactory chapter to one of them at home yes and it is all because my time is taken up with answering the letters of strangers it cant be done through a short hand amanuensisive tried thatit wouldnt worki couldnt learn to dictate what does possess strangers to write so many letters i never could find that out however i suppose i did it myself when i was a stranger but i will never do it again  maybe you think i am not happy the very thing that gravels me is that i am i dont want to be happy when i cant work i am resolved that hereafter i wont be what i have always longed for was the privilege of living forever away up on one of those mountains in the sandwich islands overlooking the sea                                yours ever                                         mark  that magazine article of yours was mighty good up to your very best i think i enclose a book review written by howells      to w d howells in boston                                               hartford oct 26 81  my dear howellsi am delighted with your review and so is mrs clemens what you have said there will convince anybody that reads it a body cannot help being convinced by it that is the kind of a review to have the doubtful man even the prejudiced man is persuaded and succumbs  what a queer blunder that was about the baronet i cant quite see how i ever made it there was an opulent abundance of things i didnt know and consequently no need to trench upon the vestpocketful of things i did know to get material for a blunder  charley warren stoddard has gone to the sandwich islands permanently lucky devil it is the only supremely delightful place on earth it does seem that the more advantage a body doesnt earn here the more of them god throws at his head this fellows postal card has set the vision of those gracious islands before my mind again with not a leaf withered nor a rainbow vanished nor a sunflash missing from the waves and now it will be months i reckon before i can drive it away again it is beautiful company but it makes one restless and dissatisfied  with love and thanks                           yrs ever                                    mark        the review mentioned in this letter was of the prince and the      pauper  what the queer blunder about the baronet was the present      writer confesses he does not know but perhaps a careful reader      could find it at least in the early edition very likely it was      corrected without loss of time       clemens now and then found it necessary to pay a visit to canada in      the effort to protect his copyright  he usually had a grand time on      these trips being lavishly entertained by the canadian literary      fraternity  in november 1881 he made one of these journeys in the      interest of the prince and the pauper this time with osgood who      was now his publisher  in letters written home we get a hint of his      diversions  the monsieur frechette mentioned was a canadian poet of      considerable distinction  clara was miss clara spaulding of      elmira who had accompanied mr and mrs clemens to europe in 1873      and again in 1878  later she became mrs john b staachfield of      new york city  her name has already appeared in these letters many      times      to mrs clemens in hartford                                               montreal nov 28 81  livy darling you and clara ought to have been at breakfast in the great dining room this morning english female faces distinctive english costumes strange and marvelous english gaitsand yet such honest honorable cleansouled countenances just as these english women almost always have you know right away  but theyve come to take me to the top of mount royal it being a cold dry sunny magnificent day going in a sleigh                           yours lovingly                                         saml      to mrs clemens in hartford                                     montreal sunday november 27 1881  livy dear a mouse kept me awake last night till 3 or 4 oclockso i am lying abed this morning i would not give sixpence to be out yonder in the storm although it is only snow  the above paragraph is written in the form of a rebus illustrated with various sketches  therethats for the childrenwas not sure that they could read writing especially jean who is strangely ignorant in some things  i can not only look out upon the beautiful snowstorm past the vigorous blaze of my fire and upon the snowveiled buildings which i have sketched and upon the churchward drifting umbrellas and upon the buffaloclad cabmen stamping their feet and thrashing their arms on the corner yonder but i also look out upon the spot where the first white men stood in the neighborhood of four hundred years ago admiring the mighty stretch of leafy solitudes and being admired and marveled at by an eager multitude of naked savages the discoverer of this region and namer of it jacques cartier has a square named for him in the city i wish you were here you would enjoy your birthday i think  i hoped for a letter and thought i had one when the mail was handed in a minute ago but it was only that note from sylvester baxter you must writedo you hearor i will be remiss myself  give my love and a kiss to the children and ask them to give you my love and a kiss from                           saml      to mrs clemens in hartford                                               quebec sunday  81  livy darling i received a letter from monsieur frechette this morning in which certain citizens of montreal tendered me a public dinner next thursday and by osgoods advice i accepted it i would have accepted anyway and very cheerfully but for the delay of two daysfor i was purposing to go to boston tuesday and home wednesday whereas now i go to boston friday and home saturday i have to go by boston on account of business  we drove about the steep hills and narrow crooked streets of this old town during three hours yesterday in a sleigh in a driving snowstorm the people here dont mind snow they were all out plodding around on their affairsespecially the children who were wallowing around everywhere like snow images and having a mighty good time i wish i could describe the winter costume of the young girls but i cant it is grave and simple but graceful and prettythe top of it is a brimless fur cap maybe it is the costume that makes pretty girls seem so monotonously plenty here it was a kind of relief to strike a homely face occasionally  you descend into some of the streets by long deep stairways and in the strong moonlight last night these were very picturesque i did wish you were here to see these things you couldnt by any possibility sleep in these beds though or enjoy the food  good night sweetheart and give my respects to the cubs                                          saml        it had been hoped that w d howells would join the canadian      excursion but howells was not very well that autumn  he wrote that      he had been in bed five weeks most of the time recovering so you      see how bad i must have been to begin with  but now i am out of any      firstclass pain i have a good appetite and i am as abusive and      peremptory as guiteau  clemens returning to hartford wrote him a      letter that explains itself      to w d howells in boston                                               hartford dec 16 81  my dear howellsit was a sharp disappointmentyour inability to connect on the canadian raid what a gaudy good time we should have had  disappointed again when i got back to boston for i was promising myself half an hours look at you in belmont but your note to osgood showed that that could not be allowed out yet  the atlantic arrived an hour ago and your faultless and delicious police report brought that blamed joe twichell powerfully before me theres a man who can tell such things himself by word of mouth and has as sure an eye for detecting a thing that is before his eyes as any man in the world perhapsthen why in the nation doesnt he report himself with a pen  one of those drenching days last week he slopped down town with his cubs and visited a poor little beggarly shed where were a dwarf a fat woman and a giant of honest eight feet on exhibition behind tawdry showcanvases but with nobody to exhibit to the giant had a broom and was cleaning up and fixing around diligently joe conceived the idea of getting some talk out of him now that never would have occurred to me so he dropped in under the mans elbow dogged him patiently around prodding him with questions and getting irritated snarls in return which would have finished me earlybut at last one of joes random shafts drove the centre of that giants sympathies somehow and fetched him the fountains of his great deep were broken up and he rained a flood of personal history that was unspeakably entertaining  among other things it turned out that he had been a turkish native colonel and had fought all through the crimean warand so for the first time joe got a picture of the charge of the six hundred that made him see the living spectacle the flash of flag and tongueflame the rolling smoke and hear the booming of the guns and for the first time also he heard the reasons for that wild charge delivered from the mouth of a master and realized that nobody had blundered but that a cold logical military brain had perceived this one and sole way to win an already lost battle and so gave the command and did achieve the victory  and mind you joe was able to come up here days afterwards and reproduce that giants picturesque and admirable history but dern him he cant write itwhich is all wrong and not as it should be  and he has gone and raked up the ms autobiography written in 1848 of mrs phebe brown author of i love to steal a while away who educated yung wing in her family when he was a little boy and i came near not getting to bed at all last night on account of the lurid fascinations of it why in the nation it has never got into print i cant understand  but by jings the postman will be here in a minute so congratulations upon your mending health and gratitude that it is mending and love to you all                                yrs ever                                    mark  dont answeri spare the sick     xxii letters 1882 mainly to howells wasted fury old scenes revisited the mississippi book       a man of mark twains profession and prominence must necessarily be      the subject of much newspaper comment  jest compliment criticism      none of these things disturbed him as a rule  he was pleased      that his books should receive favorable notices by men whose opinion      he respected but he was not grieved by adverse expressions  jests      at his expense if well written usually amused him cheap jokes      only made him sad but sarcasms and innuendoes were likely to enrage      him particularly if he believed them prompted by malice  perhaps      among all the letters he ever wrote there is none more      characteristic than this confession of violence and eagerness for      reprisal followed by his acknowledgment of error and a manifest      appreciation of his own weakness  it should be said that mark twain      and whitelaw reid were generally very good friends and perhaps for      the moment this fact seemed to magnify the offense      to w d howells in boston                                          hartford jan  28 82  my dear howellsnobody knows better than i that there are times when swearing cannot meet the emergency how sharply i feel that at this moment not a single profane word has issued from my lips this mornini have not even had the impulse to swear so wholly ineffectual would swearing have manifestly been in the circumstances but i will tell you about it  about three weeks ago a sensitive friend approaching his revelation cautiously intimated that the n y tribune was engaged in a kind of crusade against me this seemed a higher compliment than i deserved but no matter it made me very angry i asked many questions and gathered in substance this since reids return from europe the tribune had been flinging sneers and brutalities at me with such persistent frequency as to attract general remark i was an angeredwhich is just as good an expression i take it as an hungered next i learned that osgood among the rest of the general was worrying over these constant and pitiless attacks next came the testimony of another friend that the attacks were not merely frequent but almost daily reflect upon that almost daily insults for two months on a stretch what would you have done  as for me i did the thing which was the natural thing for me to do that is i set about contriving a plan to accomplish one or the other of two things 1 force a peace or 2 get revenge when i got my plan finished it pleased me marvelously it was in six or seven sections each section to be used in its turn and by itself the assault to begin at once with no 1 and the rest to follow one after the other to keep the communication open while i wrote my biography of reid i meant to wind up with this latter great work and then dismiss the subject for good  well ever since then i have worked day and night making notes and collecting and classifying material ive got collectors at work in england i went to new york and sat three hours taking evidence while a stenographer set it down as my labors grew so also grew my fascination malice and malignity faded out of meor maybe i drove them out of me knowing that a malignant book would hurt nobody but the fool who wrote it i got thoroughly in love with this work for i saw that i was going to write a book which the very devils and angels themselves would delight to read and which would draw disapproval from nobody but the hero of it and mrs clemens who was bitter against the whole thing one part of my plan was so delicious that i had to try my hand on it right away just for the luxury of it i set about it and sure enough it panned out to admiration i wrote that chapter most carefully and i couldnt find a fault with it it was not for the biographyno it belonged to an immediate and deadlier project  well five days ago this thought came into my mind from mrs clemenss wouldnt it be well to make sure that the attacks have been almost dailyand to also make sure that their number and character will justify me in doing what i am proposing to do  i at once set a man to work in new york to seek out and copy every unpleasant reference which had been made to me in the tribune from nov 1st to date on my own part i began to watch the current numbers for i had subscribed for the paper  the result arrived from my new york man this morning o what a pitiable wreck of high hopes the almost daily assaults for two months consist of1 adverse criticism of p  p from an enraged idiot in the london atheneum 2 paragraph from some indignant englishman in the pall mall gazette who pays me the vast compliment of gravely rebuking some imaginary ass who has set me up in the neighborhood of rabelais 3 a remark of the tribunes about the montreal dinner touched with an almost invisible satire 4 a remark of the tribunes about refusal of canadian copyright not complimentary but not necessarily maliciousand of course adverse criticism which is not malicious is a thing which none but fools irritate themselves about  therethat is the prodigious bugaboo in its entirety can you conceive of a mans getting himself into a sweat over so diminutive a provocation i am sure i cant what the devil can those friends of mine have been thinking about to spread these 3 or 4 harmless things out into two months of daily sneers and affronts the whole offense boiled down amounts to just this one uncourteous remark of the tribune about my booknot me between nov 1 and dec 20 and a couple of foreign criticisms of my writings not me between nov 1 and jan 26 if i cant stand that amount of friction i certainly need reconstruction further boiled down this vast outpouring of malice amounts to simply this one jest from the tribune one can make nothing more serious than that out of it one jestand that is all for the foreign criticisms do not count they being matters of news and proper for publication in anybodys newspaper  and to offset that one jest the tribune paid me one compliment dec 23 by publishing my note declining the new york new england dinner while merely in the same breath mentioning that similar letters were read from general sherman and other men whom we all know to be persons of real consequence  well my mountain has brought forth its mouse and a sufficiently small mouse it is god knows and my three weeks hard work have got to go into the ignominious pigeonhole confound it i could have earned ten thousand dollars with infinitely less trouble however i shouldnt have done it for i am too lazy now in my sere and yellow leaf to be willing to work for anything but love i kind of envy you people who are permitted for your righteousness sake to dwell in a boarding house not that i should always want to live in one but i should like the change occasionally from this housekeeping slavery to that wild independence a life of dontcareadamn in a boarding house is what i have asked for in many a secret prayer i shall come by and by and require of you what you have offered me there                                          yours ever                                                   mark        howells who had already known something of the gathering storm      replied your letter was an immense relief to me for although i      had an abiding faith that you would get sick of your enterprise      i wasnt easy until i knew that you had given it up       joel chandler harris appears again in the letters of this period      twichell during a trip south about this time had called on harris      with some sort of proposition or suggestion from clemens that harris      appear with him in public and tell or read the remus stories from      the platform  but harris was abnormally diffident  clemens later      pronounced him the shyest fullgrown man he had ever met and the      word which twichell brought home evidently did not encourage the      platform idea      to joel chandler harris in atlanta                                               hartford apl 2 82  private  my dear mr harrisjo twichell brought me your note and told me of his talk with you he said you didnt believe you would ever be able to muster a sufficiency of reckless daring to make you comfortable and at ease before an audience well i have thought out a device whereby i believe we can get around that difficulty i will explain when i see you  jo says you want to go to canada within a month or six weeksi forget just exactly what he did say but he intimated the trip could be delayed a while if necessary if this is so suppose you meet osgood and me in new orleans early in maysay somewhere between the 1st and 6th  it will be well worth your while to do this because the author who goes to canada unposted will not know what course to pursue to secure copyright when he gets there he will find himself in a hopeless confusion as to what is the correct thing to do now osgood is the only man in america who can lay out your course for you and tell you exactly what to do therefore you just come to new orleans and have a talk with him  our idea is to strike across lots and reach st louis the 20th of aprilthence we propose to drift southward stopping at some town a few hours or a night every day and making notes  to escape the interviewers i shall follow my usual course and use a fictitious name c l samuel of new york i dont know what osgoods name will be but he cant use his own  if you see your way to meet us in new orleans drop me a line now and as we approach that city i will telegraph you what day we shall arrive there  i would go to atlanta if i could but shant be able we shall go back up the river to st paul and thence by rail xlots home  i am making this letter so dreadfully private and confidential because my movements must be kept secret else i shant be able to pick up the kind of bookmaterial i want  if you are diffident i suspect that you ought to let osgood be your magazineagent he makes those people pay three or four times as much as an article is worth whereas i never had the cheek to make them pay more than double                                yrs sincerely                                         s l clemens        my backwardness is an affliction wrote harris  the ordeal      of appearing on the stage would be a terrible one but my experience      is that when a diffident man does become familiar with his      surroundings he has more impudence than his neighbors  extremes      meet       he was sorely tempted but his courage became as water at the      thought of footlights and assembled listeners  once in new york he      appears to have been caught unawares at a tile club dinner and made      to tell a story but his agony was such that at the prospect of a      similar ordeal in boston he avoided that city and headed straight      for georgia and safety       the new orleans excursion with osgood as planned by clemens proved      a great success  the little party took the steamer gold dust from      st louis down river toward new orleans  clemens was quickly      recognized of course and his assumed name laid aside  the author      of uncle remus made the trip to new orleans  george w cable was      there at the time and we may believe that in the company of mark      twain and osgood those southern authors passed two or three      delightful days  clemens also met his old teacher bixby in new      orleans and came back up the river with him spending most of his      time in the pilothouse as in the old days  it was a glorious      trip and reaching st louis he continued it northward stopping      off at hannibal and quincy      to mrs clemens in hartford                                          quincy ill  may 17 82  livy darling i am desperately homesick but i have promised osgood and must stick it out otherwise i would take the train at once and break for home  i have spent three delightful days in hannibal loitering around all day long examining the old localities and talking with the greyheads who were boys and girls with me 30 or 40 years ago it has been a moving time i spent my nights with john and helen garth three miles from town in their spacious and beautiful house they were children with me and afterwards schoolmates now they have a daughter 19 or 20 years old spent an hour yesterday with a w lamb who was not married when i saw him last he married a young lady whom i knew and now i have been talking with their grownup sons and daughters lieutenant hickman the spruce young handsomelyuniformed volunteer of 1846 called on mea grisly elephantine patriarch of 65 now his grace all vanished  that world which i knew in its blossoming youth is old and bowed and melancholy now its soft cheeks are leathery and wrinkled the fire is gone out in its eyes and the spring from its step it will be dust and ashes when i come again i have been clasping hands with the moribundand usually they said it is for the last time  now i am under way again upon this hideous trip to st paul with a heart brimming full of thoughts and images of you and susie and bay and the peerless jean and so good night my love                                               saml        clemenss trip had been saddened by learning in new orleans the      news of the death of dr john brown of edinburgh  to doctor      browns son whom he had known as jock he wrote immediately on      his return to hartford      to mr john brown in edinburgh                                          hartford june 1 1882  my dear mr browni was three thousand miles from home at breakfast in new orleans when the damp morning paper revealed the sorrowful news among the cable dispatches there was no place in america however remote or however rich or poor or high or humble where words of mourning for your father were not uttered that morning for his works had made him known and loved all over the land to mrs clemens and me the loss is personal and our grief the grief one feels for one who was peculiarly near and dear mrs clemens has never ceased to express regret that we came away from england the last time without going to see him and often we have since projected a voyage across the atlantic for the sole purpose of taking him by the hand and looking into his kind eyes once more before he should be called to his rest  we both thank you greatly for the edinburgh papers which you sent my wife and i join in affectionate remembrances and greetings to yourself and your aunt and in the sincere tender of our sympathies                                faithfully yours                                         s l clemens  our susie is still megalops he gave her that name  can you spare a photograph of your father we have none but the one taken in a group with ourselves        william dean howells at the age of fortyfive reached what many      still regard his highest point of achievement in american realism      his novel the rise of silas lapham which was running as a century      serial during the summer of 1882 attracted wide attention and upon      its issue in book form took first place among his published novels      mark twain to the end of his life loved all that howells wrote      once long afterward he said most authors give us glimpses of a      radiant moon but howellss moon shines and sails all night long      when the instalments of the rise of silas lapham began to appear he      overflowed in adjectives the sincerity of which we need not doubt      in view of his quite open criticisms of the authors reading      delivery      to w d howells in belmont mass  my dear howellsi am in a state of wild enthusiasm over this july instalment of your story its perfectly dazzlingits masterlyincomparable yet i heard you read itwithout losing my balance well the difference between your reading and your writing isremarkable i mean in the effects produced and the impression left behind why the one is to the other as is one of joe twichells yarns repeated by a somnambulist goodness gracious you read me a chapter and it is a gentle pearly dawn with a sprinkle of faint stars in it but by and by i strike it in print and shout to myself god bless us how has that pallid former spectacle been turned into these gorgeous sunset splendors  well i dont care how much you read your truck to me you cant permanently damage it for me that way it is always perfectly fresh and dazzling when i come on it in the magazine of course i recognize the form of it as being familiarbut that is all that is i remember it as pyrotechnic figures which you set up before me dead and cold but ready for the matchand now i see them touched off and all ablaze with blinding fires you can read if you want to but you dont read worth a damn i know you can read because your readings of cable and your repeatings of the german doctors remarks prove that  thats the best drunk scenebecause the truestthat i ever read there are touches in it that i never saw any writer take note of before and they are set before the reader with amazing accuracy how very drunk and how recently drunk and how altogether admirably drunk you must have been to enable you to contrive that masterpiece  why i didnt notice that that religious interview between marcia and mrs halleck was so deliciously humorous when you read it to mebut dear me its just too lovely for anything wrote clark to collar it for the library  hang it i know where the mystery is now when you are reading you glide right along and i dont get a chance to let the things soak home but when i catch it in the magazine i give a page 20 or 30 minutes in which to gently and thoroughly filter into me your humor is so very subtle and elusivewell often its just a vanishing breath of perfume which a body isnt certain he smelt till he stops and takes another smell whereas you can smell other  remainder obliterated        among mark twains old schoolmates in hannibal was little helen      kercheval for whom in those early days he had a very tender spot      indeed  but she married another schoolmate john garth who in time      became a banker highly respected and a great influence  john and      helen garth have already been mentioned in the letter of may 17th      to john garth in hannibal                                               hartford july 3 82  dear johnyour letter of june 19 arrived just one day after we ought to have been in elmira n y for the summer but at the last moment the baby was seized with scarlet fever i had to telegraph and countermand the order for special sleeping car and in fact we all had to fly around in a lively way and undo the patient preparations of weeksrehabilitate the dismantled house unpack the trunks and so on a couple of days later the eldest child was taken down with so fierce a fever that she was soon deliriousnot scarlet fever however next i myself was stretched on the bed with three diseases at once and all of them fatal but i never did care for fatal diseases if i could only have privacy and room to express myself concerning them  we gave early warning and of course nobody has entered the house in all this time but one or two reckless old bachelorsand they probably wanted to carry the disease to the children of former flames of theirs the house is still in quarantine and must remain so for a week or two yetat which time we are hoping to leave for elmira                      always your friend                                    s l clemens        by the end of summer howells was in europe and clemens in elmira      was trying to finish his mississippi book which was giving him a      great deal of trouble  it was usually so with his nonfiction      books his interest in them was not cumulative he was prone to grow      weary of them while the menace of his publishers contract was      maddening  howellss letters meant to be comforting or at least      entertaining did not always contribute to his peace of mind  the      library of american humor which they had planned was an added      burden  before sailing howells had written do you suppose you      can do your share of the reading at elmira while you are writing at      the mississippi book       in a letter from london howells writes of the good times he is      having over there with osgood hutton john hay aldrich and alma      tadema excursioning to oxford feasting especially at the mitre      tavern where they let you choose your dinner from the joints      hanging from the rafter and have passages that you lose yourself in      every time you try to go to your room  couldnt you and mrs      clemens step over for a little while  we have seen lots of      nice people and have been most pleasantly made of but i would      rather have you smoke in my face and talk for half a day just for      pleasure than to go to the best house or club in london  the      reader will gather that this could not be entirely soothing to a man      shackled by a contract and a book that refused to come to an end      to w d howells in london                                          hartford conn  oct 30 1882  my dear howellsi do not expect to find you so i shant spend many words on you to wind up in the perdition of some european deadletter office i only just want to say that the closing installments of the story are prodigious all along i was afraid it would be impossible for you to keep up so splendidly to the end but you were only i see now striking eleven it is in these last chapters that you struck twelve go on and write you can write good books yet but you can never match this one and speaking of the book i inclose something which has been happening here lately  we have only just arrived at home and i have not seen clark on our matters i cannot see him or any one else until i get my book finished the weather turned cold and we had to rush home while i still lacked thirty thousand words i had been sick and got delayed i am going to write all day and two thirds of the night until the thing is done or break down at it the spur and burden of the contract are intolerable to me i can endure the irritation of it no longer i went to work at nine oclock yesterday morning and went to bed an hour after midnight result of the day mainly stolen from books tho credit given 9500 words so i reduced my burden by one third in one day it was five days work in one i have nothing more to borrow or steal the rest must all be written it is ten days work and unless something breaks it will be finished in five we all send love to you and mrs howells and all the family                           yours as ever                                    mark   again from villeneuve on lake geneva howells wrote urging him this time to spend the winter with them in florence where they would write their great american comedy of ormes motor which is to enrich us beyond the dreams of avarice we could have a lot of fun writing it and you could go home with some of the good old etruscan malaria in your bones instead of the wretched pinchbeck hartford article that you are suffering from now its a great opportunity for you besides nobody over there likes you half as well as i do  it should be added that ormes motor was the provisional title that clemens and howells had selected for their comedy which was to be built in some measure at least around the character or rather from the peculiarities of orion clemens the cable mentioned in mark twains reply is of course george w cable who only a little while before had come up from new orleans to conquer the north with his wonderful tales and readings      to w d howells in switzerland                                               hartford nov  4th 1882  my dear howellsyes it would be profitable for me to do that because with your society to help me i should swiftly finish this now apparently interminable book but i cannot come because i am not boss here and nothing but dynamite can move mrs clemens away from home in the winter season  i never had such a fight over a book in my life before and the foolishest part of the whole business is that i started osgood to editing it before i had finished writing it as a consequence large areas of it are condemned here and there and yonder and i have the burden of these unfilled gaps harassing me and the thought of the broken continuity of the work while i am at the same time trying to build the last quarter of the book however at last i have said with sufficient positiveness that i will finish the book at no particular date that i will not hurry it that i will not hurry myself that i will take things easy and comfortably write when i choose to write leave it alone when i so prefer the printers must wait the artists the canvassers and all the rest i have got everything at a dead standstill and that is where it ought to be and that is where it must remain to follow any other policy would be to make the book worse than it already is i ought to have finished it before showing to anybody and then sent it across the ocean to you to be edited as usual for you seem to be a great many shades happier than you deserve to be and if i had thought of this thing earlier i would have acted upon it and taken the tuck somewhat out of your joyousness  in the same mail with your letter arrived the enclosed from orme the motor man you will observe that he has an office i will explain that this is a law office and i think it probably does him as much good to have a law office without anything to do in it as it would another man to have one with an active business attached you see he is on the electric light lay now going to light the city and allow me to take all the stock if i want to and he will manage it free of charge it never would occur to this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me to hire him on a good salary not to manage it do you observe the same old eagerness the same old hurry springing from the fear that if he does not move with the utmost swiftness that colossal opportunity will escape him now just fancy this same frantic plunging after vast opportunities going on week after week with this same man during fifty entire years and he has not yet learned in the slightest degree that there isnt any occasion to hurry that his vast opportunity will always wait and that whether it waits or flies he certainly will never catch it this immortal hopefulness fortified by its immortal and unteachable misjudgment is the immortal feature of this character for a play and we will write that play we should be fools else that staccato postscript reads as if some new and mighty business were imminent for it is slung on the paper telegraphically all the small words left out i am afraid something newer and bigger than the electric light is swinging across his orbit save this letter for an inspiration i have got a hundred more  cable has been here creating worshipers on all hands he is a marvelous talker on a deep subject i do not see how even spencer could unwind a thought more smoothly or orderly and do it in a cleaner clearer crisper english he astounded twichell with his faculty you know when it comes down to moral honesty limpid innocence and utterly blemishless piety the apostles were mere policemen to cable so with this in mind you must imagine him at a midnight dinner in boston the other night where we gathered around the board of the summerset club osgood full boyle oreilly full fairchild responsively loaded and aldrich and myself possessing the floor and properly fortified cable told mrs clemens when he returned here that he seemed to have been entertaining himself with horses and had a dreamy idea that he must have gone to boston in a cattlecar it was a very large time he called it an orgy and no doubt it was viewed from his standpoint  i wish i were in switzerland and i wish we could go to florence but we have to leave these delights to you there is no helping it we all join in love to you and all the family                                     yours as ever                                              mark     xxiii letters 1883 to howells and others a guest of the marquis of lorne the history game a play by howells and mark twain       mark twain in due season finished the mississippi book and placed      it in osgoods hands for publication  it was a sort of partnership      arrangement in which clemens was to furnish the money to make the      book and pay osgood a percentage for handling it  it was in fact      the beginning of mark twains adventures as a publisher       howells was not as happy in florence as he had hoped to be  the      social life there overwhelmed him  in february he wrote our two      months in florence have been the most ridiculous time that ever even      halfwitted people passed  we have spent them in chasing round      after people for whom we cared nothing and being chased by them      my story isnt finished yet and what part of it is done bears the      fatal marks of haste and distraction  of course i havent put pen      to paper yet on the play  i wring my hands and beat my breast when      i think of how these weeks have been wasted and how i have been      forced to waste them by the infernal social circumstances from which      i couldnt escape       clemens now free from the burden of his own book was light of      heart and full of ideas and news also of sympathy and appreciation      howellss story of this time was a womans reason  governor      jewell of this letter was marshall jewell governor of connecticut      from 1871 to 1873  later he was minister to russia and in 1874      was united states postmastergeneral      to w d howells in florence                                          hartford march 1st 1883  my dear howellswe got ourselves ground up in that same mill once in london and another time in paris it is a kind of foretaste of hell there is no way to avoid it except by the method which you have now chosen one must live secretly and cut himself utterly off from the human race or life in europe becomes an unbearable burden and work an impossibility i learned something last night and maybe it may reconcile me to go to europe again sometime i attended one of the astonishingly popular lectures of a man by the name of stoddard who exhibits interesting stereopticon pictures and then knocks the interest all out of them with his comments upon them but all the world go there to look and listen and are apparently well satisfied and they ought to be fully satisfied if the lecturer would only keep still or die in the first act but he described how retired tradesmen and farmers in holland load a lazy scow with the family and the household effects and then loaf along the waterways of the low countries all the summer long paying no visits receiving none and just lazying a heavenly life out in their own private unpestered society and doing their literary work if they have any wholly uninterrupted if you had hired such a boat and sent for us we should have a couple of satisfactory books ready for the press now with no marks of interruption vexatious wearinesses and other hellishnesses visible upon them anywhere we shall have to do this another time we have lost an opportunity for the present do you forget that heaven is packed with a multitude of all nations and that these people are all on the most familiar howthehellareyou footing with talmage swinging around the circle to all eternity hugging the saints and patriarchs and archangels and forcing you to do the same unless you choose to make yourself an object of remark if you refrain then why do you try to get to heaven be warned in time  we have all read your two opening numbers in the century and consider them almost beyond praise i hear no dissent from this verdict i did not know there was an untouched personage in american life but i had forgotten the auctioneer you have photographed him accurately  i have been an utterly free person for a month or two and i do not believe i ever so greatly appreciated and enjoyedand realized the absence of the chains of slavery as i do this time usually my first waking thought in the morning is i have nothing to do today i belong to nobody i have ceased from being a slave of course the highest pleasure to be got out of freedom and having nothing to do is labor therefore i labor but i take my time about it i work one hour or four as happens to suit my mind and quit when i please and so these days are days of entire enjoyment i told clark the other day to jog along comfortable and not get in a sweat i said i believed you would not be able to enjoy editing that library over there where you have your own legitimate work to do and be pestered to death by society besides therefore i thought if he got it ready for you against your return that that would be best and pleasantest  you remember governor jewell and the night he told about russia down in the library he was taken with a cold about three weeks ago and i stepped over one evening proposing to beguile an idle hour for him with a yarn or two but was received at the door with whispers and the information that he was dying his case had been dangerous during that day only and he died that night two hours after i left his taking off was a prodigious surprise and his death has been most widely and sincerely regretted win e dodge the fatherinlaw of one of jewells daughters dropped suddenly dead the day before jewell died but jewell died without knowing that jewells widow went down to new york to dodges house the day after jewells funeral and was to return here day before yesterday and she didin a coffin she fell dead of heart disease while her trunks were being packed for her return home florence strong one of jewells daughters who lives in detroit started east on an urgent telegram but missed a connection somewhere and did not arrive here in time to see her father alive she was his favorite child and they had always been like lovers together he always sent her a box of fresh flowers once a week to the day of his death a custom which he never suspended even when he was in russia mrs strong had only just reached her western home again when she was summoned to hartford to attend her mothers funeral  i have had the impulse to write you several times i shall try to remember better henceforth  with sincerest regards to all of you                                     yours as ever                                              mark        mark twain made another trip to canada in the interest of copyright      this time to protect the mississippi book  when his journey was      announced by the press the marquis of lorne telegraphed an      invitation inviting him to be his guest at rideau hall in ottawa      clemens accepted of course and was handsomely entertained by the      daughter of queen victoria and her husband then governorgeneral of      canada       on his return to hartford he found that osgood had issued a curious      little book for which clemens had prepared an introduction  it was      an absurd volume though originally issued with serious intent its      title being the new guide of the conversation in portuguese and      englishthe new guide of the conversation in portuguese and      english by pedro caxolino with an introduction by mark twain      osgood boston 1883 evidently the new guide was prepared by      some simple portuguese soul with but slight knowledge of english      beyond that which could be obtained from a dictionary and his      literal translation of english idioms are often startling as for      instance this one taken at random       a little learneds are happies enough for to may to satisfy their      fancies on the literature       mark twain thought this quaint book might amuse his royal hostess      and forwarded a copy in what he considered to be the safe and proper      form      to col de winton in ottawa canada                                               hartford june 4 83  dear colonel de wintoni very much want to send a little book to her royal highnessthe famous portuguese phrase book but i do not know the etiquette of the matter and i would not wittingly infringe any rule of propriety it is a book which i perfectly well know will amuse her some at most if she has not seen it before and will still amuse her some at least even if she has inspected it a hundred times already so i will send the book to you and you who know all about the proper observances will protect me from indiscretion in case of need by putting the said book in the fire and remaining as dumb as i generally was when i was up there i do not rebind the thing because that would look as if i thought it worth keeping whereas it is only worth glancing at and casting aside  will you please present my compliments to mrs de winton and mrs mackenzieand i beg to make my sincere compliments to you also for your infinite kindnesses to me i did have a delightful time up there most certainly                      truly yours                               s l clemens  p s although the introduction dates a year back the book is only just now issued a good long delay                                          s l c       howells writing from venice in april manifested special interest      in the play project something that would run like scheherazade      for a thousand and one nights so perhaps his book was going      better  he proposed that they devote the month of october to the      work and inclosed a letter from mallory who owned not only a      religious paper the churchman but also the madison square theater      and was anxious for a howells play  twenty years before howells had      been consul to venice and he wrote now the idea of my being here      is benumbing and silencing  i feel like the wandering jew or the      ghost of the cardiff giant       he returned to america in july  clemens sent him word of welcome      with glowing reports of his own undertakings  the story on which he      was piling up ms was the adventures of huckleberry finn begun      seven years before at quarry farm  he had no great faith in it      then and though he had taken it up again in 1880 his interest had      not lasted to its conclusion  this time however he was in the      proper spirit and the story would be finished      to w d howells in boston                                          elmira july 20 83  my dear howellswe are desperately glad you and your gang are home againmay you never travel again till you go aloft or alow charley clark has gone to the other side for a runwill be back in august he has been sick and needed the trip very much  mrs clemens had a long and wasting spell of sickness last spring but she is pulling up now the children are booming and my health is ridiculous its so robust notwithstanding the newspaper misreports  i havent piled up ms so in years as i have done since we came here to the farm three weeks and a half ago why its like old times to step right into the study damp from the breakfast table and sail right in and sail right on the whole day long without thought of running short of stuff or words  i wrote 4000 words today and i touch 3000 and upwards pretty often and dont fall below 1600 any working day and when i get fagged out i lie abed a couple of days and read and smoke and then go it again for 6 or 7 days i have finished one small book and am away along in a big 433 one that i halffinished two or three years ago i expect to complete it in a month or six weeks or two months more and i shall like it whether anybody else does or not  its a kind of companion to tom sawyer theres a raft episode from it in second or third chapter of life on the mississippi  im booming these daysgot health and spirits to wastegot an overplus and if i were at home we would write a play but we must do it anyhow by and by  we stay here till sep 10 then maybe a week at indian neck for sea air then home  we are powerful glad you are all back and send love according                           yrs ever                               mark      to onion clemens and family in keokuk id                                          elmira july 22 83 private  dear ma and orion and molliei dont know that i have anything new to report except that livy is still gaining and all the rest of us flourishing i havent had such booming workingdays for many years i am piling up manuscript in a really astonishing way i believe i shall complete in two months a book which i have been fooling over for 7 years this summer it is no more trouble to me to write than it is to lie  day before yesterday i felt slightly warned to knock off work for one day so i did it and took the open air then i struck an idea for the instruction of the children and went to work and carried it out it took me all day i measured off 817 feet of the roadway in our farm grounds with a footrule and then divided it up among the english reigns from the conqueror down to 1883 allowing one foot to the year i whittled out a basket of little pegs and drove one in the ground at the beginning of each reign and gave it that kings namethus  i measured all the reigns exactly as many feet to the reign as there were years in it you can look out over the grounds and see the little pegs from the front doorsome of them close together like richard ii richard cromwell james ii c and some prodigiously wide apart like henry iii edward iii george iii c it gives the children a realizing sense of the length or brevity of a reign shall invent a violent game to go with it  and in bed last night i invented a way to play it indoorsin a far more voluminous way as to multiplicity of dates and eventson a cribbage board     hello suppers ready           love to all                     good bye                          saml        onion clemens would naturally get excited over the idea of the game      and its commercial possibilities  not more so than his brother      however who presently employed him to arrange a quantity of      historical data which the game was to teach  for a season indeed      interest in the game became a sort of midsummer madness which      pervaded the two households at keokuk and at quarry farm  howells      wrote his approval of the idea of learning history by the running      foot which was a pun even if unintentional for in its outdoor      form it was a game of speed as well as knowledge       howells adds that he has noticed that the newspapers are exploiting      mark twains new invention of a history game and we shall presently      see how this happened       also in this letter howells speaks of an english nobleman to whom      he has given a letter of introduction  he seemed a simple quiet      gentlemanly man with a good taste in literature which he evinced      by going about with my books in his pockets and talking of yours      to w d howells in boston  my dear howellshow odd it seems to sit down to write a letter with the feeling that youve got time to do it but im done work for this season and so have got time ive done two seasons work in one and havent anything left to do now but revise ive written eight or nine hundred ms pages in such a brief space of time that i mustnt name the number of days i shouldnt believe it myself and of course couldnt expect you to i used to restrict myself to 4 or 5 hours a day and 5 days in the week but this time ive wrought from breakfast till 515 pm six days in the week and once or twice i smouched a sunday when the boss wasnt looking nothing is half so good as literature hooked on sunday on the sly  i wrote you and twichell on the same night about the game and was appalled to get a note from him saying he was going to print part of my letter and was going to do it before i could get a chance to forbid it i telegraphed him but was of course too late  if you havent ever tried to invent an indoor historical game dont ive got the thing at last so it will work i guess but i dont want any more tasks of that kind when i wrote you i thought i had it whereas i was only merely entering upon the initiatory difficulties of it i might have known it wouldnt be an easy job or somebody would have invented a decent historical game long agoa thing which nobody had done i think ive got it in pretty fair shapeso i have caveated it  earl of onstonis that it all right we shall be very glad to receive them and get acquainted with them and much obliged to you too theres plenty of worse people than the nobilities i went up and spent a week with the marquis and the princess louise and had as good a time as i want  im powerful glad you are all back again and we will come up there if our little tribe will give us the necessary furlough and if we cant get it you folks must come to us and give us an extension of time we get home sept 11  hello i think i see waring coming  goodbyletter from clark which explains for him  love to you all from the                           clemenses  noit wasnt waring i wonder what the devil has become of that man he was to spend today with us and the days most gone now  we are enjoying your story with our usual unspeakableness and im right glad you threw in the shipwreck and the mysteryi like it mrs crane thinks its the best story youve written yet webut we always think the last one is the best and why shouldnt it be practice helps  p s i thought i had sent all our loves to all of you but mrs clemens says i havent damn it a body cant think of everything but a woman thinks you can i better seal this nowelse therell be more criticism  i perceive i havent got the love in yet well we do send the love of all the family to all the howellses                                          s l c        there had been some delay and postponement in the matter of      the play which howells and clemens agreed to write  they      did not put in the entire month of october as they had      planned but they did put in a portion of that month the      latter half working out their old idea in the end it      became a revival of colonel sellers or rather a caricature      of that gentle hearted old visionary  clemens had always      complained that the actor raymond had never brought out the      finer shades of colonel sellerss character but raymond in      his worst performance never belied his original as did      howells and clemens in his dramatic revival  these two      working together let their imaginations run riot with      disastrous results  the reader can judge something of this      himself from the american claimant the book which mark      twain would later build from the play       but at this time they thought it a great triumph  they had      cracked their sides laughing over its construction as      howells once said and they thought the world would do the      same over its performance  they decided to offer it to      raymond but rather haughtily indifferently because any      number of other actors would be waiting for it       but this was a miscalculation  raymond now turned the      tables  though favorable to the idea of a new play he      declared this one did not present his old sellers at all      but a lunatic  in the end he returned the ms with a brief      note  attempts had already been made to interest other      actors and  would continue for some time     xxiv letters 1884 to howells and others cables great april fool huck finn in press mark twain for cleveland clemens and cable       mark twain had a lingering attack of the dramatic fever that      winter he made a play of the prince and pauper which      howells pronounced too thin and slight and not half long      enough  he made another of tom sawyer and probably      destroyed it for no trace of the ms exists today howells      could not join in these ventures for he was otherwise      occupied and had sickness in his household      to w d howells in boston                                                    jan  7 84  my dear howellso my goodns as jean says you have now encountered at last the heaviest calamity that can befall an author the scarlet fever once domesticated is a permanent member of the family money may desert you friends forsake you enemies grow indifferent to you but the scarlet fever will be true to you through thick and thin till you be all saved or damned down to the last one i say these things to cheer you  the bare suggestion of scarlet fever in the family makes me shudder i believe i would almost rather have osgood publish a book for me  you folks have our most sincere sympathy oh the intrusion of this hideous disease is an unspeakable disaster  my billiard table is stacked up with books relating to the sandwich islands the walls axe upholstered with scraps of paper penciled with notes drawn from them i have saturated myself with knowledge of that unimaginably beautiful land and that most strange and fascinating people and i have begun a story its hidden motive will illustrate a butlittle considered fact in human nature that the religious folly you are born in you will die in no matter what apparently reasonabler religious folly may seem to have taken its place meanwhile and abolished and obliterated it i start bill ragsdale at 12 years of age and the heroine at 4 in the midst of the ancient idolatrous system with its picturesque and amazing customs and superstitions 3 months before the arrival of the missionaries and the erection of a shallow christianity upon the ruins of the old paganism then these two will become educated christians and highly civilized  and then i will jump 15 years and do ragsdales leper business when we came to dramatize we can draw a deal of matter from the story all ready to our hand                      yrs ever                               mark        he never finished the sandwich islands story which he and howells      were to dramatize later  his head filled up with other projects      such as publishing plans readingtours and the like  the      typesetting machine does not appear in the letters of this period      but it was an important factor nevertheless  it was costing      several thousand dollars a month for construction and becoming      a heavy drain on mark twains finances  it was necessary to      recuperate and the anxiety for a profitable play or some other      adventure that would bring a quick and generous return grew out      of this need       clemens had established charles l webster his nephew by marriage      in a new york office as selling agent for the mississippi book and      for his plays  he was also planning to let webster publish the new      book huck finn       george w cable had proven his ability as a reader and clemens saw      possibilities in a reading combination which was first planned to      include aldrich and howells and a private car       but aldrich and howells did not warm to the idea and the car was      eliminated from the plan  cable came to visit clemens in hartford      and was taken with the mumps so that the readingtrip was      postponed       the fortunes of the sellers play were most uncertain and becoming      daily more doubtful  in february howells wrote if you have got      any comfort in regard to our play i wish you would heave it into my      bosom       cable recovered in time and out of gratitude planned a great      aprilfool surprise for his host  he was a systematic man and did      it in his usual thorough way  he sent a private and confidential      suggestion to a hundred and fifty of mark twains friends and      admirers nearly all distinguished literary men  the suggestion      was that each one of them should send a request for mark twains      autograph timing it so that it would arrive on the 1st of april      all seemed to have responded  mark twains writingtable on april      fool morning was heaped with letters asking in every ridiculous      fashion for his valuable autograph  the one from aldrich was a      fair sample  he wrote i am making a collection of autographs of      our distinguished writers and having read one of your works      gabriel convoy i would like to add your name to the list       of course the joke in this was that gabriel convoy was by bret      harte who by this time was thoroughly detested by mark twain  the      first one or two of the letters puzzled the victim then he      comprehended the size and character of the joke and entered into it      thoroughly  one of the letters was from bloodgood h cutter the      poet lariat of innocents abroad  cutter of course wrote in      poetry that is to say doggerel  mark twains april fool was a      most pleasant one      rhymed letter by bloodgood h cutter to mark twain

your autograph    to refuse that i will not do    after the long voyage had with you    that was a memorable time you wrote in prose i wrote in rhyme to    describe the wonders of each place and the queer customs of each race     that is in my memory yet    for while i live ill not forget    i often think of that affair    and the many that were with us there     as your friends think it for the best    i ask your autograph with the rest    hoping you will it to me send    twill please and cheer your dear old friend                      yours truly                                bloodgood h

of your proposal to read the proofs of huck finn  now if you mean it old manif you are in earnestproceed in gods name and be by me forever blest i cannot conceive of a rational man deliberately piling such an atrocious job upon himself but if there is such a man and you be that man why then pile it on it will cost me a pang every time i think of it but this anguish will be eingebusst to me in the joy and comfort i shall get out of the not having to read the verfluchtete proofs myself but if you have repented of your augenblichlicher tobsucht and got back to calm cold reason again i wont hold you to it unless i find i have got you down in writing somewhere herr i would not read the proof of one of my books for any fair and reasonable sum whatever if i could get out of it  the proofreading on the p  p cost me the last rags of my religion                           m        howells had written that he would be glad to help out in the      reading of the proofs of huck finn which book webster by      this time had in hand replying to clemenss eager and      grateful acceptance now he wrote it is all perfectly true      about the generosity unless i am going to read your proofs      from one of the shabby motives which i always find at the      bottom of my soul if i examine it  a characteristic      utterance though we may be permitted to believe that his      shabby motives were fewer and less shabby than those of      mankind in general       the proofs which howells was reading pleased him mightily      once during the summer he wrote if i had written half as      good a book as huck finn i shouldnt ask anything better      than to read the proofs even as it is i dont so send      them on they will always find me somewhere       this was the summer of the blainecleveland campaign  mark      twain in company with many other leading men had      mugwumped and was supporting cleveland  from the next      letter we gather something of the aspects of that memorable      campaign which was one of scandal and vituperation  we      learn too that the young sculptor karl gerhardt having      completed a three years study in paris had returned to      america a qualified artist      to w d howells in boston                                                    elmira aug  21 84  my dear howellsthis presidential campaign is too delicious for anything isnt human nature the most consummate sham and lie that was ever invented isnt man a creature to be ashamed of in pretty much all his aspects man know thyself and then thou wilt despise thyself to a dead moral certainty take three quite good specimenshawley warner and charley clark even i do not loathe blaine more than they do yet hawley is howling for blaine warner and clark are eating their daily crow in the paper for him and all three will vote for him o stultification where is thy sting o slave where is thy hickory  i suppose you heard how a marble monument for which st gaudens was pecuniarily responsible burned down in hartford the other day uninsuredfor who in the world would ever think of insuring a marble shaft in a cemetery against a fireand left st gauden out of pocket 15000  it was a bad day for artists gerhardt finished my bust that day and the work was pronounced admirable by all the kin and friends but in putting it in plaster or rather taking it out next day it got ruined it was four or five weeks hard work gone to the dogs the news flew and everybody on the farm flocked to the arbor and grouped themselves about the wreck in a profound and moving silencethe farmhelp the colored servants the german nurse the children everybodya silence interrupted at wide intervals by absentminded ejaculations wising from unconscious breasts as the whole size of the disaster gradually worked its way home to the realization of one spirit after another  some burst out with one thing some another the german nurse put up her hands and said oh schade oh schrecklich but gerhardt said nothing or almost that he couldnt word it i suppose but he went to work and by dark had everything thoroughly well under way for a fresh start in the morning and in three days time had built a new bust which was a trifle better than the old oneand tomorrow we shall put the finishing touches on it and it will be about as good a one as nearly anybody can make                           yrs ever                                    mark   if you run across anybody who wants a bust be sure and recommend gerhardt on my sayso       but howells was determinedly for blaine  i shall vote for      blaine he replied  i do not believe he is guilty of the      things they accuse him of and i know they are not proved      against him  as for cleveland his private life may be no      worse than that of most men but as an enemy of that      contemptible hypocritical lopsided morality which says a      woman shall suffer all the shame of unchastity and man none      i want to see him destroyed politically by his past  the      men who defend him would take their wives to the white house      if he were president but if he married his concubinemade      her an honest woman they would not go near him  i cant      stand that       certainly this was sound logic in that day at least  but      it left clemens far from satisfied      to w d howells in boston                                                elmira sept 17 84  my dear howellssomehow i cant seem to rest quiet under the idea of your voting for blaine i believe you said something about the country and the party certainly allegiance to these is well but as certainly a mans first duty is to his own conscience and honorthe party or the country come second to that and never first i dont ask you to vote at alli only urge you to not soil yourself by voting for blaine  when you wrote before you were able to say the charges against him were not proven but you know now that they are proven and it seems to me that that bars you and all other honest and honorable men who are independently situated from voting for him  it is not necessary to vote for cleveland the only necessary thing to do as i understand it is that a man shall keep himself clean by withholding his vote for an improper man even though the party and the country go to destruction in consequence it is not parties that make or save countries or that build them to greatnessit is clean men clean ordinary citizens rank and file the masses clean masses are not made by individuals standing back till the rest become clean  as i said before i think a mans first duty is to his own honor not to his country and not to his party dont be offended i mean no offence i am not so concerned about the rest of the nation butwell goodbye                                     ys ever                                              mark        there does not appear to be any further discussion of the matter      between howells and clemens  their letters for a time contained no      suggestion of politics       perhaps mark twains own political conscience was not entirely clear      in his repudiation of his party at least we may believe from his      next letter that his cleveland enthusiasm was qualified by a      willingness to support a republican who would command his admiration      and honor  the idea of an eleventhhour nomination was rather      startling whatever its motive      to mr pierce in boston                                               hartford oct  22 84  my dear mr pierceyou know as well as i do that the reason the majority of republicans are going to vote for blaine is because they feel that they cannot help themselves do not you believe that if mr edmunds would consent to run for president on the independent ticketeven at this late dayhe might be elected  well if he wouldnt consent but should even strenuously protest and say he wouldnt serve if elected isnt it still wise and fair to nominate him and vote for him since his protest would relieve him from all responsibility and he couldnt surely find fault with people for forcing a compliment upon him and do not you believe that his name thus compulsorily placed at the head of the independent column would work absolutely certain defeat to blain and save the countrys honor  politicians often carry a victory by springing some disgraceful and rascally mine under the feet of the adversary at the eleventh hour would it not be wholesome to vary this thing for once and spring as formidable a mine of a better sort under the enemys works  if edmundss name were put up i would vote for him in the teeth of all the protesting and blaspheming he could do in a month and there are lots of others who would do likewise  if this notion is not a foolish and wicked one wont you just consult with some chief independents and see if they wont call a sudden convention and whoop the thing through to nominate edmunds the 1st of november would be soon enough wouldnt it  with kindest regards to you and the aldriches                                     yr truly                                              s l clemens        clemens and cable set out on their readingtour in november      they were a curiouslyassorted pair cable was of orthodox      religion exact as to habits neat prim all that clemens      was not  in the beginning cable undertook to read the bible      aloud to clemens each evening but this part of the days      program was presently omitted by request  if they spent      sunday in a town cable was up bright and early visiting the      various churches and sundayschools while mark twain      remained at the hotel in bed reading or asleep     xxv the great year of 1885 clemens and cable publication of huck finn the grant memoirs mark twain at fifty       the year 1885 was in some respects the most important certainly the      most pleasantly exciting in mark twains life  it was the year in      which he entered fully into the publishing business and launched one      of the most spectacular of all publishing adventures the personal      memoirs of general u s grant  clemens had not intended to do      general publishing when he arranged with webster to become      salesagent for the mississippi book and later general agent for      huck finns adventures he had intended only to handle his own      books because he was pretty thoroughly dissatisfied with other      publishing arrangements  even the library of humor which howells      with clark of the courant had put together for him he left with      osgood until that publisher failed during the spring of 1885      certainly he never dreamed of undertaking anything of the      proportions of the grant book       he had always believed that grant could make a book  more than      once when they had met he had urged the general to prepare his      memoirs for publication  howells in his my mark twain tells of      going with clemens to see grant then a member of the illfated firm      of grant and ward and how they lunched on beans bacon and coffee      brought in from a nearby restaurant  it was while they were eating      this soldier fare that clemensvery likely abetted by howells      especially urged the great commander to prepare his memoirs  but      grant had become a financier as he believed and the prospect of      literary earnings however large did not appeal to him      furthermore he was convinced that he was without literary ability      and that a book by him would prove a failure       but then by and by came a failure more disastrous than anything he      had foreseenthe downfall of his firm through the napoleonic      rascality of ward  general grant was utterly ruined he was left      without income and apparently without the means of earning one  it      was the period when the great war series was appeasing in the      century magazine  general grant hardpressed was induced by the      editors to prepare one or more articles and finding that he could      write them became interested in the idea of a book  it is      unnecessary to repeat here the story of how the publication of this      important work passed into the hands of mark twain that is to say      the firm of charles l webster  co the details having been fully      given elsewheresee mark twain a biography chap  cliv       we will now return for the moment to other matters as reported in      order by the letters  clemens and cable had continued their      readingtour into canada and in february found themselves in      montreal  here they were invited by the toque bleue snowshoe club      to join in one of their weekly excursions across mt royal  they      could not go and the reasons given by mark twain are not without      interest  the letter is to mr george iles author of flame      electricity and the camera and many other useful works      to george iles far the toque blew snowshoe club montreal                                     detroit february 12 1885                                     midnight ps  my dear ilesi got your other telegram a while ago and answered it explaining that i get only a couple of hours in the middle of the day for social life i know it doesnt seem rational that a man should have to lie abed all day in order to be rested and equipped for talking an hour at night and yet in my case and cables it is so unless i get a great deal of rest a ghastly dulness settles down upon me on the platform and turns my performance into work and hard work whereas it ought always to be pastime recreation solid enjoyment usually it is just this latter but that is because i take my rest faithfully and prepare myself to do my duty by my audience  i am the obliged and appreciative servant of my brethren of the snowshoe club and nothing in the world would delight me more than to come to their house without naming time or terms on my own partbut you see how it is my cast iron duty is to my audienceit leaves me no liberty and no option  with kindest regards to the club and to you                 i am sincerely yours                                s l clemens       in the next letter we reach the end of the clemenscable venture and      get a characteristic summing up of mark twains general attitude      toward the companion of his travels  it must be read only in the      clear realization of mark twains attitude toward orthodoxy and his      habit of humor  cable was as rigidly orthodox as mark twain was      revolutionary  the two were never anything but the best of friends      to w d howells in boston                                          philada  feb 27 85  my dear howellstonight in baltimore tomorrow afternoon and night in washington and my fourmonths platform campaign is ended at last it has been a curious experience it has taught me that cables gifts of mind are greater and higher than i had suspected but  that but is pointing toward his religion you will never never know never divine guess imagine how loathsome a thing the christian religion can be made until you come to know and study cable daily and hourly mind you i like him he is pleasant company i rage and swear at him sometimes but we do not quarrel we get along mighty happily together but in him and his person i have learned to hate all religions he has taught me to abhor and detest the sabbathday and hunt up new and troublesome ways to dishonor it  nat goodwin was on the train yesterday he plays in washington all the coming week he is very anxious to get our sellers play and play it under changed names i said the only thing i could do would be to write to you well ive done it                                ys ever                                         mark        clemens and webster were often at the house of general grant during      these early days of 1885 and it must have been webster who was      present with clemens on the great occasion described in the      following telegram  it was on the last day and hour of president      arthurs administration that the bill was passed which placed      ulysses s grant as full general with full pay on the retired list      and it is said that the congressional clock was set back in order      that this enactment might become a law before the administration      changed  general grant had by this time developed cancer and was      already in feeble health      telegram to mrs clemens in hartford                                               new york mar 4 1885  to mrs s l clemens we were at general grants at noon and a telegram arrived that the last act of the expiring congress late this morning retired him with full generals rank and accompanying emoluments the effect upon him was like raising the dead we were present when the telegram was put in his hand                                s l clemens        something has been mentioned before of mark twains investments and      the generally unprofitable habit of them  he had a trusting nature      and was usually willing to invest money on any plausible      recommendation  he was one of thousands such and being a person of      distinction he now and then received letters of inquiry complaint      or condolence  a minister wrote him that he had bought some stocks      recommended by a hartford banker and advertised in a religious      paper  he added after i made that purchase they wrote me that you      had just bought a hundred shares and that you were a shrewd man      the writer closed by asking for further information  he received      it as follows      to the rev j in baltimore                                               washington mch  285  my dear siri take my earliest opportunity to answer your favor of feb b was premature in calling me a shrewd man i wasnt one at that time but am one nowthat is i am at least too shrewd to ever again invest in anything put on the market by b i know nothing whatever about the bank note co and never did know anything about it b sold me about 4000 or 5000 worth of the stock at 110 and i own it yet he sold me 10000 worth of another rosetinted stock about the same time i have got that yet also i judge that a peculiarity of bs stocks is that they are of the staying kind i think you should have asked somebody else whether i was a shrewd man or not for two reasons the stock was advertised in a religious paper a circumstance which was very suspicious and the compliment came to you from a man who was interested to make a purchaser of you i am afraid you deserve your loss a financial scheme advertised in any religious paper is a thing which any living person ought to know enough to avoid and when the factor is added that m runs that religious paper a dead person ought to know enough to avoid it                                very truly yours                                         s l clemens        the story of huck finn was having a wide success  webster handled      it skillfully and the sales were large  in almost every quarter      its welcome was enthusiastic  here and there however could be      found an exception hucks morals were not always approved of by      library readingcommittees  the first instance of this kind was      reported from concord and would seem not to have depressed the      authorpublisher      to chas l webster in new york                                                         mch 18 85  dear charleythe committee of the public library of concord mass have given us a rattling tiptop puff which will go into every paper in the country they have expelled huck from their library as trash and suitable only for the slums that will sell 25000 copies for us sure                                          s l c        perhaps the concord free trade club had some idea of making amends      to mark twain for the slight put upon his book by their librarians      for immediately after the huck finn incident they notified him of      his election to honorary membership       those were the days of authors readings and clemens and howells      not infrequently assisted at these functions usually given as      benefits of one kind or another  from the next letter written      following an entertainment given for the longfellow memorial we      gather that mark twains opinion of howellss reading was steadily      improving      to w d howells in boston                                               hartford may 5 85  my dear howells who taught you to read observation and thought i guess and practice at the tavern clubyes and that was the best teaching of all  well you sent even your daintiest and most delicate and fleeting points home to that audienceabsolute proof of good reading but you couldnt read worth a damn a few years ago i do not say this to flatter it is true i looked around for you when i was leaving but you had already gone  alas osgood has failed at last it was easy to see that he was on the very verge of it a year ago and it was also easy to see that he was still on the verge of it a month or two ago but i continued to hopebut not expect that he would pull through the library of humor is at his dwelling house and he will hand it to you whenever you want it  to save it from any possibility of getting mixed up in the failure perhaps you had better send down and get it i told him the other day that an order of any kind from you would be his sufficient warrant for its delivery to you  in two days general grant has dictated 50 pages of foolscap and thus the wilderness and appomattox stand for all time in his own words this makes the second volume of his book as valuable as the first  he looks mighty well these latter days                                          yrs ever                                                   mark        i am exceedingly glad wrote howells that you approve of my      reading for it gives me some hope that i may do something on the      platform next winter  but i would never read within a hundred      miles of you if i could help it  you simply straddled down to the      footlights and took that house up in the hollow of your hand and      tickled it      to w d howells in boston                                          elmira july 21 1885  my dear howellsyou are really my only author i am restricted to you i wouldnt give a damn for the rest  i bored through middlemarch during the past week with its labored and tedious analyses of feelings and motives its paltry and tiresome people its unexciting and uninteresting story and its frequent blinding flashes of singlesentence poetry philosophy wit and what not and nearly died from the overwork i wouldnt read another of those books for a farm i did try to read one otherdaniel deronda i dragged through three chapters losing flesh all the time and then was honest enough to quit and confess to myself that i havent any romance literature appetite as far as i can see except for your books  but what i started to say was that i have just read part ii of indian summer and to my mind there isnt a waste line in it or one that could be improved i read it yesterday ending with that opinion and read it again today ending with the same opinion emphasized i havent read part i yet because that number must have reached hartford after we left but we are going to send down town for a copy and when it comes i am to read both parts aloud to the family it is a beautiful story and makes a body laugh all the time and cry inside and feel so old and so forlorn and gives him gracious glimpses of his lost youth that fill him with a measureless regret and build up in him a cloudy sense of his having been a prince once in some enchanted faroff land and of being an exile now and desolateand lord no chance ever to get back there again that is the thing that hurts well you have done it with marvelous facility and you make all the motives and feelings perfectly clear without analyzing the guts out of them the way george eliot does i cant stand george eliot and hawthorne and those people i see what they are at a hundred years before they get to it and they just tire me to death and as for the bostonians i would rather be damned to john bunyans heaven than read that                                     yrs ever                                              mark        it is as easy to understand mark twains enjoyment of indian summer      as his revolt against daniel deronda and the bostonians  he cared      little for writing that did not convey its purpose in the simplest      and most direct terms  it is interesting to note that in thanking      clemens for his compliment howells wrote what people cannot see is      that i analyze as little as possible they go on talking about the      analytical school which i am supposed to belong to and i want to      thank you for using your eyes  did you ever read de foes      roxana  if not then read it not merely for some of the deepest      insights into the lying suffering sinning wellmeaning human      soul but for the best and most natural english that a book was ever      written in       general grant worked steadily on his book dictating when he could      making brief notes on slips of paper when he could no longer speak      clemens visited him at mt mcgregor and brought the dying soldier      the comforting news that enough of his books were already sold to      provide generously for his family and that the sales would      aggregate at least twice as much by the end of the year       this was some time in july  on the 23d of that month general grant      died  immediately there was a newspaper discussion as to the most      suitable place for the great chieftain to lie  mark twains      contribution to this debate though in the form of an open letter      seems worthy of preservation here      to the new york sun on the proper place for grants tomb   to the editor op the sunsirthe newspaper atmosphere is charged with objections to new york as a place of sepulchre for general grant and the objectors are strenuous that washington is the right place they offer good reasonsgood temporary reasonsfor both of these positions  but it seems to me that temporary reasons are not mete for the occasion we need to consider posterity rather than our own generation we should select a grave which will not merely be in the right place now but will still be in the right place 500 years from now  how does washington promise as to that you have only to hit it in one place to kill it some day the west will be numerically strong enough to move the seat of government her past attempts are a fair warning that when the day comes she will do it then the city of washington will lose its consequence and pass out of the public view and public talk it is quite within the possibilities that a century hence people would wonder and say how did your predecessors come to bury their great dead in this deserted place  but as long as american civilisation lasts new york will last i cannot but think she has been well and wisely chosen as the guardian of a grave which is destined to become almost the most conspicuous in the worlds history twenty centuries from now new york will still be new york still a vast city and the most notable object in it will still be the tomb and monument of general grant  i observe that the common and strongest objection to new york is that she is not national ground let us give ourselves no uneasiness about that wherever general grants body lies that is national ground                                          s l clemens elmira july 27        the letter that follows is very long but it seems too important and      too interesting to be omitted in any part  general grants early      indulgence in liquors had long been a matter of wide though not      very definite knowledge  every one had heard how lincoln on being      told that grant drank remarked something to the effect that he      would like to know what kind of whisky grant used so that he might      get some of it for his other generals  henry ward beecher selected      to deliver a eulogy on the dead soldier and doubtless wishing      neither to ignore the matter nor to make too much of it naturally      turned for information to the publisher of grants own memoirs      hoping from an advance copy to obtain light      to henry ward beecher brooklyn                                          elmira n y  sept 11 85  my dear mr beechermy nephew webster is in europe making contracts for the memoirs before he sailed he came to me with a writing directed to the printers and binders to this effect  honor no order for a sight or copy of the memoirs while i am absent even though it be signed by mr clemens himself  i gave my permission there were weighty reasons why i should not only give my permission but hold it a matter of honor to not dissolve the order or modify it at any time so i did all of thatsaid the order should stand undisturbed to the end if a principal could dissolve his promise as innocently as he can dissolve his written order unguarded by his promise i would send you a copy of the memoirs instantly i did not foresee you or i would have made an exception                      my idea gained from army men is that the drunkenness and sometimes pretty reckless spreeing nights ceased before he came east to be lt general refer especially to gen wm b franklinif you could see franklin and talk with himthen he would unbosom it was while grant was still in the west that mr lincoln said he wished he could find out what brand of whisky that fellow used so he could furnish it to some of the other generals franklin saw grant tumble from his horse drunk while reviewing troops in new orleans the fall gave him a good deal of a hurt he was then on the point of leaving for the chattanooga region i naturally put that and that together when i read gen o o howardss article in the christian union three or four weeks agowhere he mentions that the new general arrived lame from a recent accident see that article and why not write howard  franklin spoke positively of the frequent spreeing in campin time of war                      captain grant was frequently threatened by the commandant of his oregon post with a report to the war department of his conduct unless he modified his intemperance the report would mean dismissal from the service at last the report had to be made out and then so greatly was the captain beloved that he was privately informed and was thus enabled to rush his resignation to washington ahead of the report did the report go nevertheless i dont know if it did it is in the war department now possibly and seeable i got all this from a regular army man but i cant name him to save me  the only time general grant ever mentioned liquor to me was about last april or possibly may he said  if i could only build up my strength the doctors urge whisky and champagne but i cant take them i cant abide the taste of any kind of liquor  had he made a conquest so complete that even the taste of liquor was become an offense or was he so sore over what had been said about his habit that he wanted to persuade others and likewise himself that he hadnt even ever had any taste for it it sounded like the latter but thats no evidence  he told me in the fall of 84 that there was something the matter with his throat and that at the suggestion of his physicians he had reduced his smoking to one cigar a day then he added in a casual fashion that he didnt care for that one and seldom smoked it  i could understand that feeling he had set out to conquer not the habit but the inclinationthe desire he had gone at the root not the trunk its the perfect way and the only true way i speak from experience how i do hate those enemies of the human race who go around enslaving gods free people with pledgesto quit drinking instead of to quit wanting to drink  but sherman and van vliet know everything concerning grant and if you tell them how you want to use the facts both of them will testify regular army men have no concealments about each other and yet they make their awful statements without shade or color or malice with a frankness and a childlike naivety indeed which is enchantingand stupefying west point seems to teach them that among other priceless things not to be got in any other college in this world if we talked about our guildmates as i have heard sherman grant van vliet and others talk about theirsmates with whom they were on the best possible termswe could never expect them to speak to us again                      i am reminded now of another matter the day of the funeral i sat an hour over a single drink and several cigars with van vliet and sherman and senator sherman and among other things gen sherman said with impatient scorn  the idea of all this nonsense about grant not being able to stand rude language and indelicate stories why grant was full of humor and full of the appreciation of it i have sat with him by the hour listening to jim nyes yarns and i reckon you know the style of jim nyes histories clemens it makes me sickthat newspaper nonsense grant was no nambypamby fool he was a manall overrounded and complete  i wish i had thought of it i would have said to general grant put the drunkenness in the memoirsand the repentance and reform trust the people  but i will wager there is not a hint in the book he was sore there as much of the book as i have read gives no hint as far as i recollect  the sickroom brought out the points of gen grants charactersome of them particularly to wit  his patience his indestructible equability of temper his exceeding gentleness kindness forbearance lovingness charity his loyalty to friends to convictions to promises halfpromises infinitesimal fractions and shadows of promises there was a requirement of him which i considered an atrocity an injustice an outrage i wanted to implore him to repudiate it fred grant said save your labor i know him he is in doubt as to whether he made that halfpromise or notand he will give the thing the benefit of the doubt he will fulfill that halfpromise or kill himself trying fred grant was righthe did fulfill it his aggravatingly trustful nature his genuineness simplicity modesty diffidence selfdepreciation poverty in the quality of vanityand in no contradiction of this last his simple pleasure in the flowers and general ruck sent to him by tom dick and harry from everywherea pleasure that suggested a perennial surprise that he should be the object of so much fine attentionhe was the most lovable great child in the world i mentioned his loyalty you remember harrison the colored bodyservant the whole family hated him but that did not make any difference the general always stood at his back wouldnt allow him to be scolded always excused his failures and deficiencies with the one unvarying formula we are responsible for these things in his raceit is not fair to visit our fault upon themlet him alone so they did let him alone under compulsion until the great heart that was his shield was taken away thenwell they simply couldnt stand him and so they were excusable for determining to discharge hima thing which they mortally hated to do and by lucky accident were saved from the necessity of doing his toughness as a bargainer when doing business for other people or for his country witness his terms at donelson vicksburg etc fred grant told me his father wound up an estate for the widow and orphans of a friend in st louisit took several years at the end every complication had been straightened out and the property put upon a prosperous basis great sums had passed through his hands and when he handed over the papers there were vouchers to show what had been done with every penny and his trusting easy unexacting fashion when doing business for himself at that same time he was paying out money in driblets to a man who was running his farm for himand in his first presidency he paid every one of those driblets again total 3000 f said for he hadnt a scrap of paper to show that he had ever paid them before in his dealings with me he would not listen to terms which would place my money at risk and leave him protectedthe thought plainly gave him pain and he put it from him waved it off with his hands as one does accounts of crushings and mutilationswouldnt listen changed the subject and his fortitude he was under sentence of death last spring he sat thinking musing several daysnobody knows what about then he pulled himself together and set to work to finish that book a colossal task for a dying man presently his hand gave out fate seemed to have got him checkmated dictation was suggested no he never could do that had never tried it too old to learn now by and byif he could only do appomattoxwell so he sent for a stenographer and dictated 9000 words at a single sittingnever pausing never hesitating for a word never repeatingand in the writtenout copy he made hardly a correction he dictated again every two or three daysthe intervals were intervals of exhaustion and slow recuperationand at last he was able to tell me that he had written more matter than could be got into the book i then enlarged the bookhad to then he lost his voice he was not quite done yet howeverthere was no end of little plums and spices to be stuck in here and there and this work he patiently continued a few lines a day with pad and pencil till far into july at mt mcgregor one day he put his pencil aside and said he was donethere was nothing more to do if i had been there i could have foretold the shock that struck the world three days later  well ive written all this and it doesnt seem to amount to anything but i do want to help if i only could i will enclose some scraps from my autobiographyscraps about general grantthey may be of some trifle of use and they may notthey at least verify known traits of his character my autobiography is pretty freely dictated but my idea is to jackplane it a little before i die some day or other i mean the rude construction and rotten grammar it is the only dictating i ever did and it was most troublesome and awkward work you may return it to hartford                           sincerely yours                                         s l clemens        the old longdeferred library of humor came up again for discussion      when in the fall of 1885 howells associated himself with harper       brothers  howellss contract provided that his name was not to      appear on any book not published by the harper firm  he wrote      therefore offering to sell out his interest in the enterprise for      two thousand dollars in addition to the five hundred which he had      already receivedan amount considered to be less than he was to      have received as joint author and compiler  mark twains answer      pretty fully covers the details of this undertaking      to w d howells in boston                                          hartford oct 18 1885  private  my dear howellsi reckon it would ruin the book that is make it necessary to pigeonhole it and leave it unpublished i couldnt publish it without a very responsible name to support my own on the title page because it has so much of my own matter in it i bought osgoods rights for 3000 cash i have paid clark 800 and owe him 700 more which must of course be paid whether i publish or not yet i fully recognize that i have no sort of moral right to let that ancient and procrastinated contract hamper you in any way and i most certainly wont so it is my decisionafter thinking over and rejecting the idea of trying to buy permission of the harpers for 2500 to use your name a proposition which they would hate to refuse to a man in a perplexed position and yet would naturally have to refuse it to pigeonhole the library not destroy it but merely pigeonhole it and wait a few years and see what new notion providence will take concerning it he will not desert us now after putting in four licks to our one on this book all this time it really seems in a sense discourteous not to call it providences library of humor  now that deal is all settled the next question is do you need and must you require that 2000 now since last march you know i am carrying a mighty load solitary and alonegeneral grants bookand must carry it till the first volume is 30 days old jan 1st before the relief money will begin to flow in from now till the first of january every dollar is as valuable to me as it could be to a famishing tramp if you can wait till theni mean without discomfort without inconvenienceit will be a large accommodation to me but i will not allow you to do this favor if it will discommode you so speak right out frankly and if you need the money i will go out on the highway and get it using violence if necessary  mind i am not in financial difficulties and am not going to be i am merely a starving beggar standing outside the door of plentyobstructed by a yale timelock which is set for jan 1st i can stand it and stand it perfectly well but the days do seem to fool along considerable slower than they used to  i am mighty glad you are with the harpers i have noticed that good men in their employ go there to stay                                yours ever                                              mark        in the next letter we begin to get some idea of the size of mark      twains first publishing venture and a brief summary of results may      not be out of place here       the grant life was issued in two volumes  in the early months of      the year when the agents canvass was just beginning mark twain      with what seems now almost clairvoyant vision prophesied a sale of      three hundred thousand sets  the actual sales ran somewhat more      than this number  on february 27 1886 charles l webster  co      paid to mrs grant the largest single royalty check in the history      of bookpublishing  the amount of it was two hundred thousand      dollars  subsequent checks increased the aggregate return to      considerably more than double this figure  in a memorandum made by      clemens in the midst of the canvass he wrote       during 100 consecutive days the sales i e subscriptions of      general grants book averaged 3000 sets 6000 single volumes per      day roughly stated mrs grants income during all that time was      5000 a day      to w d howells in boston                                               hotel normandie                                               new york dec 2 85  my dear howellsi told webster this afternoon to send you that 2000 but he is in such a rush these first days of publication that he may possibly forget it so i write lest i forget it too remind me if he should forget when i postponed you lately i did it because i thought i should be cramped for money until january but that has turned out to be an error so i hasten to cut short the postponement  i judge by the newspapers that you are in auburndale but i dont know it officially  ive got the first volume launched safely consequently half of the suspense is over and i am that much nearer the goal weve bound and shipped 200000 books and by the 10th shall finish and ship the remaining 125000 of the first edition i got nervous and came down to help humpup the binderies and i mean to stay here pretty much all the time till the first days of march when the second volume will issue shant have so much trouble this time though if we get to press pretty soon because we can get more binderies then than are to be had in front of the holidays one lives and learns i find it takes 7 binderies four months to bind 325000 books  this is a good book to publish i heard a canvasser say yesterday that while delivering eleven books he took 7 new subscriptions but we shall be in a hell of a fix if that goes onit will ball up the binderies again                 yrs ever                          mark        november 30th that year was mark twains fiftieth birthday an event      noticed by the newspapers generally and especially observed by many      of his friends  warner stockton and many others sent letters      andrew lang contributed a fine poem also oliver wendell  holmes      the latter by special request of miss gilderfor the critic      these attentions came as a sort of crowning happiness at the end of      a golden year  at no time in his life were mark twains fortunes      and prospects brighter he had a beautiful family and a perfect      home also he had great prosperity  the readingtour with cable      had been a fine success  his latest book the adventures of      huckleberry finn had added largely to his fame and income      the publication of the grant memoirs had been a dazzling triumph      mark twain had become recognized not only as americas most      distinguished author but as its most envied publisher  and now      with his fiftieth birthday had come this laurel from holmes last      of the brahmins to add a touch of glory to all the rest  we feel      his exaltation in his note of acknowledgment      to dr oliver wendell holmes in boston  dear mr holmesi shall never be able to tell you the half of how proud you have made me if i could you would say you were nearly paid for the trouble you took and then the family if i can convey the electrical surprise and gratitude and exaltation of the wife and the children last night when they happened upon that critic where i had with artful artlessness spread it open and retired out of view to see what would happenwell it was great and fine and beautiful to see and made me feel as the victor feels when the shouting hosts march by and if you also could have seen it you would have said the account was squared for i have brought them up in your company as in the company of a warm and friendly and beneficent but fardistant sun and so for you to do this thing was for the sun to send down out of the skies the miracle of a special ray and transfigure me before their faces i knew what that poem would be to them i knew it would raise me up to remote and shining heights in their eyes to very fellowship with the chambered nautilus itself and that from that fellowship they could never more dissociate me while they should live and so i made sure to be by when the surprise should come  charles dudley warner is charmed with the poem for its own felicitous sake and so indeed am i but more because it has drawn the sting of my fiftieth year taken away the pain of it the grief of it the somehow shame of it and made me glad and proud it happened          with reverence and affection                          sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        holmes wrote with his own hand did miss gilder tell you i had      twentythree letters spread out for answer when her suggestion came      about your anniversary

families      had joined in preparing for him a surprise performance of the prince      and the pauper  the clemens household was always given to      theatricals and it was about this time that scenery and a stage      were preparedmainly by the sculptor gerhardtfor these home      performances after which productions of the prince and the pauper      were given with considerable regularity to audiences consisting of      parents and invited friends  the subject is a fascinating one but      it has been dwelt upon elsewherein mark twain a onn      chaps  cliii and clxwe get a glimpse of one of these occasions      as well as of mark twains financial progress in the next brief     to w d howells in boston                                                jan  3 86  my dear howellsthe date set for the prince and pauper play is ten days hencejan 13 i hope you and pilla can take a train that arrives here during the day the one that leaves boston toward the end of the afternoon would be a trifle late the performance would have already begun when you reached the house  im out of the woods on the last day of the year i had paid out 182000 on the grant book and it was totally free from debt                                                yrs ever                                                    mark        mark twains mother was a woman of sturdy character and with a keen      sense of humor and tender sympathies  her husband john marshall      clemens had been a man of high moral character honored by all who      knew him respected and apparently loved by his wife  no one would      ever have supposed that during all her years of marriage and almost      to her death she carried a secret romance that would only be told      at last in the weary disappointment of old age  it is a curious      story and it came to light in this curious way     to w d howells in boston                                          hartford may 19 86  my dear howells heres a secret a most curious and pathetic romance which has just come to light read these things but dont mention them last fall my old motherthen 82took a notion to attend a convention of old settlers of the mississippi valley in an iowa town my brothers wife was astonished and represented to her the hardships and fatigues of such a trip and said my mother might possibly not even survive them and said there could be no possible interest for her in such a meeting and such a crowd but my mother insisted and persisted and finally gained her point they started and all the way my mother was young again with excitement interest eagerness anticipation they reached the town and the hotel my mother strode with the same eagerness in her eye and her step to the counter and said  is dr barrett of st louis here  no he was here but he returned to st louis this morning  will he come again  no  my mother turned away the fire all gone from her and said let us go home  they went straight back to keokuk my mother sat silent and thinking for many daysa thing which had never happened before then one day she said  i will tell you a secret when i was eighteen a young medical student named barrett lived in columbia ky eighteen miles away and he used to ride over to see me this continued for some time i loved him with my whole heart and i knew that he felt the same toward me though no words had been spoken he was too bashful to speakhe could not do it everybody supposed we were engagedtook it for granted we werebut we were not by and by there was to be a party in a neighboring town and he wrote my uncle telling him his feelings and asking him to drive me over in his buggy and let him barrett drive me back so that he might have that opportunity to propose my uncle should have done as he was asked without explaining anything to me but instead he read me the letter and then of course i could not goand did not he barrett left the country presently and i to stop the clacking tongues and to show him that i did not care married in a pet in all these sixtyfour years i have not seen him since i saw in a paper that he was going to attend that old settlers convention only three hours before we reached that hotel he had been standing there  since then her memory is wholly faded out and gone and now she writes letters to the schoolmates who had been dead forty years and wonders why they neglect her and do not answer  think of her carrying that pathetic burden in her old heart sixtyfour years and no human being ever suspecting it                                yrs ever                                          mark       we do not get the idea from this letter that those two long      ago sweethearts quarreled but mark twain once spoke of      their having done so and there may have been a      disagreement assuming that there was a subsequent meeting      it does not matter now  in speaking of it mark twain once      said it is as pathetic a romance as any that has crossed      the field of my personal experience in a long lifetime      when mark twain a biography was written this letter had      not come to light and the matter was stated there in      accordance with mark twains latest memory of it       howells wrote after all how poor and hackneyed all the      inventions are compared with the simple and stately facts      who could have imagined such a heartbreak as that  yet it      went along with the fulfillment of everyday duty and made no      more noise than a grave under foot  i doubt if fiction will      ever get the knack of such things       jane clemens now lived with her son orion and his wife in      keokuk where she was more contented than elsewhere  in      these later days her memory had become erratic her      realization of events about her uncertain but there were      times when she was quite her former self remembering      clearly and talking with her oldtime gaiety of spirit      mark twain frequently sent her playful letters to amuse her      letters full of such boyish gaiety as had amused her long      years before  the one that follows is a fair example  it      was written after a visit which clemens and his family had      paid to keokuk     to jane clemens in keokuk                                               elmira aug 7 86  dear mai heard that molly and orion and pamela had been sick but i see by your letter that they are much better now or nearly well when we visited you a month ago it seemed to us that your keokuk weather was pretty hot jean and clara sat up in bed at mrs mcelroys and cried about it and so did i but i judge by your letter that it has cooled down now so that a person is comparatively comfortable with his skin off well it did need cooling i remember that i burnt a hole in my shirt there with some ice cream that fell on it and miss jenkins told me they never used a stove but cooked their meals on a marbletopped table in the drawingroom just with the natural heat if anybody else had told me i would not have believed it i was told by the bishop of keokuk that he did not allow crying at funerals because it scalded the furniture if miss jenkins had told me that i would have believed it this reminds me that you speak of dr jenkins and his family as if they were strangers to me indeed they are not dont you suppose i remember gratefully how tender the doctor was with jean when she hurt her arm and how quickly he got the pain out of the hurt whereas i supposed it was going to last at least an hour no i dont forget some things as easily as i do others  yes it was pretty hot weather now here when a person is going to die he is always in a sweat about where he is going to but in keokuk of course they dont care because they are fixed for everything it has set me reflecting it has taught me a lesson by and by when my health fails i am going to put all my affairs in order and bid goodbye to my friends here and kill all the people i dont like and go out to keokuk and prepare for death  they are all well in this family and we all send love                                     affly your son                                                   sam        the ways of city officials and corporations are often past      understanding and mark twain sometimes found it necessary to write      picturesque letters of protest  the following to a hartford      lighting company is a fair example of these documents     to a gas and electriclighting company in hartford  gentlementhere are but two places in our whole street where lights could be of any value by any accident and you have measured and appointed your intervals so ingeniously as to leave each of those places in the centre of a couple of hundred yards of solid darkness when i noticed that you were setting one of your lights in such a way that i could almost see how to get into my gate at night i suspected that it was a piece of carelessness on the part of the workmen and would be corrected as soon as you should go around inspecting and find it out my judgment was right it is always right when you axe concerned for fifteen years in spite of my prayers and tears you persistently kept a gas lamp exactly half way between my gates so that i couldnt find either of them after dark and then furnished such execrable gas that i had to hang a danger signal on the lamp post to keep teams from running into it nights now i suppose your present idea is to leave us a little more in the dark  dont mind usout our way we possess but one vote apiece and no rights which you are in any way bound to respect please take your electric light and go tobut never mind it is not for me to suggest you will probably find the way and any way you can reasonably count on divine assistance if you lose your bearings                                     s l clemens       etext editors note twain wrote another note to hartford gas and      electric which he may not have mailed and which paine does not      include in these volumes       gentlemansomeday you are going to move me almost to the point      of irritation with your goddamned chuckle headed fashion of      turning off your goddamned gas without giving notice to your      goddamned parishionersand you did it again last night      dw       frequently clemens did not send letters of this sort after they were      written  sometimes he realized the uselessness of such protest      sometimes the mere writing of them had furnished the necessary      relief and he put the letter away or into the wastebasket and      wrote something more temperate or nothing at all  a few such      letters here follow       clemens was all the time receiving application from people who      wished him to recommend one article or another books plays      tobacco and what not  they were generally persistent people      unable to accept a polite or kindly denial  once he set down some      remarks on this particular phase of correspondence  he wrote   i  no doubt mr edison has been offered a large interest in many and many an electrical project for the use of his name to float it withal and no doubt all men who have achieved for their names in any line of activity whatever a sure market value have been familiar with this sort of solicitation reputation is a hallmark it can remove doubt from pure silver and it can also make the plated article pass for pure  and so people without a hallmark of their own are always trying to get the loan of somebody elses  as a rule that kind of a person sees only one side of the case he sees that his invention or his painting or his book isapparentlya trifle better than you yourself can do therefore why shouldnt you be willing to put your hallmark on it you will be giving the purchaser his full moneys worth so who is hurt and where is the harm besides are you not helping a struggling fellowcraftsman and is it not your duty to do that  that side is plenty clear enough to him but he cant and wont see the other side towit that you are a rascal if you put your hallmark upon a thing which you did not produce yourself howsoever good it may be how simple that is and yet there are not two applicants in a hundred who can be made to see it  when one receives an application of this sort his first emotion is an indignant sense of insult his first deed is the penning of a sharp answer he blames nobody but that other person that person is a very base being he must be he would degrade himself for money otherwise it would not occur to him that you would do such a thing but all the same that application has done its work and taken you down in your own estimation you recognize that everybody hasnt as high an opinion of you as you have of yourself and in spite of you there ensues an interval during which you are not in your own estimation as fine a bird as you were before  however being old and experienced you do not mail your sharp letter but leave it lying a day that saves you for by that time you have begun to reflect that you are a person who deals in exaggerationsand exaggerations are lies you meant yours to be playful and thought you made them unmistakably so but you couldnt make them playfulnesses to a man who has no sense of the playful and can see nothing but the serious side of things you rattle on quite playfully and with measureless extravagance about how you wept at the tomb of adam and all in good time you find to your astonishment that no end of people took you at your word and believed you and presently they find out that you were not in earnest they have been deceived therefore as they argueand there is a sort of argument in it you are a deceiver if you will deceive in one way why shouldnt you in another so they apply for the use of your trademark you are amazed and affronted you retort that you are not that kind of person then they are amazed and affronted and wonder since when  by this time you have got your bearings you realize that perhaps there is a little blame on both sides you are in the right frame now so you write a letter void of offense declining you mail this one you pigeonhole the other  that is being old and experienced you do but early in your career you dont you mail the first one   ii  an enthusiast who had a new system of musical notation wrote to me and suggested that a magazine article from me contrasting the absurdities of the old system with the simplicities of his new one would be sure to make a rousing hit he shouted and shouted over the marvels wrought by his system and quoted the handsome compliments which had been paid it by famous musical people but he forgot to tell me what his notation was like or what its simplicities consisted in so i could not have written the article if i had wanted towhich i didnt because i hate strangers with axes to grind i wrote him a courteous note explaining how busy i wasi always explain how busy i amand casually drooped this remark  i judge the xx notation to be a rational mode of representing music in place of the prevailing fashion which was the invention of an idiot  next mail he asked permission to print that meaningless remark i answered nocourteously but still no explaining that i could not afford to be placed in the attitude of trying to influence people with a mere worthless guess what a scorcher i got next mail such irony such sarcasm such caustic praise of my superhonorable loyalty to the public and withal such compassion for my stupidity too in not being able to understand my own language i cannot remember the words of this letter broadside but there was about a page used up in turning this idea round and round and exposing it in different lights                               unmailed answer  dear sirwhat is the trouble with you if it is your viscera you cannot have them taken out and reorganized a moment too soon i mean if they are inside but if you are composed of them that is another matter is it your brain but it could not be your brain possibly it is your skull you want to look out for that some people when they get an idea it pries the structure apart your system of notation has got in there and couldnt find room without a doubt that is what the trouble is your skull was not made to put ideas in it was made to throw potatoes at                           yours truly                                 mailed answer  dear sircome cometake a walk you disturb the children                           yours truly   there was a day now happily nearly over when certain newspapers made a practice of inviting men distinguished in any walk of life to give their time and effort without charge to express themselves on some subject of the day or perhaps they were asked to send their favorite passages in prose or verse with the reasons why such symposiums were features that cost the newspapers only the writing of a number of letters stationery and postage to one such invitation mark twain wrote two replies they follow herewith                               unmailed answer  dear siri have received your propositionwhich you have imitated from a pauper london periodical which had previously imitated the idea of this sort of mendicancy from seventhrate american journalism where it originated as a variation of the inexpensive interview  why do you buy associated press dispatches to make your paper the more salable you answer but why dont you try to beg them why do you discriminate i can sell my stuff why should i give it to you why dont you ask me for a shirt what is the difference between asking me for the worth of a shirt and asking me for the shirt itself perhaps you didnt know you were begging i would not use that argumentit makes the user a fool the passage of poetryor prose if you willwhich has taken deepest root in my thought and which i oftenest return to and dwell upon with keenest no matter what is this that the proper place for journalists who solicit literary charity is on the street corner with their hats in their hands                                 mailed answer  dear siryour favor of recent date is received but i am obliged by press of work to decline        the manager of a traveling theatrical company wrote that he had      taken the liberty of dramatizing tom sawyer and would like also the      use of the authors namethe idea being to convey to the public      that it was a mark twain play  in return for this slight favor the      manager sent an invitation for mark twain to come and see the play      to be present on the opening night as it were at his the      managers expense  he added that if the play should be a go in the      cities there might be some arrangement of profits  apparently      these inducements did not appeal to mark twain  the long unmailed      reply is the more interesting but probably the briefer one that      follows it was quite as effective                               unmailed answer                                               hartford sept 8 87  dear sirand so it has got around to you at last and you also have taken the liberty you are no 1365 when 1364 sweeter and better people including the author have tried to dramatize tom sawyer and did not arrive what sort of show do you suppose you stand that is a book dear sir which cannot be dramatized one might as well try to dramatize any other hymn tom sawyer is simply a hymn put into prose form to give it a worldly air  why the pale doubt that flitteth dim and nebulous athwart the forecastle of your third sentence have no fears your piece will be a go it will go out the back door on the first night theyve all done itthe 1364 so will 1365 not one of us ever thought of the simple device of halfsoling himself with a stovelid ah what suffering a little hindsight would have saved us treasure this hint  how kind of you to invite me to the funeral go to i have attended a thousand of them i have seen tom sawyers remains in all the different kinds of dramatic shrouds there are you cannot start anything fresh are you serious when you propose to pay my expenceif that is the susquehannian way of spelling it and can you be aware that i charge a hundred dollars a mile when i travel for pleasure do you realize that it is 432 miles to susquehanna would it be handy for you to send me the 43200 first so i could be counting it as i come along because railroading is pretty dreary to a sensitive nature when theres nothing sordid to buck at for zeitvertreib  now as i understand it dear and magnanimous 1365 you are going to recreate tom sawyer dramatically and then do me the compliment to put me in the bills as father of this shady offspring sir do you know that this kind of a compliment has destroyed people before now listen  twentyfour years ago i was strangely handsome the remains of it are still visible through the rifts of time i was so handsome that human activities ceased as if spellbound when i came in view and even inanimate things stopped to looklike locomotives and district messenger boys and soon in san francisco in the rainy season i was often mistaken for fair weather upon one occasion i was traveling in the sonora region and stopped for an hours nooning to rest my horse and myself all the town came out to look the tribes of indians gathered to look a piute squaw named her baby for mea voluntary compliment which pleased me greatly other attentions were paid me last of all arrived the president and faculty of sonora university and offered me the post of professor of moral culture and the dogmatic humanities which i accepted gratefully and entered at once upon my duties but my name had pleased the indians and in the deadly kindness of their hearts they went on naming their babies after me i tried to stop it but the indians could not understand why i should object to so manifest a compliment the thing grew and grew and spread and spread and became exceedingly embarrassing the university stood it a couple of years but then for the sake of the college they felt obliged to call a halt although i had the sympathy of the whole faculty the president himself said to me i am as sorry as i can be for you and would still hold out if there were any hope ahead but you see how it is there are a hundred and thirtytwo of them already and fourteen precincts to hear from the circumstance has brought your name into most wide and unfortunate renown it causes much commenti believe that that is not an overstatement some of this comment is palliative but some of itby patrons at a distance who only know the statistics without the explanationis offensive and in some cases even violent nine students have been called home the trustees of the college have been growing more and more uneasy all these last monthssteadily along with the implacable increase in your censusand i will not conceal from you that more than once they have touched upon the expediency of a change in the professorship of moral culture the coarsely sarcastic editorial in yesterdays alta headed give the moral acrobat a resthas brought things to a crisis and i am charged with the unpleasant duty of receiving your resignation  i know you only mean me a kindness dear 1365 but it is a most deadly mistake please do not name your injun for me truly yours                                 mailed answer                                           new york sept 8  1887  dear sirnecessarily i cannot assent to so strange a proposition and i think it but fair to warn you that if you put the piece on the stage you must take the legal consequences                           yours respectfully                                     s l clemens        before the days of international copyright no american authors      books were pirated more freely by canadian publishers than those of      mark twain  it was always a sore point with him that these books      cheaply printed found their way into the united states and were      sold in competition with his better editions  the law on the      subject seemed to be rather hazy and its various interpretations      exasperating  in the next unmailed letter mark twain relieves      himself to a misguided official  the letter is worth reading today      if for no other reason to show the absurdity of copyright      conditions which prevailed at that time             unmailed letter to h c christiancy on book piracy                                               hartford dec 18 87  h c christiancy esq  dear siras i understand it the position of the u s government is this if a person be captured on the border with counterfeit bonds in his handsbonds of the n y central railway for instancethe procedure in his case shall be as follows  1 if the n y c have not previously filed in the several police offices along the border proof of ownership of the originals of the bonds the government officials must collect a duty on the counterfeits and then let them go ahead and circulate in this country  2 but if there is proof already on file then the n y c may pay the duty and take the counterfeits  but in no case will the united states consent to go without its share of the swag it is delicious the biggest and proudest government on earth turned sneakthief collecting pennies on stolen property and pocketing them with a greasy and libidinous leer going into partnership with foreign thieves to rob its own children and when the child escapes the foreigner descending to the abysmal baseness of hanging on and robbing the infant all alone by itself dear sir this is not any more respectable than for a father to collect toll on the forced prostitution of his own daughter in fact it is the same thing upon these terms what is a u s custom house but a fence that is all it is a legalized trader in stolen goods  and this nasty law this filthy law this unspeakable law calls itself a regulation for the protection of owners of copyright can sarcasm go further than that in what way does it protect them inspiration itself could not furnish a rational answer to that question whom does it protect then nobody as far as i can see but the foreign thiefsometimesand his fellowfootpad the u s government all the time what could the central company do with the counterfeit bonds after it had bought them of the star spangled banner masterthief sell them at a dollar apiece and fetch down the market for the genuine hundreddollar bond what could i do with that 20cent copy of roughing it which the united states has collared on the border and is waiting to release to me for cash in case i am willing to come down to its moral level and help rob myself sell it at ten or fifteen centsduty addedand destroy the market for the original 350 book who ever did invent that law i would like to know the name of that immortal jackass  dear sir i appreciate your courtesy in stretching your authority in the desire to do me a kindness and i sincerely thank you for it but i have no use for that book and if i were even starving for it i would not pay duty on in either to get it or suppress it no doubt there are ways in which i might consent to go into partnership with thieves and fences but this is not one of them this one revolts the remains of my selfrespect turns my stomach i think i could companion with a highwayman who carried a shotgun and took many risks yes i think i should like that if i were younger but to go in with a big rich government that robs paupers and the widows and orphans of paupers and takes no riskwhy the thought just gags me  oh no i shall never pay any duties on pirated books of mine i am much too respectable for thatyet awhile but hereone thing that grovels me is this as far as i can discoverwhile freely granting that the u s copyright laws are far and away the most idiotic that exist anywhere on the face of the earththey dont authorize the government to admit pirated books into this country toll or no toll and so i think that that regulation is the invention of one of those peopleas a rule early stricken of god intellectuallythe departmental interpreters of the laws in washington they can always be depended on to take any reasonably good law and interpret the common sense all out of it they can be depended on every time to defeat a good law and make it inoperativeyes and utterly grotesque too mere matter for laughter and derision take some of the decisions of the postoffice department for instancethough i do not mean to suggest that that asylum is any worse than the others for the breeding and nourishing of incredible lunaticsi merely instance it because it happens to be the first to come into my mind take that case of a few years ago where the p m general suddenly issued an edict requiring you to add the name of the state after boston new york chicago c in your superscriptions on pain of having your letter stopped and forwarded to the deadletter office yes and i believe he required the county too he made one little concession in favor of new york you could say new york city and stop there but if you left off the city you must add n y to your new york why it threw the business of the whole country into chaos and brought commerce almost to a standstill now think of that when that man goes totowell wherever he is going towe shant want the microscopic details of his address i guess we can find him  well as i was saying i believe that this whole paltry and ridiculous swindle is a pure creation of one of those cabbages that used to be at the head of one of those retreats down theredepartments you knowand that you will find it so if you will look into it and moreoverbut land i reckon we are both tired by this time                                truly yours                                              mark twain      xxvii miscellaneous letters of 1887 literary articles peaceful days at the farm favorite reading apology to mrs cleveland etc  we have seen in the preceding chapter how unknown aspirants in one field or another were always seeking to benefit by mark twains reputation once he remarked the symbol of the human race ought to be an ax every human being has one concealed about him somewhere he declared when a stranger called on him or wrote to him in nine cases out of ten he could distinguish the gleam of the ax almost immediately the following letter is closely related to those of the foregoing chapter only that this one was mailednot once but many times in some form adapted to the specific applicant it does not matter to whom it was originally written the name would not be recognized     to mrs t concerning unearned credentials etc                                                    hartford 1887  my dear madamit is an idea which many people have had but it is of no value i have seen it tried out many and many a time i have seen a lady lecturer urged and urged upon the public in a lavishly complimentary document signed by longfellow whittier holmes and some others of supreme celebrity butthere was nothing in her and she failed if there had been any great merit in her she never would have needed those mens help and at her rather mature age would never have consented to ask for it  there is an unwritten law about human successes and your sister must bow to that law she must submit to its requirements in brief this law is       1  no occupation without an apprenticeship       2  no pay to the apprentice  this law stands right in the way of the subaltern who wants to be a general before he has smelt powder and it stands and should stand in everybodys way who applies for pay or position before he has served his apprenticeship and proved himself your sisters course is perfectly plain let her enclose this letter to maj j b pond and offer to lecture a year for 10 a week and her expenses the contract to be annullable by him at any time after a months notice but not annullable by her at all the second year he to have her services if he wants them at a trifle under the best price offered her by anybody else  she can learn her trade in those two years and then be entitled to remunerationbut she can not learn it in any less time than that unless she is a human miracle  try it and do not be afraid it is the fair and right thing if she wins she will win squarely and righteously and never have to blush                                     truly yours                                              s l clemens        howells wrote in february offering to get a publisher to take the      library of humor off mark twains hands  howells had been paid      twentysix hundred dollars for the work on it and his conscience      hurt him when he reflected that the book might never be used  in      this letter he also refers to one of the disastrous inventions in      which clemens had investeda method of casting brass dies for      stamping bookcovers and wallpaper  howellss purpose was to      introduce something of the matter into his next story  mark twains      reply gives us a light on this particular invention                                                hartford feb 15 87  dear howellsi was in new york five days ago and webster mentioned the library and proposed to publish it a year or a year and half hence i have written him your proposition today the library is part of the property of the c l w  co firm  i dont remember what that technical phrase was but i think you will find it in any cyclopedia under the head of brass the thing i best remember is that the selfstyled inventor had a very ingenious way of keeping me from seeing him apply his invention the first appointment was spoiled by his burning down the mans shop in which it was to be done the night before the second was spoiled by his burning down his own shop the night before he unquestionably did both of these things he really had no invention the whole project was a blackmailing swindle and cost me several thousand dollars  the slip you sent me from the may study has delighted mrs clemens and me to the marrow to think that thing might be possible to many but to be brave enough to say it is possible to you only i certainly believe the longer i live the clearer i perceive how unmatchable how unapproachable a compliment one pays when he says of a man he has the courage to utter his convictions havent you had reviewers talk alps to you and then print potato hills  i havent as good an opinion of my work as you hold of it but ive always done what i could to secure and enlarge my good opinion of it ive always said to myself everybody reads it and thats somethingit surely isnt pernicious or the most acceptable people would get pretty tired of it and when a critic said by implication that it wasnt high and fine through the remark high and fine literature is wine i retorted confidentially to myself yes high and fine literature is wine and mine is only water but everybody likes water  you didnt tell me to return that proofslip so i have pasted it into my private scrapbook none will see it there with a thousand thanks                                ys ever                                         mark        our next letter is an unmailed answer but it does not belong with      the others having been withheld for reasons of quite a different      sort  jeanette gilder then of the critic was one of mark twains      valued friends  in the comment which he made when it was shown to      him twentytwo years later he tells us why he thinks this letter      was not sent  the name restandbethankful was the official      title given to the summer place at elmira but it was more often      known as quarry     to jeannette gilder not mailed                                                    hartford may 14 87  my dear miss gilderwe shall spend the summer at the same old placethe remote farm called restandbethankful on top of the hills three miles from elmira n y your other question is harder to answer it is my habit to keep four or five books in process of erection all the time and every summer add a few courses of bricks to two or three of them but i cannot forecast which of the two or three it is going to be it takes seven years to complete a book by this method but still it is a good method gives the public a rest i have been accused of rushing into print prematurely moved thereto by greediness for money but in truth i have never done that do you care for trifles of information well then tom sawyer and the prince and the pauper were each on the stocks two or three years and old times on the mississippi eight one of my unfinished books has been on the stocks sixteen years another seventeen this latter book could have been finished in a day at any time during the past five years but as in the first of these two narratives all the action takes place in noahs ark and as in the other the action takes place in heaven there seemed to be no hurry and so i have not hurried tales of stirring adventure in those localities do not need to be rushed to publication lest they get stale by waiting in twentyone years with all my time at my free disposal i have written and completed only eleven books whereas with half the labor that a journalist does i could have written sixty in that time i do not greatly mind being accused of a proclivity for rushing into print but at the same time i dont believe that the charge is really well founded suppose i did write eleven books have you nothing to be grateful for go toremember the fortynine which i didnt write                                truly yours                                         s l clemens                     notes added twentytwo years later  stormfield april 30 1909 it seems the letter was not sent i probably feared she might print it and i couldnt find a way to say so without running a risk of hurting her no one would hurt jeannette gilder purposely and no one would want to run the risk of doing it unintentionally she is my neighbor six miles away now and i must ask her about this ancient letter  i note with pride and pleasure that i told no untruths in my unsent answer i still have the habit of keeping unfinished books lying around years and years waiting i have four or five novels on hand at present in a halffinished condition and it is more than three years since i have looked at any of them i have no intention of finishing them i could complete all of them in less than a year if the impulse should come powerfully upon me long long ago moneynecessity furnished that impulse once following the equator but mere desire for money has never furnished it so far as i remember not even moneynecessity was able to overcome me on a couple of occasions when perhaps i ought to have allowed it to succeed while i was a bankrupt and in debt two offers were made me for weekly literary contributions to continue during a year and they would have made a debtless man of me but i declined them with my wifes full approval for i had known of no instance where a man had pumped himself out once a week and failed to run emptyings before the year was finished  as to that noahs ark book i began it in edinburgh in 1873this is not quite correct the noahs ark book was begun in buffalo in 1870 i dont know where the manuscript is now it was a diary which professed to be the work of shem but wasnt i began it again several months ago but only for recreation i hadnt any intention of carrying it to a finishor even to the end of the first chapter in fact  as to the book whose action takes place in heaven that was a small thing captain stormfields visit to heaven it lay in my pigeonholes 40 years then i took it out and printed it in harpers monthly last year                           s l c   in the next letter we get a pretty and peaceful picture of restandbethankful these were mark twains balmy days the financial drain of the typemachine was heavy but not yet exhausting and the prospect of vast returns from it seemed to grow brighter each day his publishing business though less profitable was still prosperous his family life was ideal how gratefully then he could enter into the peace of that perfect day     to mrs orion clemens in keokuk ia                                     on the hill near elmira july 10 87  dear molliethis is a superb sunday for weathervery cloudy and the thermometer as low as 65 the city in the valley is purple with shade as seen from up here at the study the cranes are reading and loafing in the canvascurtained summerhouse 50 yards away on a higher the highest point the cats are loafing over at ellerslie which is the childrens estate and dwellinghouse in their own private grounds by deed from susie crane a hundred yards from the study amongst the clover and young oaks and willows livy is down at the house but i shall now go and bring her up to the cranes to help us occupy the lounges and hammockswhence a great panorama of distant hill and valley and city is seeable the children have gone on a lark through the neighboring hills and woods it is a perfect day indeed                           with love to you all                                                   sam   two days after this letter was written we get a hint of what was the beginning of business troublethat is to say of the failing health of charles l webster webster was ambitious nervous and not robust he had overworked and was paying the penalty his trouble was neurasthenia and he was presently obliged to retire altogether from the business the sam and mary mentioned were samuel moffet and his wife     to mrs pamela moffett in fredonia n y                                                    elmira july 12 87  my dear sisteri had no idea that charleys case was so serious i knew it was bad and persistent but i was not aware of the full size of the matter  i have just been writing to a friend in hartford who treated what i imagine was a similar case surgically last fall and produced a permanent cure if this is a like case charley must go to him  if relief fails there he must take the required rest whether the business can stand it or not  it is most pleasant to hear such prosperous accounts of sam and mary i do not see how sam could well be more advantageously fixed he can grow up with that paper and achieve a successful life  it is not all holiday here with susie and clara this time they have to put in some little time every day on their studies jean thinks she is studying too but i dont know what it is unless it is the horses she spends the day under their heels in the stablesand that is but a continuation of her hartford system of culture  with love from us all to you all                                affectionately                                              sam   mark twain had a few books that he read regularly every year or two among these were pepyss diary suetoniuss lives of the twelve caesars and thomas carlyles french revolution he had a passion for history biography and personal memoirs of any sort in his early life he had cared very little for poetry but along in the middle eighties he somehow acquired a taste for browning and became absorbed in it a browning club assembled as often as once a week at the clemens home in hartford to listen to his readings of the master he was an impressive reader and he carefully prepared himself for these occasions indicating by graduated underscorings the exact values he wished to give to words and phrases those were memorable gatherings and they must have continued through at least two winters it is one of the puzzling phases of mark twains character that notwithstanding his passion for direct and lucid expression he should have found pleasure in the poems of robert browning     to w d howells in boston                                               elmira aug  22 87  my dear howellshow stunning are the changes which age makes in a man while he sleeps when i finished carlyles french revolution in 1871 i was a girondin every time i have read it since i have read it differently being influenced and changed little by little by life and environment and taine and st simon and now i lay the book down once more and recognize that i am a sansculotteand not a pale characterless sansculotte but a marat carlyle teaches no such gospel so the change is in mein my vision of the evidences  people pretend that the bible means the same to them at 50 that it did at all former milestones in their journey i wonder how they can lie so it comes of practice no doubt they would not say that of dickenss or scotts books nothing remains the same when a man goes back to look at the house of his childhood it has always shrunk there is no instance of such a house being as big as the picture in memory and imagination call for shrunk how why to its correct dimensions the house hasnt altered this is the first time it has been in focus  well thats loss to have house and bible shrink so under the disillusioning corrected angle is lossfor a moment but there are compensations you tilt the tube skyward and bring planets and comets and corona flames a hundred and fifty thousand miles high into the field which i see you have done and found tolstoi i havent got him in focus yet but ive got browning                                     ys ever                                              mark        mention has been made already of mark twains tendency to      absentmindedness  he was always forgetting engagements or getting      them wrong  once he hurried to an afternoon party and finding the      mistress of the house alone sat down and talked to her comfortably      for an hour or two not remembering his errand at all  it was only      when he reached home that he learned that the party had taken place      the week before  it was always dangerous for him to make      engagements and he never seemed to profit by sorrowful experience      we however may profit now by one of his amusing apologies     to mrs grover cleveland in washington                                               hartford nov  6 1887  my dear madami do not know how it is in the white house but in this house of ours whenever the minor half of the administration tries to run itself without the help of the major half it gets aground last night when i was offered the opportunity to assist you in the throwing open the warner brothers superb benefaction in bridgeport to those fortunate women i naturally appreciated the honor done me and promptly seized my chance i had an engagement but the circumstances washed it out of my mind if i had only laid the matter before the major half of the administration on the spot there would have been no blunder but i never thought of that so when i did lay it before her later i realized once more that it will not do for the literary fraction of a combination to try to manage affairs which properly belong in the office of the business bulk of it i suppose the president often acts just like that goes and makes an impossible promise and you never find it out until it is next to impossible to break it up and set things straight again well that is just our way exactlyone half of the administration always busy getting the family into trouble and the other half busy getting it out again and so we do seem to be all pretty much alike after all the fact is i had forgotten that we were to have a dinner party on that bridgeport datei thought it was the next day which is a good deal of an improvement for me because i am more used to being behind a day or two than ahead but that is just the difference between one end of this kind of an administration and the other end of it as you have noticed yourselfthe other end does not forget these things just so with a funeral if it is the mans funeral he is most always there of coursebut that is no credit to him he wouldnt be there if you depended on him to remember about it whereas if on the other handbut i seem to have got off from my line of argument somehow never mind about the funeral of course i am not meaning to say anything against funeralsthat is as occasionsmere occasionsfor as diversions i dont think they amount to much but as i was sayingif you are not busy i will look back and see what it was i was saying  i dont seem to find the place but anyway she was as sorry as ever anybody could be that i could not go to bridgeport but there was no help for it and i i have been not only sorry but very sincerely ashamed of having made an engagement to go without first making sure that i could keep it and i do not know how to apologize enough for my heedless breach of good manners                      with the sincerest respect                                         s l clemens        samuel clemens was one of the very few authors to copyright a book      in england before the enactment of the international copyright law      as early as 1872 he copyrighted roughing it in england and      piratical publishers there respected his rights  finally in 1887      the inland revenue office assessed him with income tax which he      very willingly paid instructing his london publishers chatto       windus to pay on the full amount he had received from them  but      when the receipt for his taxes came it was nearly a yard square with      due postage of considerable amount  then he wrote     to mr chatto of chatto  windus in london                                               hartford dec 5 87  my dear chattolook here i dont mind paying the tax but dont you let the inland revenue office send me any more receipts for it for the postage is something perfectly demoralizing if they feel obliged to print a receipt on a horseblanket why dont they hire a ship and send it over at their own expense  wasnt it good that they caught me out with an old book instead of a new one the tax on a new book would bankrupt a body it was my purpose to go to england next may and stay the rest of the year but ive found that tax office out just in time my new book would issue in march and they would tax the sale in both countries come we must get up a compromise somehow you go and work in on the good side of those revenue people and get them to take the profits and give me the tax then i will come over and we will divide the swag and have a good time  i wish you to thank mr christmas for me but we wont resist the country that allows me copyright has a right to tax me                                sincerely yours                                         s l clemens        another english tax assessment came that year based on the report      that it was understood that he was going to become an english      resident and had leased buckenham hall norwich for a year      clemens wrote his publishers i will explain that all that about      buckenham hall was an english newspapers mistake  i was not in      england and if i had been i wouldnt have been at buckenham hall      anyway but at buckingham palace or i would have endeavored to find      out the reason why  clemens made literature out of this tax      experience  he wrote an open letter to her majesty queen victoria      such a letter has no place in this collection  it was published in      the drawer of harpers magazine december 1887 and is now      included in the uniform edition of his works under the title of      a petition to the queen of england       from the following letter written at the end of the year we gather      that the typesetter costs were beginning to make a difference in      the clemens economies     to mrs moffett in fredonia                                               hartford dec 18 87  dear pamelawill you take this 15 and buy some candy or some other trifle for yourself and sam and his wife to remember that we remember you by  if we werent a little crowded this year by the typesetter id send a check large enough to buy a family bible or some other useful thing like that however we go on and on but the typesetter goes on foreverat 3000 a month which is much more satisfactory than was the case the first seventeen months when the bill only averaged 2000 and promised to take a thousand years well be through now in 3 or 4 months i reckon and then the strain will let up and we can breathe freely once more whether success ensues or failure  even with a typesetter on hand we ought not to be in the least scrimpedbut it would take a long letter to explain why and who is to blame  all the family send love to all of you and best christmas wishes for your prosperity                      affectionately                                         sam     xxviii letters1888 a yale degree work on the yankee on interviewing etc       mark twain received his first college degree when he was made master      of arts by yale in june 1888  editor of the courant charles h      clarke was selected to notify him of his new title  clarke was an      old friend to whom clemens could write familiarly     to charles h clarke in hartford                                                    elmira july 2 88  my dear charlesthanks for your thanks and for your initiation intentions i shall be ready for you i feel mighty proud of that degree in fact i could squeeze the truth a little closer and say vain of it and why shouldnt i bei am the only literary animal of my particular subspecies who has ever been given a degree by any college in any age of the world as far as i know                                     sincerely yours                                              s l clemens m a                   reply charles h clarke to s l clemens  my dear friend you are the only literary animal of your particular subspecies in existence and youve no cause for humility in the fact yale has done herself at least as much credit as she has done you and dont you forget it                                c h c        with the exception of his brief return to the river in 1882  mark      twain had been twentyseven years away from pilots and piloting      nevertheless he always kept a tender place in his heart for the old      times and for old river comrades  major jack downing had been a      mississippi pilot of early days but had long since retired from the      river to a comfortable life ashore in an ohio town  clemens had      not heard from him for years when a letter came which invited the      following answer     to major jack downing in middleport ohio                                          elmira n yno month 1888  dear majorand has it come to this that the dead rise up and speak for i supposed that you were dead it has been so long since i heard your name  and how young youve grown i was a mere boy when i knew you on the river where you had been piloting for 35 years and now you are only a year and a half older than i am i mean to go to hot springs myself and get 30 or 40 years knocked off my age its manifestly the place that ponce de leon was striking for but the poor fellow lost the trail  possibly i may see you for i shall be in st louis a day or two in november i propose to go down the river and note the changes once more before i make the long crossing and perhaps you can come there will you i want to see all the boys that are left alive  and so grant marsh too is flourishing yet a mighty good fellow and smart too when we were taking that wood flat down to the chambers which was aground i soon saw that i was a perfect lubber at piloting such a thing i saw that i could never hit the chambers with it so i resigned in marshs favor and he accomplished the task to my admiration we should all have gone to the mischief if i had remained in authority i always had good judgement more judgement than talent in fact  no the nom de plume did not originate in that way capt sellers used the signature mark twain himself when he used to write up the antiquities in the way of river reminiscences for the new orleans picayune he hated me for burlesquing them in an article in the true delta so four years later when he died i robbed the corpsethat is i confiscated the nom de plume i have published this vital fact 3000 times now but no matter it is good practice it is about the only fact that i can tell the same way every time very glad indeed to hear from you major and shall be gladder still to see you in november                                truly yours                                         s l clemens        he did not make the journey down the river planned for that year      he had always hoped to make another steamboat trip with bixby but      one thing and another interfered and he did not go again       authors were always sending their books to mark twain to read and      no busy man was ever more kindly disposed toward such offerings      more generously considerate of the senders  louis pendleton was a      young unknown writer in 1888 but clemens took time to read his      story carefully and to write to him about it a letter that cost      precious time thought and effort  it must have rejoiced the young      mans heart to receive a letter like that from one whom all young      authors held supreme     to louis pendleton in georgia                                          elmira n y aug 4 88  my dear siri found your letter an hour ago among some others which had lain forgotten a couple of weeks and i at once stole time enough to read ariadne stole is the right word for the summer vacation is the only chance i get for work so no minute subtracted from work is borrowed it is stolen but this time i do not repent as a rule people dont send me books which i can thank them for and so i say nothingwhich looks uncourteous but i thank you ariadne is a beautiful and satisfying story and true toowhich is the best part of a story or indeed of any other thing even liars have to admit that if they are intelligent liars i mean in their private the word conscientious written but erased intervals i struck that word out because a mans private thought can never be a lie what he thinks is to him the truth always what he speaksbut these be platitudes  if you want me to pick some flawsvery wellbut i do it unwillingly i notice one thingwhich one may notice also in my books and in all books whether written by man or god trifling carelessness of statement or expression if i think that you meant that she took the lizard from the water which she had drawn from the well it is evidenceit is almost proofthat your words were not as clear as they should have been true it is only a trifling thing but so is mist on a mirror i would have hung the pail on ariadnes arm you did not deceive me when you said that she carried it under her arm for i knew she didnt still it was not your right to mar my enjoyment of the graceful picture if the pail had been a portfolio i wouldnt be making these remarks the engraver of a fine picture revises and revises and revisesand then revises and revises and revises and then repeats and always the charm of that picture grows under his hand it was good enough beforetold its story and was beautiful true and a lovely girl is lovely with freckles but she isnt at her level best with them  this is not hypercriticism you have had training enough to know that  so much concerning exactness of statement in that other notsmall matterselection of the exact single wordyou are hard to catch still i should hold that mrs walker considered that there was no occasion for concealment that motive implied a deeper mental search than she expended on the matter that it doesnt reflect the attitude of her mind with precision is this hypercriticism i shant dispute it i only say that if mrs walker didnt go so far as to have a motive i had to suggest that when a word is so near the right one that a body cant quite tell whether it is or isnt its good politics to strike it out and go for the thesaurus thats all motive may stand but you have allowed a snake to scream and i will not concede that that was the best word  i do not apologize for saying these things for they are not said in the speckhunting spirit but in the spirit of wanttohelpifican they would be useful to me if said to me once a month they may be useful to you said once  i save the other stories for my real vacationwhich is nine months long to my sorrow i thank you again                                truly yours                                              s l clemens        in the next letter we get a sidelight on the typesetting machine      the frankenstein monster that was draining their substance and      holding out false hopes of relief and golden return  the program      here outlined was one that would continue for several years yet      with the end always in sight but never quite attained     to orion clemens in keokuk ia                                                         oct 3 88  private  saturday 29th by a closely calculated estimate there were 85 days work to do on the machine  we can use 4 men but not constantly if they could work constantly it would complete the machine in 21 days of course they will all be on hand and under wages and each will get in all the work there is opportunity for but by how much they can reduce the 85 days toward the 21 days nobody can tell    today i pay pratt  whitney 10000 this squares back indebtedness and everything to date they began about may or april or march 1886along there somewhere and have always kept from a dozen to two dozen masterhands on the machine  that outgo is done 4 men for a month or two will close up that leak and caulk it work on the patents is also kind of drawing toward a conclusion  love to you both all well here  and give our love to ma if she can get the idea                                          sam        mark twain that year was working pretty steadily on the yankee at      king arthurs court a book which he had begun two years before      he had published nothing since the huck finn story and his company      was badly in need of a new book by an author of distinction  also      it was highly desirable to earn money for himself wherefore he set      to work to finish the yankee story  he had worked pretty steadily      that summer in his elmira study but on his return to hartford found      a good deal of confusion in the house so went over to twichells      where carpenter work was in progress  he seems to have worked there      successfully though what improvement of conditions he found in that      numerous lively household over those at home it would be difficult      to say     to theodore w crane at quarry farm elmira n y                                                    friday oct5 88  dear theoi am here in twichells house at work with the noise of the children and an army of carpenters to help of course they dont help but neither do they hinder its like a boilerfactory for racket and in nailing a wooden ceiling onto the room under me the hammering tickles my feet amazingly sometimes and jars my table a good deal but i never am conscious of the racket at all and i move my feet into position of relief without knowing when i do it i began here monday morning and have done eighty pages since i was so tired last night that i thought i would lie abed and rest today but i couldnt resist i mean to try to knock off tomorrow but its doubtful if i do i want to finish the day the machine finishes and a week ago the closest calculations for that indicated oct 22but experience teaches me that their calculations will miss fire as usual  the other day the children were projecting a purchase livy and i to furnish the moneya dollar and a half jean discouraged the idea she said we havent got any money children if you would think you would remember the machine isnt done  its billiards tonight i wish you were here                      with love to you both                                              s l c  p s i got it all

              hartford nov 4 88  dear willi received your letter yesterday evening just as i was starting out of town to attend a wedding and so my mind was privately busy all the evening in the midst of the maelstrom of chat and chaff and laughter with the sort of reflections which create themselves examine themselves and continue themselves unaffected by surroundingsunaffected that is understood by the surroundings but not uninfluenced by them here was the near presence of the two supreme events of life marriage which is the beginning of life and death which is the end of it i found myself seeking chances to shirk into corners where i might think undisturbed and the most i got out of my thought was this both marriage and death ought to be welcome the one promises happiness doubtless the other assures it a long procession of people filed through my mindpeople whom you and i knew so many years agoso many centuries ago it seems likeand these ancient dead marched to the soft marriage music of a band concealed in some remote room of the house and the contented music and the dreaming shades seemed in right accord with each other and fitting nobody else knew that a procession of the dead was passing though this noisy swarm of the living but there it was and to me there was nothing uncanny about it rio they were welcome faces to me i would have liked to bring up every creature we knew in those dayseven the dumb animalsit would be bathing in the fabled fountain of youth  we all feel your deep trouble with you and we would hope if we might but your words deny us that privilege to die ones self is a thing that must be easy and of light consequence but to lose a part of ones selfwell we know how deep that pang goes we who have suffered that disaster received that wound which cannot heal                                sincerely your friend                                              s l clemens        his next is of quite a different nature  evidently the typesetting      conditions had alarmed orion and he was undertaking some economies      with a view of retrenchment  orion was always reducing economy to      science  once at an earlier date he recorded that he had figured      his personal living expenses down to sixty cents a week but      inasmuch as he was then by his own confession unable to earn the      sixty cents this particular economy was wasted  orion was a trial      certainly and the explosion that follows was not without excuse      furthermore it was not as bad as it sounds  mark twains rages      always had an element of humor in them a fact which no one more      than orion himself would appreciate  he preserved this letter      quietly noting on the envelope letter from sam about mas nurse                   letter to orion clemens

yourselves hire the attendant and tell me her cost so that i can instruct webster  co to add it every month to what they already send dont fool away any more time about this and dont write me any more damned rot about storms and inability to pay trivial sums of money andandhell and damnation you see ive read only the first page of your letter i wouldnt read the rest for a million dollars

i am on my way to the poorhouse for i am not or that i am uneasy for i am not or that i am uncomfortable or unhappyfor i never am i dont know what it is to be unhappy or uneasy and i am not going to try to learn how at this late day                                     sam        few men were ever interviewed oftener than mark twain yet he never      welcomed interviewers and was seldom satisfied with them  what i      say in an interview loses it character in print he often remarked      all its life and personality  the reporter realizes this himself      and tries to improve upon me but he doesnt help matters any       edward w bok before he became editor of the ladies home journal      was conducting a weekly syndicate column under the title of boks      literary leaves  it usually consisted of news and gossip of      writers comment etc literary odds and ends and occasional      interviews with distinguished authors  he went up to hartford one      day to interview mark twain  the result seemed satisfactory to bok      but wishing to be certain that it would be satisfactory to clemens      he sent him a copy for approval  the interview was not returned      in the place of it came a letternot altogether disappointing as      the reader may believe     to edward w bok in new york  my dear mr bokno no it is like most interviews pure twaddle and valueless  for several quite plain and simple reasons an interview must as a rule be an absurdity and chiefly for this reasonit is an attempt to use a boat on land or a wagon on water to speak figuratively spoken speech is one thing written speech is quite another print is the proper vehicle for the latter but it isnt for the former the moment talk is put into print you recognize that it is not what it was when you heard it you perceive that an immense something has disappeared from it that is its soul you have nothing but a dead carcass left on your hands color play of feature the varying modulations of the voice the laugh the smile the informing inflections everything that gave that body warmth grace friendliness and charm and commended it to your affectionsor at least to your toleranceis gone and nothing is left but a pallid stiff and repulsive cadaver  such is talk almost invariably as you see it lying in state in an interview the interviewer seldom tries to tell one how a thing was said he merely puts in the naked remark and stops there when one writes for print his methods are very different he follows forms which have but little resemblance to conversation but they make the reader understand what the writer is trying to convey and when the writer is making a story and finds it necessary to report some of the talk of his characters observe how cautiously and anxiously he goes at that risky and difficult thing if he had dared to say that thing in my presence said alfred taking a mock heroic attitude and casting an arch glance upon the company blood would have flowed  if he had dared to say that thing in my presence said hawkwood with that in his eye which caused more than one heart in that guilty assemblage to quake blood would have flowed  if he had dared to say that thing in my presence said the paltry blusterer with valor on his tongue and pallor on his lips blood would have flowed  so painfully aware is the novelist that naked talk in print conveys no meaning that he loads and often overloads almost every utterance of his characters with explanations and interpretations it is a loud confession that print is a poor vehicle for talk it is a recognition that uninterpreted talk in print would result in confusion to the reader not instruction  now in your interview you have certainly been most accurate you have set down the sentences i uttered as i said them but you have not a word of explanation what my manner was at several points is not indicated therefore no reader can possibly know where i was in earnest and where i was joking or whether i was joking altogether or in earnest altogether such a report of a conversation has no value it can convey many meanings to the reader but never the right one to add interpretations which would convey the right meaning is a something which would requirewhat an art so high and fine and difficult that no possessor of it would ever be allowed to waste it on interviews  no spare the reader and spare me leave the whole interview out it is rubbish i wouldnt talk in my sleep if i couldnt talk better than that  if you wish to print anything print this letter it may have some value for it may explain to a reader here and there why it is that in interviews as a rule men seem to talk like anybody but themselves                           very sincerely yours

type machine paige the inventor seemed at last to have given it its finishing touches the mechanical marvel that had cost so much time mental stress and a fortune in money stood complete responsive to the human will and touchthe latest and one of the greatest wonders of the world to george standring a london printer and publisher clemens wrote the machine is finished and added this is by far the most marvelous invention ever contrived by man and it is not a thing of rags and patches it is made of massive steel and will last a century  in his fever of enthusiasm on that day when he had actually seen it in operation he wrote a number of exuberant letters they were more or less duplicates but as the one to his brother is of fuller detail and more intimate than the others it has been selected for preservation here      to orion clemens in keokuk                                               hartford jan 5 89  dear orionat 1220 this afternoon a line of movable types was spaced and justified by machinery for the first time in the history of the world and i was there to see it was done automaticallyinstantlyperfectly this is indeed the first line of movable types that ever was perfectly spaced and perfectly justified on this earth  this was the last function that remained to be testedand so by long odds the most amazing and extraordinary invention ever born of the brain of man stands completed and perfect livy is down stairs celebrating  but its a cunning devil is that machineand knows more than any man that ever lived you shall see we made the test in this way we set up a lot of random letters in a stickthreefourths of a line then filled out the line with quads representing 14 spaces each space to be 351000 of an inch thick then we threw aside the quads and put the letters into the machine and formed them into 15 twoletter words leaving the words separated by twoinch vacancies then we started up the machine slowly by hand and fastened our eyes on the spaceselecting pins the first pinblock projected its third pin as the first word came traveling along the raceway second block did the same but the third block projected its second pin  oh hell stop the machinesomething wrongits going to set a 301000 space  general consternation a foreign substance has got into the spacing plates this from the head mathematician  yes that is the trouble assented the foreman  paige examined nolook in and you can see that theres nothing of the kind further examination now i know what it iswhat it must be one of those plates projects and binds its too badthe first test is a failure a pause well boys no use to cry get to worktake the machine downnohold on dont touch a thing go right ahead we are fools the machine isnt the machine knows what its about there is a speck of dirt on one of those types and the machine is putting in a thinner space to allow for it  that was just it the machine went right ahead spaced the line justified it to a hair and shoved it into the galley complete and perfect we took it out and examined it with a glass you could not tell by your eye that the third space was thinner than the others but the glass and the calipers showed the difference paige had always said that the machine would measure invisible particles of dirt and allow for them but even he had forgotten that vast fact for the moment  all the witnesses made written record of the immense historical birththe first justification of a line of movable type by machineryand also set down the hour and the minute nobody had drank anything and yet everybody seemed drunk welldizzy stupefied stunned  all the other wonderful inventions of the human brain sink pretty nearly into commonplace contrasted with this awful mechanical miracle telephones telegraphs locomotives cotton gins sewing machines babbage calculators jacquard looms perfecting presses arkwrights framesall mere toys simplicities the paige compositor marches alone and far in the lead of human inventions  in two or three weeks we shall work the stiffness out of her joints and have her performing as smoothly and softly as human muscles and then we shall speak out the big secret and let the world come and gaze  return me this letter when you have read it                                     sam        judge of the elation which such a letter would produce in keokuk      yet it was no greater than that which existed in hartfordfor a      time       then further delays  before the machine got the stiffness out of      her joints that cunning devil manifested a tendency to break the      types and paige who was never happier than when he was pulling      things to pieces and making improvements had the typesetter apart      again and the day of complete triumph was postponed       there was sadness at the elmira farm that spring  theodore crane      who had long been in poor health seemed to grow daily worse  in      february he had paid a visit to hartford and saw the machine in      operation but by the end of may his condition was very serious      remembering his keen sense of humor clemens reported to him      cheering and amusing incidents     to mrs theodore crane in elmira n y                                               hartford may 28 89  susie dear i want you to tell this to theodore you know how absentminded twichell is and how desolate his face is when he is in that frame at such times he passes the word with a friend on the street and is not aware of the meeting at all twice in a week our clara had this latter experience with him within the past month but the second instance was too much for her and she woke him up in his tracks with a reproach she said  uncle joe why do you always look as if you were just going down into the grave when you meet a person on the streetand then went on to reveal to him the funereal spectacle which he presented on such occasions well she has met twichell three times since then and would swim the connecticut to avoid meeting him the fourth as soon as he sights her no matter how public the place nor how far off she is he makes a bound into the air heaves arms and legs into all sorts of frantic gestures of delight and so comes prancing skipping and pirouetting for her like a drunken indian entering heaven  with a full invoice of love from us all to you and theodore                                                    s l c        the reference in the next to the closing sentence in a letter      written by howells to clemens about this time refers to a      heartbroken utterance of the former concerning his daughter      winnie who had died some time before  she had been a gentle      talented girl but never of robust health  her death had followed      a long period of gradual decline     to w d howells in boston                                               hartford judy 13 89  dear howellsi came on from elmira a day or two ago where i left a house of mourning mr crane died after ten months of pain and two whole days of dying at the farm on the hill the 3rd inst a man who had always hoped for a swift death mrs crane and mrs clemens and the children were in a gloom which brought back to me the days of nineteen years ago when mr langdon died it is heartbreaking to see mrs crane many a time in the past ten days the sight of her has reminded me with a pang of the desolation which uttered itself in the closing sentence of your last letter to me i do see that there is an argument against suicide the grief of the worshipers left behind the awful famine in their hearts these are too costly terms for the release  i shall be here ten days yet and all alone nobody in the house but the servants cant mrs howells spare you to me cant you come and stay with me the house is cool and pleasant your work will not be interrupted we will keep to ourselves and let the rest of the world do the same you can have your choice of three bedrooms and you will find the childrens schoolroom which was built for my study the perfection of a retired and silent den for work there isnt a fly or a mosquito on the estate comesay you will  with kindest regards to mrs howells and pilla and john                                     yours ever                                              mark   howells was more hopeful he wrote i read something in a strange book the physical theory of another life that consoles a little namely we see and feel the power of deity in such fullness that we ought to infer the infinite justice and goodness which we do not see or feel and a few days later he wrote i would rather see and talk with you than any other man in the world outside my own blood  a connecticut yankee at king arthurs court was brought to an end that year and given to the artist and printer dan beard was selected for the drawings and was given a free hand as the next letter shows     to fred j hall manager charles l webster  co  charles l webster owing to poor health had by this time retired from the firm                                                    elmira july 20 89  dear mr hallupon reflectionthus tell beard to obey his own inspiration and when he sees a picture in his mind put that picture on paper be it humorous or be it serious i want his genius to be wholly unhampered i shant have fears as to the result they will be better pictures than if i mixed in and tried to give him points on his own trade  send this note and hell understand                                          yr                                              s l c        clemens had made a good choice in selecting beard for the      illustrations  he was well qualified for the work and being of a      socialistic turn of mind put his whole soul into it  when the      drawings were completed clemens wrote hold me under permanent      obligations  what luck it was to find you  there are hundreds of      artists that could illustrate any other book of mine but there was      only one who could illustrate this one  yes it was a fortunate      hour that i went netting for lightning bugs and caught a meteor      live forever       clemens of course was anxious for howells to read the yankee and      mrs clemens particularly so  her eyes were giving her trouble that      summer so that she could not read the ms for herself and she had      grave doubts as to some of its chapters  it may be said here that      the book today might have been better if mrs clemens had been able      to read it  howells was a peerless critic but the revolutionary      subjectmatter of the book so delighted him that he was perhaps      somewhat blinded to its literary defects  however this is      premature  howells did not at once see the story  he had promised      to come to hartford but wrote that trivial matters had made his      visit impossible  from the next letter we get the situation at this      time  the mr church mentioned was frederick s church the      wellknown artist     to w d howells in boston                                               elmira july 24 89  dear howellsi too was as sorry as i could be yes and desperately disappointed i even did a heroic thing shipped my book off to new york lest i should forget hospitality and embitter your visit with it not that i think you wouldnt like to read it for i think you would but not on a holiday thats not the time i see how you were situatedanother familiarity of providence and wholly wanton intrusionand of course we could not help ourselves well just think of it a while ago while providences attention was absorbed in disordering some timetables so as to break up a trip of mine to mr churchs on the hudson that johnstown dam got loose i swear i was afraid to pray for fear i should laugh well im not going to despair well manage a meet yet  i expect to go to hartford again in august and maybe remain till i have to come back here and fetch the family and along there in august some time you let on that you are going to mexico and i will let on that i am going to spitzbergen and then under cover of this clever stratagem we will glide from the trains at worcester and have a time i have noticed that providence is indifferent about mexico and spitzbergen                                     ys ever                                              mark        possibly mark twain was not particularly anxious that howells should      see his ms fearing that he might lay a ruthless hand on some of      his more violent fulminations and wild fancies  however this may      be further postponement was soon at an end  mrs clemenss eyes      troubled her and would not permit her to read so she requested that      the yankee be passed upon by soberminded critics such as howells      and edmund clarence stedman  howells wrote that even if he hadnt      wanted to read the book for its own sake or for the authors sake      he would still want to do it for mrs clemenss  whereupon the      proofs were started in his direction     to w d howells in boston                                               elmira aug  24 89  dear howellsif you should be moved to speak of my book in the study i shall be glad and proudand the sooner it gets in the better for the book though i dont suppose you can get it in earlier than the november numberwhy no you cant get it in till a month later than that well anyway i dont think ill send out any other press copyexcept perhaps to stedman im not writing for those parties who miscall themselves critics and i dont care to have them paw the book at all its my swansong my retirement from literature permanently and i wish to pass to the cemetery unclodded  i judge that the proofs have begun to reach you about this time as i had some though not revises this morning im sure im going to be charmed with beards pictures observe his nice takeoff of middleage artdinnertable scene                                ys sincerely                                              mark        howellss approval of the yankee came almost in the form of exultant      shouts one after reading each batch of proof  first he wrote      its charming original wonderful good in fancy and sound to the      core in morals  and again its a mighty great book and it makes      my heart burn with wrath  it seems god did not forget to put a soul      into you  he shuts most literary men off with a brain merely      then a few days later the book is glorioussimply noble what      masses of virgin truth never touched in print before and finally      last night i read your last chapter  as stedman says of the whole      book its titanic     to w d howells in boston                                               hartford sept  22 89  dear howellsit is immensely good of you to grind through that stuff for me but it gives peace to mrs clemenss soul and i am as grateful to you as a body can be i am glad you approve of what i say about the french revolution few people will it is odd that even to this day americans still observe that immortal benefaction through english and other monarchical eyes and have no shred of an opinion about it that they didnt get at secondhand  next to the 4th of july and its results it was the noblest and the holiest thing and the most precious that ever happened in this earth and its gracious work is not done yetnot anywhere in the remote neighborhood of it  dont trouble to send me all the proofs send me the pages with your corrections on them and wastebasket the rest we issue the book dec 10 consequently a notice that appears dec 20 will be just in good time  i am waiting to see your study set a fashion in criticism when that happensas please god it mustconsider that if you lived three centuries you couldnt do a more valuable work for this country or a humaner  as a rule a critics dissent merely enrages and so does no good but by the new art which you use your dissent must be as welcome as your approval and as valuable i do not know what the secret of it is unless it is your attitudeman courteously reasoning with man and brother in place of the worn and wearisome critical attitude of all this long timesuperior being lecturing a boy  well my book is writtenlet it go but if it were only to write over again there wouldnt be so many things left out they burn in me and they keep multiplying and multiplying but now they cant ever be said and besides they would require a libraryand a pen warmed up in hell                                          ys ever                                                   mark        the typesetting machine began to loom large in the background      clemens believed it perfected by this time  paige had got it      together again and it was running steadilyor approximately so      setting type at a marvelous speed and with perfect accuracy  in      time an expert operator would be able to set as high as eight      thousand ems per hour or about ten times as much as a good      compositor could set and distribute by hand  those who saw it were      convincedmost of themthat the typesetting problem was solved by      this great mechanical miracle  if there were any who doubted it      was because of its marvelously minute accuracy which the others only      admired  such accuracy it was sometimes whispered required      absolutely perfect adjustment and what would happen when the great      inventorthe poet in steel as clemens once called himwas no      longer at hand to supervise and to correct the slightest variation      but no such breath of doubt came to mark twain he believed the      machine as reliable as a constellation       but now there was need of capital to manufacture and market the      wonder  clemens casting about in his mind remembered senator      jones of nevada a man of great wealth and his old friend joe      goodman of nevada in whom jones had unlimited confidence  he      wrote to goodman and in this letter we get a pretty full exposition      of the whole matter as it stood in the fall of 1889  we note in      this communication that clemens says that he has been at the machine      three years and seven months but this was only the period during      which he had spent the regular monthly sum of three thousand      dollars  his interest in the invention had begun as far back as      1880     to joseph t goodman in nevada                                          private  hartford oct 7 89  dear joei had a letter from aleck badlam day before yesterday and in answering him i mentioned a matter which i asked him to consider a secret except to you and john mccombthis is col mccomb of the altacalifornia who had sent mark twain on the quaker city excursionas i am not ready yet to get into the newspapers  i have come near writing you about this matter several times but it wasnt ripe and i waited it is ripe now it is a typesetting machine which i undertook to build for the inventor for a consideration i have been at it three years and seven months without losing a day at a cost of 3000 a month and in so private a way that hartford has known nothing about it indeed only a dozen men have known of the matter i have reported progress from time to time to the proprietors of the n y sun herald times world harper brothers and john f trow also to the proprietors of the boston herald and the boston globe three years ago i asked all these people to squelch their frantic desire to load up their offices with the mergenthaler n y tribune machine and wait for mine and then choose between the two they have waitedwith no very gaudy patiencebut still they have waited and i could prove to them today that they have not lost anything by it but i reserve the proof for the presentexcept in the case of the n y herald i sent an invitation there the other daya courtesy due a paper which ordered 240000 worth of our machines long ago when it was still in a crude condition the herald has ordered its foreman to come up here next thursday but that is the only invitation which will go out for some time yet  the machine was finished several weeks ago and has been running ever since in the machine shop it is a magnificent creature of steel all of pratt  whitneys superbest workmanship and as nicely adjusted and as accurate as a watch in construction it is as elaborate and complex as that machine which it ranks next to by every rightmanand in performance it is as simple and sure  anybody can set type on it who can readand can do it after only 15 minutes instruction the operator does not need to leave his seat at the keyboard for the reason that he is not required to do anything but strike the keys and set typemerely one function the spacing justifying emptying into the galley and distributing of dead matter is all done by the machine without anybodys helpfour functions  the ease with which a cub can learn is surprising day before yesterday i saw our newest cub set perfectly space and perfectly justify 2150 ems of solid nonpareil in an hour and distribute the like amount in the same hourand six hours previously he had never seen the machine or its keyboard it was a good hours work for 3year veterans on the other typesetting machines to do we have 3 cubs the dean of the trio is a school youth of 18 yesterday morning he had been an apprentice on the machine 16 working days 8hour days and we speeded him to see what he could do in an hour in the hour he set 5900 ems solid nonpareil and the machine perfectly spaced and justified it and of course distributed the like amount in the same hour considering that a good fair compositor sets 700 and distributes 700 in the one hour this boy did the work of about 8 x a compositors in that hour this fact sends all other typesetting machines a thousand miles to the rear and the best of them will never be heard of again after we publicly exhibit in new york  we shall put on 3 more cubs we have one school boy and two compositors nowand we think of putting on a type writer a stenographer and perhaps a shoemaker to show that no special gifts or training are required with this machine we shall train these beginners two or three monthsor until some one of them gets up to 7000 an hourthen we will show up in new york and run the machine 24 hours a day 7 days in the week for several monthsto prove that this is a machine which will never get out of order or cause delay and can stand anything an anvil can stand you know there is no other typesetting machine that can run two hours on a stretch without causing trouble and delay with its incurable caprices  we own the whole fieldevery inch of itand nothing can dislodge us  now then above is my preachment and here follows the reason and purpose of it i want you to run over here roost over the machine a week and satisfy yourself and then go to john p jones or to whom you please and sell me a hundred thousand dollars worth of this property and take ten per cent in cash or the property for your troublethe latter if you are wise because the price i ask is a long way short of the value  what i call property is this a small part of my ownership consists of a royalty of 500 on every machine marketed under the american patents my sellingterms are a permanent royalty of one dollar on every americanmarketed machine for a thousand dollars cash to me in hand paid we shant market any fewer than 5000 machines in 15 yearsa return of fifteen thousand dollars for one thousand a royalty is better than stock in one wayit must be paid every six months rain or shine it is a debt and must be paid before dividends are declared by and by when we become a stock company i shall buy these royalties back for stock if i can get them for anything like reasonable terms  i have never borrowed a penny to use on the machine and never sold a pennys worth of the property until the machine was entirely finished and proven by the severest tests to be what she started out to beperfect permanent and occupying the position as regards all kindred machines which the city of paris occupies as regards the canvasbacks of the mercantile marine  it is my purpose to sell two hundred dollars of my royalties at the above price during the next two months and keep the other 300  mrs clemens begs mrs goodman to come with you and asks pardon for not writing the message herselfwhich would be a patheticallywelcome spectacle to me for i have been her amanuensis for 8 months now since her eyes failed her yours as always                                          mark        while this letter with its amazing contents is on its way to      astonish joe goodman we will consider one of quite a different      but equally characteristic sort  we may assume that mark twains      sister pamela had been visiting him in hartford and was now making      a visit in keokuk     to mrs moffett in keokuk                                               hartford oct 9 89  dear pamelaan hour after you left i was suddenly struck with a realizing sense of the utter chuckleheadedness of that notion of mine to send your trunk after you land it was idiotic none but a lunatic would separate himself from his baggage  well i am soulfully glad the baggage fetcher saved me from consummating my insane inspiration i met him on the street in the afternoon and paid him again i shall pay him several times more as opportunity offers  i declined the invitation to banquet with the visiting south american congress in a polite note explaining that i had to go to new york today i conveyed the note privately to patrick he got the envelope soiled and asked livy to put on a clean one that is why i am going to the banquet also why i have disinvited the boys i thought i was going to punch billiards with upstairs tonight  patrick is one of the injudiciousest people i ever struck and i am the other                           your brother                                              sam        the yankee was now ready for publication and advance sheets were      already in the reviewers hands  just at this moment the brazilian      monarchy crumbled and clemens was moved to write sylvester baxter      of the boston herald a letter which is of special interest in its      prophecy of the new day the dawn of which was even nearer than he      suspected   dear mr baxter another throne has gone down and i swim in oceans of satisfaction i wish i might live fifty years longer i believe i should see the thrones of europe selling at auction for old iron i believe i should really see the end of what is surely the grotesquest of all the swindles ever invented by manmonarchy it is enough to make a graven image laugh to see apparently rational people away down here in this wholesome and merciless slaughterday for shams still mouthing empty reverence for those mossbacked frauds and scoundrelisms hereditary kingship and socalled nobility it is enough to make the monarchs and nobles themselves laughand in private they do there can be no question about that i think there is only one funnier thing and that is the spectacle of these bastard americansthese hamersleys and huntingtons and suchoffering cash encumbered by themselves for rotten carcases and stolen titles when our great brethren the disenslaved brazilians frame their declaration of independence i hope they will insert this missing link we hold these truths to be selfevident that all monarchs are usurpers and descendants of usurpers for the reason that no throne was ever set up in this world by the will freely exercised of the only body possessing the legitimate right to set it upthe numerical mass of the nation  you already have the advance sheets of my forthcoming book in your hands if you will turn to about the five hundredth page you will find a state paper of my connecticut yankee in which he announces the dissolution of king arthurs monarchy and proclaims the english republic compare it with the state paper which announces the downfall of the brazilian monarchy and proclaims the republic of the united states of brazil and stand by to defend the yankee from plagiarism there is merely a resemblance of ideas nothing more the yankees proclamation was already in print a week ago this is merely one of those odd coincidences which are always turning up come protect the yank from that cheapest and easiest of all chargesplagiarism otherwise you see he will have to protect himself by charging approximate and indefinite plagiarism upon the official servants of our majestic twin down yonder and then there might be war or some similar annoyance  have you noticed the rumor that the portuguese throne is unsteady and that the portuguese slaves are getting restive also that the head slavedriver of europe alexander iii has so reduced his usual monthly order for chains that the russian foundries are running on only half time now also that other rumor that english nobility acquired an added stench the other dayand had to ship it to india and the continent because there wasnt any more room for it at home things are working by and by there is going to be an emigration may be of course we shall make no preparation we never do in a few years from now we shall have nothing but playedout kings and dukes on the police and driving the horsecars and whitewashing fences and in fact overcrowding all the avenues of unskilled labor and then we shall wish when it is too late that we had taken common and reasonable precautions and drowned them at castle garden        there followed at this time a number of letters to goodman but as      there is much of a sameness in them we need not print them all      clemens in fact kept the mails warm with letters bulging with      schemes for capitalization and promising vast wealth to all      concerned  when the letters did not go fast enough he sent      telegrams  in one of the letters goodman is promised five hundred      thousand dollars out of the profits before we get anything      ourselves  one thing we gather from these letters is that paige      has taken the machine apart again never satisfied with its      perfection or perhaps getting a hint that certain of its      perfections were not permanent  a letter at the end of november      seems worth preserving here     to joseph t goodman in california                                               hartford nov 29 89  dear joe things are getting into better and more flexible shape every day papers are now being drawn which will greatly simplify the raising of capital i shall be in supreme command it will not be necessary for the capitalist to arrive at terms with anybody but me i dont want to dicker with anybody but jones i know him that is to say i want to dicker with you and through you with jones try to see if you cant be here by the 15th of january  the machine was as perfect as a watch when we took her apart the other day but when she goes together again the 15th of january we expect her to be perfecter than a watch  joe i want you to sell some royalties to the boys out there if you can for i want to be financially strong when we go to new york you know the machine and you appreciate its future enormous career better than any man i know at the lowest conceivable estimate 2000 machines a year we shall sell 34000 in the life of the patent17 years  all the family send love to youand they mean it or they wouldnt say it                                yours ever                                         mark        the yankee had come from the press and howells had praised it in      the editors study in harpers magazine  he had given it his      highest commendation and it seems that his opinion of it did not      change with time  of all fanciful schemes of fiction it pleases me      most he in one place declared and again referred to it as      a greatly imagined and symmetrically developed tale       in more than one letter to goodman clemens had urged him to come      east without delay  take the train joe and come along he wrote      early in december  and we judge from the following that joe had      decided to come     to w d howells in boston                                               hartford dec 23 89  dear howellsthe magazine came last night and the study notice is just great the satisfaction it affords us could not be more prodigious if the book deserved every word of it and maybe it does i hope it does though of course i cant realize it and believe it but i am your grateful servant anyway and always  i am going to read to the cadets at west point jan 11 i go from here to new york the 9th and up to the point the 11th cant you go with me its great fun im going to read the passages in the yankee in which the yankees west point cadets figureand shall covertly work in a lecture on aristocracy to those boys i am to be the guest of the superintendent but if you will go i will shake him and we will go to the hotel he is a splendid fellow and i know him well enough to take that liberty  and wont you give me a day or twos visit toward the end of january for two reasons the machine will be at work again by that time and we want to hear the rest of the dreamstory mrs clemens keeps speaking about it and hankering for it and we can have joe goodman on hand again by that time and i want you to get to know him thoroughly its well worth it i am going to run up and stay over night with you as soon as i can get a chance  we are in the full rush of the holidays now and an awful rush it is too you ought to have been here the other day to make that day perfect and complete all alone i managed to inflict agonies on mrs clemens whereas i was expecting nothing but praises i made a party call the day after the partyand called the lady down from breakfast to receive it i then left there and called on a new bride who received me in her dressinggown and as things went pretty well i stayed to luncheon the error here was that the appointed receptionhour was 3 in the afternoon and not at the brides house but at her aunts in another part of the town however as i meant well none of these disasters distressed me                           yrs ever                                    mark        the yankee did not find a very hearty welcome in england  english      readers did not fancy any burlesque of their arthurian tales or      american strictures on their institutions  mark twains publishers      had feared this and asked that the story be especially edited for      the english edition  clemens however would not listen to any      suggestions of the sort     to messrs chatto  windus in london eng  gentlemenconcerning the yankee i have already revised the story twice and it has been read critically by w d howells and edmund clarence stedman and my wife has caused me to strike out several passages that have been brought to her attention and to soften others furthermore i have read chapters of the book in public where englishmen were present and have profited by their suggestions  now mind you i have taken all this pains because i wanted to say a yankee mechanics say against monarchy and its several natural props and yet make a book which you would be willing to print exactly as it comes to you without altering a word  we are spoken of by englishmen as a thinskinned people it is you who are thinskinned an englishman may write with the most brutal frankness about any man or institution among us and we republish him without dreaming of altering a line or a word but england cannot stand that kind of a book written about herself it is england that is thinskinned it causeth me to smile when i read the modifications of my language which have been made in my english editions to fit them for the sensitive english palate  now as i say i have taken laborious pains to so trim this book of offense that you might not lack the nerve to print it just as it stands i am going to get the proofs to you just as early as i can i want you to read it carefully if you can publish it without altering a single word go ahead otherwise please hand it to j r osgood in time for him to have it published at my expense  this is important for the reason that the book was not written for america it was written for england so many englishmen have done their sincerest best to teach us something for our betterment that it seems to me high time that some of us should substantially recognize the good intent by trying to pry up the english nation to a little higher level of manhood in turn                      very truly yours                               s l clemens   the english nation at least a considerable portion of it did not wish to be pried up to a higher level of manhood by a connecticut yankee the papers pretty generally denounced the book as coarse in fact a vulgar travesty some of the critics concluded that england after all had made a mistake in admiring mark twain clemens stood this for a time and then seems to have decided that something should be done one of the foremost of english critics was his friend and admirer he would state the case to him fully and invite his assistance     to andrew lang in london  first page missing                                                              1889  they vote but do not print the head tells you pretty promptly whether the food is satisfactory or not and everybody hears and thinks the whole man has spoken it is a delusion only his taste and his smell have been heard fromimportant both in a way but these do not build up the man and preserve his life and fortify it  the little child is permitted to label its drawings this is a cow this is a horse and so on this protects the child it saves it from the sorrow and wrong of hearing its cows and its horses criticized as kangaroos and work benches a man who is whitewashing a fence is doing a useful thing so also is the man who is adorning a rich mans house with costly frescoes and all of us are sane enough to judge these performances by standards proper to each now then to be fair an author ought to be allowed to put upon his book an explanatory line this is written for the head this is written for the belly and the members and the critic ought to hold himself in honor bound to put away from him his ancient habit of judging all books by one standard and thenceforth follow a fairer course  the critic assumes every time that if a book doesnt meet the cultivatedclass standard it isnt valuable let us apply his law all around for if it is sound in the case of novels narratives pictures and such things it is certainly sound and applicable to all the steps which lead up to culture and make culture possible it condemns the spelling book for a spelling book is of no use to a person of culture it condemns all school books and all schools which lie between the childs primer and greek and between the infant school and the university it condemns all the rounds of art which lie between the cheap terra cotta groups and the venus de medici and between the chromo and the transfiguration it requires whitcomb riley to sing no more till he can sing like shakespeare and it forbids all amateur music and will grant its sanction to nothing below the classic  is this an extravagant statement no it is a mere statement of fact it is the fact itself that is extravagant and grotesque and what is the result thisand it is sufficiently curious the critic has actually imposed upon the world the superstition that a painting by raphael is more valuable to the civilizations of the earth than is a chromo and the august opera than the hurdygurdy and the villagers singing society and homer than the little everybodyspoet whose rhymes are in all mouths today and will be in nobodys mouth next generation and the latin classics than kiplings farreaching buglenote and jonathan edwards than the salvation army and the venus de medici than the plastercast peddler the superstition in a word that the vast and awful comet that trails its cold lustre through the remote abysses of space once a century and interests and instructs a cultivated handful of astronomers is worth more to the world than the sun which warms and cheers all the nations every day and makes the crops to grow  if a critic should start a religion it would not have any object but to convert angels and they wouldnt need it the thin top crust of humanitythe cultivatedare worth pacifying worth pleasing worth coddling worth nourishing and preserving with dainties and delicacies it is true but to be caterer to that little faction is no very dignified or valuable occupation it seems to me it is merely feeding the overfed and there must be small satisfaction in that it is not that little minority who are already saved that are best worth trying to uplift i should think but the mighty mass of the uncultivated who are underneath that mass will never see the old mastersthat sight is for the few but the chromo maker can lift them all one step upward toward appreciation of art they cannot have the opera but the hurdygurdy and the singing class lift them a little way toward that far light they will never know homer but the passing rhymester of their day leaves them higher than he found them they may never even hear of the latin classics but they will strike step with kiplings drumbeat and they will march for all jonathan edwardss help they would die in their slums but the salvation army will beguile some of them up to pure air and a cleaner life they know no sculpture the venus is not even a name to them but they are a grade higher in the scale of civilization by the ministrations of the plastercast than they were before it took its place upon then mantel and made it beautiful to their unexacting eyes  indeed i have been misjudged from the very first i have never tried in even one single instance to help cultivate the cultivated classes i was not equipped for it either by native gifts or training and i never had any ambition in that direction but always hunted for bigger gamethe masses i have seldom deliberately tried to instruct them but have done my best to entertain them to simply amuse them would have satisfied my dearest ambition at any time for they could get instruction elsewhere and i had two chances to help to the teachers one for amusement is a good preparation for study and a good healer of fatigue after it my audience is dumb it has no voice in print and so i cannot know whether i have won its approbation or only got its censure  yes you see i have always catered for the belly and the members but have been served like the otherscriticized from the culturestandardto my sorrow and pain because honestly i never cared what became of the cultured classes they could go to the theatre and the operathey had no use for me and the melodeon  and now at last i arrive at my object and tender my petition making supplication to this effect that the critics adopt a rule recognizing the belly and the members and formulate a standard whereby work done for them shall be judged help me mr lang no voice can reach further than yours in a case of this kind or carry greater weight of authority        langs reply was an article in the illustrated london news on the      art of mark twain  lang had no admiration to express for the      yankee which he confessed he had not cared to read but he      glorified huck finn to the highest  i can never forget nor be      ungrateful for the exquisite pleasure with which i read huckleberry      finn for the first time years ago he wrote i read it again last      night deserting kenilworth for huck  i never laid it down till i      had finished it       lang closed his article by referring to the story of huck as the      great american novel which had escaped the eyes of those who      watched to see this new planet swim into their ken     xxx letters 1890 chiefly to jos t goodman the great machine enterprise       dr john browns son whom mark twain and his wife had known in 1873      as jock sent copies of dr john brown and his sister isabella by      e  t  mclaren  it was a gift appreciated in the clemens home     to mr john brown in edinburgh scotland                                               hartford feby 11 1890  dear mr brownboth copies came and we are reading and rereading the one and lending the other to old time adorers of rab and his friends it is an exquisite book the perfection of literary workmanship it says in every line dont look at me look at himand one tries to be good and obey but the charm of the painter is so strong that one cant keep his entire attention on the developing portrait but must steal sideglimpses of the artist and try to divine the trick of her felicitous brush in this book the doctor lives and moves just as he was he was the most extensive slaveholder of his time and the kindest and yet he died without setting one of his bondmen free we all send our very very kindest regards                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        if mark twain had been less interested in the typesetting machine      he might possibly have found a profit that winter in the old sellers      play which he had written with howells seven years before  the      play had eventually been produced at the lyceum theatre in new york      with a p burbank in the leading role and clemens and howells as      financial backers  but it was a losing investment nor did it pay      any better when clemens finally sent burbank with it on the road      now however james a  herne a wellknown actor and playwright      became interested in the idea after a discussion of the matter with      howells and there seemed a probability that with changes made under      hernes advisement the play might be made sensible and successful       but mark twains greater interest was now all in the typemachine      and certainly he had no money to put into any other venture  his      next letter to goodman is illuminatingthe urgency of his need for      funds opposed to that conscientiousness which was one of the most      positive forces of mark twains body spiritual  the mr arnot of      this letter was an elmira capitalist     to jos t goodman in california                                               hartford march 31 90  dear joeif you were here i should say get you to washington and beg senator jones to take the chances and put up about ten or no i wouldnt the money would burn a hole in my pocket and get away from me if the furnisher of it were proceeding upon merely your judgment and mine and without other evidence it is too much of a responsibility  but i am in as close a place today as ever i was 3000 due for the last months machineexpenses and the purse empty i notified mr arnot a month ago that i should want 5000 today and his check arrived last night but i sent it back to him because when he bought of me on the 9th of december i said that i would not draw upon him for 3 months and that before that date senator jones would have examined the machine and approved or done the other thing if jones should arrive here a week or ten days from now as he expects to do and should not approve and shouldnt buy any royalties my deal with arnot would not be symmetrically square and then how could i refund the surest way was to return his check  i have talked with the madam and here is the result i will go down to the factory and notify paige that i will scrape together 6000 to meet the march and april expenses and will retire on the 30th of april and return the assignment to him if in the meantime i have not found financial relief  it is very rough for the machine does at last seem perfect and just a bird to go i think shes going to be good for 8000 ems an hour in the hands of a good ordinary man after a solid years practice i may be in error but i most solidly believe it  theres an improved mergenthaler in new york paige and davis and i watched it two whole afternoons                           with the love of us all                                                   mark        arnot wrote clemens urging him to accept the check for five thousand      dollars in this moment of need  clemens was probably as sorely      tempted to compromise with his conscience as he had ever been in his      life but his resolution field firm     to m h arnot in elmira n y  mr m h arnot  dear sirnono i could not think of taking it with you unsatisfied and you ought not to be satisfied until you have made personal examination of the machine and had a consensus of testimony of disinterested people besides my own perfect knowledge of what is required of such a machine and my perfect knowledge of the fact that this is the only machine that can meet that requirement make it difficult for me to realize that a doubt is possible to less wellposted men and so i would have taken your money without thinking and thus would have done a great wrong to you and a great one to myself and now that i go back over the ground i remember that where i said i could get along 3 months without drawing on you that delay contemplated a visit from you to the machine in the interval and your satisfaction with its character and prospects i had forgotten all that but i remember it now and the fact that it was not so nominated in the bond does not alter the case or justify me in making my call so prematurely i do not know that you regarded all that as a part of the bargainfor you were thoroughly and magnanimously unexactingbut i so regarded it notwithstanding i have so easily managed to forget all about it  you so gratified me and did me so much honor in bonding yourself to me in a large sum upon no evidence but my word and with no protection but my honor that my pride in that is much stronger than my desire to reap a money advantage from it  with the sincerest appreciation i am truly yours                                               s l clemens  p s i have written a good many words and yet i seem to have failed to say the main thing in exact enough languagewhich is that the transaction between us is not complete and binding until you shall have convinced yourself that the machines character and prospects are satisfactory  i ought to explain that the grippe delayed us some weeks and that we have since been waiting for mr jones when he was ready we were not and now we have been ready more than a month while he has been kept in washington by the silver bill he said the other day that to venture out of the capitol for a day at this time could easily chance to hurt him if the bill came up for action meantime although it couldnt hurt the bill which would pass anyway mrs jones said she would send me two or three days notice right after the passage of the bill and that they would follow as soon as i should return word that their coming would not inconvenience us i suppose i ought to go to new york without waiting for mr jones but it would not be wise to go there without money  the bill is still pending        the mergenthaler machine like the paige was also at this time in      the middle stages of experimental development  it was a slower      machine but it was simpler less expensive occupied less room      there was not so much about it to get out of order it was not so      delicate not so human  these were immense advantages       but no one at this time could say with certainty which typesetter      would reap the harvest of millions  it was only sure that at least      one of them would and the mergenthaler people were willing to trade      stock for stock with the paige company in order to insure financial      success for both whichever won  clemens with a faith that never      faltered declined this offer a decision that was to cost him      millions       winter and spring had gone and summer had come but still there had      been no financial conclusion with jones mackay and the other rich      californians who were to put up the necessary million for the      machines manufacture  goodman was spending a large part of his      time traveling back and forth between california and washington      trying to keep business going at both ends  paige spent most of his      time working out improvements for the typesetter delicate      attachments which complicated its construction more and more     to joe t goodman in washington                                               hartford june 22 90  dear joei have been sitting by the machine 2 hours this afternoon and my admiration of it towers higher than ever there is no sort of mistake about it it is the big bonanza in the 2 hours the time lost by typebreakage was 3 minutes  this machine is totally without a rival rivalry with it is impossible last friday fred whitmore it was the 28th day of his apprenticeship on the machine stacked up 49700 ems of solid nonpareil in 8 hours and the typebreaking delay was only 6 minutes for the day  i claim yet as i have always claimed that the machines market abroad and here together is today worth 150000000 without saying anything about the doubling and trebling of this sum that will follow within the life of the patents now here is a queer fact i am one of the wealthiest grandees in americaone of the vanderbilt gang in factand yet if you asked me to lend you a couple of dollars i should have to ask you to take my note instead  it makes me cheerful to sit by the machine come up with mrs goodman and refresh yourself with a draught of the same                                          ys ever                                                   mark        the machine was still breaking the types now and then and no doubt      paige was itching to take it to pieces and only restrained by force      from doing so  he was never thoroughly happy unless he was taking      the machine apart or setting it up again  finally he was allowed      to go at ita disasterous permission for it was just then that      jones decided to steal a day or two from the silver bill and watch      the typesetter in operation  paige already had it in parts when      this word came from goodman and joness visit had to be called off      his enthusiasm would seem to have weakened from that day  in july      goodman wrote that both mackay and jones had become somewhat      diffident in the matter of huge capitalization  he thought it      partly due at least to the fatal delays that have sicklied over      the bloom of original enthusiasm  clemens himself went down to      washington and perhaps warmed jones with his eloquence at least      jones seemed to have agreed to make some effort in the matter a      qualified promise the careful word of a wary politician and      capitalist  how many washington trips were made is not certain but      certainly more than one  jones would seem to have suggested forms      of contracts but if he came to the point of signing any there is no      evidence of it today       any one who has read mark twains a connecticut yankee in king      arthurs court has a pretty good idea of his opinion of kings in      general and tyrants in particular  rule by divine right however      liberal was distasteful to him where it meant oppression it      stirred him to violence  in his article the czars soliloquy he      gave himself loose rein concerning atrocities charged to the master      of russia and in a letter which he wrote during the summer of 1890      he offered a hint as to remedies  the letter was written by      editorial request but was never mailed  perhaps it seemed too      openly revolutionary at the moment       yet scarcely more than a quarter of a century was needed to make it      timely  clemens and his family were spending some weeks in the      catskills when it was written     an unpublished letter on the czar                                                    onteora 1890  to the editor of free russiai thank you for the compliment of your invitation to say something but when i ponder the bottom paragraph on your first page and then study your statement on your third page of the objects of the several russian liberationparties i do not quite know how to proceed let me quote here the paragraph referred to  but mens hearts are so made that the sight of one voluntary victim for a noble idea stirs them more deeply than the sight of a crowd submitting to a dire fate they cannot escape besides foreigners could not see so clearly as the russians how much the government was responsible for the grinding poverty of the masses nor could they very well realize the moral wretchedness imposed by that government upon the whole of educated russia but the atrocities committed upon the defenceless prisoners are there in all their baseness concrete and palpable admitting of no excuse no doubt or hesitation crying out to the heart of humanity against russian tyranny and the tzars government stupidly confident in its apparently unassailable position instead of taking warning from the first rebukes seems to mock this humanitarian age by the aggravation of brutalities not satisfied with slowly killing its prisoners and with burying the flower of our young generation in the siberian desserts the government of alexander iii resolved to break their spirit by deliberately submitting them to a regime of unheardof brutality and degradation  when one reads that paragraph in the glare of george kennans revelations and considers how much it means considers that all earthly figures fail to typify the czars government and that one must descend into hell to find its counterpart one turns hopefully to your statement of the objects of the several liberationpartiesand is disappointed apparently none of them can bear to think of losing the present hell entirely they merely want the temperature cooled down a little  i now perceive why all men are the deadly and uncompromising enemies of the rattlesnake it is merely because the rattlesnake has not speech monarchy has speech and by it has been able to persuade men that it differs somehow from the rattlesnake has something valuable about it somewhere something worth preserving something even good and high and fine when properly modified something entitling it to protection from the club of the first comer who catches it out of its hole it seems a most strange delusion and not reconcilable with our superstition that man is a reasoning being if a house is afire we reason confidently that it is the first comers plain duty to put the fire out in any way he candrown it with water blow it up with dynamite use any and all means to stop the spread of the fire and save the rest of the city what is the czar of russia but a house afire in the midst of a city of eighty millions of inhabitants yet instead of extinguishing him together with his nest and system the liberationparties are all anxious to merely cool him down a little and keep him  it seems to me that this is illogicalidiotic in fact suppose you had this granitehearted bloodyjawed maniac of russia loose in your house chasing the helpless women and little childrenyour own what would you do with him supposing you had a shotgun well he is loose in your houserussia and with your shotgun in your hand you stand trying to think up ways to modify him  do these liberationparties think that they can succeed in a project which has been attempted a million times in the history of the world and has never in one single instance been successfulthe modification of a despotism by other means than bloodshed they seem to think they can my privilege to write these sanguinary sentences in soft security was bought for me by rivers of blood poured upon many fields in many lands but i possess not one single little paltry right or privilege that come to me as a result of petition persuasion agitation for reform or any kindred method of procedure when we consider that not even the most responsible english monarch ever yielded back a stolen public right until it was wrenched from them by bloody violence is it rational to suppose that gentler methods can win privileges in russia  of course i know that the properest way to demolish the russian throne would be by revolution but it is not possible to get up a revolution there so the only thing left to do apparently is to keep the throne vacant by dynamite until a day when candidates shall decline with thanks then organize the republic and on the whole this method has some large advantages for whereas a revolution destroys some lives which cannot well be spared the dynamite way doesnt consider this the conspirators against the czars life are caught in every rank of life from the low to the high and consider if so many take an active part where the peril is so dire is this not evidence that the sympathizers who keep still and do not show their hands are countless for multitudes can you break the hearts of thousands of families with the awful siberian exodus every year for generations and not eventually cover all russia from limit to limit with bereaved fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters who secretly hate the perpetrator of this prodigious crime and hunger and thirst for his life do you not believe that if your wife or your child or your father was exiled to the mines of siberia for some trivial utterances wrung from a smarting spirit by the czars intolerable tyranny and you got a chance to kill him and did not do it that you would always be ashamed to be in your own society the rest of your life suppose that that refined and lovely russian lady who was lately stripped bare before a brutal soldiery and whipped to death by the czars hand in the person of the czars creature had been your wife or your daughter or your sister and today the czar should pass within reach of your hand how would you feeland what would you do consider that all over vast russia from boundary to boundary a myriad of eyes filled with tears when that piteous news came and through those tears that myriad of eyes saw not that poor lady but lost darlings of their own whose fate her fate brought back with new access of grief out of a black and bitter past never to be forgotten or forgiven  if i am a swinburnianand clear to the marrow i ami hold human nature in sufficient honor to believe there are eighty million mute russians that are of the same stripe and only one russian family that isnt                                               mark twain        typesetter matters were going badly  clemens still had faith in      jones and he had lost no grain of faith in the machine  the money      situation however was troublesome  with an expensive      establishment and work of one sort or another still to be done on      the machine his income would not reach  perhaps goodman had      already given up hope for he does not seem to have returned from      california after the next letter was writtena colorless letter      in which we feel a note of resignation  the last few lines are      sufficient     to joe t goodman in california  dear joe i wish you could get a day off and make those two or three californians buy those privileges for im going to need money before long  i dont know where the senator is but out on the coast i reckon  i guess weve got a perfect machine at last we never break a type now and the new device for enabling the operator to touch the last letters and justify the line simultaneously works to a charm                           with love to you both                                                   mark        the year closed gloomily enough  the typesetter seemed to be      perfected but capital for its manufacture was not forthcoming      the publishing business of charles l webster  co was returning      little or no profit  clemenss mother had died in keokuk

clemens was still not without hope in the machine at the      beginning of the new year 1891 but it was a hope no longer      active and it presently became a moribund  jones on about      the middle of february backed out altogether laying the      blame chiefly on mackay and the others who he said had      decided not to invest  jones let his victim down easy      with friendly words but it was the end for the present at      least of machine financiering       it was also the end of mark twains capital  his publishing      business was not good  it was already in debt and needing      more money  there was just one thing for him to do and he      did it at once not stopping to cry over spilt milk but      with good courage and the old enthusiasm that never failed      him he returned to the trade of authorship  he dug out      halffinished articles and stories finished them and sold      them and within a week after the jones collapse he was at      work on a novel based an the old sellers idea which eight      years before he and howells had worked into a play  the      brief letter in which he reported this news to howells bears      no marks of depression though the writer of

ago and this moment finished chapter four title of the book                         colonel mulberry sellers                            american claimant                                  of the

                            mark   probably mark twain did not return to literary work reluctantly he had always enjoyed writing and felt now that he was equipped better than ever for authorship at least so far as material was concerned there exists a fragmentary copy of a letter to some unknown correspondent in which he recites his qualifications it bears evidence of having been written just at this time and is of unusual interest at this point      fragment of letter to  1891   i confine myself to life with which i am familiar when pretending to portray life but i confined myself to the boylife out on the mississippi because that had a peculiar charm for me and not because i was not familiar with other phases of life i was a soldier two weeks once in the beginning of the war and was hunted like a rat the whole time familiar my splendid kipling himself hasnt a more burntin hardbaked and unforgetable familiarity with that deathonthepalehorsewithhellfollowingafter which is a raw soldiers first fortnight in the fieldand which without any doubt is the most tremendous fortnight and the vividest he is ever going to see  yes and i have shoveled silver tailings in a quartzmill a couple of weeks and acquired the last possibilities of culture in that direction and ive done pocketmining during three months in the one little patch of ground in the whole globe where nature conceals gold in pocketsor did before we robbed all of those pockets and exhausted obliterated annihilated the most curious freak nature ever indulged in there are not thirty men left alive who being told there was a pocket hidden on the broad slope of a mountain would know how to go and find it or have even the faintest idea of how to set about it but i am one of the possible 20 or 30 who possess the secret and i could go and put my hand on that hidden treasure with a most deadly precision  and ive been a prospector and know pay rock from poor when i find itjust with a touch of the tongue and ive been a silver miner and know how to dig and shovel and drill and put in a blast and so i know the mines and the miners interiorly as well as bret harte knows them exteriorly  and i was a newspaper reporter four years in cities and so saw the inside of many things and was reporter in a legislature two sessions and the same in congress one session and thus learned to know personally three sample bodies of the smallest minds and the selfishest souls and the cowardliest hearts that god makes  and i was some years a mississippi pilot and familiarly knew all the different kinds of steamboatmena race apart and not like other folk  and i was for some years a traveling jour printer and wandered from city to cityand so i know that sect familiarly  and i was a lecturer on the public platform a number of seasons and was a responder to toasts at all the different kinds of banquetsand so i know a great many secrets about audiencessecrets not to be got out of books but only acquirable by experience  and i watched over one dear project of mine for years spent a fortune on it and failed to make it goand the history of that would make a large book in which a million men would see themselves as in a mirror and they would testify and say verily this is not imagination this fellow has been thereand after would cast dust upon their heads cursing and blaspheming  and i am a publisher and did pay to one authors widow general grants the largest copyright checks this world has seenaggregating more than l80000 in the first year  and i have been an author for 20 years and an ass for 55  now then as the most valuable capital or culture or education usable in the building of novels is personal experience i ought to be well equipped for that trade  i surely have the equipment a wide culture and all of it real none of it artificial for i dont know anything about books                               no signature        clemens for several years had been bothered by rheumatism in his      shoulder  the return now to the steady use of the pen aggravated      his trouble and at times he was nearly disabled  the phonograph      for commercial dictation had been tried experimentally and mark      twain was always ready for any innovation     to w d howells in boston                                          hartford feb  28 91  dear howellswont you dropin at the boylston building new england phonograph co and talk into a phonograph in an ordinary conversationvoice and see if another person who didnt hear you do it can take the words from the thing without difficulty and repeat them to you if the experiment is satisfactory also make somebody put in a message which you dont hear and see if afterward you can get it out without difficulty wont you then ask them on what terms they will rent me a phonograph for 3 months and furnish me cylinders enough to carry 75000 words 175 cylinders aint it  i dont want to erase any of them my right arm is nearly disabled by rheumatism but i am bound to write this book and sell 100000 copies of itno i mean a millionnext fall i feel sure i can dictate the book into a phonograph if i dont have to yell i write 2000 words a day i think i can dictate twice as many  but mind if this is going to be too much trouble to yougo ahead and do it all the same                                     ys ever                                              mark        howells always willing to help visited the phonograph place and a      few days later reported results  he wrote i talked your letter      into a fonograf in my usual tone at my usual gait of speech  then      the fonograf man talked his answer in at his wonted swing and swell      then we took the cylinder to a typewriter in the next room and she      put the hooks into her ears and wrote the whole out  i send you the      result  there is a mistake of one word  i think that if you have      the cheek to dictate the story into the fonograf all the rest is      perfectly easy  it wouldnt fatigue me to talk for an hour as i      did       clemens did not find the phonograph entirely satisfactory at least      not for a time and he appears never to have used it steadily  his      early experience with it however seems interesting     to w d howells in boston                                          hartford apl 4 91  dear howellsim ashamed it happened in this way i was proposing to acknowledge the receipt of the play and the little book per phonograph so that you could see that the instrument is good enough for mere letterwriting then i meant to add the fact that you cant write literature with it because it hasnt any ideas and it hasnt any gift for elaboration or smartness of talk or vigor of action or felicity of expression but is just matteroffact compressive unornamental and as grave and unsmiling as the devil  i filled four dozen cylinders in two sittings then found i could have said about as much with the pen and said it a deal better then i resigned  i believe it could teach one to dictate literature to a phonographerand some time i will experiment in that line  the little book is charmingly written and it interested me but it flies too high for me its concretest things are filmy abstractions to me and when i lay my grip on one of them and open my hand i feel as embarrassed as i use to feel when i thought i had caught a fly im going to try to mail it back to you todayi mean i am going to charge my memory charging my memory is one of my chief industries  with our loves and our kindest regards distributed among you according to the proprieties                                yrs ever                                         mark  p sim sending that ancient mental telegraphy article to harperswith a modest postscript probably read it to you years ago                                          s l c        the little book mentioned in this letter was by swedenborg an      author in whom the boston literary set was always deeply interested      mental telegraphy appeared in harpers magazine and is now      included in the uniform edition of mark twains books  it was      written in 1878       joe goodman had long since returned to california it being clear      that nothing could be gained by remaining in washington  on receipt      of the news of the typesetters collapse he sent a consoling word      perhaps he thought clemens would rage over the unhappy circumstance      and possibly hold him in some measure to blame  but it was      generally the smaller annoyances of life that made mark twain rage      the larger catastrophes were likely to stir only his philosophy       the library of american literature mentioned in the following      letter was a work in many volumes edited by edmund clarence      stedman and ellen mackay hutchinson     to joe t goodman                                                    april  1891  dear joe well its all right anyway diplomacy couldnt have saved itdiplomacy of mineat that late day i hadnt any diplomacy in stock anyway in order to meet joness requirements i had to surrender the old contract a contract which made me boss of the situation and gave me the whiphand of paige and allow the new one to be drafted and put in its place i was running an immense risk but it was justified by joness promisespromises made to me not merely once but every time i tallied with him when february arrived i saw signs which were mighty plain reading signs which meant that paige was hoping and praying that jones would go back on mewhich would leave paige boss and me robbed and out in the cold his prayers were answered and i am out in the cold if i ever get back my ninetwentieths interest it will be by lawsuitwhich will be instituted in the indefinite future when the time comes  i am at work againon a book not with a great deal of spirit but with enoughyes plenty and i am pushing my publishing house it has turned the corner after cleaning 50000 a year for three consecutive years and piling every cent of it into one booklibrary of american literatureand from next january onward it will resume dividends but ive got to earn 50000 for it between now and thenwhich i will do if i keep my health this additional capital is needed for that same book because its prosperity is growing so great and exacting  it is dreadful to think of you in ill healthi cant realize it you are always to me the same that you were in those days when matchless health and glowing spirits and delight in life were commonplaces with us lord save us all from old age and broken health and a hopetree that has lost the faculty of putting out blossoms                      with love to you both from us all                                         mark        mark twains residence in hartford was drawing rapidly to a close      mrs clemens was poorly and his own health was uncertain  they      believed that some of the european baths would help them      furthermore mark twain could no longer afford the luxury of his      hartford home  in europe life could be simpler and vastly cheaper      he was offered a thousand dollars apiece for six european letters      by the mcclure syndicate and w m laffan of the sun  this would      at least give him a start on the other side  the family began      immediately their sad arrangements for departure     to fred j hall manager chas l webster  co n y                                     hartford apl 14 91  dear mr hallprivatelykeep it to yourselfas you are already aware we are going to europe in june for an indefinite stay we shall sell the horses and shut up the house we wish to provide a place for our coachman who has been with us a 21 years and is sober active diligent and unusually bright and capable you spoke of hiring a colored man as engineer and helper in the packing room patrick would soon learn that trade and be very valuable we will cease to need him by the middle or end of june have you made irrevocable arrangements with the colored man or would you prefer to have patrick if he thinks he would like to try  i have not said anything to him about it yet                                     yours                                              s l c        it was to be a complete breaking up of their beautiful      establishment  patrick mcaleer george the butler and others of      their household help had been like members of the family  we may      guess at the heartbreak of it all even though the letters remain      cheerful       howells strangely enough seems to have been about the last one to      be told of their european plans in fact he first got wind of it      from the papers and wrote for information  likely enough clemens      had not until then had the courage to confess     to w d howells in boston                                          hartford may 20 91  dear howellsfor her healths sake mrs clemens must try baths somewhere and this it is that has determined us to go to europe the water required seems to be provided at a little obscure and littlevisited nook up in the hills back of the rhine somewhere and you get to it by rhine trafficboat and country stagecoach come get sick or sorry enough and join us we shall be a little while at that bath and the rest of the summer at annecy this confidential to you in haute savoie 22 miles from geneva spend the winters in berlin i dont know how long we shall be in europei have a vote but i dont cast it im going to do whatever the others desire with leave to change their mind without prejudice whenever they want to travel has no longer any charm for me i have seen all the foreign countries i want to see except heaven and hell and i have only a vague curiosity as concerns one of those  i found i couldnt use the playi had departed too far from its lines when i came to look at it i thought i might get a great deal of dialogue out of it but i got only 15 loosely written pagesthey saved me half a days work it was the cursing phonograph there was abundance of good dialogue but it couldnt befitted into the new conditions of the story  oh look herei did today what i have several times in past years thought of doing answered an interviewing proposition from a rich newspaper with the reminder that they had not stated the terms that my time was all occupied with writing at good pay and that as talking was harder work i should not care to venture it unless i knew the pay was going to be proportionately higher i wish i had thought of this the other day when charley stoddard turned a pleasant englishman loose on me and i couldnt think of any rational excuse                                          ys ever                                                   mark        clemens had finished his sellers book and had disposed of the serial      rights to the mcclure syndicate  the house in hartford was closed      early in june and on the 6th the family with one maid katie      leary sailed on the gascogne  two weeks later they had begun a      residence abroad which was to last for more than nine years       it was not easy to get to work in europe  clemenss arm remained      lame and any effort at writing brought suffering  the century      magazine proposed another set of letters but by the end of july he      had barely begun on those promised to mcclure and laffan  in      august however he was able to send three one from aix about the      baths there another from bayreuth concerning the wagner festival      and a third from marienbad in bohemia where they rested for a      time  he decided that he would arrange for no more european letters      when the six were finished but would gather material for a book      he would take a courier and a kodak and go tramping again in some      fashion that would be interesting to do and to write       the idea finally matured when he reached switzerland and settled the      family at the hotel beau rivage ouchy lausanne facing lake leman      he decided to make a floating trip down the rhone and he engaged      joseph very a courier that had served him on a former european      trip to accompany him  the courier went over to bourget and bought      for five dollars a flatbottomed boat and engaged its owner as their      pilot  it was the morning of september 20 when they began their      floatingtrip down the beautiful historic river that flows through      the loveliest and most romantic region of france  he wrote daily to      mrs clemens and his letters tell the story of that drowsy happy      experience better than the notes made with a view to publication      clemens had arrived at lake bourget on the evening before the      morning of their start and slept on the island of chatillon in an      old castle of the same name  lake bourget connects with the rhone      by a small canal      letters and memoranda to mrs clemens in ouchy switzerland

the trees it was a wonderfully still place to sleep in beside us there was nobody in it but a woman a boy and a dog a pope was born in the room i slept in no he became a pope later  the lake is smooth as glassa brilliant sun is shining  our boat is comfortable and shady with its awning  1120 we have crossed the lake and are entering the canal shall presently be in the rhone  noon nearly down to the rhone passing the village of chanaz  315 p m sunday we have been in the rhone 3 hours it is unimaginably still and reposeful and cool and soft and breezy no rowing or work of any kind to dowe merely float with the currentwe glide noiseless and swiftas fast as a london cabhorse rips along8 miles an hourthe swiftest current ive ever boated in we have the entire river to ourselvesnowhere a boat of any kind                           good bye sweetheart                                         s l c                                           port de grolee monday 415 pm                                               sept 21 1891  name of the village which we left five minutes ago  we went ashore at 5 p m yesterday dear heart and walked a short mile to st geuix a big village and took quarters at the principal inn had a good dinner and afterwards along walk out of town on the banks of the guiers till 730  went to bed at 830 and continued to make notes and read books and newspapers till midnight slept until 8 breakfasted in bed and lay till noon because there had been a very heavy rain in the night and the day was still dark and lowering but at noon the sun broke through and in 15 minutes we were tramping toward the river got afloat at 1 p m but at 240 we had to rush suddenly ashore and take refuge in the above village just as we got ourselves and traps safely housed in the inn the rain let go and came down in great style we lost an hour and a half there but we are off again now with bright sunshine  i wrote you yesterday my darling and shall expect to write you every day  goodday and love to all of you                                          saml                                           on the rhone below villebois                                                    tuesday noon  good morning sweetheart night caught us yesterday where we had to take quarters in a peasants house which was occupied by the family and a lot of cows and calvesalso several rabbitshis word for fleasthe latter had a ball and i was the ballroom but they were very friendly and didnt bite  the peasants were mighty kind and hearty and flew around and did their best to make us comfortable this morning i breakfasted on the shore in the open air with two sociable dogs and a cat clean cloth napkin and table furniture white sugar a vast hunk of excellent butter good bread first class coffee with pure milk fried fish just caught wonderful that so much cleanliness should come out of such a phenomenally dirty house  an hour ago we saw the falls of the rhone a prodigiously rough and dangerous looking place shipped a little water but came to no harm it was one of the most beautiful pieces of piloting and boatmanagement i ever saw our admiral knew his business  we have had to run ashore for shelter every time it has rained heretofore but joseph has been putting in his odd time making a waterproof sunbonnet for the boat and now we sail along dry although we had many heavy showers this morning  with a word of love to you all and particularly you                                                         saml                                                on the rhone below vienna  i salute you my darling your telegram reached me in lyons last night and was very pleasant news indeed  i was up and shaved before 8 this morning but we got delayed and didnt sail from lyons till 1030an hour and a half lost and weve lost another hourtwo of them i guesssince by an error we came in sight of vienne at 2 oclock several miles ahead on a hill and i proposed to walk down there and let the boat go ahead of us so joseph and i got out and struck through a willow swamp along a dim path and by and by came out on the steep bank of a slough or inlet or something and we followed that bank forever and ever trying to get around the head of that slough finally i noticed a twig standing up in the water and by george it had a distinct and even vigorous quiver to it i dont know when i have felt so much like a donkey on an island i wanted to drown somebody but i hadnt anybody i could spare however after another long tramp we found a lonely native and he had a scow and soon we were on the mainlandyes and a blamed sight further from vienne than we were when we started  notesi make millions of them and so i get no time to write to you if youve got a pad there please send it posterestante to avignon i may not need it but i fear i shall  im straining to reach st pierre de boef but its going to be a close fit i reckon                                      afloat friday 3 pm 91  livy darling we sailed from st pierre de boef six hours ago and are now approaching tournon where we shall not stop but go on and make valence a city of 25000 people its too delicious floating with the swift current under the awning these superb sunshiny days in deep peace and quietness some of these curious old historical towns strangely persuade me but it is so lovely afloat that i dont stop but view them from the outside and sail on we get abundance of grapes and peaches for next to nothing  joseph is perfect he is at his very bestand never was better in his life i guess he gets discouraged and feels disliked and in the way when he is lying aroundbut here he is perfection and brim full of useful alacrities and helps and ingenuities  when i woke up an hour ago and heard the clock strike 4 i said i seem to have been asleep an immensely long time i must have gone to bed mighty early i wonder what time i did go to bed and i got up and lit a candle and looked at my watch to see                                                          afloat                                          2 hours below bourg st andeol                                          monday 11 am sept 28  livy darling i didnt write yesterday we left la voulte in a driving storm of cold raincouldnt write in itand at 1 p m when we were not thinking of stopping we saw a picturesque and mighty ruin on a high hill back of a village and i was seized with a desire to explore it so we landed at once and set out with rubbers and umbrella sending the boat ahead to st andeol and we spent 3 hours clambering about those cloudy heights among those worn and vast and idiotic ruins of a castle built by two crusaders 650 years ago the work of these asses was full of interest and we had a good time inspecting examining and scrutinizing it all the hills on both sides of the rhone have peaks and precipices and each has its gray and wasted pile of mouldy walls and broken towers the romans displaced the gauls the visigoths displaced the romans the saracens displaced the visigoths the christians displaced the saracens and it was these pious animals who built these strange lairs and cut each others throats in the name and for the glory of god and robbed and burned and slew in peace and war and the pauper and the slave built churches and the credit of it went to the bishop who racked the money out of them these are pathetic shores and they make one despise the human race  we came down in an hour by rail but i couldnt get your telegram till this morning for it was sunday and they had shut up the post office to go to the circus i went too it was all one familyparents and 5 childrenperforming in the open air to 200 of these enchanted villagers who contributed coppers when called on it was a most gay and strange and pathetic show i got up at 7 this morning to see the poor devils cook their poor breakfast and pack up their sordid fineries  this is a 9 km current and the wind is with us we shall make avignon before 4 oclock i saw watermelons and pomegranates for sale at st andeol                 with a power of love sweetheart                                                   saml

hour and i thank you and dear clam with all my heart its like hearing from home after a long absence  it is early to be in bed but im always abed before 9 on this voyage and up at 7 or a trifle later every morning if i ever take such a trip again i will have myself called at the first tinge of dawn and get to sea as soon after as possible the early dawn on the waternothing can be finer as i know by old mississippi experience i did so long for you and sue yesterday morningthe most superb sunrisethe most marvelous sunrise and i saw it all from the very faintest suspicion of the coming dawn all the way through to the final explosion of glory but it had interest private to itself and not to be found elsewhere in the world for between me and it in the far distanteastward was a silhouette mountainrange in which i had discovered the previous afternoon a most noble face upturned to the sky and mighty form out stretched which i had named napoleon dreaming of universal empireand now this prodigious face soft rich blue spirituelle asleep tranquil reposeful lay against that giant conflagration of ruddy and golden splendors all rayed like a wheel with the upstreaming and farreaching lances of the sun it made one want to cry for delight it was so supreme in its unimaginable majesty and beauty  we had a curious experience today a little after i had sealed and directed my letter to you in which i said we should make avignon before 4 we got lost we ceased to encounter any village or ruin mentioned in our particularizes and detailed guide of the rhonewent drifting along by the hour in a wholly unknown land and on an uncharted river confound it we stopped talking and did nothing but stand up in the boat and search the horizons with the glass and wonder what in the devil had happened and at last away yonder at 5 oclock when some east towers and fortresses hove in sight we couldnt recognize them for avignonyet we knew by the broken bridge that it was avignon  then we saw what the trouble wasat some time or other we had drifted down the wrong side of an island and followed a sluggish branch of the rhone not frequented in modern times we lost an hour and a half by it and missed one of the most picturesque and gigantic and historysodden masses of castellated medieval ruin that europe can show  it was dark by the time we had wandered through the town and got the letters and found the hotelso i went to bed  we shall leave here at noon tomorrow and float down to arles arriving about dark and there bid good bye to the boat the rivertrip finished between arles and nimes and avignon again we shall be till saturday morningthen rail it through on that day to ouchy reaching the hotel at 11 at night if the train isnt late  next day sunday if you like go to basel and monday to berlin but i shall be at your disposal to do exactly as you desire and prefer            with no end of love to all of you and twice as much to you                sweetheart                          saml  i believe my arm is a trifle better than it was when i started        the mention in the foregoing letter of the napoleon effigy is the      beginning of what proved to be a rather interesting episode  mark      twain thought a great deal of his discovery as he called itthe      giant figure of napoleon outlined by the distant mountain range      in his notebook he entered memoranda telling just where it was to      be seen and added a pencil sketch of the huge profile  but then he      characteristically forgot all about it and when he recalled the      incident ten years later he could not remember the name of the      village beauchastel from which the great figure could be seen      also that he had made a record of the place       but he was by this time more certain than ever that his discovery      was a remarkable one which if known would become one of the great      natural wonders such as niagara falls  theodore stanton was      visiting him at the time and clemens urged him on his return to      france to make an excursion to the rhone and locate the lost      napoleon as he now called it  but clemens remembered the wonder as      being somewhere between arles and avignon instead of about a      hundred miles above the lastnamed town  stanton naturally failed      to find it and it remained for the writer of these notes motoring      up the rhone one september day exactly twentytwo years after the      first discovery to relocate the vast reclining figure of the first      consul of france dreaming of universal empire  the rediscovery      was not difficultwith mark twains memoranda as a guideand it      was worth while  perhaps the lost napoleon is not so important a      natural wonder as mark twain believed but it is a striking picture      and on a clear day the calm blue face outlined against the sky will      long hold the travelers attention      to clara clemens in ouchy switzerland                                afloat 1120 am sept 29 tuesday  dear old benthe vast stone masses and huge towers of the ancient papal palace of avignon are projected above an intervening wooded island a mile up the river behind mefor we are already on our way to arles it is a perfectly still morning with a brilliant sun and very hotoutside but i am under cover of the linen hood and it is cool and shady in here  please tell mamma i got her very last letter this morning and i perceive by it that i do not need to arrive at ouchy before saturday midnight i am glad because i couldnt do the railroading i am proposing to do during the next two or three days and get there earlier i could put in the time till sunday midnight but shall not venture it without telegraphic instructions from her to nimes day after tomorrow oct 1 care hotel manivet  the only adventures we have is in drifting into rough seas now and then they are not dangerous but they go thro all the motions of it yesterday when we shot the bridge of the holy spirit it was probably in charge of some inexperienced deputy spirit for the day for we were allowed to go through the wrong arch which brought us into a tourbillon below which tried to make this old scow stand on its head of course i lost my temper and blew it off in a way to be heard above the roar of the tossing waters i lost it because the admiral had taken that arch in deference to my opinion that it was the best one while his own judgment told him to take the one nearest the other side of the river i could have poisoned him i was so mad to think i had hired such a turnip a boatman in command should obey nobodys orders but his own and yield to nobodys suggestions  it was very sweet of you to write me dear and i thank you ever so much with greatest love and kisses                                     papa     to mrs clemens in ouchy switzerland                                               arles sept 30 noon  livy darling i haint got no time to write today because i am sight seeing industriously and imagining my chapter  bade goodbye to the river trip and gave away the boat yesterday evening we had ten great days in her  we reached here after dark we were due about 430 counting by distance but we couldnt calculate on such a lifeless current as we found                 i love you sweetheart                                         saml        it had been a long time since clemens had written to his old friend      twichell but the rhone trip must have reminded him of those days      thirteen years earlier when comparatively young men he and      twichell were tramping through the black forest and scaling gemmi      pass  he sent twichell a reminder of that happy time     to rev joseph h twichell in hartford conn                                                    nimes oct 1 91  dear joei have been ten days floating down the rhone on a raft from lake bourget and a most curious and darling kind of a trip it has been you ought to have been alongi could have made room for you easilyand you would have found that a pedestrian tour in europe doesnt begin with a raftvoyage for hilarity and mild adventure and intimate contact with the unvisited native of the back settlements and extinction from the world and newspapers and a conscience in a state of coma and lazy comfort and solid happiness in fact theres nothing thats so lovely  but its all over i gave the raft away yesterday at arles and am loafing along back by short stages on the rail to ouchylausanne where the tribe are staying                           love to you all                                         mark        the clemenses settled in berlin for the winter at 7 kornerstrasse      and later at the hotel royal  there had been no permanent      improvement in mark twains arm and he found writing difficult      some of the letters promised to laffan and mcclure were still      unfinished       young hall his publishing manager in america was working hard to      keep the business afloat and being full of the optimism of his      years did not fail to make as good a showing as he could  we may      believe his letters were very welcome to clemens and his wife who      found little enough in the general prospect to comfort them     to mr hall in new york                                                    berlin nov 27 91  dear mr hallthat kind of a statement is valuable it came this morning this is the first time since the business began that i have had a report that furnished the kind of information i wanted and was really enlightening and satisfactory keep it up dont let it fall into desuetude  everything looks so fine and handsome with the business now that i feel a great letup from depression the rewards of your long and patient industry are on their way and their arrival safe in port presently seems assured  by george i shall be glad when the ship comes in  my arm is so much better that i was able to make a speech last night to 250 americans but when they threw my portrait on the screen it was a sorrowful reminder for it was from a negative of 15 years ago and hadnt a gray hair in it and now that my arm is better i have stolen a couple of days and finished up a couple of mcclure letters that have been lying a long time  i shall mail one of them to you next tuesdayregistered lookout for it  i shall register and mail the other one concerning the jungfrau next friday look out for it also and drop me a line to let me know they have arrived  i shall write the 6th and last letter by and by when i have studied berlin sufficiently  yours in a most cheerful frame of mind and with my and all the familys thanksgiving greetings and best wishes                                          s l clemens          postscript by mrs clemens written on mr clemenss letter  dear mr hallthis is my birthday and your letter this morning was a happy addition to the little gifts on the breakfast table i thought of going out and spending money for something unnecessary after it came but concluded perhaps i better wait a little longer                                     sincerely yours                                              o l clemens        the german chicago was the last of the six mcclure letters and was      finished that winter in berlin  it is now included in the uniform      edition of mark twains works and is one of the best descriptive      articles of the german capital ever written  he made no use of the      rhone notes further than to put them together in literary form      they did not seem to him to contain enough substance to warrant      publication  a letter to hall written toward the end of december      we find rather gloomy in tone though he is still able to extract      comfort and even cheerfulness from one of mr halls reports                    memorandum to fred j hall in new york  among the mss i left with you are a few that have a recent look and are written on rather stiff pale green paper if you will have those typewritered and keep the originals and send me the copies one per mail not two ill see if i can use them  but tell howells and other inquirers that my hopes of writing anything are very slenderi seem to be disabled for life  drop mcclure a line and tell him the same i cant dare to make an engagement now for even a single letter  i am glad howells is on a magazine but sorry he gave up the study i shall have to go on a magazine myself if this l a l continues to hold my nose down to the grindstone much longer  im going to hold my breath now for 30 daysthen the annual statement will arrive and i shall know how we feel merry xmas to you from us all                           sincerely                                    s l c  p s just finished the above and finished raging at the eternal german taxgatherer and so all the jubilant things which i was going to say about the past years business got knocked out of me after writing this present letter i was feeling blue about huck finn but i sat down and overhauled your reports from now back to last april and compared them with the splendid octnov business and went to bed feeling refreshed and fine for certainly it has been a handsome year now rush me along the annual report and lets see how we feel                                                    s l c     xxxii letters 1892 chiefly to mr hall and mrs crane in berlin mentone badnauheim florence  mark twain was the notable literary figure in berlin that winter the center of every great gathering he was entertained by the kaiser and shown many special attentions by germans of every rank his books were as well known in berlin as in new york and at court assemblies and embassies he was always a chief center of interest  he was too popular for his own good the gaiety of the capital told on him finally one night after delivering a lecture in a hot room he contracted a severe cold driving to a ball at general von versens and a few days later was confined to his bed with pneumonia it was not a severe attack but it was long continued he could write some letters and even work a little but he was not allowed to leave his bed for many weeks a condition which he did not find a hardship for no man ever enjoyed the loose luxury of undress and the comfort of pillows more than mark twain in a memorandum of that time he wrote i am having a booming time all to myself  meantime hall in america was sending favorable reports of the publishing business and this naturally helped to keep up his spirits he wrote frequently to hall of course but the letters for the most part are purely of a business nature and of little interest to the general reader     to fred j hall in new york                                          hotel royal berlin feb 12  dear mr halldaly wants to get the stage rights of the american claimant the foundation from which i wrote the story is a play of the same name which has been in a p burbanks hands 5 or 6 years that play cost me some money helping burbank stage it but has never brought me any i have written burbank lotos club and asked him to give me back his rights in the old play so that i can treat with daly and utilize this chance to even myself up burbank is a lovely fellow and if he objects i cant urge him but you run in at the lotos and see him and if he relinquishes his claim then i would like you to conduct the business with daly or have whitford or some other lawyer do it under your supervision if you prefer  this morning i seem to have rheumatism in my right foot  i am ordered south by the doctor and shall expect to be well enough to start by the end of this month                               no signature         it is curious after clemens and howells had tried so hard and so      long to place their sellers play that now when the story      appeared in book form augustin daly should have thought it worth      dramatizing  daly and clemens were old friends and it would seem      that daly could hardly have escaped seeing the play when it was      going the rounds  but perhaps there is nothing more mysterious in      the world than the ways and wants of theatrical managers  the      matter came to nothing of course but the fact that daly should      have thought a story built from an old discarded play had a play in      it seems interesting       clemens and his wife were advised to leave the cold of berlin as      soon as he was able to travel  this was not until the first of      march when taking their old courier joseph very they left the      children in good hands and journeyed to the south of france     to susy clemens in berlin                                               mentone mch 22 92  susy deari have been delighted to note your easy facility with your pen and proud to note also your literary superiorities of one kind and anotherclearness of statement directness felicity of expression photographic ability in setting forth an incidentstylegood styleno barnacles on it in the way of unnecessary retarding words the shipman scrapes off the barnacles when he wants his racer to go her best gait and straight to the buoy you should write a letter every day long or shortand so ought i but i dont  mamma says tell clara yes she will have to write a note if the fan comes back mended  we couldnt go to nice todayhad to give it up on various accountsand this was the last chance i am sorry for mammai wish she could have gone she got a heavy fall yesterday evening and was pretty stiff and lame this morning but is working it off trunk packing  joseph is gone to nice to educate himself in kodakingand to get the pictures mounted which mamma thinks she took here but i noticed she didnt take the plug out as a rule when she did she took nine pictures on top of each othercomposites                                with lots of love                                                   papa        in the course of their italian wanderings they reached florence      where they were so comfortable and well that they decided to engage      a villa for the next winter  through prof willard fiske they      discovered the villa viviani near settignano an old palace      beautifully located on the hilltops east of florence commanding a      wonderful view of the ancient city  clemens felt that he could work      there and time proved that he was right       for the summer however they returned to germany and located at      badnauheim  clemens presently decided to make a trip to america to      give some personal attention to business matters  for one thing      his publishinghouse in spite of prosperity seemed constantly to      be requiring more capital and then a chicago company had been      persuaded by paige to undertake the manufacture of the typesetter      it was the beginning of a series of feverish trips which he would      make back and forth across the ocean during the next two years     to fred j hall in new york                                          badnauheim june 11 92                                                         saturday  dear mr hallif this arrives before i do let it inform you that i am leaving bremen for new york next tuesday in the havel  if you can meet me when the ship arrives you can help me to get away from the reporters and maybe you can take me to your own or some other lodgings where they cant find me  but if the hour is too early or too late for you i shall obscure myself somewhere till i can come to the office  yours sincerely                         s l c        nothing of importance happened in america  the new paige company      had a factory started in chicago and expected to manufacture fifty      machines as a beginning  they claimed to have capital or to be      able to command it and as the main control had passed from      clemenss hands he could do no more than look over the ground and      hope for the best  as for the business about all that he could do      was to sign certain notes necessary to provide such additional      capital as was needed and agree with hall that hereafter they would      concentrate their efforts and resist further temptation in the way      of new enterprise  then he returned to badnauheim and settled down      to literature  this was the middle of july and he must have worked      pretty steadily for he presently had a variety of mss ready to      offer     to fred j hall in new york                                                         aug 10 92  dear mr halli have dropped that novel i wrote you about because i saw a more effective way of using the main episodeto wit by telling it through the lips of huck finn so i have started huck finn and tom sawyer still 15 years old and their friend the freed slave jim around the world in a stray balloon with huck as narrator and somewhere after the end of that great voyage he will work in the said episode and then nobody will suspect that a whole book has been written and the globe circumnavigated merely to get that episode in an effective and at the same time apparently unintentional way i have written 12000 words of this narrative and find that the humor flows as easily as the adventures and surprisesso i shall go along and make a book of from 50000 to 100000 words  it is a story for boys of course and i think will interest any boy between 8 years and 80  when i was in new york the other day mrs dodge editor of st nicholas wrote and offered me 5000 for serial right a story for boys 50000 words long i wrote back and declined for i had other matter in my mind then  i conceive that the right way to write a story for boys is to write so that it will not only interest boys but will also strongly interest any man who has ever been a boy that immensely enlarges the audience  now this story doesnt need to be restricted to a childs magazineit is proper enough for any magazine i should think or for a syndicate i dont swear it but i think so  proposed title of the story new adventures of huckleberry finn                               no signature        the novel mentioned in the foregoing was the extraordinary twins      a story from which puddnhead wilson would be evolved later  it was      a wildly extravagant farcejust the sort of thing that now and then      mark twain plunged into with an enthusiasm that had to work itself      out and die a natural death or mellow into something worth while      tom sawyer abroad as the new huck story was finally called was      completed and disposed of to st nicholas for serial publication       the twichells were in europe that summer and came to badnauheim      the next letter records a pleasant incident  the prince of wales of      that day later became king edward vii     to mr and mrs orion clemens in keokuk iowa                                     private  badnauheim aug 23 92  dear orion and mollieprivate because no newspaperman or other gossip must get hold of it  livy is getting along pretty well and the doctor thinks another summer here will cure her  the twichells have been here four days and we have had good times with them joe and i ran over to homburg the great pleasure resort saturday to dine with some friends and in the morning i went walking in the promenade and met the british ambassador to the court of berlin and he introduced me to the prince of wales and i found him a most unusually comfortable and unembarrassing englishman to talk withquick to see the obscurest point and equipped with a laugh which is spontaneous and catching am invited by a near friend of his to meet him at dinner day after tomorrow and there could be a good time but the brass band will smash the talk and spoil everything  we are expecting to move to florence ten or twelve days hence but if this hot weather continues we shall wait for cooler i take clara to berlin for the wintermusic mainly with german and french added thus far jean is our only glib french scholar  we all send love to you all and to pamela and sams family and annie                                     sam        clemens and family left badnauheim for italy by way of switzerland      in september mrs clemenss sister mrs crane who had been with      them in europe during the first year had now returned to america      mrs clemens had improved at the baths though she had by no means      recovered her health  we get a general report of conditions from      the letter which clemens wrote mrs crane from lucerne switzerland      where the party rested for several days  the phelps mentioned in      this letter was william walter phelps united states minister to      germany  the phelps and clemens families had been much associated      in berlin  mason was frank mason consul general at frankfort      and in later years at paris  charlie and ida were charles and      mrs langdon of elmira     to mrs crane in elmira n y                                               lucerne sept 18 92  dear aunt sueimagine how i felt to find that you had actually gone off without filling my traveling ink stand which you gave me i found it out yesterday livy advised me to write you about it  i have been driving this pen hard i wrote 280 pages on a yarn called tom sawyer abroad then took up the twins again destroyed the last half of the manuscript and rewrote it in another form and am going to continue it and finish it in florence tom sawyer seems rather pale to the family after the extravagances of the twins but they came to like it after they got used to it  we remained in nauheim a little too long if we had left there four or five days earlier we should have made florence in 3 days but by the time we got started livy had got smitten with what we feared might be erysipelasgreatly swollen neck and face and unceasing headaches we lay idle in frankfort 4 days doctoring we started thursday and made bale hard trip because it was one of those trains that gets tired every seven minutes and stops to rest three quarters of an hour it took us 3 12 hours to get here instead of the regulation 220 we reached here friday evening and will leave tomorrow tuesday morning the rest has made the headaches better we shall pull through to milan tomorrow if possible next day we shall start at 10 a m and try to make bologna 5 hours next day thursday florence d v next year we will walk for these excursions have got to be made over again ive got seven trunks and i undertook to be courier because i meant to express them to florence direct but we were a couple of days too late all continental roads had issued a peremptory order that no baggage should travel a mile except in the company of the owner all over europe people are howling they are separated from their baggage and cant get it forwarded to them i have to reship my trunks every day it is very amusinguncommonly so there seemed grave doubts about our being able to get these trunks over the italian frontier but ive got a very handsome note from the frankfort italian consul general addressed to all italian customs officers and we shall get through if anybody does  the phelpses came to frankfort and we had some great timesdinner at his hotel the masons supper at our innlivy not in it she was merely allowed a glimpse no more of course phelps said she was merely pretending to be ill was never looking so well and fine  the children are all right they paddle around a little and driveso do we all lucerne seems to be pretty full of tourists the fleulen boat went out crowded yesterday morning  the paris herald has created a public interest by inoculating one of its correspondents with cholera a man said yesterday he wished to god they would inoculate all of them yes the interest is quite general and strong and much hope is felt  livy says i have said enough bad things and better send all our loves to you and charley and ida and all the children and shut up which i doand shut up                                s l c        they reached florence on the 26th and four days later we find      clemens writing again to mrs crane detailing everything at length      little comment on this letter is required it fully explains itself      perhaps a word of description from one of his memoranda will not be      out of place  of the villa he wrote it is a plain square      building like a box and is painted light green and has green      windowshutters  it stands in a commanding position on the      artificial terrace of liberal dimensions which is walled around      with masonry  from the walls the vineyards and olive groves of the      estate slant away toward the valley  roses overflow the      retaining walls and the battered and mossy stone urn on the      gatepost in pink and yellow cataracts exactly as they do on the      dropcurtains in the theaters  the house is a very fortress for      strength       the mrs ross in this letter was janet ross daughter of lady duff      gordon remembered today for her egyptian letters  the ross castle      was but a little distance away     to mrs crane in elmira                                     villa viviani settignano florence                                                    sept  30 1892  dear suewe have been in the house several days and certainly it is a beautiful placeparticularly at this moment when the skies are a deep leaden color the domes of florence dim in the drizzling rain and occasional perpendicular coils of lightning quivering intensely in the black sky about galileos tower it is a charming panorama and the most conspicuous towers and domes down in the city look today just as they looked when boccaccio and dante used to contemplate them from this hillock five and six hundred years ago  the mademoiselle is a great help to livy in the housekeeping and is a cheery and cheerful presence in the house the butler is equipped with a little french and it is this fact that enables the house to gobut it wont go well until the family get some sort of facility with the italian tongue for the cook the womanofallwork and the coachman understand only that it is a stubborn and devilish language to learn but jean and the others will master it livys german nauheim girl is the worst off of anybody as there is no market for her tongue at all among the help  with the furniture in and the curtains up the house is very pretty and not unhomelike at midnight last night we heard screams up stairssusy had set the lofty window curtains afire with a candle this sounds kind of frightful whereas when you come to think of it a burning curtain or pile of furniture hasnt any element of danger about it in this fortress there isnt any conceivable way to burn this house down or enable a conflagration on one floor to climb to the next  mrs ross laid in our wood wine and servants for us and they are excellent she had the house scoured from cellar to rook the curtains washed and put up all beds pulled to pieces beaten washed and put together again and beguiled the marchese into putting a big porcelain stove in the vast central hall she is a wonderful woman and we dont quite see how or when we should have gotten under way without her  observe our address abovethe post delivers letters daily at the house  even with the work and fuss of settling the house livy has improvedand the best is yet to come there is going to be absolute seclusion herea hermit life in fact we the rest of us shall run over to the rosss frequently and they will come here now and then and see livythat is all mr fiske is awaynobody knows whereand the work on his house has been stopped and his servants discharged therefore we shall merely go rossingas far as society is concernedshant

florence  oct 22 92  dear suewe are getting wonted the open fires have driven away the cold and the doubt and now a cheery spirit pervades the place livy and the kings and mademoiselle having been taking their tea a number of times lately on the open terrace with the city and the hills and the sunset for company i stop work a few minutes as a rule when the sun gets down to the hilltops west of florence and join the teagroup to wonder and exclaim there is always some new miracle in the view a new and exquisite variation in the show a variation which occurs every 15 minutes between dawn and night once early in the morning a multitude of white villas not before perceived revealed themselves on the far hills then we recognized that all those great hills are snowed thick with them clear to the summit  the variety of lovely effects the infinitude of change is something not to be believed by any who has not seen it no view that i am acquainted with in the world is at all comparable to this for delicacy charm exquisiteness dainty coloring and bewildering rapidity of change it keeps a person drunk with pleasure all the time sometimes florence ceases to be substantial and becomes just a faint soft dream with domes and towers of air and one is persuaded that he might blow it away with a puff of his breath  livy is progressing admirably this is just the place for her

arthur stedman for his author club book so your suggestion that my new springbook bear that name arrives too late as he probably would not want us to use that story in a book of ours until the author book had had its run that is for him to decideand i dont want him hampered at all in his decision i for my part prefer the 1000000 banknote and other stories by mark twain as a title but above my judgment i prefer yours i mean thisit is not taffy  i told arthur to leave out the former squib or paragraph and use only the californians story tell him this is because i am going to use that in the book i am now writing  i finished those extraordinary twins night before last makes 60 or 80000 wordshavent counted  the last third of it suits me to a dot i begin today to entirely recast and rewrite the first twothirdsnew plan with two minor characters made very prominent one major character cropped out and the twins subordinated to a minor but not insignificant place  the minor character will now become the chiefest and i will name the story after himpuddnhead wilson  merry xmas to you and great prosperity and felicity                                                    s l clemens     xxxiii letters 1893 to mr hall mrs clemens and others florence business troubles puddnhead wilson joan of arc at the players new york  the reader may have suspected that young mr hall in new york was having his troubles he was by this time onethird owner in the business of charles l webster  co as well as its general manager the business had been drained of its capital one way and anotherpartly by the publication of unprofitable books partly by the earlier demands of the typesetter but more than all by the manufacturing cost and agents commissions demanded by l a l that is to say the eleven large volumes constituting the library of american literature which webster had undertaken to place in a million american homes there was plenty of sale for itindeed that was just the trouble for it was sold on paymentssmall monthly paymentswhile the cost of manufacture and the liberal agents commissions were cash items and it would require a considerable period before the dribble of collections would swell into a tide large enough to satisfy the steady outflow of expense a sale of twentyfive sets a day meant prosperity on paper but unless capital could be raised from some other source to make and market those books through a period of months perhaps even years to come it meant bankruptcy in reality it was halls job with clemens to back him to keep their ship afloat on these steadily ebbing financial waters it was also halls affair to keep mark twain cheerful to look pleasant himself and to show how they were steadily getting rich because orders were pouring in though a cloud that resembled bankruptcy loomed always a little higher upon the horizon if hall had not been young and an optimist he would have been frightened out of his boots early in the game as it was he made a brave steady fight kept as cheerful and stiff an upper lip as possible always hoping that something would happensome grand sale of his other books some unexpected inflow from the typesetter interestsanything that would sustain his ship until the l a l tide should turn and float it into safety  clemens had faith in hall and was fond of him he never found fault with him he tried to accept his encouraging reports at their face value he lent the firm every dollar of his literary earnings not absolutely needed for the familys support he signed new notes he allowed mrs clemens to put in such remnants of her patrimony as the typesetter had spared  the situation in 1893 was about as here outlined the letters to hall of that year are frequent and carry along the story to any who had formed the idea that mark twain was irascible exacting and faultfinding they will perhaps be a revelation     to fred j hall in new york                                               florence jan 1 93  dear mr hallyours of dec 19 is to hand and mrs clemens is deeply distressed for she thinks i have been blaming you or finding fault with you about something but most surely that cannot be i tell her that although i am prone to write hasty and regrettable things to other people i am not a bit likely to write such things to you i cant believe i have done anything so ungrateful if i have pile coals of fire on my head for i deserve it  i wonder if my letter of credit isnt an encumbrance do you have to deposit the whole amount it calls for if that is so it is an encumbrance and we must withdraw it and take the money out of soak i have never made drafts upon it except when compelled because i thought you deposited nothing against it and only had to put up money that i drew upon it that therefore the less i drew the easier it would be for you  i am dreadfully sorry i didnt know it would be a help to you to let my monthly check pass over a couple of months i could have stood that by drawing what is left of mrs clemenss letter of credit and we would have done it cheerfully  i will write whitmore to send you the century check for 1000 and you can collect mrs dodges 2000 whitmore has power of attorney which i think will enable him to endorse it over to you in my name if you need that 3000 put it in the business and use it and send whitmore the companys note for a year if you dont need it turn it over to mr halsey and let him invest it for me  ive a mighty poor financial head and i may be all wrongbut tell me if i am wrong in supposing that in lending my own firm money at 6 per cent i pay 4 of it myself and so really get only a per cent now dont laugh if that is stupid  of course my friend declined to buy a quarter interest in the l a l for 200000 i judged he would i hoped he would offer 100000 but he didnt if the cholera breaks out in america a few months hence we cant borrow or sell but if it doesnt we must try hard to raise 100000 i wish we could do it before there is a cholera scare  i have been in bed two or three days with a cold but i got up an hour ago and i believe i am all right again  how i wish i had appreciated the need of 100000 when i was in new york last summer i would have tried my best to raise it it would make us able to stand 1000 sets of l a l per month but not any more i guess  you have done magnificently with the business and we must raise the money somehow to enable you to reap the reward of all that labor                                sincerely yours                                          s l clemens   whitmore in this letter was f g whitmore of hartford mark twains financial agent the money due from mrs dodge was a balance on tom sawyer abroad which had been accepted by st nicholas mr halsey was a downtown broker  clemens who was growing weary of the constant demands of l a l had conceived the idea that it would be well to dispose of a portion of it for enough cash to finance its manufacture  we dont know who the friend was to whom he offered a quarter interest for the modest sum of two hundred thousand dollars but in the next letter we discover designs on a certain very canny scotchman of skibo     to fred j hall in new york                                               florence jan 28 92  dear mr halli want to throw out a suggestion and see what you think of it we have a good start and solid ground under us we have a valuable reputation our business organization is practical sound and welldevised our publications are of a respectworthy character and of a moneybreeding species now then i think that the association with us of some one of great name and with capital would give our business a prodigious impetusthat phrase is not too strong  as i look at it it is not money merely that is needed if that were all the firm has friends enough who would take an interest in a paying venture we need some one who has made his life a success not only from a business standpoint but with that achievement back of him has been great enough to make his power felt as a thinker and a literary man it is a pretty usual thing for publishers to have this sort of partners now you see what a power carnegie is and how far his voice reaches in the several lines i speak of do you know him you do by correspondence or purely business talks about his booksbut personally i mean so that it would not be an intrusion for you to speak to him about this desire of minefor i would like you to put it before him and if you fail to interest him in it you will probably get at least some valuable suggestions from him ill enclose a note of introductionyou neednt use it if you dont need to                                     yours s l c  p s yes i think i have already acknowledged the dec 1000 and the jan 500and if another 500 was mailed 3 days ago theres no hiatus  i think i also reminded you that the new letter of credit does not cover the unexpended balance of the old one but falls considerably short of it  do your best with carnegie and dont wait to consider any of my intermediate suggestions or talks about our raising half of the 200000 ourselves i mean wait for nothing to make my suggestion available i should have to go over and see arnot and i dont want to until i can mention carnegies name to him as going in with us  my book is typewritten and ready for printpuddnhead wilsona tale or those extraordinary twins if preferable  it makes 82500 words12000 more than huck finn but i dont know what to do with it mrs clemens thinks it wouldnt do to go to the am pub co or anywhere outside of our own house we have no subscription machinery and a book in the trade is a book thrown away as far as moneyprofit goes i am in a quandary give me a lift out of it  i will mail the book to you and get you to examine it and see if it is good or if it is bad i think it is good and i thought the claimant bad when i saw it in print but as for real judgment i think i am destitute of it  i am writing a companion to the prince and pauper which is half done and will make 200000 words and i have had the idea that if it were gotten up in handsome style with many illustrations and put at a high enough price maybe the l a l canvassers would take it and run it with that book would they it could be priced anywhere from 4 up to 10 according to how it was gotten up i suppose  i dont want it to go into a magazine                                               s l c  i am having several short things typewritered i will send them to you presently i like the century and harpers but i dont know that i have any business to object to the cosmopolitan if they pay as good rates i suppose a man ought to stick to one magazine but that may be only superstition what do you think                                               s l c        the companion to the prince and the pauper mentioned in this      letter was the story of joan of arc perhaps the most finished of      mark twains literary productions  his interest in joan had been      first awakened when as a printers apprentice in hannibal he had      found blowing along the street a stray leaf from some printed story      of her life  that fragment of history had pictured joan in prison      insulted and mistreated by ruffians  it had aroused all the      sympathy and indignation in the boy sam clemens also it had      awakened his interest in history and indeed in all literature       his love for the character of joan had grown with the years until      in time he had conceived the idea of writing her story  as far back      as the early eighties he had collected material for it and had      begun to make the notes  one thing and another had interfered and      he had found no opportunity for such a story  now however in      florence in the ancient villa and in the quiet garden looking      across the vineyards and olive groves to the dream city along the      arno he felt moved to take up the tale of the shepherd girl of      france the soldier maid or as he called her the noble child      the most innocent the most lovely the most adorable the ages have      produced  his surroundings and background would seem to have been      perfect and he must have written with considerable ease to have      completed a hundred thousand words in a period of not more than six      weeks       perhaps hall did not even go to see carnegie at all events nothing      seems to have come of the idea  once at a later time mask twain      himself mentioned the matter to carnegie and suggested to him that      it was poor financiering to put all of ones eggs into one basket      meaning into iron  but carnegie answered thats a mistake put      all your eggs into one basket and watch that basket       it was march when clemens felt that once more his presence was      demanded in america  he must see if anything could be realized from      the typesetter or l a l     to fred j hall in new york                                                         march 13 93  dear mr halli am busy getting ready to sail the 22d in the kaiser wilhelm ii  i send herewith 2 magazine articles  the story contains 3800 to 4000 words  the diary contains 3800 words  each would make about 4 pages of the century  the diary is a gem if i do say it myself that shouldnt  if the cosmopolitan wishes to pay 600 for either of them or 1200 for both gather in the check and i will use the money in america instead of breaking into your treasury  if they dont wish to trade for either send the articles to the century without naming a price and if their check isnt large enough i will call and abuse them when i come  i signed and mailed the notes yesterday                                          yours                                              s l c        clemens reached new york on the 3d of april and made a trip to      chicago but accomplished nothing except to visit the worlds fair      and be laid up with a severe cold  the machine situation had not      progressed  the financial stringency of 1893 had brought everything      to a standstill  the new york bank would advance webster  co no      more money  so disturbed were his affairs so disordered was      everything that sometimes he felt himself as one walking amid      unrealities  a fragment of a letter to mrs crane conveys this       i dreamed i was born and grew up and was a pilot on the mississippi      and a miner and a journalist in nevada and a pilgrim in the quaker      city and had a wife and children and went to live in a villa at      florenceand this dream goes on and on and sometimes seems so real      that i almost believe it is real  i wonder if it is  but there is      no way to tell for if one applies tests they would be part of the      dream too and so would simply aid the deceit  i wish i knew      whether it is a dream or real       he saw warner briefly in america also howells now living in new      york but he had little time

sea entertainment and i thank you ever so much for it  ive had a little visit with warner at last i was getting afraid i wasnt going to have a chance to see him at all i forgot to tell you how thoroughly i enjoyed your account of the country printing office and how true it all was and how intimately recognizable in all its details but warner was full of delight over it and that reminded me and i am glad for i wanted to speak of it  you have given me a book annie trumbull has sent me her book i bought a couple of books mr hall gave me a choice german book laflan gave me two bottles of

already been made of the ross home being very near to      viviani and the association of the ross and clemens families      there was a fine vegetable garden on the ross estate and it was in      the

italy to an english lady she is a neighbor of mine outside of florence and has a great garden and thinks she could raise corn for her table if she had the right ammunition i myself feel a warm interest in this enterprise both on patriotic grounds and because i have a key to that garden which i got made from a wax impression it is not very good soil still i think she can grow enough for one

royaltiesso i judge you have not succeeded  this has depressed me i have been looking over the past years letters and statements and am depressed still more  i am terribly tired of business i am by nature and disposition unfitted for it and i want to get out of it i am standing on the mount morris volcano with help from the machine a long way offdoubtless a long way further off than the connecticut co imagines  now here is my idea for getting out  the firm owes mrs clemens and mei do not know quite how much but it is about 170000 or 175000 i suppose i make this guess from the documents here whose technicalities confuse me horribly  the firm owes other sums but there is stock and cash assets to cover the entire indebtedness and 11667920 over is that it in addition we have the l a l plates and copyright worth more than 130000is that correct  that is to say we have property worth about 250000 above indebtedness i supposeor by one of your estimates 300000 the greater part of the first debts to me is in notes paying 6 percent the rest the old 70000 or whatever it is pays no interest  now then will harper or appleton or putnam give me 200000 for those debts and my twothirds interest in the firm the firm of course taking the mount morris and all such obligations off my hands and leaving me clear of all responsibility  i dont want much money i only want first class notes200000 worth of them at 6 per cent payable monthlyyearly notes renewable annually for 3 years with 5000 of the principal payable at the beginning and middle of each year after that the notes renewable annually and perhaps a larger part of the principal payable semiannually  please advise me and suggest alterations and emendations of the above scheme for i need that sort of help being ignorant of business and not able to learn a single detail of it  such a deal would make it easy for a big firm to pour in a big cash capital and jump l a l up to enormous prosperity then your onethird would be a fortuneand i hope to see that day  i enclose an authority to use with whitmore in case you have sold any royalties but if you cant make this deal dont make any wait a little and see if you cant make the deal do make the deal if you possibly can and if any presence shall be necessary in order to complete it i will come over though i hope it can be done without that  get me out of business  and i will be yours forever gratefully                                     s l clemens  my idea is that i am offering my 23 of l a l and the business for thirty or forty thousand dollars is that it  p s s the new firm could retain my books and reduce them to a 10 percent royalty                                      s l c     to rev jos h twichell in hartford

but weakness cough all gone  old sir henry layard was here the other day visiting our neighbor janet ross daughter of lady duff gordon and since then i have been reading his account of the adventures of his youth in the far east in a footnote he has something to say about a sailor which i thought might interest youviz  this same quartermaster was celebrated among the english in mesopotamia for an entry which he made in his logbookafter a perilous storm the windy and watery elements raged tears and prayers was had recourse to but was of no manner of use so we hauled up the anchor and got round

munich in order that mrs clemens might visit some of the      german baths  the next letter is written by her and shows her deep      sympathy with hall in his desperate struggle  there have been few      more unselfish and courageous women in history than mark twains      wife     from mrs clemens to mr hall in new york                                                     june 27th 1893                                                    munich  dear mr hallyour letter to mr clemens of june 16th has just reached here as he has gone to berlin for clara i am going to send you just a line in answer to it  mr clemens did not realize what trouble you would be in when his letter should reach you or he would not have sent it just then i hope you will not worry any more than you can help do not let our interests weigh on you too heavily we both know you will as you always have look in every way to the best interests of all  i think mr clemens is right in feeling that he should get out of business that he is not fitted for it it worries him too much  but he need be in no haste about it and of course it would be the very farthest from his desire to imperil in the slightest degree your interests in order to save his own  i am sure that i voice his wish as well as mine when i say that he would simply like you to bear in mind the fact that he greatly desires to be released from his present anxiety and worry at a time when it shall not endanger your interest or the safety of the business  i am more sorry than i can express that this letter of mr clemens should have reached you when you were struggling under such terrible pressure i hope now that the weight is not quite so heavy he would not have written you about the money if he had known that it was an inconvenience for you to send it he thought the bookkeeper whose duty it is to forward it had forgotten  we can draw on mr langdon for money for a few weeks until things are a little easier with you as mr clemens wrote you we would say do not send us any more money at present if we were not afraid to do so i will say however do not trouble yourself if for a few weeks you are not able to send the usual amount  mr clemens and i have the greatest possible desire not to increase in any way your burdens and sincerely wish we might aid you  i trust my brother may be able in his talk with you to throw some helpful light on the situation  hoping you will see a change for the better and begin to reap the fruit of your long and hard labor                 believe me                     very cordially yours                               olivia l clemens   hall naturally did not wish to be left alone with the business he realized that his credit would suffer both at the bank and with the public if his distinguished partner should retire he wrote therefore proposing as an alternate that they dispose of the big subscription set that was swamping them it was a good planif it would workand we find clemens entering into it heartily     to fred j hall in new york                                               munich july 3 93  dear mr hallyou make a suggestion which has once or twice flitted dimly through my mind heretofore to wit sell l a l  i like that better than the other scheme for it is no doubt feasible whereas the other is perhaps not  the firm is in debt but l a l is freeand not only free but has large money owing to it a proposition to sell that by itself to a big house could be made without embarrassment we merely confess that we cannot spare capital from the rest of the business to run it on the huge scale necessary to make it an opulent success  it will be selling a good thingfor somebody and it will be getting rid of a load which we are clearly not able to carry whoever buys will have a noble good openinga complete equipment a well organized business a capable and experienced manager and enterprise not experimental but under full sail and immediately able to pay 50 per cent a year on every dollar the publisher shall actually invest in iti mean in making and selling the books  i am miserably sorry to be adding bothers and torments to the oversupply which you already have in these hideous times but i feel so troubled myself considering the dreary fact that we are getting deeper and deeper in debt and the l a l getting to be a heavier and heavier burden all the time that i must bestir myself and seek a way of relief  it did not occur to me that in selling out i would injure youfor that i am not going to do but to sell l a l will not injure you it will put you in better shape                 sincerely yours                          s l clemens     to fred j hall in new york                                                    july 8 92  dear mr halli am sincerely glad you are going to sell l a l i am glad you are shutting off the agents and i hope the fatal book will be out of our hands before it will be time to put them on again with nothing but our nonexistent capital to work with the book has no value for us rich a prize as it will be to any competent house that gets it  i hope you are making an effort to sell before you discharge too many agents for i suppose the agents are a valuable part of the property  we have been stopping in munich for awhile but we shall make a break for some country resort in a few days now                           sincerely yours                                    s l c                                                              july 8  p s no i suppose i am wrong in suggesting that you wait a moment before discharging your l a l agentsin fact i didnt mean that i judge your only hope of salvation is in discharging them all at once since it is their commissions that threaten to swamp us it is they who have eaten up the 14000 i left with you in such a brief time no doubt  i feel panicky  i think the sale might be made with better advantage however now than later when the agents have got out of the purchasers reach                                     s l c  p s no monthly report for many months        those who are old enough to remember the summer of 1893 may recall      it as a black financial season  banks were denying credit      businesses were forced to the wall  it was a poor time to float any      costly enterprise  the chicago company who was trying to build the      machines made little progress  the book business everywhere was      bad  in a brief note following the foregoing letters clemens wrote      hall       it is now past the middle of july and no cablegram to say the      machine is finished  we are afraid you are having miserable days      and worried nights and we sincerely wish we could relieve you but      it is all black with us and we dont know any helpful thing to say      or do       he inclosed some kind of manuscript proposition for john brisben      walker of the cosmopolitan with the comment it is my ingenious      scheme to protect the family against the almshouse for one more      yearand after thatwell goodness knows  i have never felt so      desperate in my lifeand good reason for i havent got a penny to      my name and mrs clemens hasnt enough laid up with langdon to keep      us two months       it was like mark twain in the midst of all this turmoil to project      an entirely new enterprise his busy mind was always visioning      success in unusual undertakings regardless of immediate conditions      and the steps necessary to achievement     to fred j hall in new york                                                         july 26 93  dear mr hall i hope the machine will be finished this month but it took me four years and cost me 100000 to finish the other machine after it was apparently entirely complete and setting type like a houseafire  i wonder what they call finished after it is absolutely perfect it cant go into a printingoffice until it has had a months wear running night and day to get the bearings smooth i judge  i may be able to run over about midoctober then if i find you relieved of l a l we will start a magazine inexpensive and of an entirely unique sort arthur stedman and his father editors of it arthur could do all the work merely submitting it to his father for approval  the first number should payand all subsequent ones25 cents a number cost of first number 20000 copies 2000 give most of them away sell the rest advertising and other expensescost unknown send one to all newspapersit would get a noticefavorable too  but we cannot undertake it until l a l is out of the way with our hands free and some capital to spare we could make it hum  where is the shelley article if you have it on hand keep it and i will presently tell you what to do with it  dont forget to tell me                           yours sincerely                                    s l c        the shelley article mentioned in this letter was the defense of      harriet sheller one of the very best of his essays  how he could      have written this splendid paper at a time of such distraction      passes comprehension  furthermore it is clear that he had revised      indeed rewritten the long story of puddnhead wilson     to fred j hall in new york                                                    july 30 93  dear mr hallthis time puddnhead wilson is a success even mrs clemens the most difficult of critics confesses it and without reserves or qualifications formerly she would not consent that it be published either before or after my death i have pulled the twins apart and made two individuals of them i have sunk them out of sight they are mere flitting shadows now and of no importance their story has disappeared from the book aunt betsy hale has vanished wholly leaving not a trace behind aunt patsy cooper and her daughter rowena have almost disappearedthey scarcely walk across the stage the whole story is centered on the murder and the trial from the first chapter the movement is straight ahead without divergence or sideplay to the murder and the trial everything that is done or said or that happens is a preparation for those events therefore 3 people stand up high from beginning to end and only 3puddnhead tom driscoll and his nigger mother roxana none of the others are important or get in the way of the story or require the readers attention consequently the scenes and episodes which were the strength of the book formerly are stronger than ever now  when i began this final reconstruction the story contained 81500 words now it contains only 58000 i have knocked out everything that delayed the march of the storyeven the description of a mississippi steamboat theres no weather in and no scenerythe story is stripped for flight  now then what is she worth the amount of matter is but 3000 words short of the american claimant for which the syndicate paid 12500 there was nothing new in that story but the fingerprints in this one is virgin groundabsolutely fresh and mighty curious and interesting to everybody  i dont want any more syndicatingnothing short of 20000 anyway and that i cant getbut wont you see how much the cosmopolitan will stand  do your best for me for i do not sleep these nights for visions of the poorhouse  this in spite of the hopeful tone of yours of 11th to langdon just received for in me hope is very nearly expiring everything does look so blue so dismally blue  by and by i shall take up the rhone openboat voyage again but not nowwe are going to be moving around too much i have torn up some of it but still have 15000 words that mrs clemens approves of and that i like i may go at it in paris again next winter but not unless i know i can write it to suit me  otherwise i shall tackle adam once more and do him in a kind of a friendly and respectful way that will commend him to the sunday schools ive been thinking out his first lifedays today and framing his childish and ignorant impressions and opinions for him  will ship puddnhead in a few days when you get it cable                      mark twain                          care brownship london                                         received  i mean to ship puddnhead wilson to yousay tomorrow itll furnish me hash for awhile i reckon i am almost sorry it is finished it was good entertainment to work at it and kept my mind away from things  we leave here in about ten days but the doctors have changed our plans again i think we shall be in bohemia or thereabouts till near the end of september then go to paris and take a rest                           yours sincerely                                         s l c  p s mrs clemens has come in since and read your letter and is deeply distressed she thinks that in some letter of mine i must have reproached you she says it is wonderful that you have kept the ship afloat in this storm that has seen fleets and fleets go down that from what she learns of the american businesssituation from her home letters you have accomplished a marvel in the circumstances and that she cannot bear to have a word said to you that shall voice anything but praise and the heartiest appreciationand not the shadow of a reproach will she allow  i tell her i didnt reproach you and never thought of such a thing and i said i would break open my letter and say so  mrs clemens says i must tell you not to send any money for a month or twoso that you may be afforded what little relief is in our power all rightim willing this is honest but i wish brer chatto would send along his little yearly contribution i dropped him a line about another matter a week agoasked him to subscribe for the daily news for meyou see i wanted to remind him in a covert way that it was payup timebut doubtless i directed the letter to you or some one else for i dont hear from him and dont get any daily news either     to fred j hall in new york                                               aug  6 93  dear mr halli am very sorryit was thoughtless in me let the reports go send me once a month two items and two only  cash liabilitiesso much cash assetsso much  i can perceive the condition of the business at a glance then and that will be sufficient  here we never see a newspaper but even if we did i could not come anywhere near appreciating or correctly estimating the tempest you have been buffeting your way throughonly the man who is in it can do thatbut i have tried not to burden you thoughtlessly or wantonly i have been wrought and unsettled in mind by apprehensions and that is a thing that is not helpable when one is in a strange land and sees his resources melt down to a two months supply and cant see any sure daylight beyond the bloody machine offered but a doubtful outlookand will still offer nothing much better for a long time to come for when daviss three weeks is up theres three months tinkering to follow i guess that is unquestionably the boss machine of the world but is the toughest one on prophets when it is in an incomplete state that has ever seen the light neither davis nor any other man can foretell with any considerable approach to certainty when it will be ready to get down to actual work in a printing office                               no signature        three days after the foregoing letter was written he wrote briefly       great scott but its a long yearfor you and me  i never knew the      almanac to drag so  at least since i was finishing that other      machine       i watch for your letters hungrilyjust as i used to watch for the      cablegram saying the machines finished but when next week      certainly swelled into three weeks sure i recognized the old      familiar tune i used to hear so much  ward dont know what      sickheartedness isbut he is in a way to find out       always the quaint form of his humor no matter how dark the way      we may picture him walking the floor planning scheming and      smokingalways smokingtrying to find a way out  it was not the      kind of scheming that many men have done under the circumstances      not scheming to avoid payment of debts but to pay them     to fred j hall in new york                                                         aug 14 93  dear mr halli am very glad indeed if you and mr langdon are able to see any daylight ahead to me none is visible i strongly advise that every penny that comes in shall be applied to paying off debts i may be in error about this but it seems to me that we have no other course open we can pay a part of the debts owing to outsidersnone to the clemenses in very prosperous times we might regard our stock and copyrights as assets sufficient with the money owing to us to square up and quit even but i suppose we may not hope for such luck in the present condition of things  what i am mainly hoping for is to save my royalties if they come into danger i hope you will cable me so that i can come over and try to save them for if they go i am a beggar  i would sail today if i had anybody to take charge of my family and help them through the difficult journeys commanded by the doctors i may be able to sail ten days hence i hope so and expect so  we can never resurrect the l a l i would not spend any more money on that book you spoke a while back of trying to start it up again as a preparation to disposing of it but we are not in shape to venture that i think it would require more borrowing and we must not do that                      yours sincerely                                s l c  aug 16 i have thought and thought but i dont seem to arrive in any very definite place of course you will not have an instants safety until the bank debts are paid there is nothing to be thought of but to hand over every penny as fast as it comes inand that will be slow enough or could you secure them by pledging part of our cash assets and  i am coming over just as soon as i can get the family moved and settled                                               s l c        two weeks following this letter he could endure the suspense no      longer and on august 29th sailed once more for america  in new      york clemens settled down at the players club where he could live      cheaply and undertook some literary work while he was casting about      for ways and means to relieve the financial situation  nothing      promising occurred until one night at the murray hill hotel he was      introduced by dr clarence c rice to henry h rogers of the      standard oil group of financiers  rogers had a keen sense of humor      and had always been a great admirer of mark twains work  it was a      mirthful evening and certainly an eventful one in mark twains      life  a day or two later doctor rice asked the millionaire to      interest himself a little in clemenss business affairs which he      thought a good deal confused  just what happened is not remembered      now but from the date of the next letter we realize that a      discussion of the matter by clemens and rogers must have followed      pretty promptly     to mrs clemens in europe                                                    oct 18 93  dear dear sweethearti dont seem to get even half a chance to write you these last two days and yet theres lots to say  apparently everything is at last settled as to the giveaway of l a l and the papers will be signed and the transfer made tomorrow morning  meantime i have got the best and wisest man in the whole standard oil group of muftimillionaires a good deal interested in looking into the typesetter this is private dont mention it he has been searching into that thing for three weeks and yesterday he said to me i find the machine to be all you represented iti have here exhaustive reports from my own experts and i know every detail of its capacity its immense value its construction cost history and all about its inventors character i know that the new york co and the chicago co are both stupid and that they are unbusinesslike people destitute of money and in a hopeless boggle  then he told me the scheme he had planned then said if i can arrange with these people on this basisit will take several weeks to find outi will see to it that they get the money they need then the thing will move right along and your royalties will cease to be waste paper i will post you the minute my scheme fails or succeeds in the meantime you stop walking the floor go off to the country and try to be gay you may have to go to walking again but dont begin till i tell you my scheme has failed and he added keep me posted always as to where you arefor if i need you and can use youi want to know where to put my hand on you  if i should even divulge the fact that the standard oil is merely talking remotely about going into the typesetter it would send my royalties up  with worlds and worlds of love and kisses to you all                                                         saml   with so great a burden of care shifted to the broad financial shoulders of h h rogers mark twains spirits went ballooning soaring toward the stars he awoke too to some of the social gaieties about him and found pleasure in the things that in the hour of his gloom had seemed mainly mockery we find him going to a sunday evening at howellss to john mackays and elsewhere     to mrs clemens in paris                                                         dec 2 93  livy darlinglast night at john mackays the dinner consisted of soup raw oysters corned beef and cabbage and something like a custard i ate without fear or stint and yet have escaped all suggestion of indigestion the men present were old gray pacificcoasters whom i knew when i and they were young and not gray the talk was of the days when we went gypsying a long time agothirty years indeed it was a talk of the dead mainly that and of how they looked and the harumscarum things they did and said for there were no cares in that life no aches and pains and not time enough in the day and threefourths of the night to work off ones surplus vigor and energy of the midnight highway robbery joke played upon me with revolvers at my head on the windswept and desolate gold hill divide no witness is left but me the victim all the friendly robbers are gone these old fools last night laughed till they cried over the particulars of that old forgotten crime  john mackay has no family here but a pet monkeya most affectionate and winning little devil but he makes trouble for the servants for he is full of curiosity and likes to take everything out of the drawers and examine it minutely and he puts nothing back the examinations of yesterday count for nothing todayhe makes a new examination every day but he injures nothing  i went with laffan to the racquet club the other night and played billiards two hours without starting up any rheumatism i suppose it was all really taken out of me in berlin  richard harding davis spoke yesterday of claras impersonations at mrs van rensselaers here and said they were a wonderful piece of work  livy dear i do hope you are comfortable as to quarters and food at the hotel brighton but if youre not dont stay there make one more effortdont give it up dear heart this is from one who loves youwhich is saml        it was decided that rogers and clemens should make a trip to chicago      to investigate personally the typesetter situation there  clemens      reports the details of the excursion to mrs clemens in a long      subdivided letter most of which has no general interest and is here      omitted  the trip as a whole would seem to have been      satisfactory  the personal portions of the long christmas letter      may properly be preserved     to mrs clemens in paris                                               the players xmas 1893                                    no 1  merry xmas my darling and all my darlings i arrived from chicago close upon midnight last night and wrote and sent down my christmas cablegram before undressing merry xmas promising progress made in chicago it would get to the telegraph office toward 8 this morning and reach you at luncheon  i was vaguely hoping all the past week that my xmas cablegram would be definite and make you all jump with jubilation but the thought always intruded itself you are not going out there to negotiate with a man but with a louse this makes results uncertain  i was asleep as christmas struck upon the clock at mid night and didnt wake again till two hours ago it is now half past 10 xmas morning i have had my coffee and bread and shant get out of bed till it is time to dress for mrs laflans christmas dinner this eveningwhere i shall meet bram stoker and must make sure about that photo with irvings autograph i will get the picture and he will attend to the rest in order to remember and not forgetwell i will go there with my dress coat wrong side out it will cause remark and then i shall remember                                  no 2 and 3  i tell you it was interesting the chicago campaign i mean on the way out mr rogers would plan out the campaign while i walked the floor and smoked and assented then he would close it up with a snap and drop it and we would totally change the subject and take up the scenery etc  here follows the long detailed report of the chicago conference of interest only to the parties directly concerned                                     no 4  we had nice tripe going and coming mr rogers had telegraphed the pennsylvania railroad for a couple of sections for us in the fast train leaving at 2 p m the 22nd the vice president telegraphed back that every berth was engaged which was not trueit goes without saying but that he was sending his own car for us it was mighty nice and comfortable in its parlor it had two sofas which could become beds at night it had four comfortablycushioned cane armchairs it had a very nice bedroom with a wide bed in it which i said i would take because i believed i was a little wider than mr rogerswhich turned out to be true so i took it it had a darling backporchrailed roofed and roomy and there we sat most of the time and viewed the scenery and talked for the weather was may weather and the soft dreampictures of hill and river and mountain and sky were clear and away beyond anything i have ever seen for exquisiteness and daintiness  the colored waiter knew his business and the colored cook was a finished artist breakfasts coffee with real cream beefsteaks sausage bacon chops eggs in various ways potatoes in variousyes and quite wonderful baked potatoes and hot as fire dinnersall manner of things including canvasback duck apollinaris claret champagne etc  we sat up chatting till midnight going and coming seldom read a line day or night though we were well fixed with magazines etc then i finished off with a hot scotch and we went to bed and slept till 930 am i honestly tried to pay my share of hotel bills fees etc but i was not allowedand i knew the reason why and respected the motive i will explain when i see you and then you will understand  we were 25 hours going to chicago we were there 24 hours we were 30 hours returning brisk work but all of it enjoyable we insisted on leaving the car at philadelphia so that our waiter and cook to whom mr r gave 10 apiece could have their christmaseve at home  mr rogerss carriage was waiting for us in jersey city and deposited me at the players therethats all this letter is to make up for the three letterless days i love you dear heart i love you all                                                                   saml     xxxiv letters 1894 a winter in new york business failure end of the machine  the beginning of the new year found mark twain sailing buoyantly on a tide of optimism he believed that with h h rogers as his financial pilot he could weather safely any storm or stress he could divert himself or rest or work and consider his business affairs with interest and amusement instead of with haggard anxiety he ran over to hartford to see an amateur play to boston to give a charity reading to fair haven to open the library which mr rogers had established there he attended gay dinners receptions and late studio parties acquiring the name of the belle of new york in the letters that follow we get the echo of some of these things the mrs rice mentioned in the next brief letter was the wife of dr clarence c rice who had introduced h h rogers to mark twain     to mrs clemens in paris                                               jan 12 94  livy darling i came down from hartford yesterday with kipling and he and hutton and i had the small smoking compartment to ourselves and found him at last at his ease and not shy he was very pleasant company indeed he is to be in the city a week and i wish i could invite him to dinner but it wont do i should be interrupted by business of course the construction of a contract that will suit paiges lawyer not paige turns out to be very difficult he is embarrassed by earlier advice to paige and hates to retire from it and stultify himself the negotiations are being conducted by means of tedious long telegrams and by talks over the longdistance telephone we keep the wires loaded  dear me dinner is ready so mrs rice says                           with worlds of love                                               saml   clemens and oliver wendell holmes had met and become friends soon after the publication of innocents abroad in 1869 now twentyfive years later we find a record of what without doubt was their last meeting it occurred at the home of mrs james t field     to mrs clemens in paris                                               boston jan 25 94  livy darling i am caught out worse this time than ever before in the matter of letters tuesday morning i was smart enough to finish and mail my long letter to you before breakfastfor i was suspecting that i would not have another spare moment during the day it turned out just so  in a thoughtless moment i agreed to come up here and read for the poor i did not reflect that it would cost me three days i could not get released yesterday i had myself called at 8 and ran out to mr rogerss house at 9 and talked business until half past 10 then caught 11 oclock train and arrived here at 6 was shaven and dressed by 7 and ready for dinner here in mrs fields charming house  dr oliver wendell holmes never goes out now he is in his 84th year but he came out this timesaid he wanted to have a time once more with me  mrs fields said aldrich begged to come and went away crying because she wouldnt let him she allowed only her family sarah orne jewett and sister to be present because much company would overtax dr holmes  well he was just delightful he did as brilliant and beautiful talking and listening as ever he did in his life i guess fields and jewett said he hadnt been in such splendid form in years he had ordered his carriage for 9  the coachman sent in for him at 9 but he said oh nonsenseleave glories and grandeurs like these tell him to go away and come in an hour  at 10 he was called for again and mrs fields getting uneasy rose but he wouldnt goand so we rattled ahead the same as ever twice more mrs fields rose but he wouldnt goand he didnt go till half past 10an unwarrantable dissipation for him in these days he was prodigiously complimentary about some of my books and is having puddnhead read to him i told him you and i used the autocrat as a courting book and marked it all through and that you keep it in the sacred green box with the love letters and it pleased him  goodbye my dear darling it is 15 minutes to dinner and im not dressed yet i have a reception tonight and will be out very late at that place and at irvings theatre where i have a complimentary box i wish you were all here                           saml        in the next letter we meet james j corbettgentleman jim as he      was sometimes calledthe champion pugilist of that day       the howells incident so amusingly dramatized will perhaps be more      appreciated if the reader remembers that mark twain himself had at      intervals been a mindhealing enthusiast  indeed in spite of his      strictures on mrs eddy his interest in the subject of mindcure      continued to the end of his life     to mrs clemens in paris                                                    sunday 930 a m  livy dear when we got out to the house last night mrs rogers who is up and around now didnt want to go down stairs to dinner but mr r persuaded her and we had a very good time indeed by 8 oclock we were down again and bought a fifteendollar box in the madison square garden rogers bought it not i then he went and fetched dr rice while i went to the players and picked up two artistsreid and simmonsand thus we filled 5 of the 6 seats there was a vast multitude of people in the brilliant place stanford white came along presently and invited me to go to the worldchampions dressing room which i was very glad to do corbett has a fine face and is modest and diffident besides being the most perfectly and beautifully constructed human animal in the world i said  you have whipped mitchell and maybe you will whip jackson in junebut you are not done then you will have to tackle me  he answered so gravely that one might easily have thought him in earnest  noi am not going to meet you in the ring it is not fair or right to require it you might chance to knock me out by no merit of your own but by a purely accidental blow and then my reputation would be gone and you would have a double one you have got fame enough and you ought not to want to take mine away from me  corbett was for a long time a clerk in the nevada bank in san francisco  there were lots of little boxing matches to entertain the crowd then at last corbett appeared in the ring and the 8000 people present went mad with enthusiasm my two artists went mad about his form they said they had never seen anything that came reasonably near equaling its perfection except greek statues and they didnt surpass it  corbett boxed 3 rounds with the middleweight australian championoh beautiful to seethen the show was over and we struggled out through a perfect wash of humanity when we reached the street i found i had left my arctics in the box i had to have them so simmons said he would go back and get them and i didnt dissuade him i couldnt see how he was going to make his way a single yard into that solid oncoming wave of peopleyet he must plow through it full 50 yards he was back with the shoes in 3 minutes  how do you reckon he accomplished that miracle by saying  way gentlemen pleasecoming to fetch mr corbetts overshoes  the word flew from mouth to mouth the red sea divided and simmons walked comfortably through and back dry shod simmons this was revealed to me under seal of secrecy by reid is the hero of gwen and he and gwens author were once engaged to marry this is fireescape simmons the inveterate talker you know exitin case of simmons  i had an engagement at a beautiful dwelling close to the players for 1030 i was there by 1045 thirty cultivated and very musical ladies and gentlemen presentall of them acquaintances and many of them personal friends of mine that wonderful hungarian band was there they charge 500 for an evening conversation and band until midnight then a bite of supper then the company was compactly grouped before me and i told about dr b e martin and the etchings and followed it with the scotchirish christening my but the martin is a darling story next the head tenor from the opera sang half a dozen great songs that set the company wild yes mad with delight that nobly handsome young damrosch accompanying on the piano  just a little pausethen the band burst out into an explosion of weird and tremendous dance music a hungarian celebrity and his wife took the floori followed i couldnt help it the others drifted in one by one and it was onteora over again  by half past 4 i had danced all those people downand yet was not tired merely breathless i was in bed at 5 and asleep in ten minutes up at 9 and presently at work on this letter to you i think i wrote until 2 or half past then i walked leisurely out to mr rogerss it is called 3 miles but it is short of it arriving at 330 but he was outto return at 530and a person was in whom i dont particularly likeso i didnt stay but dropped over and chatted with the howellses until 6  first howells and i had a chat together i asked about mrs h he said she was fine still steadily improving and nearly back to her old best health i asked as if i didnt know  what do you attribute this strange miracle to  mindcuresimply mindcure  lord what a conversion you were a scoffer three months ago  i i wasnt  you were you made elaborate fun of me in this very room  i did not clemens  its a lie howells you did  i detailed to him the conversation of that timewith the stately argument furnished by boyesen in the fact that a patient had actually been killed by a mindcurist and howellss own smart remark that when the mindcurist is done with you you have to call in a regular at last because the former cant procure you a burial permit  at last he gave inhe said he remembered that talk but had now been a mindcurist so long it was difficult for him to realize that he had ever been anything else  mrs h came skipping in presently the very person to a dot that she used to be so many years ago  mrs h said people may call it what they like but it is just hypnotism and thats all it ishypnotism pure and simple mindcurethe idea why this woman that cured me hasnt got any mind shes a good creature but shes dull and dumb and illiterate and  now eleanor  i know what im talking aboutdont i go there twice a week and mr clemens if you could only see her wooden and satisfied face when she snubs me for forgetting myself and showing by a thoughtless remark that to me weather is still weather instead of being just an abstraction and a superstitionoh its the funniest thing you ever saw andwhen she tilts up her nosewell itsitswell its that kind of a nose that  now eleanorthe woman is not responsible for her nose and soon and soon it didnt seem to me that i had any right to be having this feast and you not there  she convinced me before she got through that she and william james are righthypnotism and mindcure are the same thing no difference between them very well the very source the very center of hypnotism is paris dr charcots pupils and disciples are right there and ready to your hand without fetching poor dear old susy across the stormy sea let mrs mackay to whom i send my best respects tell you whom to go to to learn all you need to learn and how to proceed do do it honey dont lose a minute   at 11 oclock last night mr rogers said  i am

simmons distinguished painterthe latter a brilliant      fluent and industrious talker  the title fireescape simmons      which clemens gives him originated when oliver herford whose      quaint wit

meantime i hope to get a good picture of her to sign she was of the breakfast company yesterday but the picture of herself which she signed and gave me does not do her majestic beauty justice  i am too busy to attend to the photocollecting right because i have to live up to the name which jamie dodge has given methe belle of new yorkand it just keeps me rushing yesterday i had engagements to breakfast at noon dine at 3 and dine again at 7 i got away from the long breakfast at 2 p m went and excused myself from the 3 oclock dinner then lunched with mrs dodge in 58th street returned to the players and dressed dined out at 9 and was back at mrs dodges at 10 p m where we had magiclantern views of a superb sort and a lot of yarns until an hour after midnight and got to bed at 2 this morninga good deal of a gain on my recent hours but i dont get tired i sleep as sound as a dead person and always wake up fresh and strongusually at exactly 9  i was at breakfast lately where people of seven separate nationalities sat and the seven languages were going all the time at my side sat a charming gentleman who was a delightful and active talker and interesting he talked glibly to those folks in all those seven languages and still had a language to spare i wanted to kill him for very envy                 i greet you with love and kisses

a most delightful time until 4 this morning no ladies were invited this time among the people present were     coquelin    richard harding davis    harrison the great outdoor painter    wm h chase the artist    bettini inventor of the new phonograph    nikola tesla the worldwide illustrious electrician see article about    him in jan or feb century    john drew actor    james barnes a marvelous mimic my you should see him    smedley the artist    zorn the artist    zogbaum the artist    reinhart the artist    metcalf the artist    ancona head tenor at the opera  oh a great lot of others everybody there had done something and was in his way famous  somebody welcomed coquelin in a nice little french speech john drew did the like for me in english and then the fun began coquelin did some excellent french monologuesone of them an ungrammatical englishman telling a colorless historiette in french it nearly killed the fifteen or twenty people who understood it  i told a yarn ancona sang half a dozen songs barnes did his darling imitations harding davis sang the hanging of danny deever which was of course good but he followed it with that most fascinating for what reason i dont know of all kiplings poems on the road to mandalay sang it tenderly and it searched me deeper and charmed me more than the deever  young gerrit smith played some ravishing dance music and we all danced about an hour there couldnt be a pleasanter night than that one was some of those people complained of fatigue but i dont seem to know what the sense of fatigue is  coquelin talks quite good english now he said  i have a brother who has the fine mindah a charming and delicate fancy and he knows your writings so well and loves themand that is the same with me it will stir him so when i write and tell him i have seen you  wasnt that nice we talked a good deal together he is as winning as his own face but he wouldnt sign that photograph for clara that no she shall have a better one i will send it to you  he is much driven and will forget it but reid has promised to get the picture for me and i will try and keep him reminded  oh dear my time is all used up and your letters are not answered  mama dear i dont go everywherei decline most things but there are plenty that i cant well get out of  i will remember what you say and not make my yarning too common  i am so glad susy has gone on that trip and that you are trying the electric may you both prosper for you are mighty dear to me and in my thoughts always                                     saml        the affairs of the webster publishing company were by this time      getting into a very serious condition indeed  the effects of the      panic of the year before could not be overcome  creditors were      pressing their claims and profits were negligible  in the following      letter we get a mark twain estimate of the great financier who so      cheerfully was willing to undertake the solving of mark twains      financial problems     to mrs clemens in paris                                the players feb 15 94  1130 p m  livy darling yesterday i talked all my various matters over with mr rogers and we decided that it would be safe for me to leave here the 7th of march in the new york so his private secretary miss harrison wrote and ordered a berth for me and then i lost no time in cabling you that i should reach southampton march 14 and paris the 15th land but it made my pulses leap to think i was going to see you again one thing at a time i never fully laid websters disastrous condition before mr rogers until tonight after billiards i did hate to burden his good heart and overworked head with it but he took hold with avidity and said it was no burden to work for his friends but a pleasure we discussed it from various standpoints and found it a sufficiently difficult problem to solve but he thinks that after he has slept upon it and thought it over he will know what to suggest  you must not think i am ever rude with mr rogers i am not he is not common clay but finefine and delicateand that sort do not call out the coarsenesses that are in my sort i am never afraid of wounding him i do not need to watch myself in that matter the sight of him is peace  he wants to go to japanit is his dream wants to go with mewhich means the two familiesand hear no more about business for awhile and have a rest and he needs it but it is like all the dreams of all busy menfated to remain dreams  you perceive that he is a pleasant text for me it is easy to write about him when i arrived in september lord how black the prospect washow desperate how incurably desperate webster and co had to have a small sum of money or go under at once i flew to hartfordto my friendsbut they were not moved not strongly interested and i was ashamed that i went it was from mr rogers a stranger that i got the money and was by it saved and thenwhile still a strangerhe set himself the task of saving my financial life without putting upon me in his native delicacy any sense that i was the recipient of a charity a benevolenceand he has accomplished that task accomplished it at a cost of three months of wearing and difficult labor he gave that time to metime which could not be bought by any man at a hundred thousand dollars a monthno nor for three times the money  well in the midst of that great fight that long and admirable fight george warner came to me and said  there is a splendid chance open to you i know a mana prominent manwho has written a book that will go like wildfire a book that arraigns the standard oil fiends and gives them unmitigated hell individual by individual it is the very book for you to publish there is a fortune in it and i can put you in communication with the author  i wanted to say  the only man i care for in the world the only man i would give a damn for the only man who is lavishing his sweat and blood to save me and mine from starvation and shame is a standard oil fiend if you know me you know whether i want the book or not  but i didnt say that i said i didnt want any book i wanted to get out of the publishing business and out of all business and was here for that purpose and would accomplish it if i could  but theres enough i shall be asleep by 3 and i dont need much sleep because i am never drowsy or tired these days dear dear susy my strength reproaches me when i think of her and you my darling                                          saml        but even so able a man as henry rogers could not accomplish the      impossible  the affairs of the webster company were hopeless the      business was not worth saving  by mr rogerss advice an assignment      was made april 18 1894  after its early spectacular success less      than ten years had brought the business to failure  the publication      of the grant memoirs had been its only great achievement       clemens would seem to have believed that the business would resume      and for a time rogers appears to have comforted him in his hope but      we cannot believe that it long survived  young hall who had made      such a struggle for its salvation was eager to go on but he must      presently have seen the futility of any effort in that direction       of course the failure of mark twains firm made a great stir in the      country and it is easy to understand that loyal friends would rally      in his behalf     to mrs clemens in paris                                                         april 22 94  dear old darling we all think the creditors are going to allow us to resume business and if they do we shall pull through and pay the debts i am prodigiously glad we made an assignment and also glad that we did not make it sooner earlier we should have made a poor showing but now we shall make a good one  i meet flocks of people and they all shake me cordially by the hand and say i was so sorry to hear of the assignment but so glad you did it it was around this long time that the concern was tottering and all your friends were afraid you would delay the assignment too long  john mackay called yesterday and said dont let it disturb you samwe all have to do it at one time or another its nothing to be ashamed of  one stranger out in new york state sent me a dollar bill and thought he would like to get up a dollarsubscription for me and poultney bigelows note came promptly with his check for 1000 i had been meeting him every day at the club and liking him better and better all the time i couldnt take his money of course but i thanked him cordially for his good will  now and then a good and dear joe twichell or susy warner condoles with me and says cheer updont be downhearted and some other friend says i am glad and surprised to see how cheerful you are and how bravely you stand itand none of them suspect what a burden has been lifted from me and how blithe i am inside except when i think of you dear heartthen i am not blithe for i seem to see you grieving and ashamed and dreading to look people in the face for in the thick of the fight there is cheer but you are far away and cannot hear the drums nor see the wheeling squadrons you only seem to see rout retreat and dishonored colors dragging in the dirtwhereas none of these things exist there is temporary defeat but no dishonorand we will march again charley warner said today sho livy isnt worrying so long as shes got you and the children she doesnt care what happens she knows it isnt her affair which didnt convince me  good bye my darling i love you and all of the kidsand you can tell clara i am not a spitting gray kitten                                               saml        clemens sailed for europe as soon as his affairs would permit him      to go  he must get settled where he could work comfortably      typesetter prospects seemed promising but meantime there was      need of funds       he began writing on the ship as was his habit and had completed      his article on fenimore cooper by the time he reached london  in      august we find him writing to mr rogers from etretat a little      norman wateringplace     to h h rogers in new york                                               etretat normandie                                                    chalet des abris                                                         aug  25 94  dear mr rogersi find the madam ever so much better in health and strength the air is superb and soothing and wholesome and the chalet is remote from noise and people and just the place to write in i shall begin work this afternoon  mrs clemens is in great spirits on account of the benefit which she has received from the electrical treatment in paris and is bound to take it up again and continue it all the winter and of course i am perfectly willing she requires me to drop the lecture platform out of my mind and go straight ahead with joan until the book is finished if i should have to go home for even a week she means to go with mewont consent to be separated againbut she hopes i wont need to go  i tell her all right i wont go unless you send and then i must  she keeps the accounts and as she ciphers it we cant get crowded for money for eight months yet i didnt know that but i dont know much anyway                      sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        the reader may remember that clemens had written the first half of      his joan of arc book at the villa viviani in florence nearly two      years before  he had closed the manuscript then with the taking of      orleans and was by no means sure that he would continue the story      beyond that point  now however he was determined to reach the      tales tragic conclusion     to h h rogers in new york                                                         etretat                                                   sunday sept 9 94  dear mr rogers i drove the quill too hard and i broke downin my head it has now been three days since i laid up when i wrote you a week ago i had added 10000 words or thereabout to joan next day i added 1500 which was a proper enough days work though not a full one but during tuesday and wednesday i stacked up an aggregate of 6000 wordsand that was a very large mistake my head hasnt been worth a cent since  however theres a compensation for in those two days i reached and passedsuccessfullya point which i was solicitous about before i ever began the book viz the battle of patay because that would naturally be the next to the last chapter of a work consisting of either two books or one in the one case one goes right along from that point as i shall do now in the other he would add a windup chapter and make the book consist of joans childhood and military career alone  i shall resume work today and hereafter i will not go at such an intemperate rate my head is pretty cobwebby yet  i am hoping that along about this time i shall hear that the machine is beginning its test in the herald office i shall be very glad indeed to know the result of it i wish i could be there                      sincerely yours                               s l clemens        rouen where joan met her martyrdom was only a short distance away      and they halted there en route to paris where they had arranged to      spend the winter  the health of susy clemens was not good and they      lingered in rouen while clemens explored the old city and      incidentally did some writing of another sort  in a note to mr      rogers he said to put in my odd time i am writing some articles      about paul bourget and his outremer chapterslaughing at them and      at some of our oracular owls who find them important  what the hell      makes them important i should like to know       he was still at rouen two weeks later and had received encouraging      news from rogers concerning the typesetter which had been placed      for trial in the office of the chicago herald  clemens wrote i      can hardly keep from sending a hurrah by cable  i would certainly      do it if i wasnt superstitious  his restraint though wise was      wasted the end was near     to h h rogers in new york                                          169 rue de luniversite                                              paris dec 22 94  dear mr rogersi seemed to be entirely expecting your letter and also prepared and resigned but lord it shows how little we know ourselves and how easily we can deceive ourselves it hit me like a thunderclap it knocked every rag of sense out of my head and i went flying here and there and yonder not knowing what i was doing and only one clearly defined thought standing up visible and substantial out of the crazy stormdrift that my dream of ten years was in desperate peril and out of the 60000 or 90000 projects for its rescue that came floating through my skull not one would hold still long enough for me to examine it and size it up have you ever been like that not so much so i reckon  there was another clearly defined ideai must be there and see it die that is if it must die and maybe if i were there we might hatch up some nexttoimpossible way to make it take up its bed and take a walk  so at the end of four hours i started still whirling and walked over to the rue scribe4 p mand asked a question or two and was told i should be running a big risk if i took the 9 p m train for london and southampton better come right along at 652 per havre special and step aboard the new york all easy and comfortable very and i about two miles from home with no packing done  then it occurred to me that none of these salvationnotions that were whirlwinding through my head could be examined or made available unless at least a months time could be secured so i cabled you and said to myself that i would take the french steamer tomorrow which will be sunday  by bedtime mrs clemens had reasoned me into a fairly rational and contented state of mind but of course it didnt last long so i went on thinkingmixing it with a smoke in the dressing room once an houruntil dawn this morning resulta sane resolution no matter what your answer to my cable might be i would hold still and not sail until i should get an answer to this present letter which i am now writing or a cable answer from you saying come or remain  i have slept 6 hours my pond has clarified and i find the sediment of my 70000 projects to be of this character  several pages of suggestions for reconstructing the machine follow  dont say im wild for really im sane again this morning                           i am going right along with joan now and wait untroubled till i hear from you if you think i can be of the least use cable me come i can write joan on board ship and lose no time also i could discuss my plan with the publisher for a deluxe joan time being an object for some of the pictures could be made over here cheaply and quickly but would cost much time and money in america                           if the meeting should decide to quit business jan 4 id like to have stoker stopped from paying in any more money if miss harrison doesnt mind that disagreeable job and ill have to write them too of course                      with love                          s l clemens        the stoker of this letter was bram stoker long associated with      sir henry irving  irving himself had also taken stock in the      machine  the address 169 rue de luniversite whence these letters      are written was the beautiful studio home of the artist pomroy      which they had taken for the winter     to h h rogers in new york                                          169 rue de luniversite                                         paris dec 27 94  dear mr rogersnotwithstanding your heart is old and hard you make a body choke up i know you mean every word you say and i do take it in the same spirit in which you tender it i shall keep your regard while we two livethat i know for i shall always remember what you have done for me and that will insure me against ever doing anything that could forfeit it or impair it i am 59 years old yet i never had a friend before who put out a hand and tried to pull me ashore when he found me in deep waters  it is six days or seven days ago that i lived through that despairing day and then through a night without sleep then settled down next day into my right mind or thereabouts and wrote you i put in the rest of that day till 7 p m plenty comfortably enough writing a long chapter of my book then went to a masked ball blacked up as uncle remus taking clara along and we had a good time i have lost no day since and suffered no discomfort to speak of but drove my troubles out of my mind and had good success in keeping them outthrough watchfulness i have done a good weeks work and put the book a good way ahead in the great trial which is the difficult part which requires the most thought and carefulness i cannot see the end of the trial yet but i am on the road i am creeping surely toward it  why not leave them all to me my business bothers i take you by the hand i jump at the chance  i ought to be ashamed and i am trying my best to be ashamedand yet i do jump at the chance in spite of it i dont want to write irving and i dont want to write stoker it doesnt seem as if i could but i can suggest something for you to write them and then if you see that i am unwise you can write them something quite different now this is my idea       1  to return stokers 100 to him and keep his stock       2  and tell irving that when luck turns with me i will make good to      him what the salvage from the dead co fails to pay him of his 500   p s madam says no i must face the music so i enclose my effort to be used if you approve but not otherwise  there now if you will alter it to suit your judgment and bang away i shall be eternally obliged  we shall try to find a tenant for our hartford house not an easy matter for it costs heavily to live in we can never live in it again though it would break the familys hearts if they could believe it  nothing daunts mrs clemens or makes the world look black to herwhich is the reason i havent drowned myself  we all send our deepest and warmest greetings to you and all of yours and a happy new year                                s l clemens   enclosure  my dear stokeri am not dating this because it is not to be mailed at present  when it reaches you it will mean that there is a hitch in my machineenterprisea hitch so serious as to make it take to itself the aspect of a dissolved dream this letter then will contain cheque for the 100 which you have paid and will you tell irving for mei cant get up courage enough to talk about this misfortune myself except to you whom by good luck i havent damaged yet that when the wreckage presently floats ashore he will get a good deal of his 500 back and a dab at a time i will make up to him the rest  im not feeling as fine as i was when i saw you there in your home please remember me kindly to mrs stoker i gave up that london lectureproject entirely had totheres never been a chance since to find the time                      sincerely yours                                    s l clemens     xxxv letters 189596 to h h rogers and others finishing joan of arc the trip around the world death of susy clemens     to h h rogers in new york city                                                         no date  dear mr rogersyours of dec 21 has arrived containing the circular to stockholders and i guess the co will really quitthere doesnt seem to be any other wise course  theres one thing which makes it difficult for me to soberly realize that my ten year dream is actually dissolved and that is that it reveries my horoscope the proverb says born lucky always lucky and i am very superstitious as a small boy i was notoriously lucky it was usual for one or two of our lads per annum to get drowned in the mississippi or in bear creek but i was pulled out in a 23 drowned condition 9 times before i learned to swim and was considered to be a cat in disguise when the pennsylvania blew up and the telegraph reported my brother as fatally injured with 60 others but made no mention of me my uncle said to my mother it means that sam was somewhere else after being on that boat a year and a halfhe was born lucky yes i was somewhere else i am so superstitious that i have always been afraid to have business dealings with certain relatives and friends of mine because they were unlucky people all my life i have stumbled upon lucky chances of large size and whenever they were wasted it was because of my own stupidity and carelessness and so i have felt entirely certain that that machine would turn up trumps eventually it disappointed me lots of times but i couldnt shake off the confidence of a lifetime in my luck  well whatever i get out of the wreckage will be due to good luckthe good luck of getting you into the schemefor but for that there wouldnt be any wreckage it would be total loss  i wish you had been in at the beginning then we should have had the good luck to step promptly ashore  miss harrison has had a dream which promises me a large bank account and i want her to go ahead and dream it twice more so as to make the prediction sure to be fulfilled  ive got a first rate subject for a book it kept me awake all night and i began it and completed it in my mind the minute i finish joan i will take it up                 love and happy new year to you all                          sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        this was about the end of the machine interests so far as clemens      was concerned  paige succeeded in getting some new people      interested but nothing important happened or that in any way      affected mark twain  characteristically he put the whole matter      behind him and plunged into his work facing comparative poverty and      a burden of debts with a stout heart  the beginning of the new year      found him really poorer in purse than he had ever been in his life      but certainly not crushed or even discouragedat least not      permanentlyand never more industrious or capable     to h h rogers in new york city                                          169 rue de

deliberate holiday since i had the gout on the first holiday i wrote a tale of about 6000 words which was 3 days work in one and this time i did 8000 before midnight i got nothing out of that first holiday but the recreation of it for i condemned the work after careful reading and some revision but this time i fared betteri finished the huck finn tale that lies in your safe and am satisfied with it  the bacheller syndicate 117 tribune building want a story of 5000 words lowest limit of their london agent for 1000 and offer to plank the check on delivery and it was partly to meet that demand that i took that other holiday so as i have no short story that suits me and cant and shant make promises the best i can do is to offer the longer one which i finished on my second holidaytom sawyer detective  it makes 27 or 28000 words and is really written for grown folks though i expect young folk to read it too it transfers to the banks of the mississippi the incidents of a strange murder which was committed in sweden in old times  ill refer applicants for a sight of the story to you or miss harrisonsecretary to mr rogers                           yours sincerely

felicitous delightful letter of the 15th arrived three days ago and brought great pleasure into the house  there is one thing that weighs heavily on mrs clemens and me that is brusnahans money if he is satisfied to have it invested in the chicago enterprise well and good if not we would like to have the money paid back to him i will give him as many months to decide in as he pleaseslet him name 6 or 10 or 12and we will let the money stay where it is in your hands till the time is up will miss harrison tell him so i mean if you approve i would like him to have a good investment but would meantime prefer to protect him against loss  at 6 minutes past 7 yesterday evening joan of arc was burned at the stake  with the long strain gone i am in a sort of physical collapse today but it will be gone tomorrow i judged that this end of the book would be hard work and it turned out so i have never done any work before that cost so much thinking and weighing and measuring and planning and cramming or so much cautious and painstaking execution for i wanted the whole rouen trial in if it could be got in in such a way that the readers interest would not flagin fact i wanted the readers interest to increase and so i stuck to it with that determination in viewwith the result that i have left nothing out but unimportant repetitions although it is mere historyhistory pure and simplehistory stripped naked of flowers embroideries colorings exaggerations inventionthe family agree that i have succeeded it was a perilous thing to try in a tale but i never believed it a doubtful oneprovided i stuck strictly to business and didnt weaken and give up or didnt get lazy and skimp the work the first twothirds of the book were easy for i only needed to keep my historical road straight therefore i used for reference only one french history and one english oneand shoveled in as much fancy work and invention on both sides of the historical road as i pleased but on this last third i have constantly used five french sources and five english ones and i think no telling historical nugget in any of them has escaped me  possibly the book may not sell but that is nothingit was written for love  thereim called to see company the family seldom require this of me but they know i am not working today                           yours sincerely                                    s l clemens        brusnahan of the foregoing letter was an employee of the new      york herald superintendent of the pressroomwho had invested some      of his savings in the typesetter       in february clemens returned to new york to look after matters      connected with his failure and to close arrangements for a      readingtour around the world  he was nearly sixty years old and      time had not lessened his loathing for the platform  more than      once however in earlier years he had turned to it as a      debtpayer and never yet had his burden been so great as now  he      concluded arrangements with major pond to take him as far as the      pacific coast and with r s smythe of australia for the rest of      the tour  in april we find him once more back in paris preparing      to bring the family to america he had returned by way of london      where he had visited stanley the exploreran old friend     to h h rogers in new york city                                               169 rue de luniversite                                                   sunday apr795  dear mr rogers stanley is magnificently housed in london in a grand mansion in the midst of the official world right off downing street and whitehall he had an extraordinary assemblage of brains and fame there to meet methirty or forty both sexes at dinner and more than a hundred came in after dinner kept it up till after midnight there were cabinet ministers ambassadors admirals generals canons oxford professors novelists playwrights poets and a number of people equipped with rank and brains i told some yarns and made some speeches i promised to call on all those people next time i come to london and show them the wife and the daughters if i were younger and very strong i would dearly love to spend a season in londonprovided i had no work on hand or no work more exacting than lecturing i think i will lecture there a month or two when i return from australia  there were many delightful ladies in that company one was the wife of his excellency admiral bridge commanderin chief of the australian station and she said her husband was able to throw wide all doors to me in that part of the world and would be glad to do it and would yacht me and my party around and excursion us in his flagship and make us have a great time and she said she would write him we were coming and we would find him ready i have a letter from her this morning enclosing a letter of introduction to the admiral i already know the admiral commanding in the china seas and have promised to look in on him out there he sleeps with my books under his pillow praps it is the only way he can sleep  according to mrs clemenss present planssubject to modification of coursewe sail in may stay one day or two days in new york spend june july and august in elmira and prepare my lectures then lecture in san francisco and thereabouts during september and sail for australia before the middle of october and open the show there about the middle of november we dont take the girls along it would be too expensive and they are quite willing to remain behind anyway  mrs c is feeling so well that she is not going to try the new york doctor till we have gone around the world and robbed it and made the finances a little easier                      with a power of love to you all                                    s l clemens        there would come moments of depression of course and a week later      he wrote i am tired to death all the time  to a man of less      vitality less vigor of mind and body it is easy to believe that      under such circumstances this condition would have remained      permanent  but perhaps after all it was his comic outlook on      things in general that was his chief lifesaver     to h h rogers in new york city                                169 rue de luniversite apr 29 95  dear mr rogersi have been hidden an hour or two reading proof of joan and now i think i am a lost child i cant find anybody on the place the baggage has all disappeared including the family i reckon that in the hurry and bustle of moving to the hotel they forgot me but it is no matter it is peacefuller now than i have known it for days and days and days  in these joan proofs which i have been reading for the september harper i find a couple of tiptop platform readingsand i mean to read them on our trip if the authorship is known by then and if it isnt i will reveal it the fact is there is more good platformstuff in joan than in any previous book of mine by a long sight  yes every danged member of the tribe has gone to the hotel and left me lost i wonder how they can be so careless with property i have got to try to get there by myself now  all the trunks are going over as luggage then ive got to find somebody on the dock who will agree to ship 6 of them to the hartford customhouse if it is difficult i will dump them into the river it is very careless of mrs clemens to trust trunks and things to me                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        by the latter part of may they were at quarry farm and clemens      laid up there with a carbuncle was preparing for his long tour      the outlook was not a pleasant one  to mr rogers he wrote i      shant be able to stand on the platform before we start west  i      shant get a single chance to practice my reading but will have to      appear in cleveland without the essential preparation  nothing in      this world can save it from being a shabby poor disgusting      performance  ive got to stand i cant do it and talk to a house      and how in the nation am i going to sit  land of goshen its this      night week  pray for me       the opening at cleveland july 15th appears not to have been much of      a success though from another reason one that doubtless seemed      amusing to him later     to h h rogers in new york city                                                         forenoon                                              cleveland july 16 95  dear mr rogershad a roaring success at the elmira reformatory sunday night but here last night i suffered defeatthere were a couple of hundred little boys behind me on the stage on a lofty tier of benches which made them the most conspicuous objects in the house and there was nobody to watch them or keep them quiet why with their scufflings and horseplay and noise it was just a menagerie besides a concert of amateurs had been smuggled into the program to precede me and their families and friends say ten per cent of the audience kept encoring them and they always responded so it was 20 minutes to 9 before i got the platform in front of those 2600 people who had paid a dollar apiece for a chance to go to hell in this fashion  i got started magnificently but inside of half an hour the scuffling boys had the audiences maddened attention and i saw it was a gone case so i skipped a third of my program and quit the newspapers are kind but between you and me it was a defeat there aint going to be any more concerts at my lectures i care nothing for this defeat because it was not my fault my first half hour showed that i had the house and i could have kept it if i hadnt been so handicapped                           yours sincerely                                    s l clemens  p s had a satisfactory time at petoskey crammed the house and turned away a crowd we had 548 in the house which was 300 more than it had ever had in it before i believe i dont care to have a talk go off better than that one did        mark twain on this long tour was accompanied by his wife and his      daughter clarasusy and jean clemens remaining with their aunt at      quarry farm  the tour was a financial success from the start      by the time they were ready to sail from vancouver five thousand      dollars had been remitted to mr rogers against that day of      settlement when the debts of webster  co were to be paid  perhaps      it should be stated here that a legal settlement had been arranged      on a basis of fifty cents on the dollar but neither clemens nor his      wife consented to this as final  they would pay in full       they sailed from vancouver august 23 1895  about the only letter      of this time is an amusing note to rudyard kipling written at the      moment of departure     to rudyard kipling in england                                                         august 1895  dear kiplingit is reported that you are about to visit india this has moved me to journey to that far country in order that i may unload from my conscience a debt long due to you years ago you came from india to elmira to visit me as you said at the time it has always been my purpose to return that visit and that great compliment some day i shall arrive next january and you must be ready i shall come riding my ayah with his tusks adorned with silver bells and ribbons and escorted by a troop of native howdahs richly clad and mounted upon a herd of wild bungalows and you must be on hand with a few bottles of ghee for i shall be thirsty                           affectionately                               s l clemens        clemens platforming in australia was too busy to write letters      everywhere he was welcomed by great audiences and everywhere      lavishly entertained  he was beset by other carbuncles but would      seem not to have been seriously delayed by them  a letter to his      old friend twichell carries the story     to rev jos h twichell in hartford                                     frank moellers masonic hotel                                              napier new zealand                                                   november 29 95  dear joeyour welcome letter of two months and five days ago has just arrived and finds me in bed with another carbuncle it is no 3 not a serious one this time i lectured last night without inconvenience but the doctors thought best to forbid tonights lecture my second one kept me in bed a week in melbourne   we are all glad it is you who is to write the article it delights us all through  i think it was a good stroke of luck that knocked me on my back here at napier instead of some hotel in the centre of a noisy city here we have the smooth and placidlycomplaining sea at our door with nothing between us and it but 20 yards of shingleand hardly a suggestion of life in that space to mar it or make a noise away down here fiftyfive degrees south of the equator this sea seems to murmur in an unfamiliar tonguea foreign tonguetongue bred among the icefields of the antarctica murmur with a note of melancholy in it proper to the vast unvisited solitudes it has come from it was very delicious and solacing to wake in the night and find it still pulsing there i wish you were hereland but it would be fine  livy and clara enjoy this nomadic life pretty well certainly better than one could have expected they would they have tough experiences in the way of food and beds and frantic little ships but they put up with the worst that befalls with heroic endurance that resembles contentment  no doubt i shall be on the platform next monday a week later we shall reach wellington talk there 3 nights then sail back to australia we sailed for new zealand october 30  day before yesterday was livys birthday under world time and tomorrow will be mine i shall be 60no thanks for it  i and the others send worlds and worlds of love to all you dear ones                                     mark        the article mentioned in the foregoing letter was one which twichell      had been engaged by harpers magazine to write concerning the home      life and characteristics of mark twain  by the time the clemens      party had completed their tour of indiaa splendid triumphant      tour too full of work and recreation for letterwritingand had      reached south africa the article had appeared a satisfactory one      if we may judge by mark twains next       this letter however has a special interest in the account it gives      of mark twains visit to the jameson raiders then imprisoned at      pretoria     to rev jos h twichell in hartford                                     pretoria south african republic                                         the queens birthday 96                                                        may 24  dear old joeharper for may was given to me yesterday in johannesburg by an american lady who lives there and i read your article on me while coming up in the train with her and an old friend and fellowmissourian of mine mrs john hays hammond the handsome and spirited wife of the chief of the 4 reformers who lies in prison here under a 15year sentence along with 50 minor reformers who are in for 1 and 5year terms thank you a thousand times joe you have praised me away above my deserts but i am not the man to quarrel with you for that and as for livy she will take your very hardiest statements at par and be grateful to you to the bottom of her heart between you and punch and brander matthews i am like to have my opinion of myself raised sufficiently high and i guess the children will be after you for it is the study of their lives to keep my selfappreciation down somewhere within bounds  i had a note from mrs rev gray nee tyler yesterday and called on her today she is well  yesterday i was allowed to enter the prison with mrs hammond a boer guard was at my elbow all the time but was courteous and polite only he barred the way in the compound quadrangle or big open court and wouldnt let me cross a white mark that was on the groundthe deathline one of the prisoners called it not in earnest though i think i found that i had met hammond once when he was a yale senior and a guest of gen franklins i also found that i had known capt mein intimately 32 years ago one of the english prisoners had heard me lecture in london 23 years ago after being introduced in turn to all the prisoners i was allowed to see some of the cells and examine their food beds etc i was told in johannesburg that hammonds salary of 150000 a year is not stopped and that the salaries of some of the others are still continued hammond was looking very well indeed and i can say the same of all the others when the trouble first fell upon them it hit some of them very hard several fell sick hammond among them two or three had to be removed to the hospital and one of the favorites lost his mind and killed himself poor fellow last week his funeral with a sorrowing following of 10000 took the place of the public demonstration the americans were getting up for me  these prisoners are strong men prominent men and i believe they are all educated men they are well off some of them are wealthy they have a lot of books to read they play games and smoke and for awhile they will be able to bear up in their captivity but not for long not for very long i take it i am told they have times of deadly brooding and depression i made them a speechsitting down it just happened so i dont prefer that attitude still it has one advantageit is only a talk it doesnt take the form of a speech i have tried it once before on this trip however if a body wants to make sure of having liberty and feeling at home he had better stand up of course i advised them at considerable length to stay where they werethey would get used to it and like it presently if they got out they would only get in again somewhere else by the look of their countenances and i promised to go and see the president and do what i could to get him to double their jailterms  we had a very good sociable time till the permitted time was up and a little over and we outsiders had to go i went again today but the rev mr gray had just arrived and the warden a genial elderly boer named du plessisexplained that his orders wouldnt allow him to admit saint and sinner at the same time particularly on a sunday du plessisdescended from the huguenot fugitives you see of 200 years agobut he hasnt any french left in him nowall dutch  it gravels me to think what a goose i was to make livy and clara remain in durban but i wanted to save them the 30hour railway trip to johannesburg and durban and its climate and opulent foliage were so lovely and the friends there were so choice and so hearty that i sacrificed myself in their interests as i thought it is just the beginning of winter and although the days are hot the nights are cool but its lovely weather in these regions too and the friends are as lovely as the weather and johannesburg and pretoria are brimming with interest i talk here twice more then return to johannesburg next wednesday for a fifth talk there then to the orange free state capital then to some town on the way to port elizabeth where the two will join us by sea from durban then the gang will go to kimberley and presently to the capeand so in the course of time we shall get through and sail for england and then we will hunt up a quiet village and i will write and livy edit for a few months while clara and susy and jean study music and things in london  we have had noble good times everywhere and every day from cleveland july 15 to pretoria may 24 and never a dull day either on sea or land notwithstanding the carbuncles and things even when i was laid up 10 days at jeypore in india we had the charmingest times with english friends all over india the english well you will never know how good and fine they are till you see them  midnight and after and i must do many things today and lecture tonight  a world of thanks to you joe dear and a world of love to all of you                                               mark        perhaps for readers of a later day a word as to what constituted the      jameson raid would not be out of place here  dr leander starr      jameson was an english physician located at kimberley  president      kruger oom paul head of the south african republic was one of      his patients also lobengula the matabele chief  from lobengula      concessions were obtained which led to the formation of the south      african company  jameson gave up his profession and went in for      conquest associating himself with the projects of cecil rhodes      in time he became administrator of rhodesia  by the end of 1894      he was in high feather and during a visit to england was feted as      a sort of romantic conqueror of the olden time  perhaps this turned      his head at all events at the end of 1895 came the startling news      that dr jim as he was called at the head of six hundred men      had ridden into the transvaal in support of a rhodes scheme for an      uprising at johannesburg  the raid was a failure  jameson and      those other knights of adventure were captured by the forces of      oom paul and some of them barely escaped execution  the boer      president handed them over to the english government for punishment      and they received varying sentences but all were eventually      released  jameson later became again prominent in southafrican      politics but there is no record of any further raids                              the clemens party sailed from south africa the middle of july 1896      and on the last day of the month reached england  they had not      planned to return to america but to spend the winter in or near      london in some quiet place where clemens could write the book of his      travels       the two daughters in america susy and jean were expected to arrive      august 12th but on that day there came instead a letter saying      that susy clemens was not well enough to sail  a cable inquiry was      immediately sent but the reply when it came was not satisfactory      and mrs clemens and clara sailed for america without further delay      this was on august 15th  three days later in the old home at      hartford susy clemens died of cerebral fever  she had been      visiting mrs charles dudley warner but by the physicians advice      had been removed to the comfort and quiet of her own home only a      few steps away       mark twain returning from his triumphant tour of the world in the      hope that soon now he might be free from debt with his family      happily gathered about him had to face alone this cruel blow      there was no purpose in his going to america susy would be buried      long before his arrival  he awaited in england the return of his      broken family  they lived that winter in a quiet corner of chelsea      no 23 tedworth square     to rev joseph h twichell in hartford conn                                          permanent address

unmatchable self it was no surprise to me to learn that you stayed by susy long hours careless of fatigue and heat it was no surprise to me to learn that you could still the storms that swept her spirit when no other could for she loved you revered you trusted you and uncle joe was no empty phrase upon her lips i am grateful to you joe grateful to the bottom of my heart which has always been filled with love for you and respect and admiration and i would have chosen you out of all the world to take my place at susys side and livys in those black hours  susy was a rare creature the rarest that has been reared in hartford in this generation and livy knew it and you knew it and charley warner and george and harmony and the hillyers and the dunhams and the cheneys and susy and lilly and the bunces and henry robinson and dick burton and perhaps others and i also was of the number but not in the same degreefor she was above my duller comprehension i merely knew that she was my superior in fineness of mind in the delicacy and subtlety of her intellect but to fully measure her i was not competent i know her better now for i have read her private writings and sounded the deeps of her mind and i know better now the treasure that was mine than i knew it when i had it but i have this consolation that dull as i was i always knew enough to be proud when she commended me or my workas proud as if livy had done it herselfand i took it as the accolade from the hand of genius i see nowas livy always sawthat she had greatness in her and that she herself was dimly conscious of it  and now she is deadand i can never tell her  god bless you joeand all of your house                                               s l c     to mr henry c robinson hartford conn                                               london sept  28 96  it is as you say dear old friend the pathos of it yes it was a piteous thingas piteous a tragedy as any the year can furnish when we started westward upon our long trip at half past ten at night july 14 1895 at elmira susy stood on the platform in the blaze of the electric light waving her goodbyes to us as the train glided away her mother throwing back kisses and watching her through her tears one year one month and one week later clara and her mother having exactly completed the circuit of the globe drew up at that platform at the same hour of the night in the same train and the same carand again susy had come a journey and was near at hand to meet them she was waiting in the house she was born in in her coffin  all the circumstances of this death were patheticmy brain is worn to rags rehearsing them the mere death would have been cruelty enough without overloading it and emphasizing it with that score of harsh and wanton details the child was taken away when her mother was within three days of her and would have given three decades for sight of her  in my despair and unassuageable misery i upbraid myself for ever parting with her but there is no use in that since it was to happen it would have happened                           with love                                         s l c        the life at tedworth square that winter was one of almost complete      privacy  of the hundreds of friends which mark twain had in london      scarcely half a dozen knew his address  he worked steadily on his      book of travels following the equator and wrote few letters      beyond business communications to mr rogers  in one of these he      said i am appalled  here i am trying to load you up with work      again after you have been drayhorsing over the same tiresome ground      for a year  its too bad and i am ashamed of it       but late in november he sent a letter of a different sortone that      was to have an important bearing on the life of a girl today of      unique and worldwide distinction     to mrs h h rogers in new york city  for and in behalf of helen keller stone blind and deaf and formerly dumb  dear mrs rogersexperience has convinced me that when one wishes to set a hardworked man at something which he mightnt prefer to be bothered with it is best to move upon him behind his wife if she cant convince him it isnt worth while for other people to try  mr rogers will remember our visit with that astonishing girl at lawrence huttons house when she was fourteen years old last july in boston when she was 16 she underwent the harvard examination for admission to radcliffe college she passed without a single condition she was allowed the same amount of time that is granted to other applicants and this was shortened in her case by the fact that the question papers had to be read to her yet she scored an average of 90 as against an average of 78 on the part of the other applicants  it wont do for america to allow this marvelous child to retire from her studies because of poverty if she can go on with them she will make a fame that will endure in history for centuries along her special lines she is the most extraordinary product of all the ages  there is danger that she must retire from the struggle for a college degree for lack of support for herself and for miss sullivan the teacher who has been with her from the startmr rogers will remember her mrs hutton writes to ask me to interest rich englishmen in her case and i would gladly try but my secluded life will not permit it i see nobody nobody knows my address nothing but the strictest hiding can enable me to write my long book in time  so i thought of this scheme beg you to lay siege to your husband and get him to interest himself and mess john d and william rockefeller and the other standard oil chiefs in helens case get them to subscribe an annual aggregate of six or seven hundred or a thousand dollarsand agree to continue this for three or four years until she has completed her college course im not trying to limit their generosityindeed no they may pile that standard oil helen keller college fund as high as they please they have my consent  mrs huttons idea is to raise a permanent fund the interest upon which shall support helen and her teacher and put them out of the fear of want i shant say a word against it but she will find it a difficult and disheartening job and meanwhile what is to become of that miraculous girl  no for immediate and sound effectiveness the thing is for you to plead with mr rogers for this hampered wonder of your sex and send him clothed with plenary powers to plead with the other chiefsthey have spent mountains of money upon the worthiest benevolences and i think that the same spirit which moved them to put their hands down through their hearts into their pockets in those cases will answer here when its name is called in this one 638  therei dont need to apologize to you or to h h for this appeal that i am making i know you too well for that  goodbye with love to all of you                                     s l clemens  laurence hutton is on the staff of harpers monthlyclose by and handy when wanted        the plea was not made in vain  mr and mrs rogers interested      themselves most liberally in helen kellers fortune and certainly      no one can say that any of those who contributed to her success ever      had reason for disappointment       in his letter of grateful acknowledgment which follows clemens      also takes occasion to thank mr rogers for his further efforts in      the matter of his own difficulties  this particular reference      concerns the publishing complications which by this time had arisen      between the american publishing company of hartford and the house      in franklin square                                                london dec  22 96  dear mrs rogersit is superb and i am beyond measure grateful to you both i knew you would be interested in that wonderful girl and that mr rogers was already interested in her and touched by her and i was sure that if nobody else helped her you two would but you have gone far and away beyond the sum i expectedmay your lines fall in pleasant places here and hereafter for it  the huttons are as glad and grateful as they can be and i am glad for their sakes as well as for helens  i want to thank mr rogers for crucifying himself again on the same old cross between bliss and harper and goodness knows i hope he will come to enjoy it above all other dissipations yet seeing that it has about it the elements of stability and permanency however at any time that he says sign were going to do it                           ever sincerely yours                                         s l clemens     xxxvi letters 1897 london switzerland vienna       mark twain worked steadily on his book that sad winter and      managed to keep the gloom out of his chapters though it is      noticeable that following the equator is more serious than      his other books of travel he wrote few letters and these      only to his three closest friends howells twichell and      rogers  in the letter to twichell which follows there is      mention of two unfinished manuscripts which he expects to      resume  one of these was a dream story enthusiastically      begun but perhaps with insufficient plot to carry it      through for it never reached conclusion  he had already      tried it in one or two forms and would begin it again      presently  the identity of the other tale is uncertain     to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               london jan 19 97  dear joedo i want you to write to me indeed i do i do not want most people to write but i do want you to do it the others break my heart but you will not you have a something divine in you that is not in other men you have the touch that heals not lacerates and you know the secret places of our hearts you know our lifethe outside of itas the others doand the inside of itwhich they do not you have seen our whole voyage you have seen us go to sea a cloud of sailand the flag at the peak and you see us now chartless adriftderelicts battered waterlogged our sails a ruck of rags our pride gone for it is gone and there is nothing in its place the vanity of life was all we had and there is no more vanity left in us we are even ashamed of that we had ashamed that we trusted the promises of life and builded highto come to this  i did know that susy was part of us i did not know that she could go away i did not know that she could go away and take our lives with her yet leave our dull bodies behind and i did not know what she was to me she was but treasure in the bank the amount known the need to look at it daily handle it weigh it count it realize it not necessary and now that i would do it it is too late they tell me it is not there has vanished away in a night the bank is broken my fortune is gone i am a pauper how am i to comprehend this how am i to have it why am i robbed and who is benefited  ah well susy died at home she had that privilege her dying eyes rested upon nothing that was strange to them but only upon things which they had known and loved always and which had made her young years glad and she had you and sue and katy and john and ellen this was happy fortunei am thankful that it was vouchsafed to her if she had died in another housewell i think i could not have borne that to us our house was not unsentient matterit had a heart and a soul and eyes to see us with and approvals and solicitudes and deep sympathies it was of us and we were in its confidence and lived in its grace and in the peace of its benediction we never came home from an absence that its face did not light up and speak out its eloquent welcomeand we could not enter it unmoved and could we now oh now in spirit we should enter it unshod  i am trying to add to the assets which you estimate so generously no i am not the thought is not in my mind my purpose is other i am working but it is for the sake of the workthe surcease of sorrow that is found there i work all the days and trouble vanishes away when i use that magic this book will not long stand between it and me now but that is no matter i have many unwritten books to fly to for my preservation the interval between the finishing of this one and the beginning of the next will not be more than an hour at most continuances i mean for two of them are already well alongin fact have reached exactly the same stage in their journey 19000 words each the present one will contain 180000 words130000 are done i am well protected but livy she has nothing in the world to turn to nothing but housekeeping and doing things for the children and me she does not see people and cannot books have lost their interest for her she sits solitary and all the day and all the days wonders how it all happened and why we others were always busy with our affairs but susy was her comradehad to be driven from her loving persecutionssometimes at 1 in the morning to livy the persecutions were welcome it was heaven to her to be plagued like that but it is ended now livy stands so in need of help and none among us all could help her like you  some day you and i will walk again joe and talk i hope so we could have such talks we are all grateful to you and harmonyhow grateful it is not given to us to say in words we pay as we can in love and in this coin practicing no economy                           good bye dear old joe                                                   mark        the letters to mr rogers were for the most part on matters of      business but in one of them he said i am going to write with all      my might on this book and follow it up with others as fast as i can      in the hope that within three years i can clear out the stuff that      is in me waiting to be written and that i shall then die in the      promptest kind of a way and no fooling around  and in one he      wrote you are the best friend ever a man had and the surest

so daringly uttered and so warmly the words stir the dead heart of me and throw a glow of color into a life which sometimes seems to have grown wholly wan i dont mean that i am miserable noworse than thatindifferent indifferent to nearly everything but work i like that i enjoy it and stick to it i do it without purpose and without ambition merely for the love of it  this mood will pass some daythere is history for it but it cannot pass until my wife comes up out of the submergence she was always so quick to recover herself before but now there is no rebound and we are dead people who go through the motions of life indeed i am a mud image and it will puzzle me to know what it is in me that writes and has comedyfancies and finds pleasure in phrasing them it is a law of our nature of course or it wouldnt happen the thing in me forgets the presence of the mud image and goes its own way wholly unconscious of it and apparently of no kinship with it i have finished my book but i go on as if the end were indefinitely awayas indeed it is there is no hurryat any rate there is no limit  jeans spirits are good claras are rising they have youththe only thing that was worth giving to the race  these are sardonic times look at greece and that whole shabby muddle but i am not sorry to be alive and privileged to look on if i were not a hermit i would go to the house every day and see those people scuffle over it and blether about the brotherhood of the human race this has been a bitter year for english pride and i dont like to see england humbledthat is not too much we are sprung from her loins and it hurts me i am for republics and she is the only comrade weve got in that we cant count france and there is hardly enough of switzerland to count beneath the governing crust england is soundheartedand sincere too and nearly straight but i am appalled to notice that the wide extension of the surface has damaged her manners and made her rather americanly uncourteous on the lower levels  wont you give our love to the howellses all and particular                           sincerely yours                                         s l clemens        the travelbook did not finish easily and more than once when he      thought it completed he found it necessary to cut and add and      change  the final chapters were not sent to the printer until the      middle of may and in a letter to mr rogers he commented a      successful book is not made of what is in it but what is left out      of it  clemens was at the time contemplating a uniform edition of      his books and in one of his letters to mr rogers on the matter he      wrote whimsically now i was proposing to make a thousand sets at      a hundred dollars a set and do the whole canvassing myself  i      would load up every important jail and saloon in america with de      luxe editions of my books  but mrs clemens and the children object      to this i do not know why  and in a moment of depression you      see the lightning refuses to strike methere is where the defect      is  we have to do our own striking as barney barnato did  but      nobody ever gets the courage until he goes crazy       they went to switzerland for the summer to the village of weggis on      lake lucernethe charmingest place we ever lived in he declared      for repose and restfulness and superb scenery  it was here that      he began work on a new story of tom and huck and at least upon one      other manuscript  from a brief note to mr rogers we learn      something of his employments and economies     to henry h rogers in new york                           lucerne august the something or other 1897  dear mr rogersi am writing a novel and am getting along very well with it  i believe that this place weggis half an hour from lucerne is the loveliest in the world and the most satisfactory we have a small house on the hillside all to ourselves and our meals are served in it from the inn below on the lake shore six francs a day per head house and food included the scenery is beyond comparison beautiful we have a row boat and some bicycles and good roads and no visitors nobody knows we are here and sunday in heaven is noisy compared to this quietness                           sincerely yours                                         s l c     to rev j h twichell in hartford

lovely time with him and such intellectual refreshment as we had not tasted in many a month  and the other night we had a detachment of the jubilee singers6 i had known one of them in london 24 years ago three of the 6 were born in slavery the others were children of slaves how charming they werein spirit manner language pronunciation enunciation grammar phrasing matter carriage clothesin every detail that goes to make the real lady and gentleman and welcome guest we went down to the village hotel and bought our tickets and entered the beerhall where a crowd of german and swiss men and women sat grouped at round tables with their beer mugs in front of themselfcontained and unimpressionable looking people an indifferent and unposted and disheartened audienceand up at the far end of the room sat the jubilees in a row the singers got up and stoodthe talking and glass jingling went on then rose and swelled out above those common earthly sounds one of those rich chords the secret of whose make only the jubilees possess and a spell fell upon that house it was fine to see the faces light up with the pleased wonder and surprise of it no one was indifferent any more and when the singers finished the camp was theirs it was a triumph it reminded me of launcelot riding in sir kays armor and astonishing complacent knights who thought they had struck a soft thing the jubilees sang a lot of pieces arduous and painstaking cultivation has not diminished or artificialized their music but on the contraryto my surprisehas mightily reinforced its eloquence and beauty away back in the beginningto my mindtheir music made all other vocal music cheap and that early notion is emphasized now it is utterly beautiful to me and it moves me infinitely more than any other music can i think that in the jubilees and their songs america has produced the perfectest flower of the ages and i wish it were a foreign product so that she would worship it and lavish money on it and go properly crazy over it  now these countries are different they would do all that if it were native it is true they praise god but that is merely a formality and nothing in it they open out their whole hearts to no foreigner  the musical critics of the german press praise the jubilees with great enthusiasmacquired technique etc included  one of the jubilee men is a son of general joe johnson and was educated by him after the war the party came up to the house and we had a pleasant time  this is paradise herebut of course we have got to leave it by and by the 18th of augustanniversary of susy clemenss deathhas come and gone joeand we still seem to live                           with love from us all                                                   mark        clemens declared he would as soon spend his life in weggis as      anywhere else in the geography but october found them in vienna      for the winter at the hotel metropole  the austrian capital was      just then in a political turmoil the character of which is hinted      in the following     to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               hotel metropole                                                   vienna oct 23 97  dear joewe are gradually getting settled down and wonted vienna is not a cheap place to live in but i have made one small arrangement which has a distinctly economical aspect the vice consul made the contract for me yesterdaytowit a barber is to come every morning 830 and shave me and keep my hair trimmed for 250 a month i used to pay 150 per shave in our house in hartford  does it suggest to you reflections when you reflect that this is the most important event which has happened to me in ten daysunless i countin my handing a cabman over to the police day before yesterday with the proper formalities and promised to appear in court when his case comes up  if i had time to run around and talk i would do it for there is much politics agoing and it would be interesting if a body could get the hang of it it is christian and jew by the hornsthe advantage with the superior man as usualthe superior man being the jew every time and in all countries land joe what chance would the christian have in a country where there were 3 jews to 10 christians oh not the shade of a shadow of a chance the difference between the brain of the average christian and that of the average jewcertainly in europeis about the difference between a tadpoles and an archbishops its a marvelous raceby long odds the most marvelous that the world has produced i suppose  and theres more politicsthe clash between czech and austrian i wish i could understand these quarrels but of course i cant  with the abounding love of us all                                          mark        in following the equator there was used an amusing picture showing      mark twain on his trip around the world  it was a trick photograph      made from a picture of mark twain taken in a steamerchair cut out      and combined with a dilapidated negrocart drawn by a horse and an      ox  in it clemens appears to be sitting luxuriously in the end of      the disreputable cart  his companions are two negroes  to the      creator of this ingenious effect mark twain sent a characteristic      acknowledgment     to t s frisbie                                                    vienna oct 25 97  mr t s frisbiedear sir the picture has reached me and has moved me deeply that was a steady sympathetic and honorable team and although it was not swift and not showy it pulled me around the globe successfully and always attracted its proper share of attention even in the midst of the most costly and fashionable turnouts princes and dukes and other experts were always enthused by the harness and could hardly keep from trying to buy it the barouche does not look as fine now as it did earlierbut that was before the earthquake  the portraits of myself and uncle and nephew are very good indeed and your impressionist reproduction of the palace of the governor general of india is accurate and full of tender feeling  i consider that this picture is much more than a work of art how much more one cannot say with exactness but i should think twothirds more                      very truly yours                                    mark twain        following the equator was issued by subscription through mark      twains old publishers the blisses of hartford  the sale of it      was large not only on account of the value of the book itself but      also because of the sympathy of the american people with mark      twains brave struggle to pay his debts  when the newspapers began      to print exaggerated stories of the vast profits that were piling      up bliss became worried for he thought it would modify the      sympathy  he cabled clemens for a denial with the following      result     to frank e bliss in hartford                                               vienna nov 4 1897  dear blissyour cablegram informing me that a report is in circulation which purports to come from me and which says i have recently made 82000 and paid all my debts has just reached me and i have cabled back my regret to you that it is not true i wrote a lettera private lettera short time ago in which i expressed the belief that i should be out of debt within the next twelvemonth if you make as much as usual for me out of the book that belief will crystallize into a fact and i shall be wholly out of debt i am encoring you now  it is out of that moderate letter that the eightytwo thousanddollar mares nest has developed but why do you worry about the various reports they do not worry me they are not unfriendly and i dont see how they can do any harm be patient you have but a little while to wait the possible reports are nearly all in it has been reported that i was seriously illit was another man dyingit was another man deadthe other man again it has been reported that i have received a legacy it was another man that i am out of debtit was another man and now comes this 82000still another man it has been reported that i am writing booksfor publication i am not doing anything of the kind it would surprise and gratify me if i should be able to get another book ready for the press within the next three years you can see yourself that there isnt anything more to be reportedinvention is exhausted therefore dont worry blissthe long night is breaking as far as i can see nothing remains to be reported except that i have become a foreigner when you hear it dont you believe it and dont take the trouble to deny it merely just raise the american flag on our house in hartford and let it talk                                     truly yours                                              mark twain  p s this is not a private letter i am getting tired of private letters     to rev j h twichell in hartford

for forrests austrohungarian articles i have just finished reading the first one and in it i find that his opinion and viennas are the same upon a point which was puzzling methe paucity no the absence of austrian celebrities he and vienna both say the country cannot afford to allow great names to grow up that the whole safety and prosperity of the empire depends upon keeping things quiet cant afford to have geniuses springing up and developing ideas and stirring the public soul i am assured that every time a man finds himself blooming into fame they just softly snake him down and relegate him to a wholesome obscurity it is curious and interesting  three days ago the new york world sent and asked a friend of mine correspondent of a london daily to get some christmas greetings from the celebrities of the empire she spoke of this two or three bright austrians were present they said there are none who are known all over the world none who have achieved fame none who can point to their work and say it is known far and wide in the earth there are no names kossuth known because he had a father and lecher who made the 12 hour speech two namesnothing more every other country in the world perhaps has a giant or two whose heads are away up and can be seen but ours weve got the materialhave always had itbut we have to suppress it we cant afford to let it develop our political salvation depends upon tranquillityalways has  poor livy she is laid up with rheumatism but she is getting along now we have a good doctor and he says she will be out of bed in a couple of days but must stay in the house a week or ten  clara is working faithfully at her music jean at her usual studies and we all send love                                mark        mention has already been made of the political excitement in vienna      the trouble between the hungarian and german legislative bodies      presently became violent  clemens found himself intensely      interested and was present in one of the galleries when it was      cleared by the police  all sorts of stories were circulated as to      what happened to him one of which was cabled to america  a letter      to twichell sets forth what really happened     to rev j h twichell in hartford                                                    hotel metropole                                                   vienna dec 10 97  dear joepond sends me a cleveland paper with a cablegram from here in it which says that when the police invaded the parliament and expelled the 11 members i waved my handkerchief and shouted hoch die deutschen and got hustled out oh dear what a pity it is that ones adventures never happen when the ordner sergeantatarms came up to our gallery and was hurrying the people out a friend tried to get leave for me to stay by saying but this gentleman is a foreigneryou dont need to turn him outhe wont do any harm  oh i know him very welli recognize him by his pictures and i should be very glad to let him stay but i havent any choice because of the strictness of the orders  and so we all went out and no one was hustled below i ran across the london times correspondent and he showed me the way into the first gallery and i lost none of the show the first gallery had not misbehaved and was not disturbed   we cannot persuade livy to go out in society yet but all the lovely people come to see her and clara and i go to dinner parties and around here and there and we all have a most hospitable good time jeans woodcarving flourishes and her other studies  goodbye joeand we all love all of you                                               mark        clemens made an article of the austrian troubles one of the best      things he ever wrote and certainly one of the clearest elucidations      of the austrohungarian confusions  it was published in harpers      magazine and is now included in his complete works       thus far none of the webster company debts had been paidat least      none of importance  the money had been accumulating in mr rogerss      hands but clemens was beginning to be depressed by the heavy      burden  he wrote asking for relief      fragment of a letter to h h rogers in new york  dear mr rogersi throw up the sponge i pull down the flag let us begin on the debts i cannot bear the weight any longer it totally unfits me for work i have lost three entire months now in that time i have begun twenty magazine articles and booksand flung every one of them aside in turn the debts interfered every time and took the spirit out of any work and yet i have worked like a bond slave and wasted no time and spared no effort  rogers wrote proposing a plan for beginning immediately upon the debts clemens replied enthusiastically and during the next few weeks wrote every few days expressing his delight in liquidation             extracts from letters to h  h  rogers in new york   we all delighted with your plan only dont leave bout apparently that claim has been inherited by some womendaughters no doubt we dont want to see them lose any thing b is an ass and disgruntled but i dont care for that i am responsible for the money and must do the best i can to pay it i am writing hardwriting for the creditors                                                               dec  29  land we are glad to see those debts diminishing for the first time in my life i am getting more pleasure out of paying money out than pulling it in                                                               jan  2  since we have begun to pay off the debts i have abundant peace of mind againno sense of burden work is become a pleasure againit is not labor any longer                                                               march 7  mrs clemens has been reading the creditors letters over and over again and thanks you deeply for sending them and says it is the only really happy day she has had since susy died     xxxvii letters 1898 to howells and twichell life in vienna payment of the debts assassination of the empress  the end of january saw the payment of the last of mark twains debts once more he stood free before the worlda world that sounded his praises the latter fact rather amused him honest men must be pretty scarce he said when they make so much fuss over even a defective specimen when the end was in sight clemens wrote the news to howells in a letter as full of sadness as of triumph     to w d howells in new york                                          hotel metropole                                              vienna jan 22 98  dear howellslook at those ghastly figures i used to write it hartford 1871 there was no susy thenthere is no susy now and how much lies betweenone long lovely stretch of scented fields and meadows and shady woodlands and suddenly sahara you speak of the glorious days of that old timeand they were it is my quarrelthat traps like that are set susy and winnie given us in miserable sport and then taken away  about the last time i saw you i described to you the culminating disaster in a book i was going to write and will yet when the stroke is further awaya mans dead daughter brought to him when he had been through all other possible misfortunesand i said it couldnt be done as it ought to be done except by a man who had lived itit must be written with the blood out of a mans heart i couldnt know then how soon i was to be made competent i have thought of it many a time since if you were here i think we could cry down each others necks as in your dream for we are a pair of old derelicts drifting around now with some of our passengers gone and the sunniness of the others in eclipse  i couldnt get along without work now i bury myself in it up to the ears long hours8 and 9 on a stretch sometimes and all the days sundays included it isnt all for print by any means for much of it fails to suit me 50000 words of it in the past year it was because of the deadness which invaded me when susy died but i have made a change latelyinto dramatic workand i find it absorbingly entertaining i dont know that i can write a play that will play but no matter ill write half a dozen that wont anyway dear me i didnt know there was such fun in it ill write twenty that wont play i get into immense spirits as soon as my day is fairly started of course a good deal of this friskiness comes of my being in sight of landon the webster  co debts i mean private weve lived close to the bone and saved every cent we could and theres no undisputed claim now that we cant cash i have marked this private because it is for the friends who are attending to the matter for us in new york to reveal it when they want to and if they want to there are only two claims which i dispute and which i mean to look into personally before i pay them but they are small both together they amount to only 12500 i hope you will never get the like of the load saddled onto you that was saddled onto me 3 years ago and yet there is such a solid pleasure in paying the things that i reckon maybe it is worth while to get into that kind of a hobble after all mrs clemens gets millions of delight out of it and the children have never uttered one complaint about the scrimping from the beginning  we all send you and all of you our love                                               mark        howells wrote i wish you could understand how unshaken you are      you old tower in every way your foundations are struck so deep      that you will catch the sunshine of immortal years and bask in the      same light as cervantes and shakespeare       the clemens apartments at the metropole became a sort of social      clearinghouse of the viennese art and literary life much more like      an embassy than the home of a mere literary man  celebrities in      every walk of life persons of social and official rank writers for      the press assembled there on terms hardly possible in any other      home in vienna  wherever mark twain appeared in public he was a      central figure  now and then he read or spoke to aid some benefit      and these were great gatherings attended by members of the royal      family  it was following one such event that the next letter was      written   private     to rev j h twichell in hartford

of work nevertheless there may be idle people in the world but im not one of them i say private up there because ive got an adventure to tell and you mustnt let a breath of it get out first i thought i would lay it up along with a thousand others that ive laid up for the same purposeto talk to you about butthose others have vanished out of my memory and that must not happen with this  the other night i lectured for a vienna charity and at the end of it livy and i were introduced to a princess who is aunt to the heir apparent of the imperial thronea beautiful lady with a beautiful spirit and very cordial in her praises of my books and thanks to me for writing them and glad to meet me face to face and shake me by the handjust the kind of princess that adorns a fairy tale and makes it the prettiest tale there is  very well we long ago found that when you are noticed by supremacies the correct etiquette is to go within a couple of days and pay your respects in the quite simple form of writing your name in the visitors book kept in the office of the establishment that is the end of it and everything is squared up and shipshape  so at noon today livy and i drove to the archducal palace and got by the sentries all right and asked the grandlyuniformed porter for the book and said we wished to write our names in it and he called a servant in livery and was sending us up stairs and said her royal highness was out but would soon be in of course livy said nonowe only want the book but he was firm and said you are americans  yes  then you are expected please go up stairs  but indeed we are not expectedplease let us have the book and  her royal highness will be back in a very little whileshe commanded me to tell you soand you must wait  well the soldiers were there close bythere was no use trying to resistso we followed the servant up but when he tried to beguile us into a drawingroom livy drew the line she wouldnt go in and she wouldnt stay up there either she said the princess might come in at any moment and catch us and it would be too infernally ridiculous for anything so we went down stairs againto my unspeakable regret for it was too darling a comedy to spoil i was hoping and praying the princess would come and catch us up there and that those other americans who were expected would arrive and be taken for impostors by the portier and shot by the sentinelsand then it would all go into the papers and be cabled all over the world and make an immense stir and be perfectly lovely and by that time the princess would discover that we were not the right ones and the minister of war would be ordered out and the garrison and they would come for us and there would be another prodigious time and that would get cabled too andwell joe i was in a state of perfect bliss but happily oh so happily that big portier wouldnt let us outhe was sorry but he must obey orderswe must go back up stairs and wait poor livyi couldnt help but enjoy her distress she said we were in a fix and how were we going to explain if the princess should arrive before the rightful americans came we went up stairs againlaid off our wraps and were conducted through one drawing room and into another and left alone there and the door closed upon us  livy was in a state of mind she said it was too theatrically ridiculous and that i would never be able to keep my mouth shut that i would be sure to let it out and it would get into the papersand she tried to make me promisepromise what i saidto be quiet about this indeed i wontits the best thing that ever happened ill tell it and add to it and i wish joe and howells were here to make it perfect i cant make all the rightful blunders myselfit takes all three of us to do justice to an opportunity like this i would just like to see howells get down to his work and explain and lie and work his futile and inventionless subterfuges when that princess comes raging in here and wanting to know but livy could not hear funit was not a time to be trying to be funnywe were in a most miserable and shameful situation and if  just then the door spread wide and our princess and 4 more and 3 little princes flowed in our princess and her sister the archduchess marie therese mother to the imperial heir and to the young girl archduchesses present and aunt to the 3 little princesand we shook hands all around and sat down and had a most sociable good time for half an hourand by and by it turned out that we were the right ones and had been sent for by a messenger who started too late to catch us at the hotel we were invited for 2 oclock but we beat that arrangement by an hour and a half  wasnt it a rattling good comedy situation seems a kind of pity we were the right ones it would have been such nuts to see the right ones come and get fired out and we chatting along comfortably and nobody suspecting us for impostors  we send lots and lots of love                                     mark        the reader who has followed these pages has seen how prone mark      twain was to fall a victim to the lure of a patentrighthow he      wasted several small fortunes on profitless contrivances and one      large one on that insatiable demon of intricacy and despair the      paige typesetter  it seems incredible that after that experience      and its attending disaster he should have been tempted again  but      scarcely was the ink dry on the receipts from his creditors when he      was once more borne into the clouds on the prospect of millions      perhaps even billions to be made from a marvelous carpetpattern      machine the invention of sczezepanik an austrian genius  that      clemens appreciated his own tendencies is shown by the parenthetic      line with which he opens his letter on the subject to mr rogers      certainly no man was ever a more perfect prototype of colonel      sellers than the creator of that lovely irrepressible visionary     to mr rogers in new york                                                         march 24 98  dear mr rogersi feel like col sellers  mr kleinberg agent for sczezepanik came according to appointment at 830 last night and brought his englishspeaking secretary i asked questions about the auxiliary invention which i call no 2  and got as good an idea of it as i could it is a machine it automatically punches the holes in the jacquard cards and does it with mathematical accuracy it will do for 1 what now costs 3 so it has value but no 2 is the great thing the designing invention it saves 9 out of 10 and the jacquard looms must have it  then i arrived at my new project and said to him in substance this  you are on the point of selling the no 2 patents to belgium italy etc i suggest that you stop those negotiations and put those people off two or three months they are anxious now they will not be less anxious thenjust the reverse people always want a thing that is denied them  so far as i know no great worldpatent has ever yet been placed in the grip of a single corporation this is a good time to begin  we have to do a good deal of guesswork here because we cannot get hold of just the statistics we want still we have some good statisticsand i will use those for a test  you say that of the 1500 austrian textile factories 800 use the jacquard then we will guess that of the 4000 american factories 2000 use the jacquard and must have our no 2  you say that a middlesized austrian factory employs from 20 to 30 designers and pays them from 800 to 3000 odd florins a yeara florin is 2 francs let us call the average wage 1500 florins 600  let us apply these figures the low wages too to the 2000 american factorieswith this difference to guard against overguessing that instead of allowing for 20 to 30 designers to a middlesized factory we allow only an average of 10 to each of the 2000 factoriesa total of 20000 designers wages at 600 a total of 12000000 let us consider that no 2 will reduce this expense to 2000000 a year the saving is 5000000 per each of the 200000000 of capital employed in the jacquard business over there  let us consider that in the countries covered by this patent an aggregate of 1500000000 of capital is employed in factories requiring no 2  the saving as above is 75000000 a year the company holding in its grip all these patents would collar 50000000 of that as its share possibly more  competition would be at an end in the jacquard business on this planet pricecutting would end fluctuations in values would cease the business would be the safest and surest in the world commercial panics could not seriously affect it its stock would be as choice an investment as government bonds when the patents died the company would be so powerful that it could still keep the whole business in its hands would you like to grant me the privilege of placing the whole jacquard business of the world in the grip of a single company and dont you think that the business would growgrow like a weed  ach americait is the country of the big let me get my breaththen we will talk  so then we talkedtalked till pretty late would germany and england join the combination i said the company would know how to persuade them  then i asked for a supplementary option to cover the world and we parted  i am taking all precautions to keep my name out of print in connection with this matter and we will now keep the invention itself out of print as well as we can descriptions of it have been granted to the dry goods economist new york and to a syndicate of american papers i have asked mr kleinberg to suppress these and he feels pretty sure he can do it                 with love                               s l c        if this splendid enthusiasm had not cooled by the time a reply came      from mr rogers it must have received a sudden chill from the      letter which he inclosedthe brief and concise report from a      carpetmachine expert who said i do not feel that it would be of      any value to us in our mills and the number of jacquard looms in      america is so limited that i am of the opinion that there is no      field for a company to develop the invention here  a cursory      examination of the pamphlet leads me to place no very high value      upon the invention from a practical standpoint       with the receipt of this letter carpetpattern projects would seem      to have suddenly ceased to be a factor in mark twains calculations      such a letter in the early days of the typemachine would have saved      him a great sum in money and years of disappointment  but perhaps      he would not have heeded it then       the year 1898 brought the spanishamerican war  clemens was      constitutionally against all wars but writing to twichell whose

for a couple of weeks ago when the weekly came containing that handsome reference to me i was powerfully moved to write you and my letter went on writing itself while i was at work at my other literature during the day but next day my other literature was still urgentand so on and so on so my letter didnt get put into ink at all but i see now that you were writing about that time therefore a part of my stir could have come across the atlantic per mental telegraph in 1876 or 75 i wrote 40000 words of a story called simon wheeler wherein the nub was the preventing of an execution through testimony furnished by mental telegraph from the other side of the globe i had a lot of people scattered about the globe who carried in their pockets something like the old mesmerizerbutton made of different metals and when they wanted to call up each other and have a talk they pressed the button or did something i dont remember what and communication was at once opened i didnt finish the story though i rebegan it in several new ways and spent altogether 70000 words on it then gave it up and threw it aside  this much as preliminary to this remark some day people will be able to call each other up from any part of the world and talk by mental telegraphand not merely by impression the impression will be articulated into words it could be a terrible thing but it wont be because in the upper civilizations everything like sentimentality i was going to say sentiment will presently get materialized out of people along with the already fading spiritualities and so when a man is called who doesnt wish to talk he will be like those visitors you mention not chosenand will be frankly damned and shut off  speaking of the ill luck of starting a piece of literary work wrongand again and again always aware that there is a way if you could only think it out which would make the thing slide effortless from the penthe one right way the sole form for you the other forms being for men whose line those forms are or who are capabler than yourself ive had no end of experience in that and maybe i am the only onelet us hope so last summer i started 16 things wrong3 books and 13 mag articlesand could only make 2 little wee things 1500 words altogether succeedonly that out of piles and stacks of diligentlywrought ms the labor of 6 weeks unremitting effort i could make all of those things go if i would take the trouble to rebegin each one half a dozen times on a new plan but none of them was important enough except one the story i in the wrong form mapped out in paris three or four years ago and told you about in new york under seal of confidenceno other person knows of it but mrs clemensthe story to be called which was the dream  a week ago i examined the ms10000 wordsand saw that the plan was a totally impossible onefor me but a new plan suggested itself and straightway the tale began to slide from the pen with ease and confidence i think ive struck the right one this time i have already put 12000 words of it on paper and mrs clemens is pretty outspokenly satisfied with ita hard critic to content i feel sure that all of the first half of the storyand i hope threefourthswill be comedy but by the former plan the whole of it except the first 3 chapters would have been tragedy and unendurable almost i think i can carry the reader a long way before he suspects that i am laying a tragedytrap in the present form i could spin 16 books out of it with comfort and joy but i shall deny myself and restrict it to one if you should see a little short story in a magazine in the autumn called my platonic sweetheart written 3 weeks ago that is not this one it may have been a suggester though  i expect all these singular privacies to interest you and you are not to let on that they dont  we are leaving this afternoon for ischl to use that as a base for the baggage and then gad around ten days among the lakes and mountains to restup mrs clemens who is jaded with housekeeping i hope i can get a chance to work a little in spotsi cant tell but you do ittherefore why should you think i cant                             remainder missing        the dream story was never completed  it was the same that he had      worked on in london and perhaps again in switzerland  it would be      tried at other times and in other forms but it never seemed to      accommodate itself to a central idea so that the good writing in it      eventually went to waste  the short story mentioned my platonic      sweetheart a charming idyllic tale was not published during mark      twains lifetime  two years after his death it appeared in harpers      magazine       the assassination of the empress of austria at geneva was the      startling event of that summer  in a letter to twichell clemens      presents the tragedy in a few vivid paragraphs  later he treated it      at some length in a magazine article which very likely because of      personal relations with members of the austrian court he withheld      from print  it has since been included in a volume of essays what      is man etc     to rev j h twichell in hartford                                          kaltenleutgeben sep  13 98  dear joeyou are mistaken people dont send us the magazines noharper century and mcclure do an example i should like to recommend to other publishers and so i thank you very much for sending me branders article when you say i like brander matthews he impresses me as a man of parts and power i back you right up to the hubi feel the same way and when you say he has earned your gratitude for cuffing me for my crimes against the leather stockings and the vicar i aint making any objection dern your gratitude  his article is as sound as a nut brander knows literature and loves it he can talk about it and keep his temper he can state his case so lucidly and so fairly and so forcibly that you have to agree with him even when you dont agree with him and he can discover and praise such merits as a book has even when they are half a dozen diamonds scattered through an acre of mud and so he has a right to be a critic  to detail just the opposite of the above invoice is to describe me i havent any right to criticise books and i dont do it except when i hate them i often want to criticise jane austen but her books madden me so that i cant conceal my frenzy from the reader and therefore i have to stop every time i begin  that good and unoffending lady the empress is killed by a madman and i am living in the midst of worldhistory again the queens jubilee last year the invasion of the reichsrath by the police and now this murder which will still be talked of and described and painted a thousand years from now to have a personal friend of the wearer of the crown burst in at the gate in the deep dusk of the evening and say in a voice broken with tears my god the empress is murdered and fly toward her home before we can utter a questionwhy it brings the giant event home to you makes you a part of it and personally interested it is as if your neighbor antony should come flying and say caesar is butcheredthe head of the world is fallen  of course there is no talk but of this the mourning is universal and genuine the consternation is stupefying the austrian empire is being draped with black vienna will be a spectacle to see by next saturday when the funeral cortege marches we are invited to occupy a room in the sumptuous new hotel the krantz where we are to live during the fall and winter and view it and we shall go  speaking of mrs leiter there is a noble dame in vienna about whom they retail similar slanders she said in frenchshe is weak in frenchthat she had been spending a sunday afternoon in a gathering of the demimonde meaning the unknown land that mercantile land that mysterious halfworld which underlies the aristocracy but these malaproperies are always inventionsthey dont happen  yes i wish we could have some talks im full to the eyelids had a noble good one with parker and dunhamland but we were grateful for that visit                 yours with all our loves                                         mark                        inclosed with the foregoing  among the inadequate attempts to account for the assassination we must concede high rank to the german emperors he justly describes it as a deed unparalleled for ruthlessness and then adds that it was ordained from above  i think this verdict will not be popular above a man is either a free agent or he isnt if a man is a free agent this prisoner is responsible for what he has done but if a man is not a free agent if the deed was ordained from above there is no rational way of making this prisoner even partially responsible for it and the german court cannot condemn him without manifestly committing a crime logic is logic and by disregarding its laws even emperors as capable and acute as william ii can be beguiled into making

once more in easy even      luxurious circumstances  the hard work and good fortune which had      enabled him to pay his debts had in the course of another year      provided what was comparative affluence his report to howells is      characteristic and interesting     to w d howells in new york                                     hotel krantz wien l  never markt 6                                                        dec  30 98  dear howellsi begin with a dateincluding all the detailsthough i shall be interrupted presently by a southafrican acquaintance who is passing through and it may be many days before i catch another leisure moment note how suddenly a thing can become habit and how indestructible the habit is afterward in your house in cambridge a hundred years ago mrs howells said to me here is a bunch of your letters and the dates are of no value because you dont put any inthe years anyway that remark diseased me with a habit which has cost me worlds of time and torture and ink and millions of vain efforts and buckets of tears to break it and here it is yeti could easier get rid of a virtue  i hope it will interest you for i have no one else who would much care to know it that here lately the dread of leaving the children in difficult circumstances has died down and disappeared and i am now having peace from that long long nightmare and can sleep as well as anyone every little while for these three years now mrs clemens has come with pencil and paper and figured up the condition of things she keeps the accounts and the bankbook and has proven to me that the clouds were lifting and so has hoisted my spirits temporarily and kept me going till another figuringup was necessary last night she figured up for her own satisfaction not mine and found that we own a house and furniture in hartford that my english and american copyrights pay an income which represents a value of 200000 and that we have 107000 cash in the bank i have been out and bought a box of 6cent cigars i was smoking 4 12 centers before  at the house of an english friend on christmas eve we saw the mousetrap played and well played i thought the house would kill itself with laughter by george they played with life and it was most devastatingly funny and it was well they did for they put us clemenses in the front seat and if they played it poorly i would have assaulted them the head young man and girl were americans the other parts were taken by english irish and scotch girls then there was a niggerminstrel show of the genuine old sort and i enjoyed that too for the niggershow was always a passion of mine this one was created and managed by a quaker doctor from philada 23 years old and he was the middle man there were 9 others5 americans from 5 states and a scotchman 2 englishmen and an irishmanall postgraduatemedical young fellows of courseor it could be music but it would be bound to be one or the other  its quite truei dont read you as much as i ought nor anywhere near half as much as i want to still i read you all i get a chance to i saved up your last story to read when the numbers should be complete but before that time arrived some other admirer of yours carried off the papers i will watch admirers of yours when the silver wedding journey begins and that will not happen again the last chance at a bound book of yours was in london nearly two years agothe last volume of your short things by the harpers i read the whole book twice through and some of the chapters several times and the reason that that was as far as i got with it was that i lent it to another admirer of yours and he is admiring it yet your admirers have ways of their own i dont know where they get them  yes our project is to go home next autumn if we find we can afford to live in new york weve asked a friend to inquire about flats and expenses but perhaps nothing will come of it we do afford to live in the finest hotel in vienna and have 4 bedrooms a diningroom a drawingroom 3 bathrooms and 3 vorzimmers and food but we couldnt get the half of it in new york for the same money 600 a month   susy hovers about us this holiday week and the shadows fall all about us of                 the days when we went gipsying                a long time ago  death is so kind so benignant to whom he loves but he goes by us others and will not look our way we saw the master of palmyra last night how death with the gentleness and majesty made the human grandfolk around him seem little and trivial and silly  with love from all of us to all of you                                               mark     xxxviii letters 1899 to howells and others vienna london a summer in sweden  the beginning of 1899 found the clemens family still in vienna occupying handsome apartments at the hotel krantz their rooms so often thronged with gay and distinguished people were sometimes called the second embassy clemens himself was the central figure of these assemblies of all the foreign visitors in the austrian capital he was the most notable everywhere he was surrounded by a crowd of listenershis sayings and opinions were widely quoted  a project for world disarmament promulgated by the czar of russia would naturally interest mark twain and when william t stead of the review of reviews cabled him for an opinion on the matter he sent at first a brief word and on the same day followed it with more extended comment the great war which has since devastated the world gives to this incident an added interest     to wm t stead in london  no 1                                                         vienna jan  9  dear mr steadthe czar is ready to disarm i am ready to disarm collect the others it should not be much of a task now                                          mark twain    to wm t stead in london  no 2  dear mr steadpeace by compulsion that seems a better idea than the other peace by persuasion has a pleasant sound but i think we should not be able to work it we should have to tame the human race first and history seems to show that that cannot be done cant we reduce the armaments little by littleon a pro rata basisby concert of the powers cant we get four great powers to agree to reduce their strength 10 per cent a year and thrash the others into doing likewise for of course we cannot expect all of the powers to be in their right minds at one time it has been tried we are not going to try to get all of them to go into the scheme peaceably are we in that case i must withdraw my influence because for business reasons i must preserve the outward signs of sanity four is enough if they can be securely harnessed together they can compel peace and peace without compulsion would be against nature and not operative a sliding scale of reduction of 10 per cent a year has a sort of plausible look and i am willing to try that if three other powers will join i feel sure that the armaments are now many times greater than necessary for the requirements of either peace or war take wartime for instance suppose circumstances made it necessary for us to fight another waterloo and that it would do what it did beforesettle a large question and bring peace i will guess that 400000 men were on hand at waterloo i have forgotten the figures in five hours they disabled 50000 men it took them that tedious long time because the firearms delivered only two or three shots a minute but we would do the work now as it was done at omdurman with shower guns raining 600 balls a minute four men to a gunis that the number a hundred and fifty shots a minute per man thus a modern soldier is 149 waterloo soldiers in one thus also we can now retain one man out of each 150 in service disband the others and fight our waterloos just as effectively as we did eightyfive years ago we should do the same beneficent job with 2800 men now that we did with 400000 then the allies could take 1400 of the men and give napoleon 1400 and then whip him  but instead what do we see in wartime in germany russia and france taken together we find about 8 million men equipped for the field each man represents 149 waterloo men in usefulness and killing capacity altogether they constitute about 350 million waterloo men and there are not quite that many grown males of the human race now on this planet thus we have this insane factthat whereas those three countries could arm 18000 men with modern weapons and make them the equals of 3 million men of napoleons day and accomplish with them all necessary war work they waste their money and their prosperity creating forces of their populations in piling together 349982000 extra waterloo equivalents which they would have no sort of use for if they would only stop drinking and sit down and cipher a little  perpetual peace we cannot have on any terms i suppose but i hope we can gradually reduce the war strength of europe till we get it down to where it ought to be20000 men properly armed then we can have all the peace that is worth while and when we want a war anybody can afford it                                                     vienna january 9  p sin the article i sent the figures are wrong350 million ought to be 450 million 349982000 ought to be 449982000 and the remark about the sum being a little more than the present number of males on the planetthat is wrong of course it represents really one and a half the existing males        now and then one of mark twains old comrades still reached out to      him across the years  he always welcomed such lettersthey

was to teach me the river for a certain specified sum i have forgotten what it was but i paid it i steered a trip for bart bowen of keokuk on the a t lacy and i was partner with will bowen on the a b chambers one trip and with sam bowen a whole summer on a small memphis packet  the newspaper report you sent me is incorrect bixby is not 67 he is 97 i am 63 myself and i couldnt talk plain and had just begun to walk when i apprenticed myself to bixby who was then passing himself off for 57 and successfully too for he always looked 60 or 70 years younger than he really was at that time he was piloting the mississippi on a potomac commission granted him by george washington who was a personal friend of his before the revolution he has piloted every important river in america on that commission he has also used it as a passport in russia i have never revealed these facts before i notice too that you are deceiving the people concerning your age the printed portrait which you have enclosed is not a portrait of you but a portrait of me when i was 19 i remember very well when it was common for people to mistake bixby for your grandson is it spreading i wonderthis disposition of pilots to renew their youth by doubtful methods beck jolly and joe bryanthey probably go to sunday school nowbut it will not deceive  yes it is as you say all of the procession but a fraction has

you are old enough to be a weary man with paling interests but you do not show it you do your work in the same old delicate and delicious and forceful and searching and perfect way i dont know how you canbut i suspect i suspect that to you there is still dignity in human life and that man is not a jokea poor jokethe poorest that was ever contrived since i wrote my bible last yearwhat is manwhich mrs clemens loathes and shudders over and will not listen to the last half nor allow me to print any part of it man is not to me the respectworthy person he was before and so i have lost my pride in him and cant write gaily nor praisefully about him any more and i dont intend to try i mean to go on writing for that is my best amusement but i shant print much for i dont wish to be scalped any more than another  april 5 the harper has come i have been in leipzig with your party and then went on to karlsbad and saw mrs marshs encounter with the swine with the toothpick and the other mannerstheir silver wedding journeyat this point jean carried the magazine away  is it imagination oranyway i seem to get furtive and fleeting glimpses which i take to be the weariness and condolence of age indifference to sights and things once brisk with interest tasteless stale stuff which used to be champagne the boredom of travel the secret sigh behind the public smile the private whatinhelldidicomefor  but maybe that is your art maybe that is what you intend the reader to detect and think he has made a columbusdiscovery then it is well done perfectly done i wrote my last travel bookfollowing the equatorin hell but i let on the best i could that it was an excursion through heaven some day i will read it and if its lying cheerfulness fools me then i shall believe it fooled the reader how i did loathe that journey around the worldexcept the seapart and india  evening my tail hangs low i thought i was a financierand i bragged to you i am not bragging now the stock which i sold at such a fine profit early in january has never ceased to advance and is now worth 60000 more than i sold it for i feel just as if i had been spending 20000 a month and i feel reproached for this showy and unbecoming extravagance  last week i was going down with the family to budapest to lecture and to make a speech at a banquet just as i was leaving here i got a telegram from london asking for the speech for a new york paper i this is strictly private sent it and then i didnt make that speech but another of a quite different charactera speech born of something which the introducer said if that said speech got cabled and printed you neednt let on that it was never uttered  that was a darling night and those hungarians were lively people we were there a week and had a great time at the banquet i heard their chief orator make a most graceful and easy and beautiful and delicious speechi never heard one that enchanted me morealthough i did not understand a word of it since it was in hungarian but the art of itit was superlative  they are wonderful english scholars these people my lecture audienceall hungariansunderstood me perfectlyto judge by the effects the english clergyman told me that in his congregation are 150 young english women who earn their living teaching their language and that there are others besides these  for 60 cents a week the telephone reads the morning news to you at home gives you the stocks and markets at noon gives you lessons in 3 foreign languages during 3 hours gives you the afternoon telegrams and at night the concerts and operas of course even the clerks and seamstresses and bootblacks and everybody else are subscribers  correction mrs clemens says it is 60 cents a month  i am renewing my youth i made 4 speeches at one banquet here last saturday night and ive been to a lot of football matches  jean has been in here examining the poll for the immortals literature march 24 in the hope i think that at last she should find me at the top and you in second place and if that is her ambition she has suffered disappointment for the third timeand will never fare any better i hope for you are where you belong by every right she wanted to know who it is that does the voting but i was not able to tell her nor when the election will be completed and decided  next morning i have been reading the morning paper i do it every morningwell knowing that i shall find in it the usual depravities and basenesses and hypocrisies and cruelties that make up civilization and cause me to put in the rest of the day pleading for the damnation of the human race i cannot seem to get my prayers answered yet i do not despair  escaped from 5 oclock tea sh oh the american girl in europe often she is creditable but sometimes she is just shocking this one a minute ago19 fatface raspy voice pert ways the selfcomplacency of god and with it all a silly laugh embarrassed which kept breaking out through her chatter all along whereas there was no call for it for she said nothing that was funny spose so many ve told y how they njoyed yr chaptr on the germ tongue its bringin coals to newcastle kehe say anything bout it kehehe spent m vacation n russia n saw tolstoi he said it made me shudder  april 12 jean has been in here with a copy of literature complaining that i am again behind you in the election of the 10 consecrated members and seems troubled about it and not quite able to understand it but i have explained to her that you are right there on the ground inside the poolbooth keeping gameand that that makes a large difference in these things  13th i have been to the knustausstellung with mrs clemens the office of art seems to be to grovel in the dirt before emperors and this and that and the other damned breed of priests                                     yrs ever                                              mark        howells and clemens were corresponding regularly again though not      with the frequency of former years  perhaps neither of them was      bubbling over with things to say perhaps it was becoming yearly      less attractive to pick up a pen and write and then of course      there was always the discouragement of distance  once howells      wrote i know this will find you in austria before i can well turn      round but i must make believe you are in kennebunkport before i can      begin it  and in another letter it ought to be as pleasant to      sit down and write to you as to sit down and talk to you but it      isnt  the only reason why i write is that i want another      letter from you and because i have a whole afternoon for the job      i have the whole of every afternoon for i cannot work later than      lunch  i am fagged by that time and sunday is the only day that      brings unbearable leisure  i hope you will be in new york another      winter then i shall know what to do with these foretastes of      eternity       clemens usually wrote at considerable length for he had a good deal      to report of his life in the austrian capital now drawing to a      close     to w d howells in new york                                                         may 12 1899  dear howells715 p m tea for mr and mrs tower who are leaving for russia just over nice people and rather creditable to the human race mr and mrs tower the new minister and his wife the secretary of legation the naval and military attach several english ladies an irish lady a scotch lady a particularly nice young austrian baron who wasnt invited but came and went supposing it was the usual thing and wondered at the unusually large gathering two other austrians and several americans who were also in his fix the old baronin langeman the only austrian invited the rest were americans it made just a comfortable crowd in our parlor with an overflow into claras through the folding doors i dont enjoy teas and am daily spared them by mrs clemens but this was a pleasant one i had only one accident the old baronin langeman is a person i have a strong fondness for for we violently disagree on some subjects and as violently agree on othersfor instance she is temperance and i am not she has religious beliefs and feelings and i have none shes a methodist she is a democrat and so am i she is womans rights and so am i she is laborers rights and approves trades unions and strikes and that is me and so on after she was gone an english lady whom i greatly like began to talk sharply against her for contributing money time labor and public expression of favor to a strike that is on for an 11hour day in the silk factories of bohemiaand she caught me unprepared and betrayed me into overwarm argument i am sorry for she didnt know anything about the subject and i did and one should be gentle with the ignorant for they are the chosen of god  the new minister is a good man but out of place the sec of legation is a good man but out of place the attache is a good man but out of place our government for displacement beats the new white star ship and her possible is 17200 tons  may 13 4 p m a beautiful english girl and her handsome english husband came up and spent the evening and she certainly is a bird english parentsshe was born and reared in roumania and couldnt talk english till she was 8 or 10 she came up clothed like the sunset and was a delight to look at roumanian costume  twentyfour young people have gone out to the semmering today and tomorrow and mrs clemens and an english lady and old leschetitzky and his wife have gone to chaperon them they gave me a chance to go but there are no snow mountains that i want to look at three hours out three hours back and sit up all night watching the young people dance yelling conversationally and being yelled at conversationally by new acquaintances through the deafening music about how i like vienna and if its my first visit and how long we expect to stay and did i see the footwashing and am i writing a book about vienna and so on the terms seemed too severe snow mountains are too dear at the price  for several years i have been intending to stop writing for print as soon as i could afford it at last i can afford it and have put the potboiler pen away what i have been wanting is a chance to write a book without reservesa book which should take account of no ones feelings and no ones prejudices opinions beliefs hopes illusions delusions a book which should say my say right out of my heart in the plainest language and without a limitation of any sort i judged that that would be an unimaginable luxury heaven on earth  it is under way now and it is a luxury an intellectual drunk twice i didnt start it right and got pretty far in both times before i found it out but i am sure it is started right this time it is in taleform i believe i can make it tell what i think of man and how he is constructed and what a shabby poor ridiculous thing he is and how mistaken he is in his estimate of his character and powers and qualities and his place among the animals  so far i think i am succeeding i let the madam into the secret day before yesterday and locked the doors and read to her the opening chapters she said  it is perfectly horribleand perfectly beautiful  within the due limits of modesty that is what i think  i hope it will take me a year or two to write it and that it will turn out to be the right vessel to contain all the abuse i am planning to dump into it                           yours ever                                         mark        the story mentioned

death  six years later 1916 it was published serially      in harpers magazine and in book form       the end of may found the clemens party in london where they were      received and entertained

of their entertainments     to w d howells in america                                                    london july 3 99  dear howells ive a lot of things to write you but its no usei cant get time for anything these days i must break off and write a postscript to canon wilberforce before i go to bed this afternoon he left a luncheonparty half an hour ahead of the rest and carried off my hat which has mark twain in a big hand written in it when the rest of us came out there was but one hat that would go on my headit fitted exactly too so wore it away it had no name in it but the canon was the only man who was absent i wrote him a note at 8 pm saying that for four hours i had not been able to take anything that did not belong to me nor stretch a fact beyond the frontiers of truth and my family were getting alarmed could he explain my trouble and now at 830 pm comes a note from him to say that all the afternoon he has been exhibiting a wondercompelling mental vivacity and grace of expression etc etc and have i missed a hat our letters have crossed                                yours ever                                              mark        news came of the death of robert

scientists pretend to do you wish to advise with a physician about it certainly there is no objection he knows next to something about his own trade but that will not embarrass him in framing a verdict about this one i respect your superstitionswe all have them it would be quite natural for the cautious chinaman to ask his native priest to instruct him as to the value of the new religious

in viennaby accidentwhich i wish i had learned years ago i meant to read from a tauchnitz because i knew i hadnt well memorized the pieces and i came on with the book and read a few sentences then remembered that the sketch needed a few words of explanatory introduction and so lowering the book and now and then unconsciously using it to gesture with i talked the introduction and it happened to carry me into the sketch itself and then i went on pretending that i was merely talking extraneous matter and would come to the sketch presently it was a beautiful success i knew the substance of the sketch and the telling phrases of it and so the throwing of the rest of it into informal talk as i went along limbered it up and gave it the snap and go and freshness of an impromptu i was to read several pieces and i played the same game with all of them and always the audience thought i was being reminded of outside things and throwing them in and was going to hold up the book and begin on the sketch presentlyand so i always got through the sketch before they were entirely sure that it had begun i did the same thing in budapest and had the same good time over again its a new dodge and the best one that was ever invented try it youll never lose your audiencenot even for a moment their attention is fixed and never wavers and that is not the case where one reads from book or ms or where he stands up without a note and frankly exposes the fact by his confident manner and smooth phrasing that he is not improvising but reciting from memory and in the heat of telling a thing that is memorised in substance only one flashes out the happiest suddenlybegotten phrases every now and then try it such a phrase has a life and sparkle about it that twice as good a one could not exhibit

recognise      their deadness frankly and read them       from vienna clemens had contributed to the cosmopolitan then owned      by john brisben walker his first article on christian science  it      was a delicious bit of humor and found such enthusiastic      appreciation that walker was moved to send an additional 200 check      in payment for it  this brought prompt acknowledgment     to john brisben walker in irvington n y                                               london oct 19 99  dear mr walkerby gracious but you have a talent for making a man feel proud and good to say a compliment well is a high artand few possess it you know how to do it and when you confirm its sincerity with a handsome cheque the limit is reached and compliment can no higher go i like to work for you when you dont approve an article you say so recognizing that i am not a child and can stand it and when you approve an article i dont have to dicker with you as if i raised peanuts and you kept a stand i know i shall get every penny the article is worth  you have given me very great pleasure and i thank you for it                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        on the same day he sent word to howells of the good luck which now      seemed to be coming his way  the joan of arc introduction was the      same that today appears in his collected works under the title of      saint joan of arc     to w d howells in new york                                               london oct  19 99  dear howellsmy its a lucky dayof the sort when it never rains but it pours i was to write an introduction to a nobler bookthe english translation of the official record unabridged of the trials and rehabilitation of joan of arc and make a lot of footnotes i wrote the introduction in sweden and here a few days ago i tore loose from a tale i am writing and took the ms book and went at the grind of notemakinga fearful job for a man not used to it this morning brought a note from my excellent friend murray a rich englishman who edits the translation saying never mind the noteswell make the translators do them that was comfort and joy  the same mail brought a note from canon wilberforce asking me to talk joan of arc in his drawingroom to the dukes and earls and m pswhich would fetch me out of my seclusion and into print and i couldnt have that and so of course i must run down to the abbey and explainand lose an hour just then came murray and said leave that to meill go and do the explaining and put the thing off 3 months you write a note and tell him i am coming  which i did later wilberforce carried off my hat from a lunch party last summer and in todays note he said he wouldnt steal my new hat this time in my note i said i couldnt make the drawingroom talk nowmurray would explain and added a p s you mustnt think it is because i am afraid to trust my hat in your reach again for i assure you upon honor it isnt i should bring my old one  i had suggested to murray a fortnight ago that he get some big guns to write introductory monographs for the book  miss x joans voices and prophecies  the lord chief justice of england the legal prodigies which she performed before her judges  lord roberts her military genius  kipling her patriotism  and so on when he came this morning he said he had captured miss x that lord roberts and kipling were going to take hold and see if they could do monographs worthy of the book he hadnt run the others to cover yet but was on their track very good news it is a grand book and is entitled to the best efforts of the best people as for me i took pains with my introduction and i admit that it is no slouch of a performance  then i came down to chattos and found your all too beautiful letter and was lifted higher than ever next came letters from america properly glorifying my christian science article in the cosmopolitan and one roundly abusing it and a letter from john brisben walker enclosing 200 additional pay for the article he had already paid enough but i didnt mention thatwhich wasnt right of me for this is the second time he has done such a thing whereas gilder has done it only once and no one else ever i make no prices with walker and gilderi can trust them  and last of all came a letter from m how i do wish that man was in hell eventhe briefest line from that idiot puts me in a rage  but on the whole it has been a delightful day and with min hell it would have been perfect but that will happen and i can wait  ah if i could look into the inside of people as you do and put it on paper and invent things for them to do and say and tell how they said it i could writs a fine and readable book now for ive got a prime subject ive written 30000 words of it and satisfied myself that the stuff is there so i am going to discard that ms and begin all over again and have a good time with it  oh i know how you feel ive been in hell myself you are there tonight by difference in time you are at luncheon nowand not eating it nothing is so lonesome as gadding around platforming i have declined 45 lectures todayengland and scotland i wanted the money but not the torture good luck to youand repentance                           with love to all of you                                              mark      xxxix letters of 1900 mainly to twichell the boer war boxer troubles the return to america  the new year found clemens still in london chiefly interested in osteopathy and characteristically glorifying the practice at the expense of other healing methods     to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               london jan  8 1900  dear joemental telepathy has scored another mental telegraphy will be greatly respected a century hence  by the accident of writing my sister and describing to her the remarkable cures made by kellgren with his hands and without drugs i brought upon myself a quite stunning surprise for she wrote to me that she had been taking this very treatment in buffaloand that it was an american invention  well it does really turn out that dr still in the middle of kansas in a village began to experiment in 1874 only five years after kellgren began the same work obscurely in the village of gotha in germany dr still seems to be an honest man therefore i am persuaded that kellgren moved him to his experiments by mental telegraphy across six hours of longitude without need of a wire by the time still began to experiment kellgren had completed his development of the principles of his system and established himself in a good practice in london1874and was in good shape to convey his discovery to kansas mental telegraphically  yes i was greatly surprised to find that my mares nest was much in arrears that this new science was well known in america under the name of osteopathy since then i find that in the past 3 years it has got itself legalized in 14 states in spite of the opposition of the physicians that it has established 20 osteopathic schools and colleges that among its students are 75 allopathic physicians that there is a school in boston and another in philadelphia that there are about 100 students in the parent college dr stills at kirksville missouri and that there are about 2000 graduates practicing in america dear me there are not 30 in europe europe is so sunk in superstitions and prejudices that it is an almost impossible thing to get her to do anything but scoff at a new thingunless it come from abroad as witness the telegraph dentistry c  presently the osteopath will come over here from america and will soon make himself a power that must be recognized and reckoned with and then 25 years from now england will begin to claim the invention and tell all about its origin in the cyclopedia bas in the case of the telegraph applied anaesthetics and the other benefactions which she heaped her abuse upon when her inventors first offered them to her  i cannot help feeling rather inordinately proud of america for the gay and hearty way in which she takes hold of any new thing that comes along and gives it a first rate trial many an ass in america is getting a deal of benefit out of xsciences new exploitation of an ageold healing principlefaith combined with the patients imaginationlet it boom along i have no objection let them call it by what name they choose so long as it does helpful work among the class which is numerically vastly the largest bulk of the human race ie the fools the idiots the puddnheads  we do not guess we know that 9 in 10 of the species are puddnheads we know it by various evidences and one of them is that for ages the race has respected and almost venerated the physicians grotesque systemthe emptying of miscellaneous and harmful drugs into a persons stomach to remove ailments which in many cases the drugs could not reach at all in many cases could reach and help but only at cost of damage to some other part of the man and in the remainder of the cases the drug either retarded the cure or the disease was cured by nature in spite of the nostrums the doctors insane system has not only been permitted to continue its follies for ages but has been protected by the state and made a close monopolyan infamous thing a crime against a freemans proper right to choose his own assassin or his own method of defending his body against disease and death  and yet at the same time with curious and senile inconsistency the state has allowed the man to choose his own assassinin one detailthe patentmedicine detailmaking itself the protector of that perilous business collecting money out of it and appointing no committee of experts to examine the medicines and forbid them when extra dangerous really when a man can prove that he is not a jackass i think he is in the way to prove that he is no legitimate member of the race  i have by me a list of 52 human ailmentscommon onesand in this list i count 19 which the physicians art cannot cure but there isnt one which osteopathy or kellgren cannot cure if the patient comes early  fifteen years ago i had a deep reverence for the physician and the surgeon but 6 months of closely watching the kellgren business has revolutionized all that and now i have neither reverence nor respect for the physicians trade and scarcely any for the surgeonsi am convinced that of all quackeries the physicians is the grotesquest and the silliest and they know they are shams and humbugs they have taken the place of those augurs who couldnt look each other in the face without laughing  see what a powerful hold our ancient superstitions have upon us two weeks ago when livy committed an incredible imprudence and by consequence was promptly stricken down with a heavy triple attackinfluenza bronchitis and a lung affectedshe recognized the gravity of the situation and her old superstitions rose she thought she ought to send for a doctorthink of itthe last man in the world i should want around at such a time of course i did not say nonot that i was indisposed to take the responsibility for i was not my notion of a dangerous responsibility being quite the other waybut because it is unsafe to distress a sick person i only said we knew no good doctor and it could not be good policy to choose at hazard so she allowed me to send for kellgren today she is up and aroundcured it is safe to say that persons hit in the same way at the same time are in bed yet and booked to stay there a good while and to be in a shackly condition and afraid of their shadows for a couple of years or more to come  it will be seen by the foregoing that mark twains interest in the kellgren system was still an ardent one indeed for a time he gave most of his thought to it and wrote several long appreciations perhaps with little idea of publication but merely to get his enthusiasm physically expressed war however presently supplanted medicinethe boer troubles in south africa and the boxer insurrection in china it was a disturbing exciting year     to w d howells in boston                                          wellington court

sorry he didnt go with you for it is marvelous to hear him yarn he is good company cheery and hearty and his mill is never idle your doing a lecture tour was heroic it was the highest order of grit and you have a right to be proud of yourself no mount of applause or money or both could save it from being a hell to a man constituted as you are it is that even to me who am made of coarser stuff  i knew the audiences would come forward and shake hands with youthat one infallible sign of sincere approval in all my life wherever it failed me i left the hall sick and ashamed knowing what it meant  privately speaking this is a sordid and criminal war and in every way shameful and excuseless every day i write in my head bitter magazine articles about it but i have to stop with that for england must not fall it would mean an inundation of russian and german political degradations which would envelop the globe and steep it in a sort of middleage night and slavery which would last till christ comes again even wrongand she is wrongengland must be upheld he is an enemy of the human race who shall speak against her now why was the human race created or at least why wasnt something creditable created in place of it god had his opportunity he could have made a reputation but no he must commit this grotesque follya lark which must have cost him a regret or two when he came to think it over and observe effects for a giddy and unbecoming caprice there has been nothing like it till this war i talk the war with both sidesalways waiting until the other man introduces the topic then i say my head is with the briton but my heart and such rags of morals as i have are with the boernow we will talk unembarrassed and without prejudice and so we discuss and have no trouble                                                         jan  26  it was my intention to make some disparaging remarks about the human race and so i kept this letter open for that purpose and for the purpose of telling my dream wherein the trinity were trying to guess a conundrum but i can do betterfor i can snip out of the times various samples and sidelights which bring the race down to date and expose it as of yesterday if you will notice there is seldom a telegram in a paper which fails to show up one or more members and beneficiaries of our civilization as promenading in his shirttail with the rest of his regalia in the wash  i love to see the holy ones air their smug pieties and admire them and smirk over them and at the same moment frankly and publicly show their contempt for the pieties of the boerconfidently expecting the approval of the country and the pulpit and getting it  i notice that god is on both sides in this war thus history repeats itself but i am the only person who has noticed this everybody here thinks he is playing the game for this side and for this side only                 with great love to you all                                              mark        one cannot help wondering what mark twain would have thought of      human nature had he lived to see the great world war fought mainly      by the christian nations who for nearly two thousand years had been      preaching peace on earth and goodwill toward men  but his opinion      of the race could hardly have been worse than it was  and nothing      that human beings could do would have surprised him     to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               london jan 27 1900  dear joeapparently we are not proposing to set the filipinos free and give their islands to them and apparently we are not proposing to hang the priests and confiscate their property if these things are so the war out there has no interest for me  i have just been examining chapter lxx of following the equator to see if the boers old military effectiveness is holding out it reads curiously as if it had been written about the present war  i believe that in the next chapter my notion of the boer was rightly conceived he is popularly called uncivilized i do not know why happiness food shelter clothing wholesale labor modest and rational ambitions honesty kindliness hospitality love of freedom and limitless courage to fight for it composure and fortitude in time of disaster patience in time of hardship and privation absence of noise and brag in time of victory contentment with a humble and peaceful life void of insane excitementsif there is a higher and better form of civilization than this i am not aware of it and do not know where to look for it i suppose we have the habit of imagining that a lot of artistic intellectual and other artificialities must be added or it isnt complete we and the english have these latter but as we lack the great bulk of these others i think the boer civilization is the best of the two my idea of our civilization is that it is a shabby poor thing and full of cruelties vanities arrogancies meannesses and hypocrisies as for the word i hate the sound of it for it conveys a lie and as for the thing itself i wish it was in hell where it belongs  provided we could get something better in the place of it but that is not possible perhaps poor as it is it is better than real savagery therefore we must stand by it extend it and in public praise it and so we must not utter any hateful word about england in these days nor fail to hope that she will win in this war for her defeat and fall would be an irremediable disaster for the mangy human race naturally then i am for england but she is profoundly in the wrong joe and no instructed englishman doubts it at least that is my belief  maybe i managed to make myself misunderstood as to the osteopathists i wanted to know how the men impress you as to their art i know fairly well about that and should not value hartfords opinion of it nor a physicians nor that of another who proposed to enlighten me out of his ignorance opinions based upon theory superstition and ignorance are not very precious  livy and the others are off for the country for a day or two                 love to you all                                    mark        the next letter affords a pleasant variation  without doubt it was      written on realizing that good nature and enthusiasm had led him      into indiscretion  this was always happening to him and letters      like this are not infrequent though generally less entertaining     to mr ann in london                                          wellington court feb 23 00  dear mr annupon sober second thought it wont doi withdraw that letter not because i said anything in it which is not true for i didnt but because when i allow my name to be used in forwarding a stockscheme i am assuming a certain degree of responsibility as toward the investor and i am not willing to do that i have another objection a purely selfish one trading upon my name whether the enterprise scored a success or a failure would damage me i cant afford that even the archbishop of canterbury couldnt afford it and he has more character to spare than i have ah a happy thought if he would sign the letter with me that would change the whole complexion of the thing of course i do not know him yet i would sign any commercial scheme that he would sign as he does not know me it follows that he would sign anything that i would sign this is unassailable logicbut really that is all that can be said for it  no i withdraw the letter this virgin is pure up to date and is going to remain so                           ys sincerely

robinsons death is a sharp wound to me and it goes very deep i had a strong affection for him and i think he had for me every friday threefourths of the year for 16 years he was of the billiardparty in our house when we come home how shall we have billiardnights againwith no ned bunce and no henry robinson i believe i could not endure that we must find another use for that room susy is gone george is gone libby hamersley ned bunce henry robinson the friends are passing one by one our house where such warm blood and such dear blood flowed so freely is become a cemetery but not in any repellent sense our dead are welcome there their life made it beautiful their death has hallowed it we shall have them with us always and there will be no parting  it was a moving address you made over ward cheneythat fortunate youth like susy he got out of life all that was worth the living and got his great reward before he had crossed the tropic frontier of dreams and entered the sahara of fact the deep consciousness of susys good fortune is a constant comfort to me  london is happyhearted at last the british victories have swept the clouds away and there are no uncheerful faces for three months the private dinner parties we go to no public ones have been lodges of sorrow and just a little depressing sometimes but now they are smiley and animated again joe do you know the irish gentleman and the irish lady the scotch gentleman and the scotch lady these are darlings every one night before last it was all irish24 one would have to travel far to match their ease and sociability and animation and sparkle and absence of shyness and selfconsciousness  it was american in these fine qualities this was at mr leckys he is irish you know last night it was irish again at lady gregorys lord roberts is irish and sir william butler and kitchener i think and a disproportion of the other prominent generals are of irish and scotch breedkeeping up the traditions of wellington and sir colin campbell of the mutiny you will have noticed that in s a as in the mutiny it is usually the irish and the scotch that are placed in the forefront of the battle an irish friend of mine says this is because the kelts are idealists and enthusiasts with ageold heroisms to emulate and keep bright before the world but that the lowclass englishman is dull and without ideals fighting bulldoggishly while he has a leader but losing his head and going to pieces when his leader fallsnot so with the kelt sir wm butler said the kelt is the spearhead of the british lance

public under      the name of gladstone park so called for the reason that in an      earlier time gladstone had frequently visited there  it was a      beautiful spot a place of green grass and spreading oaks  in a      letter in which mrs clemens wrote to her sister she said it is      simply divinely beautiful and peaceful the great old trees are      beyond everything  i believe nowhere in the world do you find such      trees as in england  clemens wrote to twichell  from the house      you can see little but spacious stretches of hayfields and green      turf  yet the massed brick

seem to have been less prompt     to the editor of the times in london  sirit has often been claimed that the london postal service was swifter than that of new york and i have always believed that the claim was justified but a doubt has lately sprung up in my mind i live eight miles from printing house square the times leaves that point at 4 oclock in the morning by mail and reaches me at 5 in

here to tea a week ago and it was a breath of american air to see them we furnished them a bright day and comfortable weatherand they used it all up in their extravagant american way since then we have sat by coal fires evenings  we shall sail for home sometime in october but shall winter in new york where we can have an osteopath of good repute to continue the work of putting this family in proper condition  livy and i dined with the chief justice a month ago and he was as wellconditioned as an athlete  it is all china now and my sympathies are with the chinese they have been villainously dealt with by the sceptred thieves of europe and i hope they will drive all the foreigners out and keep them out for good i only wish it of course i dont really expect it  why hang it it occurs to me that by the time we reach new york you twichells will be invading europe and once more we shall miss the connection this is thoroughly exasperating arent we ever going to meet again

habit then i will submit and adopt it  this is our day of mourning it is four years since susy died it is five years and a month that i saw her alive for the last timethrowing kisses at us from the railway platform when we started west around the world  sometimes it is a century sometimes it was yesterday                      with love                                    mark        we discover in the foregoing letter that the long european residence      was drawing to an end  more than nine years had passed since the      closing of the hartford houseeventful years that had seen failure      bereavement battle with debt and rehabilitated fortunes  all the      family were anxious to get homemark twain most anxious of all       they closed dollis hill house near the end of september and put up      for a brief period at a family hotel an amusing picture of which      follows     to j y m macalister in london                                                              sep  1900  my dear macalisterwe do really start next saturday i meant to sail earlier but waited to finish some studies of what are called family hotels they are a london specialty god has not permitted them to exist elsewhere they are ramshackle clubs which were dwellings at the time of the heptarchy dover and albemarle streets are filled with them the once spacious rooms are split up into coops which afford as much discomfort as can be had anywhere out of jail for any money all the modern inconveniences are furnished and some that have been obsolete for a century the prices are astonishingly high for what you get the bedrooms are hospitals for incurable furniture i find it so in this one they exist upon a tradition they represent the vanishing homelike inn of fifty years ago and are mistaken by foreigners for it some quite respectable englishmen still frequent them through inherited habit and arrested development many americans also through ignorance and superstition the rooms are as interesting as the tower of london but older i think older and dearer the lift was a gift of william the conqueror some of the beds are prehistoric they represent geological periods mine is the oldest it is formed in strata of old red sandstone volcanic tufa ignis fatuus and bicarbonate of hornblende superimposed upon argillaceous shale and contains the prints of prehistoric man it is in no 149 thousands of scientists come to see it they consider it holy they want to blast out the prints but cannot dynamite rebounds from it  finished studies and sail saturday in minnehaha

welcome  the press far and wide      sounded mark twains praises once more dinners and receptions were      offered on every hand editors and lecture agents clamored for him       the family settled in the earlington hotel during a period of      househunting  they hoped eventually to return to hartford but      after a brief visit paid by clemens alone to the old place he wrote     to sylvester baxter in boston                                               new york oct 26 1900  dear mr baxterit was a great pleasure to me to renew the other days with you and there was a pathetic pleasure in seeing hartford and the house again but i realize that if we ever enter the house again to live our hearts will break i am not sure that we shall ever be strong enough to endure that strain                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        mr and mrs rogers wished to have them in their neighborhood but      the houses there were not suitable or were too expensive  through      mr frank doubleday they eventually found at 14 west tenth street      a large residence handsomely furnished and this they engaged for      the winter  we were lucky to get this big house furnished he      wrote macalister in london  there was not another one in town      procurable that would answer us but this one is all rightspace      enough in it for several families the rooms all oldfashioned      great size       the little note that follows shows that mark twain had not entirely      forgotten the days of tom sawyer and huck finn     to a neighbor on west tenth street new york                                                         nov 30  dear madami know i ought to respect my duty and perform it but i am weak and faithless where boys are concerned and i cant help secretly approving pretty bad and noisy ones though i do object to the kind that ring doorbells my family try to get me to stop the boys from holding conventions on the front steps but i basely shirk out of it because i think the boys enjoy it  my wife has been complaining to me this evening about the boys on the front steps and under compulsion i have made some promises but i am very forgetful now that i am old and my sense of duty is getting spongy                      very truly yours                                    s l clemens        mark twains letters 19011906  volume v  by mark twain   arranged with comment by albert bigelow paine      xl letters of 1901 chiefly to twichell mark twain as a reformer summer at saranac assassination of president mckinley       an editorial in the louisville courierjournal early in 1901 said      a remarkable transformation or rather a development has taken      place in mark twain  the genial humorist of the earlier day is now      a reformer of the vigorous kind a sort of knight errant who does      not hesitate to break a lance with either church or state if he      thinks them interposing on that broad highway over which he believes      not a part but the whole of mankind has the privilege of passing in      the onward march of the ages       mark twain had begun breaking the lance very soon after his return      from europe  he did not believe that he could reform the world but      at least he need not withhold his protest against those things which      stirred his wrath  he began by causing the arrest of a cabman who      had not only overcharged but insulted him he continued by writing      openly against the american policy in the philippines the      missionary propaganda which had resulted in the chinese uprising and      massacre and against tammany politics  not all of his efforts were      in the line of reform he had become a sort of general spokesman      which the public flocked to hear whatever the subject  on the      occasion of a lincoln birthday service at carnegie hall he was      chosen to preside and he was obliged to attend more dinners than      were good for his health  his letters of this period were mainly      written to his old friend twichell in hartford  howells who lived      in new york he saw with considerable frequency       in the letter which follows the medicine which twichell was to take      was plasmon an english proprietary remedy in which mark twain had      investeda panacea for all human ills which osteopathy could not      reach      to rev joseph twichell in hartford                                     14 w 10th st  jan  23 01  dear joecertainly i used to take it in my coffee but it settled to the bottom in the form of mud and i had to eat it with a spoon so i dropped the custom and took my 2 teaspoonfuls in cold milk after breakfast if we were out of milk i shoveled the dry powder into my mouth and washed it down with water the only essential is to get it down the method is not important  no blame it i cant go to the alumni dinner joe it takes two days and i cant spare the time moreover i preside at the lincoln birthday celebration in carnegie hall feb 11 and i must not make two speeches so close together think of ittwo old rebels functioning therei as president and watterson as orator of the day things have changed somewhat in these 40 years thank god  look herewhen you come down you must be our guestweve got a roomy room for you and livy will make trouble if you go elsewhere come straight to 14 west 10th  jan 24 livy says amen to that also can you give us a day or twos notice so the room will be sure to be vacant  im going to stick close to my desk for a month now hoping to write a small book                 ys ever                          mark        the letter which follows is a fair sample of mark twains private      violence on a subject which in public print he could only treat      effectively by preserving his good humor  when he found it      necessary to boil over as he did now and then for relief he      always found a willing audience in twichell  the mention of his      private philosophy refers to what is man privately published      in 1906 reissued by his publishers in 1916     to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               14  w 10th jan  29 01  dear joeim not expecting anything but kicks for scoffing and am expecting a diminution of my bread and butter by it but if livy will let me i will have my say this nation is like all the others that have been spewed upon the earthready to shout for any cause that will tickle its vanity or fill its pocket what a hell of a heaven it will be when they get all these hypocrites assembled there  i cant understand it you are a public guide and teacher joe and are under a heavy responsibility to men young and old if you teach your peopleas you teach meto hide their opinions when they believe the flag is being abused and dishonored lest the utterance do them and a publisher a damage how do you answer for it to your conscience you are sorry for me in the fair way of give and take i am willing to be a little sorry for you  however i seem to be going counter to my own private philosophywhich livy wont allow me to publishbecause it would destroy me but i hope to see it in print before i die i planned it 15 years ago and wrote it in 98 ive often tried to read it to livy but she wont have it it makes her melancholy the truth always has that effect on people would have anyway if they ever got hold of a rag of itwhich they dont  you are supposing that i am supposing that i am moved by a large patriotism and that i am distressed because our president has blundered up to his neck in the philippine mess and that i am grieved because this great big ignorant nation which doesnt know even the a b c facts of the philippine episode is in disgrace before the sarcastic worlddrop that idea i care nothing for the resti am only distressed and troubled because i am befouled by these things that is all when i search myself away down deep i find this out whatever a man feels or thinks or does there is never any but one reason for itand that is a selfish one  at great inconvenience and expense of precious time i went to the chief synagogue the other night and talked in the interest of a charity school of poor jew girls i knowto the finest shadesthe selfish ends that moved me but no one else suspects i could give you the details if i had time you would perceive how true they are  ive written another article you better hurry down and help livy squelch it  shes out pottering around somewhere poor housekeeping slave and clara is in the hands of the osteopath getting the bronchitis pulled and hauled out of her it was a bad attack and a little disquieting it came day before yesterday and she hasnt sat up till this afternoon she is getting along satisfactorily now                      lots of love to you all                                              mark        mark twains religion had to do chiefly with humanity in its present      incarnation and concerned itself very little with any possible      measure of reward or punishment in some supposed court of the      hereafter  nevertheless psychic investigation always interested      him and he was goodnaturedly willing to explore even hoping      perhaps to be convinced that individuality continues beyond death      the letter which follows indicates his customary attitude in      relation to spiritualistic research  the experiments here      mentioned however were not satisfactory      to mrs charles mcquiston                                                    dobbs ferry

wife and i have experimented in the matter when opportunity offered and shall continue to do so  i enclose a letter which came this morningthe second from the same source mrs kis a missourian and lately she discovered by accident that she was a remarkable hypnotiser her best subject is a missouri girl miss white who is to come here soon and sustain strictly scientific tests before professors at columbia university mrs clemens and i intend to be present and we shall ask the pair to come to our house to do whatever things they can do meantime if you thought well of it you might write her and arrange a meeting telling her it is by my suggestion and that i gave you her address  someone has told me that mrs piper is discredited i cannot be sure but i think it was mr myers president of the london psychical research societywe heard of his death yesterday he was a spiritualist i am afraid he was a very easily convinced man we visited two mediums whom he and andrew lang considered quite wonderful but they were quite transparent frauds  mrs clemens corrects me one of those women was a fraud the other not a fraud but only an innocent wellmeaning driveling vacancy                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        in mark twains bermuda chapters entitled idle notes of an idle      excursion he tells of an old sea captain one hurricane jones who      explained biblical miracles in a practical even if somewhat      startling fashion  in his story of the prophets of baal for      instance the old captain declared that the burning water was      nothing more nor less than petroleum  upon reading the notes      professor phelps of yale wrote that the same method of explaining      miracles had been offered by sir thomas browne       perhaps it may be added that captain hurricane jones also appears in      roughing it as captain ned blakely      to professor william lyon phelps                                                    yale university                                              new york april 24 1901  my dear siri was not aware that old sir thomas had anticipated that story and i am much obliged to you for furnishing me the paragraph it is curious that the same idea should leave entered two heads so unlike as the head of that wise old philosopher and that of captain ned wakeman a splendidly uncultured old sailor but in his own opinion a thinker by divine right he was an old friend of mine of many years standing i made two or three voyages with him and found him a darling in many ways the petroleum story was not told to me he told it to joe twichell who ran across him by accident on a sea voyage where i think the two were the only passengers a delicious pair and admirably mated they took to each other at once and became as thick as thieves joe was passing under a fictitious name and old wakeman didnt suspect that he was a parson so he gave his profanity full swing and he was a master of that great art you probably know twichell and will know that that is a kind of refreshment which he is very capable of enjoying                      sincerely yours                               s l clemens        for the summer clemens and his family found a comfortable lodge in      the adirondacksa log cabin called the lairon saranac lake      soon after his arrival there he received an invitation to attend the      celebration of missouris eightieth anniversary  he sent the      following letter      to edward l dimmitt in st louis                                among the adirondack lakes july 19 1901  dear mr dimmittby an error in the plans things go wrong end first in this world and much precious time is lost and matters of urgent importance are fatally retarded invitations which a brisk young fellow should get and which would transport him with joy are delayed and impeded and obstructed until they are fifty years overdue when they reach him  it has happened again in this case  when i was a boy in missouri i was always on the lookout for invitations but they always miscarried and went wandering through the aisles of time and now they are arriving when i am old and rheumatic and cant travel and must lose my chance  i have lost a world of delight through this matter of delaying invitations fifty years ago i would have gone eagerly across the world to help celebrate anything that might turn up it would have made no difference to me what it was so that i was there and allowed a chance to make a noise  the whole scheme of things is turned wrong end to life should begin with age and its privileges and accumulations and end with youth and its capacity to splendidly enjoy such advantages as things are now when in youth a dollar would bring a hundred pleasures you cant have it when you are old you get it and there is nothing worth buying with it then  its an epitome of life the first half of it consists of the capacity to enjoy without the chance the last half consists of the chance without the capacity  i am admonished in many ways that time is pushing me inexorably along i am approaching the threshold of age in 1977 i shall be 142 this is no time to be flitting about the earth i must cease from the activities proper to youth and begin to take on the dignities and gravities and inertia proper to that season of honorable senility which is on its way and imminent as indicated above  yours is a great and memorable occasion and as a son of missouri i should hold it a high privilege to be there and share your just pride in the states achievements but i must deny myself the indulgence while thanking you earnestly for the prized honor you have done me in asking me to be present                      very truly yours                               s l clemens        in the foregoing mark twain touches upon one of his favorite      fancies that life should begin with old age and approach strong      manhood golden youth to end at last with pampered and beloved      babyhood  possibly he contemplated writing a story with this idea      as the theme but he seems never to have done so       the reader who has followed these letters may remember yung wing      who had charge of the chinese educational mission in hartford and      how mark twain with twichell called on general grant in behalf of      the mission  yung wing now returned to china had conceived the      idea of making an appeal to the government of the united states for      relief of his starving countrymen      to j h twichell in hartford                                          ampersand n y july 28 01  dear joeas you say it is impracticablein my case certainly for me to assist in an appeal to that congress of landthieves and liars would be to bring derision upon it and for me to assist in an appeal for cash to pass through the hands of those missionaries out there of any denomination catholic or protestant wouldnt do at all they wouldnt handle money which i had soiled and i wouldnt trust them with it anyway they would devote it to the relief of sufferingi know thatbut the sufferers selected would be converts the missionaryutterances exhibit no humane feeling toward the others but in place of it a spirit of hate and hostility and it is natural the bible forbids their presence there their trade is unlawful why shouldnt their characters be of necessity in harmony withbut never mind let it go it irritates me  later i have been reading yung wings letter again it may be that he is overwrought by his sympathies but it may not be so there may be other reasons why the missionaries are silent about the shensi2year famine and cannibalism it may be that there are so few protestant converts there that the missionaries are able to take care of them that they are not likely to largely concern themselves about catholic converts and the others is quite natural i think  that crude way of appealing to this government for help in a cause which has no money in it and no politics rises before me again in all its admirable innocence doesnt yung wing know us yet however he has been absent since 96 or 97 we have gone to hell since then kossuth couldnt raise 30 cents in congress now if he were back with his moving magyartale  i am on the front porch lower onemain deck of our little bijou of a dwellinghouse the lakeedge lower saranac is so nearly under me that i cant see the shore but only the water smallpored with rainsplashesfor there is a heavy downpour it is charmingly like sitting snuggled up on a ships deck with the stretching sea all aroundbut very much more satisfactory for at sea a rainstorm is depressing while here of course the effect engendered is just a deep sense of comfort and contentment the heavy forest shuts us solidly in on three sides there are no neighbors there are beautiful little tancolored impudent squirrels about they take tea 5 p m not invited at the table in the woods where jean does my typewriting

extravagant suggestion that i read the biography of phillips brooksthe very dullest book that has been printed for a century joe ten pages of mrs cheneys masterly biography of her fathersno five pages of itcontain more meat more sense more literature more brilliancy than that whole basketful of drowsy rubbish put together why in that dead atmosphere even brooks himself is dullhe wearied me oh how he wearied me  we had a noble good time in the yacht and caught a chinese missionary and drowned him                      love from us all to you all                                                   mark        the assassination of president mckinley occurred september 6 1901      such an event would naturally stir mark twain to comment on human      nature in general  his letter to twichell is as individual as it is      sound in philosophy  at what period of his own life or under what      circumstances he made the long journey with tragic intent there is      no means of knowing now  there is no other mention of it elsewhere      in the records that survive him      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                     ampersand tuesday sept 10 1901  dear joeit is another off day but tomorrow i shall resume work to a certainty and bid a long farewell to letterscribbling  the news of the president looks decidedly hopeful and we are all glad and the household faces are much improved as to cheerfulness oh the talk in the newspapers evidently the human race is the same old human race and how unjust and unreflectingly discriminating the talkers are under the unsettling effects of powerful emotion the talkers are saying wild things crazy thingsthey are out of themselves and do not know it they are temporarily insane yet with one voice they declare the assassin sanea man who has been entertaining fiery and reasondebauching maggots in his head for weeks and months why no one is sane straight along year in and year out and we all know it our insanities are of varying sorts and express themselves in varying formsfortunately harmless forms as a rulebut in whatever form they occur an immense upheaval of feeling can at any time topple us distinctly over the sanityline for a little while and then if our form happens to be of the murderous kind we must look outand so must the spectator  this ass with the unpronounceable name was probably more insane than usual this week or two back and may get back upon his bearings by and by but he was over the sanityborder when he shot the president it is possible that it has taken him the whole interval since the murder of the king of italy to get insane enough to attempt the presidents life without a doubt some thousands of men have been meditating the same act in the same interval but new and strong interests have intervened and diverted their overexcited minds long enough to give them a chance to settle and tranquilize and get back upon a healthy level again every extraordinary occurrence unsettles the heads of hundreds of thousands of men for a few moments or hours or days if there had been ten kings around when humbert fell they would have been in great peril for a day or moreand from men in whose presence they would have been quite safe after the excess of their excitement had had an interval in which to cool down i bought a revolver once and travelled twelve hundred miles to kill a man he was away he was gone a day with nothing else to do i had to stop and thinkand did within an hourwithin half of iti was ashamed of myselfand felt unspeakably ridiculous i do not know what to call it if i was not insane during a whole week my head was in a turmoil night and day fierce enough and exhausting enough to upset a stronger reason than mine  all over the world every day there are some millions of men in that condition temporarily and in that time there is always a momentperhaps only a single one when they would do murder if their man was at hand if the opportunity comes a shade too late the chances are that it has come permanently too late opportunity seldom comes exactly at the supreme moment this saves a million lives a day in the worldfor sure  no ruler is ever slain but the tremendous details of it are ravenously devoured by a hundred thousand men whose minds dwell unaware near the temporaryinsanity frontierand over they go now there is a daytwo daysthreeduring which no ruler would be safe from perhaps the half of them and there is a single moment wherein he would not be safe from any of them no doubt  it may take this present shootingcase six months to breed another rulertragedy but it will breed it there is at least one mind somewhere which will brood and wear and decay itself to the killingpoint and produce that tragedy  every negro burned at the stake unsettles the excitable brain of another onei mean the inflaming details of his crime and the lurid theatricality of his exit do itand the duplicate crime follows and that begets a repetition and that one another one and so on every lynchingaccount unsettles the brains of another set of excitable white men and lights another pyre115 lynchings last year 102 inside of 8 months this year in ten years this will be habit on these terms  yes the wild talk you see in the papers and from men who are sane when not upset by overwhelming excitement a u s senatorcullomwants this buffalo criminal lynched it would breed other lynchingsof men who are not dreaming of committing murders now and will commit none if cullom will keep quiet and not provide the exciting cause  and a district attorney wants a law which shall punish with death attempts upon a presidents lifethis mind you as a deterrent it would have no effector the opposite one the lunatics mindspace is all occupiedas mine waswith the matter in hand there is no room in it for reflections upon what may happen to him that comes after the crime  it is the noise the attempt would make in the world that would breed the subsequent attempts by unsettling the rickety minds of men who envy the criminal his vast notorietyhis obscure name tongued by stupendous kings and emperorshis picture printed everywhere the trivialest details of his movements what he eats what he drinks how he sleeps what he says cabled abroad over the whole globe at cost of fifty thousand dollars a dayand he only a lowly shoemaker yesterdaylike the assassin of the president of francein debt three francs to his landlady and insulted by herand today she is proud to be able to say she knew him as familiarly as you know your own brother and glad to stand till she drops and pour out columns and pages of her grandeur and her happiness upon the eager interviewer  nothing will check the lynchings and rulermurder but absolute silencethe absence of powpow about them how are you going to manage that by gagging every witness and jamming him into a dungeon for life by abolishing all newspapers by exterminating all newspaper men and by extinguishing gods most elegant invention the human race it is quite simple quite easy and i hope you will take a day off and attend to it joe i blow a kiss to you and am                                     lovingly yours                                                   mark        when the adirondack summer ended clemens settled for the winter in      the beautiful appleton home at riverdaleonthehudson  it was a      place of widespreading grass and shadea house of ample room  they      were established in it in time for mark twain to take an active      interest in the new york elections and assist a ticket for good      government to defeat tammany hall     xli letters of 1902 riverdale york harbor illness of mrs clemens  the year 1902 was an eventful one for mark twain in april he received a degree of lld from the university of missouri and returned to his native state to accept it this was his last journey to the mississippi river during the summer mrs clemenss health broke down and illnesses of one sort or another visited other members of the family amid so much stress and anxiety clemens had little time or inclination for work he wrote not many letters and mainly somber ones once by way of diversion he worked out the idea of a curious clubwhich he formedits members to be young girlsgirls for the most part whom he had never seen they were elected without their consent from among those who wrote to him without his consent and it is not likely that any one so chosen declined membership one selection from his letters to the french member miss helene picard of stdie france will explain the club and present a side of mask twain somewhat different from that found in most of his correspondence      to miss picard in stdie france                                riverdaleonthehudson february 22 1902  dear miss heleneif you will let me call you so considering that my head is white and that i have grownup daughters your beautiful letter has given me such deep pleasure i will make bold to claim you for a friend and lock you up with the rest of my riches for i am a miser who counts his spoil every day and hoards it secretly and adds to it when he can and is grateful to see it grow  some of that gold comes like yourself in a sealed package and i cant see it and may never have the happiness but i know its value without that and by what sum it increases my wealth  i have a club a private club which is all my own i appoint the members myself and they cant help themselves because i dont allow them to vote on their own appointment and i dont allow them to resign they are all friends whom i have never seen save one but who have written friendly letters to me  by the laws of my club there can be only one member in each country and there can be no male member but myself some day i may admit males but i dont knowthey are capricious and inharmonious and their ways provoke me a good deal it is a matter which the club shall decide  i have made four appointments in the past three or four months you as member for france a young highland girl as member for scotland a mohammedan girl as member for bengal and a dear and bright young niece of mine as member for the united statesfor i do not represent a country myself but am merely member at large for the human race  you must not try to resign for the laws of the club do not allow that you must console yourself by remembering that you are in the best of company that nobody knows of your membership except myselfthat no member knows anothers name but only her country that no taxes are levied and no meetings held but how dearly i should like to attend one  one of my members is a princess of a royal house another is the daughter of a village bookseller on the continent of europe for the only qualification for membership is intellect and the spirit of good will other distinctions hereditary or acquired do not count  may i send you the constitution and laws of the club i shall be so pleased if i may it is a document which one of my daughters typewrites for me when i need one for a new member and she would give her eyebrows to know what it is all about but i strangle her curiosity by saying there are much cheaper typewriters than you are my dear and if you try to pry into the sacred mysteries of this club one of your prosperities will perish sure  my favorite it is joan of arc my next is huckleberry finn but the familys next is the prince and the pauper yes you are righti am a moralist in disguise it gets me into heaps of trouble when i go thrashing around in political questions  i wish you every good fortune and happiness and i thank you so much for your letter                      sincerely yours                               s l clemens        early in the year clemens paid a visit to twichell in hartford and      after one of their regular arguments on theology and the moral      accountability of the human race arguments that had been going on      between them for more than thirty yearstwichell lent his visitor      freedom of the will by jonathan edwards to read on the way home      the next letter was the result      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               riverdaleonthehudson                                                        feb 02  dear joeafter complimentsmeaning what a good time you gave me what a happiness it was to be under your roof again etc etc see opening sentence of all translations of letters passing between lord roberts and indian princes and rulersfrom bridgeport to new york thence to home and continuously until near midnight i wallowed and reeked with jonathan in his insane debauch rose immediately refreshed and fine at 10 this morning but with a strange and haunting sense of having been on a three days tear with a drunken lunatic it is years since i have known these sensations all through the book is the glaze of a resplendent intellect gone mada marvelous spectacle no not all through the bookthe drunk does not come on till the last third where what i take to be calvinism and its god begins to show up and shine red and hideous in the glow from the fires of hell their only right and proper adornment by god i was ashamed to be in such company  jonathan seems to hold as against the arminian position that the man or his soul or his will never creates an impulse itself but is moved to action by an impulse back of it thats sound  also that of two or more things offered it it infallibly chooses the one which for the moment is most pleasing to itself perfectly correct an immense admission for a man not otherwise sane  up to that point he could have written chapters iii and iv of my suppressed gospel but there we seem to separate he seems to concede the indisputable and unshakable dominion of motive and necessity call them what he may these are exterior forces and not under the mans authority guidance or even suggestionthen he suddenly flies the logic track and to all seeming makes the man and not these exterior forces responsible to god for the mans thoughts words and acts it is frank insanity  i think that when he concedes the autocratic dominion of motive and necessity he grants a third position of minethat a mans mind is a mere machinean automatic machinewhich is handled entirely from the outside the man himself furnishing it absolutely nothing not an ounce of its fuel and not so much as a bare suggestion to that exterior engineer as to what the machine shall do nor how it shall do it nor when  after that concession it was time for him to get alarmed and shirkfor he was pointing straight for the only rational and possible nextstation on that piece of road the irresponsibility of man to god  and so he shirked shirked and arrived at this handsome result  man is commanded to do soandso it has been ordained from the beginning of time that some men shant and others cant  these are to be blamed let them be damned  i enjoy the colonel very much and shall enjoy the rest of him with an obscene delight                 joe the whole tribe shout love to you and yours                                                        mark        we have not heard of joe goodman since the trying days of 90 and      91 when he was seeking to promote the fortunes of the typesetting      machine  goodman meantime who had in turn been miner printer      publisher and farmer had been devoting his energies and genius to      something entirely new he had been translating the prehistoric      mayan inscriptions of yucatan and with such success that his work      was elaborately published by an association of british scientists      in due time a copy of this publication came to clemens who was full      of admiration of the great achievement      to j t goodman in california                                          riverdaleonthehudson                                                   june 13 02  dear joei am lost in reverence and admiration it is now twentyfour hours that i have been trying to cool down and contemplate with quiet blood this extraordinary spectacle of energy industry perseverance pluck analytical genius penetration this irruption of thunders and fiery splendors from a fair and flowery mountain that nobody had supposed was a sleeping volcano but i seem to be as excited as ever yesterday i read as much as half of the book not understanding a word but enchanted neverthelesspartly by the wonder of it all the study the erudition the incredible labor the modesty the dignity the majestic exclusiveness of the field and its lofty remoteness from things and contacts sordid and mean and earthy and partly by the grace and beauty and limpidity of the books unsurpassable english science always great and worshipful goes often in hodden grey but you have clothed her in garments meet for her high degree  you think you get poor pay for your twenty years no oh no you have lived in a paradise of the intellect whose lightest joys were beyond the reach of the longest purse in christendom you have had daily and nightly emancipation from the worlds slaveries and gross interests you have received a bigger wage than any man in the land you have dreamed a splendid dream and had it come true and today you could not afford to trade fortunes with anybodynot even with another scientist for he must divide his spoil with his guild whereas essentially the world you have discovered is your own and must remain so  it is all just magnificent joe and no one is prouder or gladder than                 yours always                               mark        at york harbor maine where they had taken a cottage for the      summera pretty place with howells not far distant at kittery      pointmrs clemenss health gave way  this was at a period when      telegraphic communication was far from reliable  the oldtime      western union had fallen from grace its system no longer      justified the best significance of that word  the new day of      reorganization was coming and it was time for it  mark twains      letter concerning the service at york harbor would hardly be      warranted today but those who remember conditions of that earlier      time will agree that it was justified then and will appreciate its      satire      to the president of the western union in new york                                               the pines                                         york harbor maine  dear siri desire to make a complaint and i bring it to you the head of the company because by experience i know better than to carry it to a subordinate  i have been here a month and a half and by testimony of friends reinforced by personal experience i now feel qualified to claim as an established fact that the telegraphic service here is the worst in the world except that boston  these services are actually slower than was the new york and hartford service in the days when i last complained to youwhich was fifteen or eighteen years ago when telegraphic time and train time between the mentioned points was exactly the same towit three hours and a half six days agoit was that raw day which provoked so much commentmy daughter was on her way up from new york and at noon she telegraphed me from new haven asking that i meet her with a cloak at portsmouth her telegram reached me four hours and a quarter laterjust 15 minutes too late for me to catch my train and meet her  i judge that the telegram traveled about 200 miles it is the best telegraphic work i have seen since i have been here and i am mentioning it in this place not as a complaint but as a compliment i think a compliment ought always to precede a complaint where one is possible because it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous and gentle reception  still there is a detail or two connected with this matter which ought perhaps to be mentioned and now having smoothed the way with the compliment i will venture them the head corpse in the york harbor office sent me that telegram altho 1 he knew it would reach me too late to be of any value 2 also that he was going to send it to me by his boy 3 that the boy would not take the trolley and come the 2 miles in 12 minutes but would walk 4 that he would be two hours and a quarter on the road 5 and that he would collect 25 cents for transportation for a telegram which the he knew to be worthless before he started it from these data i infer that the western union owes me 75 cents that is to say the amount paid for combined wire and land transportationa recoup provided for in the printed paragraph which heads the telegraphblank  by these humane and christian stages we now arrive at the complaint proper we have had a grave case of illness in the family and a relative was coming some six hundred miles to help in the sickroom during the convalescing period it was an anxious time of course and i wrote and asked to be notified as to the hour of the expected arrival of this relative in boston or in york harbor being afraid of the telegraphwhich i think ought not to be used in times of hurry and emergencyi asked that the desired message be brought to me by some swift method of transportation by the milkman if he was coming this way but there are always people who think they know more than you do especially young people so of course the young fellow in charge of this lady used the telegraph and at boston of all places except york harbor  the result was as usual let me employ a statelier and exacter term and say historical  the dispatch was handed to the h c of the boston office at 9 this morning it said shall bring a s to you eleven fortyfive this morning the distance traveled by the dispatch is forty or fifty miles i suppose as the traintime is five minutes short of two hours and the trains are so slow that they cant give a w u telegram two hours and twenty minutes start and overtake it  as i have said the dispatch was handed in at boston at 9 the expected visitors left boston at 940 and reached my house at 12 noon beating the telegram 2 solid hours and 5 minutes over  the boy brought the telegram it was baldheaded with age but still legible the boy was prostrate with travel and exposure but still alive and i went out to condole with him and get his last wishes and send for the ambulance he was waiting to collect transportation before turning his passing spirit to less serious affairs i found him strangely intelligent considering his condition and where he is getting his training i asked him at what hour the telegram was handed to the h c in boston he answered brightly that he didnt know  i examined the blank and sure enough the wary boston h c had thoughtfully concealed that statistic i asked him at what hour it had started from boston he answered up as brightly as ever and said he didnt know  i examined the blank and sure enough the boston h c had left that statistic out in the cold too in fact it turned out to be an official concealmentno blank was provided for its exposure and none required by the law i suppose it is a good onesided idea i remarked they can take your money and ship your telegram next year if they want toyouve no redress the law ought to extend the privilege to all of us  the boy looked upon me coldly  i asked him when the telegram reached york harbor he pointed to some figures following the signature at the bottom of the blank1214 i said it was now 145 and asked  do you mean that it reached your morgue an hour and a half ago  he nodded assent  it was at that time half an hour too late to be of any use to me if i wanted to go and meet my peoplewhich was the casefor by the wording of the message you can see that they were to arrive at the station at 1145 why did your h c send me this useless message cant he read is he dead  its the rules  no that does not account for it would he have sent it if it had been three years old i in the meantime deceased and he aware of it  the boy didnt know  because you know a rule which required him to forward to the cemetery today a dispatch due three years ago would be as good a rule as one which should require him to forward a telegram to me today which he knew had lost all its value an hour or two before he started it the construction of such a rule would discredit an idiot in fact an idioti mean a common ordinary christian idiot you understandwould be ashamed of it and for the sake of his reputation wouldnt make it what do you think  he replied with much natural brilliancy that he wasnt paid for thinking  this gave me a better opinion of the commercial intelligence pervading his morgue than i had had before it also softened my feelings toward him and also my tone which had hitherto been tinged with bitterness  let bygones be bygones i said gently we are all erring creatures and mainly idiots but god made us so and it is dangerous to criticise                           sincerely                                    s l clemens        one day there arrived from europe a caller with a letter of      introduction from elizabeth queen of rumania better known as      carmen sylva  the visitor was madam hartwig formerly an american      girl returning now because of reduced fortunes to find profitable      employment in her own land  her husband a man of high principle      had declined to take part in an affair of honor as recognized by      the continental code hence his ruin  elizabeth of rumania was one      of the most loved and respected of european queens and an author of      distinction  mark twain had known her in vienna  her letter to him      and his own letter to the public perhaps a second one for its date      is two years later follow herewith                        from carmen sylva to mark twain                                                    bucarest may 9 1902  honored masterif i venture to address you on behalf of a poor lady who is stranded in bucarest i hope not to be too disagreeable  mrs hartwig left america at the age of fourteen in order to learn to sing which she has done thoroughly her husband had quite a brilliant situation here till he refused to partake dans une afaire onereuse so it seems they havent a penny and each of them must try to find a living she is very nice and pleasant and her school is so good that she most certainly can give excellent singing lessons  i beg your pardon for being a bore to one i so deeply love and admire to whom i owe days and days of forgetfulness of self and troubles and the intensest of all joys heroworship people dont always realize what a happiness that is god bless you for every beautiful thought you poured into my tired heart and for every smile on a weary way                                                    carmen sylva                         from mark twain to the public                                                         nov  16 04  to whom it may concerni desire to recommend madame hartwig to my friends and the public as a teacher of singing and as a concertvocalist she has lived for fifteen years at the court of roumania and she brought with her to america an autograph letter in which her majesty the queen of roumania cordially certified her to me as being an accomplished and gifted singer and teacher of singing and expressed a warm hope that her professional venture among us would meet with success through absence in europe i have had no opportunity to test the validity of the queens judgment in the matter but that judgment is the utterance of an entirely competent authoritythe best that occupies a throne and as good as any that sits elsewhere as the musical world well knowsand therefore back it without hesitation and endorse it with confidence  i will explain that the reason her majesty tried to do her friend a friendly office through me instead of through someone else was not that i was particularly the right or best person for the office but because i was not a stranger it is true that i am a stranger to some of the monarchsmainly through their neglect of their opportunitiesbut such is not the case in the present instance the latter fact is a high compliment to me and perhaps i ought to conceal it some people would                                          mark twain          mrs clemenss improvement was scarcely perceptible  it was not      until october that they were able to remove her to riverdale and      then only in a specially arranged invalidcar  at the end of the      long journey she was carried to her room and did not leave it again      for many months      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                          riverdale n y oct 31 02  dear joeit is ten days since susy twichell wrote that you were laid up with a sprained shoulder since which time we have had no news about it i hope that no news is good news according to the proverb still authoritative confirmation of it will be gladly received in this family if some of you will furnish it moreover i should like to know how and where it happened in the pulpit as like as not otherwise you would not be taking so much pains to conceal it this is not a malicious suggestion and not a personallyinvented one you told me yourself once that you threw artificial power and impressiveness into places in your sermons where needed by banging the bibleyour own words you have reached a time of life when it is not wise to take these risks you would better jump around we all have to change our methods as the infirmities of age creep upon us jumping around will be impressive now whereas before you were gray it would have excited remark  poor livy drags along drearily it must be hard times for that turbulent spirit it will be a long time before she is on her feet again it is a most pathetic case i wish i could transfer it to myself between ripping and raging and smoking and reading i could get a good deal of a holiday out of it  clara runs the house smoothly and capably she is discharging a trialcook today and hiring another                      a power of love to you all                                                   mark        such was the state of mrs clemenss health that visitors      were excluded from the sick room and even clemens himself      was allowed to see her no more than a few moments at a time      these brief precious visits were the chief interests of his      long days  occasionally he was allowed to send her a few      lines reporting his occupations and these she was      sometimes permitted to answer  only one of his notes has      been preserved written after a day now rare of literary      effort  its signature the letter y stands for youth      always her name for him      to mrs clemens   dear heartive done another full days work and finished before 4 i have been reading and dozing since and would have had a real sleep a few minutes ago but for an incursion to bring me a couple of unimportant letters ive stuck to the bed all day and am getting back my lost ground next time i will be strictly careful and make my visit very shortjust a kiss and a rush thank you for your dear dear note you who are my own and only sweetheart                                          sleep well

h rogers some five      or six years earlier had taken charge of the fortunes of      helen keller making it possible for her to complete her      education  helen had now written her first booka      wonderful bookthe story of my life and it had been      successfully published  for a later generation it may be      proper to explain that the miss sullivan later mrs macy      mentioned in the letter which follows was the noble woman      who had devoted her life to the enlightenment of this blind      dumb girlhad made it possible for her to speak and      understand and indeed to see with the eyes of luminous      imagination       the case of plagiarism mentioned in this letter is not now      remembered and does not matter but it furnished a text for      mark twain whose remarks on the subject in general are      eminently worth while      to helen keller in wrentham mass                                               riverdaleonthehudson                                              st  patricks day 03  dear heleni must steal half a moment from my work to say how glad i am to have your book and how highly i value it both for its own sake and as a remembrances of an affectionate friendship which has subsisted between us for nine years without a break and without a single act of violence that i can call to mind i suppose there is nothing like it in heaven and not likely to be until we get there and show off i often think of it with longing and how theyll say there they comesit down in front i am practicing with a tin halo you do the same i was at henry rogerss last night and of course we talked of you he is not at all well you will not like to hear that but like you and me he is just as lovely as ever  i am charmed with your bookenchanted you are a wonderful creature the most wonderful in the worldyou and your other half togethermiss sullivan i mean for it took the pair of you to make a complete and perfect whole how she stands out in her letters her brilliancy penetration originality wisdom character and the fine literary competencies of her penthey are all there  oh dear me how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque was that plagiarism farce as if there was much of anything in any human utterance oral or written except plagiarism the kernel the soullet us go further and say the substance the bulk the actual and valuable material of all human utterancesis plagiarism for substantially all ideas are secondhand consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his temperament and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing when a great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries and ten thousand menbut we call it his speech and really some exceedingly small portion of it is his but not enough to signify it is merely a waterloo it is wellingtons battle in some degree and we call it his but there are others that contributed it takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph or a steam engine or a phonograph or a photograph or a telephone or any other important thingand the last man gets the credit and we forget the others he added his little mitethat is all he did these object lessons should teach us that ninetynine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms pure and simple and the lesson ought to make us modest but nothing can do that  then why dont we unwittingly reproduce the phrasing of a story as well as the story itself it can hardly happento the extent of fifty words except in the case of a child its memorytablet is not lumbered with impressions and the actual language can have gravingroom there and preserve the language a year or two but a grown persons memorytablet is a palimpsest with hardly a bare space upon which to engrave a phrase it must be a very rare thing that a whole page gets so sharply printed upon a mans mind by a single reading that it will stay long enough to turn up some time or other and be mistaken by him for his own no doubt we are constantly littering our literature with disconnected sentences borrowed from books at some unremembered time and now imagined to be our own but that is about the most we can do in 1866 i read dr holmess poems in the sandwich islands a year and a half later i stole his dictation without knowing it and used it to dedicate my innocents abroad with then years afterwards i was talking with dr holmes about it he was not an ignorant assno not he he was not a collection of decayed human turnips like your plagiarism court and so when i said i know now where i stole it but whom did you steal it from he said i dont remember i only know i stole it from somebody because i have never originated anything altogether myself nor met anybody who had  to think of those solemn donkeys breaking a little childs heart with their ignorant rubbish about plagiarism i couldnt sleep for blaspheming about it last night why their whole lives their whole histories all their learning all their thoughts all their opinions were one solid ruck of plagiarism and they didnt know it and never suspected it a gang of dull and hoary pirates piously setting themselves the task of disciplining and purifying a kitten that they think theyve caught filching a chop oh dam  but you finish it dear i am running short of vocabulary today ever lovingly your friend                                          mark  edited and modified by clara clemens deputy to her mother who for more than 7 months has been ill in bed and unable to exercise her official function        the burden of the clemens household had fallen almost entirely upon      clara clemens  in addition to supervising its customary affairs      she also shouldered the responsibility of an unusual combination of      misfortunes for besides the critical condition of her mother her      sister jean clemens was down with pneumonia no word of which must      come to mrs clemens  certainly it was a difficult position  in      some account of it which he set down later clemens wrote it was      fortunate for us all that claras reputation for truthfulness was so      well established in her mothers mind  it was our daily protection      from disaster  the mother never doubted claras word  clara could      tell her large improbabilities without exciting any suspicion      whereas if i tried to market even a small and simple one the case      would have been different  i was never able to get a reputation      like claras       the accumulation of physical ailments in the clemens home had      somewhat modified mark twains notion of medical practice  he was      no longer radical he had become eclectic  it is a good deal of a      concession that he makes to twichell after those earlier letters      from sweden in which osteopathy had been heralded as the anodyne      for all human ills      to rev j h twichell in hartford   dear joelivy does really make a little progress these past 3 or 4 days progress which is visible to even the untrained eye the physicians are doing good work with her but my notion is that no art of healing is the best for all ills i should distribute the ailments around surgery cases to the surgeons lupus to the actinicray specialist nervous prostration to the christian scientist most ills to the allopath and the homeopath in my own particular case rheumatism gout and bronchial attacks to the osteopathist  mr rogers was to sail southward this morningand here is this weather i am sorry i think its a question if he gets away tomorrow                                ys ever                                         mark        it was through j y m macalister to whom the next letter is      written that mark twain had become associated with the plasmon      company which explains the reference to shares  he had seen much      of macalister during the winter at tedworth square and had grown      fond of him  it is a characteristic letter and one of interesting      fact      to j y m macalister in london

an offence in some way and forfeited your friendshipa kind of blunder i have made so many times in my life that i am always standing in a waiting and morbid dread of its occurrence  three days ago i was in conditionduring one horribly long nightto sympathetically roast with you in your hell of troubles during that night i was back again where i was in the black days when i was buried under a mountain of debt i called the daughters to me in private council and paralysed them with the announcement our outgo has increased in the past 8 months until our expenses are now 125 per cent greater than our income  it was a mistake when i came down in the morning a gray and aged wreck and went over the figures again i found that in some unaccountable way unaccountable to a business man but not to me i had multiplied the totals by 2 by god i dropped 75 years on the floor where i stood  do you know it affected me as one is affected when he wakes out of a hideous dream and finds that it was only a dream it was a great comfort and satisfaction to me to call the daughters to a private meeting of the board again and say you need not worry any more our outgo is only a third more than our income in a few months your mother will be out of her bed and on her feet againthen we shall drop back to normal and be all right  certainly there is a blistering and awful reality about a wellarranged unreality it is quite within the possibilities that two or three nights like that night of mine could drive a man to suicide he would refuse to examine the figures they would revolt him so and he could go to his death unaware that there was nothing serious about them i cannot get that night out of my head it was so vivid so real so ghastly in any other year of these 33 the relief would have been simple go where you can cut your cloth to fit your income you cant do that when your wife cant be moved even from one room to the next  clam spells the trained nurse afternoons i am allowed to see mrs clemens 20 minutes twice a day and write her two letters a day provided i put no news in them no other person ever sees her except the physician and now and then a nervespecialist from new york she saw there was something the matter that morning but she got no facts out of me but that is nothingshe hasnt had anything but lies for 8 months a fact would give her a relapse  the doctor and a specialist met in conspiracy five days ago and in their belief she will by and by come out of this as good as new substantially they ordered her to italy for next winterwhich seems to indicate that by autumn she will be able to undertake the voyage so clara is writing a florence friend to take a look round among the villas for us in the regions near that city it seems early to do this but joan bergheim thought it would be wise  he and his wife lunched with us here yesterday they have been abroad in havana 4 months and they sailed for england this morning  i am enclosing an order for half of my your founders shares you are not to refuse them this time though you have done it twice before they are yours not mine and for your familys sake if not your own you cannot in these cloudy days renounce this property which is so clearly yours and theirs you have been generous long enough be just now to yourself mr rogers is off yachting for 5 or 6 weeksill get them when he returns the head of the house joins me in warmest greetings and remembrances to you and mrs macalister                           ever yours                                         mark  may 8 great scott i never mailed this letter i addressed it put registered on itthen left it lying unsealed on the arm of my chair and rushed up to my bed quaking with a chill ive never been out of the bed sinceoh bronchitis rheumatism two sets of teeth aching land ive had a dandy time for 4 weeks and todaygreat guns one of the very worst  im devilish sorry and i do apologisefor although i am not as slow as you are about answering letters as a rule i see where im standing this time  two weeks ago jean was taken down againthis time with measles and i havent been able to go to her and she hasnt been able to come to me  but mrs clemens is making nice progress and can stand alone a moment or two at a time  now ill post this                                     mark        the two letters that follow though written only a few days apart      were separated in their arrival by a period of seven years  the      second letter was in some way mislaid and not mailed and it was      not until after the writer of it was dead that it was found and      forwarded       mark twain could never get up much enthusiasm for the writings of      scott  his praise of quentin durward is about the only approval he      ever accorded to the works of the great romanticist      to brander matthews in new york                                               new york city may 4 03  dear branderi havent been out of my bed for four weeks butwell i have been reading a good deal and it occurs to me to ask you to sit down some time or other when you have 8 or 9 months to spare and jot me down a certain few literary particulars for my help and elevation your time need not be thrown away for at your further leisure you can make colombian lectures out of the results and do your students a good turn  1 are there in sir walters novels passages done in good englishenglish which is neither slovenly or involved  2 are there passages whose english is not poor and thin and commonplace but is of a quality above that  3 are there passages which burn with real firenot punk foxfire make believe  4 has he heroes and heroines who are not cads and cadesses  5 has he personages whose acts and talk correspond with their characters as described by him  6 has he heroes and heroines whom the reader admires admires and knows why  7 has he funny characters that are funny and humorous passages that are humorous  8 does he ever chain the readers interest and make him reluctant to lay the book down  9 are there pages where he ceases from posing ceases from admiring the placid flood and flow of his own dilutions ceases from being artificial and is for a time long or short recognizably sincere and in earnest  10 did he know how to write english and didnt do it because he didnt want to  11 did he use the right word only when he couldnt think of another one or did he run so much to wrong because he didnt know the right one when he saw it  13 can you read him and keep your respect for him of course a person could in his dayan era of sentimentality and sloppy romanticsbut land can a body do it today  brander i lie here dying slowly dying under the blight of sir walter i have read the first volume of rob roy and as far as chapter xix of guy mannering and i can no longer hold my head up nor take my nourishment lord its all so juvenile so artificial so shoddy and such wax figures and skeletons and spectres interest why it is impossible to feel an interest in these bloodless shams these milkandwater humbugs and oh the poverty of the invention not poverty in inventing situations but poverty in furnishing reasons for them sir walter usually gives himself away when he arranges for a situationelaborates and elaborates and elaborates till if you live to get to it you dont believe in it when it happens  i cant find the rest of rob roy i cant stand any more manneringi do not know just what to do but i will reflect and not quit this great study rashly he was great in his day and to his proper audience and so was god in jewish times for that matter but why should either of them rank high now and do theyhonest now do they damd if i believe it  my i wish i could see you and leigh hunt                                        sincerely yours                                              s l clemens      to brander matthews in new york                                riverdale may 803 mailed june 1910  dear branderim still in bed but the days have lost their dulness since i broke into sir walter and lost my temper i finished guy manneringthat curious curious book with its mob of squalid shadows jabbering around a single fleshandblood beingdinmont a book crazily put together out of the very refuse of the romanceartists stage propertiesfinished it and took up quentin durward and finished that  it was like leaving the dead to mingle with the living it was like withdrawing from the infant class in the college of journalism to sit under the lectures in english literature in columbia university  i wonder who wrote quentin durward                                     yrs ever                                              mark        in 1903 preparations were going on for a great worlds fair to be      held in st louis and among other features proposed was a worlds      literary convention with a week to be set apart in honor of mark      twain and a special mark twain day in it on which the national      association would hold grand services in honor of the distinguished      missourian  a letter asking his consent to the plan brought the      following reply      to t f gatts of missouri                                                    new york may 30 1903  dear mr gattsit is indeed a high compliment which you offer me in naming an association after me and in proposing the setting apart of a mark twain day at the great st louis fair but such compliments are not proper for the living they are proper and safe for the dead only i value the impulse which moves you to tender me these honors i value it as highly as any one can and am grateful for it but i should stand in a sort of terror of the honors themselves so long as we remain alive we are not safe from doing things which however righteously and honorably intended can wreck our repute and extinguish our friendships  i hope that no society will be named for me while i am still alive for i might at some time or other do something which would cause its members to regret having done me that honor after i shall have joined the dead i shall follow the customs of those people and be guilty of no conduct that can wound any friend but until that time shall come i shall be a doubtful quantity like the rest of our race                                very truly yours                                         s l clemens        the national mark twain association did not surrender easily  mr      gatts wrote a second letter full of urgent appeal  if mark twain      was tempted we get no hint of it in his answer      to t f gatts of missouri                                               new york june 8 1903  dear mr gattswhile i am deeply touched by the desire of my friends of hannibal to confer these great honors upon me i must still forbear to accept them spontaneous and unpremeditated honors like those which came to me at hannibal columbia st louis and at the village stations all down the line are beyond all price and are a treasure for life in the memory for they are a free gift out of the heart and they come without solicitations but i am a missourian and so i shrink from distinctions which have to be arranged beforehand and with my privity for i then became a party to my own exalting i am humanly fond of honors that happen but chary of those that come by canvass and intention with sincere thanks to you and your associates for this high compliment which you have been minded to offer me i am                                     very truly yours                                              s l clemens        we have seen in the letter to macalister that mark twains wife had      been ordered to italy and plans were in progress for an      establishment there  by the end of june mrs clemens was able to      leave riverdale and she made the journey to quarry farm elmira      where they would remain until october the month planned for their      sailing  the house in hartford had been sold and a house which      prior to mrs clemenss breakdown they had bought near tarrytown      expecting to settle permanently on the hudson had been let  they      were going to europe for another indefinite period       at quarry farm mrs clemens continued to improve and clemens once      more able to work occupied the study which mrs crane had built for      him thirty years before and where tom sawyer and huck finn and the      wandering prince had been called into being      to rev j h twichell in hartford conn

was going to answer it for her right away and said so but she reserved the privilege to herself i judge she is accumulating hot stuffas george ade would say  livy is coming along eats well sleeps some is mostly very gay not very often depressed spends all day on the porch sleeps there a part of the night makes excursions in carriage and in wheelchair and in the matter of superintending everything and everybody has resumed business at the old stand  did you ever go househunting 3000 miles away it costs three months of writing and telegraphing to pull off a success we finished 3 or 4 days ago and took the villa papiniano dam the name i have to look at it a minutes after writing it and then am always in doubt for a year by cable three miles outside of florence under fiesolea darling location and apparently a choice house near fiske  theres 7 in our gang all women but me it means trunks and things but thanks be today this is private comes a most handsome voluntary document with seals and escutcheons on it from the italian ambassador who is a stranger to me commanding the customs people to keep their hands off the clemenss things now wasnt it lovely of him and wasnt it lovely of me to let livy take a pencil and edit my answer and knock a good third of it out  and thats a nice shipthe irene newswift13000 tonsrooms up in the sky open to sun and airand all that i was desperately troubled for livyabout the downcellar cells in the ancient latin  the cubs are in riverdale yet they come to us the first week in august                 with lots and lots of love to you all                                         mark        the arrangement for the villa papiniano was not completed after      all and through a good friend george gregory smith a resident of      florence the villa quarto an ancient home of royalty on the hills      west of florence was engaged  smith wrote that it was a very      beautiful place with a southeastern exposure looking out toward      valombrosa and the chianti hills  it had extensive grounds and      stables and the annual rental for it all was two thousand dollars a      year  it seemed an ideal place in prospect and there was great      hope that mrs clemens would find her health once more in the      italian climate which she loved       perhaps at this point when mark twain is once more leaving america      we may offer two letters from strangers to himletters of      appreciationsuch as he was constantly receiving from those among      the thousands to whom he had given happiness  the first is from      samuel merwin one day to become a popular novelist then in the      hour of his beginnings      to mark twain from samuel merwin                                                         plainfield n j                                                        august 4 1903  dear mr clemensfor a good many years i have been struggling with the temptation to write you and thank you for the work you have done and today i seem to be yielding  during the past two years i have been reading through a group of writers who seem to me to represent about the best we havesir thomas malory spenser shakespeare boswell carlyle le sage in thinking over one and then another and then all of them together it was plain to see why they were great men and writers each brought to his time some new blood new ideasturned a new current into the stream i suppose there have always been the careful painstaking writers the men who are always taken so seriously by their fellow craftsmen it seems to be the unconventional man who is so rarei mean the honestly unconventional man who has to express himself in his own big way because the conventional way isnt big enough because ne needs room and freedom  we have a group of the more or less conventional men nowmen of dignity and literary position but in spite of their influence and of all the work they have done there isnt one of them to whom one can give ones self up without reservation not one whose ideas seem based on the deep foundation of all true philosophyexcept mark twain  i hope this letter is not an impertinence i have just been turning about with my head full of spenser and shakespeare and gil blas looking for something in our own present day literature to which i could surrender myself as to those five gripping old writings and nothing could i find until i took up life on the mississippi and huckleberry finn and just now the connecticut yankee it isnt the first time i have read any of these three and its because i know it wont be the last because these books are the only ones written in my lifetime that claim my unreserved interest and admiration and above all my feelings that ive felt i had to write this letter  i like to think that tom sawyer and huckleberry finn will be looked upon fifty or a hundred years from now as the picture of buoyant dramatic human american life i feel deep in my own heart pretty sure that they will be they wont be looked on then as the work of a humorist any more than we think of shakespeare as a humorist now i dont mean by this to set up a comparison between mark twain and shakespeare i dont feel competent to do it and im not at all sure that it could be done until mark twains work shall have its fair share of historical perspective but shakespeare was a humorist and so thank heaven is mark twain and shakespeare plunged deep into the deep sad things of life and so in a different way but in a way that has more than once brought tears to my eyes has mark twain but after all it isnt because of any resemblance for anything that was ever before written that mark twains books strike in so deep its rather because theyve brought something really new into our literaturenew yet old as adam and eve and the apple and this achievement the achievement of putting something into literature that was not there before is i should think the most that any writer can ever hope to do it is the one mark of distinction between the lonesome little group of big men and the vast herd of medium and small ones anyhow this much i am sure ofto the young man who hopes however feebly to accomplish a little something someday as a writer the one inspiring example of our time is mark twain                         very truly yours                                         samuel merwin   mark twain once said he could live a month on a good compliment and from his reply we may believe this one to belong in that class      to samuel merwin in plainfield n j                                                         aug  16 03  dear mr merwinwhat you have said has given me deep pleasureindeed i think no words could be said that could give me more                                very sincerely yours                                              s l clemens        the next compliment is from one who remains unknown for she      failed to sign her name in full  but it is a lovely letter and      loses nothing by the fact that the writer of it was willing to      remain in obscurity      to mark twain from margaret m                                                    portland oregon                                                   aug 18 1903  my dear dear mark twainmay a little girl write and tell you how dearly she loves and admires your writings well i do and i want to tell you your ownself dont think me too impertinent for indeed i dont mean to be that i have read everything of yours that i could get and parts that touch me i have read over and over again they seem such dear friends to me so like real live human beings talking and laughing working and suffering too one cannot but feel that it is your own life and experience that you have painted so do not wonder that you seem a dear friend to me who has never even seen you i often think of you as such in my own thoughts i wonder if you will laugh when i tell you i have made a hero of you for when people seem very sordid and mean and stupid and it seems as if everybody was then the thought will come like a little crumb of comfort well mark twain isnt anyway and it does really brighten me up  you see i have gotten an idea that you are a great bright spirit of kindness and tenderness one who can twist everybodyseven your ownfaults and absurdities into hearty laughs even the person mocked must laugh oh dear how often you have made me laugh and yet as often you have struck something infinite away down deep in my heart so that i want to cry while half laughing  so this all means that i want to thank you and to tell you god always love mark twain is often my wish i dearly love to read books and i never tire of reading yours they always have a charm for me goodbye i am afraid i have not expressed what i feel but at least i have tried                           sincerely yours                                    margaret m        clemens and family left elmira october the 5th for new york city      they remained at the hotel grosvenor until their sailing date      october 24th  a few days earlier mr frank doubleday sent a volume      of kiplings poems and de blowitzs memoirs for entertainment on the      ship  mark twains acknowledgment follows      to f n doubleday in new york                                                         the grosvenor                                                        october 12 03  dear doubledaythe books cameever so many thanks i have been reading the bell buoy and the old men over and over againmy custom with kiplings workand saving up the rest for other leisurely and luxurious meals a bellbuoy is a deeply impressive fellowbeing in these many recent trips up and down the sound in the kanawhamr rogerss yachthe has talked to me nightly sometimes in his pathetic and melancholy way sometimes with his strenuous and urgent note and i got his meaningnow i have his words no one but kipling could do this strong and vivid thing some day i hope to hear the poem chanted or sungwith the bellbuoy breaking in out of the distance  the old men delicious isnt it and so comically true i havent arrived there yet but i suppose i am on the way                                     yours ever                                              mark  p s your letter has arrived it makes me proud and gladwhat kipling says i hope fate will fetch him to florence while we are there i would rather see him than any other man  weve let the tarrytown house for a year man you would never have believed a person could let a house in these times that ones for sale the hartford one is sold when we buy again may wemay ibe damned  ive dipped into blowitz and find him quaintly and curiously interesting i think he tells the straight truth too i knew him a little 23 years ago       the appreciative word which kipling had sent doubleday was i love      to think of the great and godlike clemens  he is the biggest man      you have on your side of the water by a damn sight and dont you      forget it  cervantes was a relation of his     xliii letters of 1904 to various persons life in villa quarto death of mrs clemens the return to america       mrs clemens stood the voyage to italy very well and in due      time the family were installed in the villa reale di      quarto the picturesque old palace of cosimo a spacious      luxurious place even if not entirely cheerful or always      comfortable during the changeable tuscan winter      congratulated in a letter from macalister in being in the      midst of florentine sunshine he answered florentine      sunshine  bless you there isnt any  we have heavy fogs      every morning and rain all day  this house is not merely      large it is vasttherefore i think it must always lack the      home feeling       neither was their landlady the american wife of an italian      count all that could be desired  from a letter to      twichell however we learn that mark twains work was      progressing well      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                                    villa di quarto                                              florence jan 7 04  dear joe i have had a handsome success in one way here i left new york under a sort of half promise to furnish to the harper magazines 30000 words this year magazining is difficult work because every third page represents 2 pages that you have put in the fire because you are nearly sure to start wrong twice and so when you have finished an article and are willing to let it go to print it represents only 10 cents a word instead of 30  but this time i had the curious and unprecedented luck to start right in each case i turned out 37000 words in 25 working days and the reason i think i started right every time is that not only have i approved and accepted the several articles but the court of last resort livy has done the same  on many of the betweendays i did some work but only of an idle and not necessarily necessary sort since it will not see print until i am dead i shall continue this an hour per day but the rest of the year i expect to put in on a couple of long books halfcompleted ones no more magazinework hanging over my head  this secluded and silent solitude this clean soft air and this enchanting view of florence the great valley and the snowmountains that frame it are the right conditions for work they are a persistent inspiration today is very lovely when the afternoon arrives there will be a new picture every hour till dark and each of them divineor progressing from divine to diviner and divinest on this second floor claras room commands the finest she keeps a window ten feet high wide open all the time and frames it in i go in from time to time every day and trade sass for a look the central detail is a distant and stately snowhump that rises above and behind blackforested hills and its sloping vast buttresses velvety and sunpolished with purple shadows between make the sort of picture we knew that time we walked in switzerland in the days of our youth  i wish i could show your letter to livybut she must wait a week or so for it i think i told you she had a prostrating week of tonsillitis a month ago she has remained very feeble ever since and confined to the bed of course but we allow ourselves to believe she will regain the lost ground in another month her physician is professor groccoshe could not have a better and she has a very good trained nurse  love to all of you from all of us and to all of our dear hartford friends                      mark  p s 3 days later  livy is as remarkable as ever the day i wrote youthat night i meanshe had a bitter attack of gout or rheumatism occupying the whole left arm from shoulder to fingers accompanied by fever the pains racked her 50 or 60 hours they have departed nowand already she is planning a trip to egypt next fall and a winters sojourn there this is life in her yet  you will be surprised that i was willing to do so much magazinewritinga thing i have always been chary aboutbut i had good reasons our expenses have been so prodigious for a year and a half and are still so prodigious that livy was worrying altogether too much about them and doing a very dangerous amount of lying awake on their account it was necessary to stop that and it is now stopped  yes she is remarkable joe her rheumatic attack set me to cursing and swearing without limit as to time or energy but it merely concentrated her patience and her unconquerable fortitude it is the difference between us i cant count the different kinds of ailments which have assaulted her in this fiendish year and a halfand i forgive none of thembut here she comes up again as bright and fresh and enterprising as ever and goes to planning about egypt with a hope and a confidence which are to me amazing  clara is calling for mewe have to go into town and pay calls                                     mark        in florence that winter clemens began dictating to his secretary      some autobiographical chapters  this was the work which was not to      see print until i am dead  he found it a pleasant lazy occupation      and wrote his delight in it to howells in a letter which seems not      to have survived  in his reply howells wrote you do stir me      mightily with the hope of dictating and i will try it when i get the      chance  but there is the tempermental difference  you are dramatic      and unconscious you count the thing more than yourself i am cursed      with consciousness to the core and cant say myself out i am      always saying myself in and setting myself above all that i say as      of more worth  lately i have felt as if i were rotting with      egotism  i dont admire myself i am sick of myself but i cant      think of anything else  here i am at it now when i ought to be      rejoicing with you at the blessing you have found  id like      immensely to read your autobiography  you always rather bewildered      me by your veracity and i fancy you may tell the truth about      yourself  but all of it  the black truth which we all know of      ourselves in our hearts or only the whitybrown truth of the      pericardium or the nice whitened truth of the shirtfront  even      you wont tell the black heartstruth  the man who could do it      would be famed to the last day the sun shone upon       we gather from mark twains answer that he was not deceiving himself      in the matter of his confessions      to w d howells in new york                                               villa di quarto florence                                                        march 14 04  dear howellsyes i set up the safeguards in the first days dictating taking this position that an autobiography is the truest of all books for while it inevitably consists mainly of extinctions of the truth shirkings of the truth partial revealments of the truth with hardly an instance of plain straight truth the remorseless truth is there between the lines where the author is raking dust upon it the result being that the reader knows the author in spite of his wily diligences  the summer in england you cant ask better luck than that then you will run over to florence we shall all be hungry to see youall we are hunting for another villa this one is plenty large enough but has no room in it but even if we find it i am afraid it will be months before we can move mrs clemens of course it will but it comforts us to let on that we think otherwise and these pretensions help to keep hope alive in her                      goodbye with love amen                               yours ever                                         mark        news came of the death of henry m  stanley one of mark twains      oldest friends  clemens once said that he had met stanley in st      louis where he clemens had delivered a lecture which stanley had      reported  in the following letter he fixes the date of their      meeting as early in 1867 which would be immediately after mark      twains return from california and just prior to the quaker city      excursiona fact which is interesting only because it places the      two men together when each was at the very beginning of a great      career      to lady stanley in england                                     villa di quarto firenze may 11 04  dear lady

he was to you know that how far he stretches across my life i knew him when his work was all before him five years before the great day that he wrote his name faraway up on the blue of the sky for the world to see and applaud and remember i have known him as friend and intimate ever since it is 37 years i have known no other friend and intimate so long except john haya friendship which dates from the same year and the same half of it the first half of 1867 i grieve with you and with your family dear lady stanley it is all i can do but that i do out of my heart it would be we instead of i if mrs clemens knew but in all these 20 months that she has lain a prisoner in her bed we have hidden from her all things that could sadden her many a friend is gone whom she still asks about and still thinks is living  in deepest sympathy i beg the privilege of signing myself                           your friend                                         s l clemens      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                          villa di quarto may 11 04  dear joeyours has this moment arrivedjust as i was finishing a note to poor lady stanley i believe the last countryhouse visit we paid in england was to stanleys lord how my friends and acquaintances fall about me now in my grayheaded days vereschagin mommsen dvorak lenbach jokaiall so recently and now stanley i had known stanley 37 years goodness who is it i havent known as a rule the necrologies find me personally interestedwhen they treat of old stagers generally when a man dies who is worth cabling it happens that i have run across him somewhere some time or other  oh say down by the laurentian library theres a marble image that has been sitting on its pedestal some 450 years if my dates are rightcosimo i ive seen the back of it many a time but not the front but yesterday i twisted my head around after we had driven by and the profane exclamation burst from my mouth before i could think theres chauncey depew  i mean to get a photo of itand use it if it confirms yesterdays conviction thats a very nice word from the catholic magazine and i am glad you sent it i mean to show it to my priestwe are very fond of him he is a stealing man and is also learnedly scientific he invented the thing which records the seismatic disturbances for the peoples of the earth and hes an astronomer and has an observatory of his own  ah manys the cry i have over reflecting that maybe we could have had young harmony for livy and didnt have wit enough to think of it  speaking of livy reminds me that your inquiry arrives at a good time unberufen it has been weeks i dont know how many since we could have said a hopeful word but this morning katy came the minute the daynurse came on watch and said words of a strange and longforgotten sound mr clemens mrs clemens is really and truly betteranybody can see it she sees it herself and last night at 9 oclock she said it  thereit is heartwarming it is splendid it is sublime let us enjoy it let us make the most of it todayand bet not a farthing on tomorrow the tomorrows have nothing for us too many times they have breathed the word of promise to our ear and broken it to our hope we take no tomorrows word any more  youve done a wonder joe youve written a letter that can be sent in to livythat doesnt often happen when either a friend or a stranger writes you did whirl in a p s that wouldnt do but you wrote it on a margin of a page in such a way that i was able to clip off the margin clear across both pages and now livy wont perceive that the sheet isnt the same size it used to was it was about aldrichs son and i came near forgetting to remove it it should have been written on a loose strip and enclosed that son died on the 5th of march and aldrich wrote me on the night before that his minutes were numbered on the 18th livy asked after that patient and i was prepared and able to give her a grateful surprise by telling her the aldriches are no longer uneasy about him  i do wish i could have been present and heard charley clark when he cant light up a dark place nobody can                      with lots of love to you all                                                   mark        mrs clemens had her bad days and her good daysdays when there      seemed no ray of light and others that seemed almost to promise      recovery  the foregoing letter to twichell and the one which      follows to richard watson gilder reflect the hope and fear that      daily and hourly alternated at villa quarto      to richard watson gilder in new york                                          villa di quarto florence                                              may 12 04  dear gildera friend of ours the baroness de nolda was here this afternoon and wanted a note of introduction to the century for she has something to sell to you in case youll want to make her an offer after seeing a sample of the goods i said with pleasure get the goods ready send the same to me i will have jean typewrite them then i will mail them to the century and tonight i will write the note to mr gilder and start it along also write me a letter embodying what you have been saying to me about the goods and your proposed plan of arranging and explaining them and i will forward that to gilder too  as to the baroness she is a german 30 years old was married at 17 is very prettyindeed i might say very pretty has a lot of sons 5 running up from seven to 12 years old her husband is a russian they live half the time in russia and the other half in florence and supply population alternately to the one country and then to the other of course it is a family that speaks languages this occurs at their tablei know it by experience it is babel come again the other day when no guests were present to keep order the tribes were all talking at once and 6 languages were being traded in at last the littlest boy lost his temper and screamed out at the top of his voice with angry sobs mais vraiment io non capisco gar nichts  the baroness is a little afraid of her english therefore she will write her remarks in frenchi said theres a plenty of translators in new york examine her samples and drop her a line  for two entire days now we have not been anxious about mrs clemens unberufen after 20 months of bedridden solitude and bodily misery she all of a sudden ceases to be a pallid shrunken shadow and looks bright and young and pretty she remains what she always was the most wonderful creature of fortitude patience endurance and recuperative power that ever was but ah dear it wont last this fiendish malady will play new treacheries upon her and i shall go back to my prayers againunutterable from any pulpit                      with love to you and yours                                              s l c  may 13 10 am i have just paid one of my pair of permitted 2 minutes visits per day to the sick room and found what i have learned to expectretrogression and that pathetic something in the eye which betrays the secret of a waning hope        the year of the worlds fair had come and an invitation from gov      francis of missouri came to mark twain in florence personally      inviting him to attend the great celebration and carry off first      prize  we may believe that clemens felt little in the spirit of      humor but to such an invitation he must send a cheerful even if      disappointing answer      to gov francis of missouri                                               villa di quarto firenze                                                        may 26 1904  dear governor francisit has been a dear wish of mine to exhibit myself at the great fair and get a prize but circumstances beyond my control have interfered and i must remain in florence although i have never taken prizes anywhere else i used to take them at school in missouri half a century ago and i ought to be able to repeat now if i could have a chance i used to get the medal for good spelling every week and i could have had the medal for good conduct if there hadnt been so much corruption in missouri in those days still i got it several times by trading medals and giving boot i am willing to give boot now ifhowever those days are forever gone by in missouri and perhaps it is better so nothing ever stops the way it was in this changeable world although i cannot be at the fair i am going to be represented there anyway by a portrait by professor gelli you will find it excellent good judges here say it is better than the original they say it has all the merits of the original and keeps still besides it sounds like flattery but it is just true  i suppose you will get a prize because you have created the most prodigious and in all ways most wonderful fair the planet has ever seen very well you have indeed earned it and with it the gratitude of the state and the nation                                     sincerely yours                                                   mark twain       it was only a few days after the foregoing was written that death      entered villa quartounexpectedly at lastfor with the first june      days mrs clemens had seemed really to improve  it was on sunday      june 5th that the end came  clemens with his daughter jean had      returned from a long drive during which they had visited a villa      with the thought of purchase  on their return they were told that      their patient had been better that afternoon than for three months      yet it was only a few hours later that she left them so suddenly      and quietly that even those near her did not at first realize that      she was gone      to w d howells in new york                                          villa di quarto florence                                              june 6 94 1904  dear howellslast night at 920 i entered mrs clemenss room to say the usual goodnightand she was deadtho no one knew it she had been cheerfully talking a moment before she was sitting up in bedshe had not lain down for monthsand katie and the nurse were supporting her they supposed she had fainted and they were holding the oxygen pipe to her mouth expecting to revive her i bent over her and looked in her face and i think i spokei was surprised and troubled that she did not notice me then we understood and our hearts broke how poor we are today  but how thankful i am that her persecutions are ended i would not call her back if i could  today treasured in her worn old testament i found a dear and gentle letter from you dated far rockaway sept 13 1896 about our poor susys death i am tired and old i wish i were with livy  i send my loveand hersto you all                                     s l c        in a letter to twichell he wrote how sweet she was in death how      young how beautiful how like her dear girlish self cf thirty      years ago not a gray hair showing       the family was now without plans for the future until they      remembered the summer home of r w gilder at tyringham      massachusetts and the possibility of finding lodgment for      themselves in that secluded corner of new england  clemens wrote      without delay as follows      to r w gilder in new york                                               villa di quarto florence                                                   june 7 04  dear gilder familyi have been worrying and worrying to know what to do at last i went to the girls with an idea to ask the gilders to get us shelter near their summer home it was the first time they have not shaken their heads so tomorrow i will cable to you and shall hope to be in time  an hour ago the best heart that ever beat for me and mine went silent out of this house and i am as one who wanders and has lost his way she who is gone was our head she was our hands we are now trying to make planswe we who have never made a plan before nor ever needed to if she could speak to us she would make it all simple and easy with a word and our perplexities would vanish away if she had known she was near to death she would have told us where to go and what to do but she was not suspecting neither were we she had been chatting cheerfully a moment before and in an instant she was gone from us and we did not know it we were not alarmed we did not know anything had happened it was a blessed deathshe passed away without knowing it she was all our riches and she is gone she was our breath she was our life and now we are nothing  we send you our loveand with it the love of you that was in her heart when she died                           s  l  clemens        howells wrote his words of sympathy adding the character which      now remains a memory was one of the most perfect ever formed on the      earth and again after having received clemenss letter i cannot      speak of your wifes having kept that letter of mine where she did      you know how it must humiliate a man in his unworthiness to have      anything of his so consecrated  she hallowed what she touched far      beyond priests      to w d howells in new york

                            june 18 04  dear joeit is 13 days i am bewildered and must remain so for a time longer it was so sudden so unexpected imagine a man worth a hundred millions who finds himself suddenly penniless and fifty million in debt in his old age  i was richer than any other person in the world and now i am that pauper without peer some day i will tell you about it not now                                                              mark        a tide of condolence flowed in from all parts of the world  it was      impossible to answer all  only a few who had been their closest      friends received a written line but the little printed      acknowledgment which was returned was no mere formality  it was a      heartfelt personal word       they arrived in america in july and were accompanied by twichell to      elmira and on the 14th mrs clemens was laid to rest by the side of      susy and little langdon  r w gilder had arranged for them to      occupy for the summer a cottage on his place at tyringham in the      berkshire hills  by november they were at the grosvenor in new      york preparing to establish themselves in a house which they had      taken on the corner of ninth street and fifth avenuenumber 21      to f n doubleday in new york   dear doubledayi did not know you were going to england i would have freighted you with such messages of homage and affection to kipling and i would have pressed his hand through you for his sympathy with me in my crushing loss as expressed by him in his letter to gilder you know my feeling for kipling and that it antedates that expression  i was glad that the boys came here to invite me to the housewarming and i think they understood why a man in the shadow of a calamity like mine could not go  it has taken three months to repair and renovate our housecorner of 9th and 5th avenue but i shall be in it in io or 15 days hence much of the furniture went into it today from hartford we have not seen it for 13 years katy leary our old housekeeper who has been in our service more than 24 years cried when she told me about it today she said i had forgotten it was so beautiful and it brought mrs clemens right back to mein that old time when she was so young and lovely  jean and my secretary and the servants whom we brought from italy because mrs clemens liked them so well are still keeping house in the berkshire hillsand waiting clara nervously wrecked by her mothers death is in the hands of a specialist in 69th st and i shall not be allowed to have any communication with hereven telephonefor a year i am in this comfortable little hotel and still in bedfor i dasnt budge till im safe from my pet devil bronchitis  isnt it pathetic one hour and ten minutes before mrs clemens died i was saying to her today after five months search ive found the villa that will content you tomorrow you will examine the plans and give it your consent and i will buy it her eyes danced with pleasure for she longed for a home of her own and there on that morrow she lay white and cold and unresponsive to my reverent caressesa new thing to me and a new thing to her that had not happened before in five and thirty years  i am coming to see you and mrs doubleday by and bye she loved and honored mrs doubleday and her work                                     always yours                                                   mark        it was a presidential year and the air was thick with politics      mark twain was no longer actively interested in the political      situation he was only disheartened by the hollowness and pretense      of officeseeking and the methods of officeseekers in general      grieved that twichell should still pin his faith to any party when      all parties were so obviously venal and timeserving he wrote in      outspoken and rather somber protest      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                               the grosvenor nov 4 04  oh dear get out of that sewerparty politicsdear joe at least with your mouth we hail only two men who could make speeches for their parties and preserve their honor and their dignity one of them is dead possibly there were four i am sorry for john hay sorry and ashamed and yet i know he couldnt help it he wears the collar and he had to pay the penalty certainly he had no more desire to stand up before a mob of confiding human incapables and debauch them than you had certainly he took no more real pleasure in distorting history concealing facts propagating immoralities and appealing to the sordid side of human nature than did you but he was his partys property and he had to climb away down and do it  it is interesting wonderfully interestingthe miracles which partypolitics can do with a mans mental and moral makeup look at mckinley roosevelt and yourself in private life spotless in character honorable honest just humane generous scorning trickeries treacheries suppressions of the truth mistranslations of the meanings of facts the filching of credit earned by another the condoning of crime the glorifying of base acts in public political life the reverse of all this  mckinley was a silveriteyou concealed it roosevelt was a silveriteyou concealed it parker was a silveriteyou publish it along with a shudder and a warning he was unsafe then is he any safer now  joe even i could be guilty of such a thing as thatif i were in partypolitics i really believe it  mr cleveland gave the country the gold standard by implication you credit the matter to the republican party  by implication you prove the whole annual pensionscoop concealing the fact that the bulk of the money goes to people who in no way deserve it you imply that all the batteners upon this briberyfund are republicans an indiscreet confession since about half of them must have been democrats before they were bought  you as good as praise order 78 it is true you do not shout and you do not linger you only whisper and skipstill what little you do in the matter is complimentary to the crime  it means if it means anything that our outlying properties will all be given up by the democrats and our flag hauled down all of them not only the properties stolen by mr mckinley and mr roosevelt but the properties honestly acquired joe did you believe that hardy statement when you made it yet you made it and there it stands in permanent print now what moral law would suffer if we should give up the stolen ones but  you know our standardbearer he will maintain all that we have gainedby whatever process land i believe you  by george joe you are as handy at the game as if you had been in training for it all your life your campaign address is built from the ground up upon the oldest and best models there isnt a paragraph in it whose facts or morals will washnot even a sentence i believe  but you will soon be out of this you didnt want to do itthat is sufficiently apparent thanks bebut you couldnt well get out of it in a few days you will be out of it and then you can fumigate yourself and take up your legitimate work again and resume your clean and wholesome private character once more and be happyand useful  i know i ought to hand you some guff now as propitiation and apology for these reproaches but on the whole i believe i wont  i have inquired and find that mitsikuri does not arrive here until tomorrow night i shall watch out and telephone again for i greatly want to see him                      always yours                                    mark  p snov 4 i wish i could learn to remember that it is unjust and dishonorable to put blame upon the human race for any of its acts for it did not make itself it did not make its nature it is merely a machine it is moved wholly by outside influences it has no hand in creating the outside influences nor in choosing which of them it will welcome or reject its performance is wholly automatic it has no more mastership nor authority over its mind than it has over its stomach which receives material from the outside and does as it pleases with it indifferent to its proprietors suggestions even let alone his commands wherefore whatever the machine doesso called crimes and infamies includedis the personal act of its maker and he solely is responsible i wish i could learn to pity the human race instead of censuring it and laughing at it and i could if the outside influences of old habit were not so strong upon my machine it vexes me to catch myself praising the clean private citizen roosevelt and blaming the soiled president roosevelt when i know that neither praise nor blame is due to him for any thought or word or deed of his he being merely a helpless and irresponsible coffeemill ground by the hand of god       through a misunderstanding clemens something more than a year      earlier had severed his connection with the players club of which      he had been one of the charter members  now upon his return to new      york a number of his friends joined in an invitation to him to      return  it was not exactly a letter they sent but a bit of an old      scotch song                              to mark twain                                 from                              the clansmen                          will ye no come back again                          will ye no come back again                          better loed ye canna be                          will ye no come back again       those who signed it were david monroe of the north american review      robert reid the painter and about thirty others of the round table      group so called because its members were accustomed to lunching at      a large round table in a bay window of the player diningroom  mark      twains reply was prompt and heartfelt  he wrote      to robt reid and the others  wellbelovedsurely those lovely verses went to prince charleys heart if he had one and certainly they have gone to mine i shall be glad and proud to come back again after such a moving and beautiful compliment as this from comrades whom i have loved so long i hope you can poll the necessary vote i know you will try at any rate it will be many months before i can foregather with you for this black border is not perfunctory not a convention it symbolizes the loss of one whose memory is the only thing i worship  it is not necessary for me to thank youand words could not deliver what i feel anyway i will put the contents of your envelope in the small casket where i keep the things which have become sacred to me                                                    s  l  c   a year later mark twain did come back again as an honorary life member and was given a dinner of welcome by those who had signed the lines urging his return     xliv letters of 1905 to twichell mr duneka and others politics and humanity a summer at dublin mark twain at 70       in 1884 mark twain had abandoned the republican party to vote for      cleveland  he believed the party had become corrupt and to his      last day it was hard for him to see anything good in republican      policies or performance  he was a personal friend of theodore      roosevelts but as we have seen in a former letter roosevelt the      politician rarely found favor in his eyes  with or without      justification most of the presidents political acts invited his      caustic sarcasm and unsparing condemnation  another letter to      twichell of this time affords a fair example      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                                         feb 16 05  dear joei knew i had in me somewhere a definite feeling about the president if i could only find the words to define it with here they are to a hairfrom leonard jerome for twenty years i have loved roosevelt the man and hated roosevelt the statesman and politician  its mighty good every time in 25 years that i have met roosevelt the man a wave of welcome has streaked through me with the handgrip but whenever as a rule i meet roosevelt the statesman and politician i find him destitute of morals and not respectworthy it is plain that where his political self and his party self are concerned he has nothing resembling a conscience that under those inspirations he is naively indifferent to the restraints of duty and even unaware of them ready to kick the constitution into the back yard whenever it gets in the way and whenever he smells a vote not only willing but eager to buy it give extravagant rates for it and pay the bill not out of his own

insane each in his own way and with insanity goes irresponsibility theodore the man is sane in fairness we ought to keep in mind that theodore as statesman and politician is insane and irresponsible  do not throw these enlightenments aside but study them let them raise you to higher planes and make you better you taught me in my callow days let me pay back the debt now in my old age out of a thesaurus with wisdom smelted from the golden ores of experience                           ever yours for sweetness and light                                                             mark        the next letter to twichell takes up politics and humanity in      general in a manner complimentary to neither  mark twain was never      really a pessimist but he had pessimistic intervals such as come      to most of us in lifes later years and at such times he let      himself go without stint concerning the damned human race as he      called it usually with a manifest sense of indignation that he      should be a member of it  in much of his later writing      a mysterious stranger for examplehe said his say with but small      restraint and certainly in his purely intellectual moments he was      likely to be a pessimist of the most extreme type capably damning      the race and the inventor of it  yet at heart no man loved his      kind more genuinely or with deeper compassion than mark twain      perhaps for its very weaknesses  it was only that he had intervals      frequent intervals and rather long oneswhen he did not admire      it and was still more doubtful as to the ways of providence      to rev j h twichell in hartford                                                         march 14 05  dear joei have a puddnhead maxim  when a man is a pessimist before 48 he knows too much if he is an optimist after it he knows too little  it is with contentment therefore that i reflect that i am better and wiser than you joe you seem to be dealing in bulks now the bulk of the farmers and u s senators are honest as regards purchase and sale with money who doubts it is that the only measure of honesty arent there a dozen kinds of honesty which cant be measured by the moneystandard treason is treasonand theres more than one form of it the moneyform is but one of them when a person is disloyal to any confessed duty he is plainly and simply dishonest and knows it knows it and is privately troubled about it and not proud of himself judged by this standardand who will challenge the validity of itthere isnt an honest man in connecticut nor in the senate nor anywhere else i do not even except myself this time  am i finding fault with you and the rest of the populace noi assure you i am not for i know the human races limitations and this makes it my dutymy pleasant dutyto be fair to it each person in it is honest in one or several ways but no member of it is honest in all the ways required byby what by his own standard outside of that as i look at it there is no obligation upon him  am i honest i give you my word of honor private i am not for seven years i have suppressed a book which my conscience tells me i ought to publish i hold it a duty to publish it there are other difficult duties which i am equal to but i am not equal to that one yes even i am dishonest not in many ways but in some fortyone i think it is we are certainly all honest in one or several waysevery man in the worldthough i have reason to think i am the only one whose blacklist runs so light sometimes i feel lonely enough in this lofty solitude  yes oh yes i am not overlooking the steady progress from age to age of the coming of the kingdom of god and righteousness from age to ageyes it describes that giddy gait i and the rocks will not live to see it arrive but that is all rightit will arrive it surely will but you ought not to be always ironically apologizing for the deity if that thing is going to arrive it is inferable that he wants it to arrive and so it is not quite kind of you and it hurts me to see you flinging sarcasms at the gait of it and yet it would not be fair in me not to admit that the sarcasms are deserved when the deity wants a thing and after working at it for ages and ages cant show even a shade of progress toward its accomplishment wewell we dont laugh but it is only because we dasnt the source of righteousnessis in the heart yes and engineered and directed by the brain yes well history and tradition testify that the heart is just about what it was in the beginning it has undergone no shade of change its good and evil impulses and their consequences are the same today that they were in old bible times in egyptian times in greek times in middle age times in twentieth century times there has been no change  meantime the brain has undergone no change it is what it always was there are a few good brains and a multitude of poor ones it was so in old bible times and in all other timesgreek roman middle ages and twentieth century among the savagesall the savagesthe average brain is as competent as the average brain here or elsewhere i will prove it to you some time if you like and there are great brains among them too i will prove that also if you like  well the 19th century made progressthe first progress after ages and agescolossal progress in what materialities prodigious acquisitions were made in things which add to the comfort of many and make life harder for as many more but the addition to righteousness is that discoverable i think not the materialities were not invented in the interest of righteousness that there is more righteousness in the world because of them than there was before is hardly demonstrable i think in europe and america there is a vast change due to them in idealsdo you admire it all europe and all america are feverishly scrambling for money money is the supreme idealall others take tenth place with the great bulk of the nations named moneylust has always existed but not in the history of the world was it ever a craze a madness until your time and mine this lust has rotted these nations it has made them hard sordid ungentle dishonest oppressive  did england rise against the infamy of the boer war norose in favor of it did america rise against the infamy of the phillipine war norose in favor of it did russia rise against the infamy of the present war nosat still and said nothing has the kingdom of god advanced in russia since the beginning of time  or in europe and america considering the vast backward step of the moneylust or anywhere else if there has been any progress toward righteousness since the early days of creationwhich in my ineradicable honesty i am obliged to doubti think we must confine it to ten per cent of the populations of christendom but leaving russia spain and south america entirely out this gives us 320000000 to draw the ten per cent from that is to say 32000000 have advanced toward righteousness and the kingdom of god since the ages and ages have been flying along the deity sitting up there admiring well you see it leaves 1200000000 out of the race they stand just where they have always stood there has been no change  n b no charge for these informations do come down soon joe                           with love                                         mark        st clair mckelway of the brooklyn eagle narrowly escaped injuries      in a railway accident and received the following  clemens and      mckelway were old friends      to st clair mckelway in brooklyn                                          21 fifth ave  sunday morning                                                   april 30 1905  dear mckelway your innumerable friends are grateful most grateful  as i understand the telegrams the engineer of your train had never seen a locomotive before very well then i am once more glad that there is an everwatchful providence to foresee possible results and send ogdens and mcintyres along to save our friends  the governments official report showing that our railways killed twelve hundred persons last year and injured sixty thousand convinces me that under present conditions one providence is not enough to properly and efficiently take care of our railroad business but it is characteristically americanalways trying to get along shorthanded and save wages  i am helping your family congratulate themselves and am your friend as always                      s l clemens        clemens did not spend any more summers at quarry farm  all its      associations were beautiful and tender but they could only sadden      him  the life there had been as of another world sunlit idyllic      now forever vanished  for the summer of 1905 he leased the copley      green house at dublin new hampshire where there was a boston      colony of writing and artistic folk including many of his longtime      friends  among them was colonel thomas wentworth higginson who      wrote a hearty letter of welcome when he heard the news  clemens      replied in kind      to col thomas wentworth higginson in boston                                21 fifth ave  sunday march 26 1905  dear col higginsoni early learned that you would be my neighbor in the summer and i rejoiced recognizing in you and your family a large asset i hope for frequent intercourse between the two households i shall have my youngest daughter with me the other one will go from the restcure in this city to the restcure in norfolk conn and we shall not see her before autumn we have not seen her since the middle of october  jean the youngest daughter went to dublin and saw the house and came back charmed with it i know the thayers of oldmanifestly there is no lack of attractions up there mrs thayer and i were shipmates in a wild excursion perilously near 40 years ago  you say you send with this the story then it should be here but it isnt when i send a thing with another thing the other thing goes but the thing doesnt i find it laterstill on the premises will you look it up now and send it  aldrich was here half an hour ago like a breeze from over the fields with the fragrance still upon his spirit i am tired of waiting for that man to get old                           sincerely yours                                              s l c        mark twain was in his seventieth year old neither in mind nor body      but willing to take life more quietly to refrain from travel and      gay events  a sort of pioneers reunion was to be held on the      pacific coast and a letter from robert fulton of reno nevada      invited clemens to attend  he did not go but he sent a letter that      we may believe was the next best thing to those who heard it read      to robert fulton in reno nevada                                                    in the mountains                                                        may 24 1905  dear mr fultoni remember as if it were yesterday that when i disembarked from the overland stage in front of the ormsby in carson city in august 1861 i was not expecting to be asked to come again i was tired discouraged white with alkali dust and did not know anybody and if you had said then cheer up desolate stranger dont be downheartedpass on and come again in 1905 you cannot think how grateful i would have been and how gladly i would have closed the contract although i was not expecting to be invited i was watching out for it and was hurt and disappointed when you started to ask me and changed it to how soon are you going away  but you have made it all right now the wound is closed and so i thank you sincerely for the invitation and with you all reno and if i were a few years younger i would accept it and promptly i would go i would let somebody else do the oration but as for me i would talkjust talk i would renew my youth and talkand talkand talkand have the time of my life i would march the unforgotten and unforgettable antiques by and name their names and give them reverent hailandfarewell as they passed goodman mccarthy gillis curry baldwin winters howard nye stewart neely johnson hal clayton north rootand my brother upon whom be peaceand then the desperadoes who made life a joy and the slaughterhouse a precious possession sam brown farmer pete bill mayfield sixfingered jake jack williams and the rest of the crimson discipleshipand so on and so on believe me i would start a resurrection it would do you more good to look at than the next one will if you go on the way you are doing now  those were the days those old ones they will come no more youth will come no more they were so full to the brim with the wine of life there have been no others like them it chokes me up to think of them would you like me to come out there and cry it would not beseem my white head  goodbye i drink to you all have a good timeand take an old mans blessing                      mark twain        a few days later he was writing to h h bancroft of san francisco      who had invited him for a visit in event of his coming to the coast      henry james had just been there for a week and it was hoped that      howells would soon follow      to h h bancroft in san francisco                                                    up in new hampshire                                                        may 27 1905  dear mr bancrofti thank you sincerely for the tempting hospitalities which you offer me but i have to deny myself for my wandering days are over and it is my desire and purpose to sit by the fire the rest of my remnant of life and indulge myself with the pleasure and repose of workwork uninterrupted and unmarred by duties or excursions  a man who like me is going to strike 70 on the 30th of next november has no business to be flitting around the way howells doesthat shameless old fictitious butter fly but if he comes dont tell him i said it for it would hurt him and i wouldnt brush a flake of powder from his wing for anything i only say it in envy of his indestructible youth anyway howells will be 88 in october with thanks again                                sincerely yours                                         s l c        clemens found that the air of the new hampshire hills agreed with      him and stimulated him to work  he began an entirely new version of      the mysterious stranger of which he already had a bulky and nearly      finished manuscript written in vienna  he wrote several hundred      pages of an extravaganza entitled three thousand years among the      microbes and then having got his superabundant vitality reduced      it was likely to expend itself in these weird mental exploits      he settled down one day and wrote that really tender and beautiful      idyl eves diary which he had begun or at least planned the      previous summer at tyringham  in a letter to mr frederick a      duneka general manager of harper  brothers he tells something of      the manner of the story also his revised opinion of adams diary      written in 93 and originally published as a souvenir of niagara      falls      to frederick a duneka in new york                                                    dublin july 16 05  dear mr dunekai wrote eves diary she using adams diary as her unwitting and unconscious text of course since to use any other text would have been an imbecilitythen i took adams diary and read it it turned my stomach it was not literature yet it had been literature oncebefore i sold it to be degraded to an advertisement of the buffalo fair i was going to write and ask you to melt the plates and put it out of print  but this morning i examined it without temper and saw that if i abolished the advertisement it would be literature again  so i have done it i have struck out 700 words and inserted 5 ms pages of new matter 650 words and now adams diary is dam goodsixty times as good as it ever was before  i believe it is as good as eves diary nowno its not quite that good i guess but it is good enough to go in the same cover with eves im sure of that  i hate to have the old adam go out any moredont put it on the presses again lets put the new one in place of it and next xmas let us bind adam and eve in one cover they score points against each otherso if not bound together some of the points would not be perceived  p s please send another adams diary so that i can make 2 revised copies eves diary is eves lovestory but we will not name it that                                     yrs ever                                                   mark        the peacemaking at portsmouth between japan and russia was not      satisfactory to mark twain who had fondly hoped there would be no      peace until as he said russian liberty was safe  one more battle      would have abolished the waiting chains of millions upon millions of      unborn russians and i wish it could have been fought  he set down      an expression of his feelings for the associated press and it      invited many letters  charles francis adams wrote it attracted my      attention because it so exactly expresses the views i have myself      all along entertained       clemens was invited by colonel george harvey to dine with the      russian emissaries baron rosen and sergius witte  he declined but      his telegram so pleased witte that he asked permission to publish      it and announced that he would show it to the czar                 telegram  to col george harvey in new york  to colonel harveyi am still a cripple otherwise i should be more than glad of this opportunity to meet the illustrious magicians who came here equipped with nothing but a pen and with it have divided the honors of the war with the sword it is fair to presume that in thirty centuries history will not get done admiring these men who attempted what the world regarded as impossible and achieved it       witte would not have cared to show the czar the telegram in its      original form which follows        telegram unsent  to col george harvey in new york  to colonel harveyi am still a cripple otherwise i should be more than glad of this opportunity to meet those illustrious magicians who with the pen have annulled obliterated and abolished every high achievement of the japanese sword and turned the tragedy of a tremendous war into a gay and blithesome comedy if i may let me in all respect and honor salute them as my fellowhumorists i taking third place as becomes one who was not born to modesty but by diligence and hard work is acquiring it                                                  mark       nor still another unsent form perhaps more characteristic than      either of the foregoing           telegram unsent  to col george harvey in new york   dear colonelno this is a lovefeast when you call a lodge of sorrow send for me                                                    mark      to mrs crane quarry farm                                               dublin sept 24 05  susy dear i have had a lovely dream livy dressed in black was sitting up in my bed here at my right and looking as young and sweet as she used to do when she was in health she said what is the name of your sweet sister i said pamela oh yes that is it i thought it was naming a name which has escaped me wont you write it down for me i reached eagerly for a pen and padlaid my hands upon boththen said to myself it is only a dream and turned back sorrowfully and there she was still the conviction flamed through me that our lamented disaster was a dream and this a reality i said how blessed it is how blessed it is it was all a dream only a dream she only smiled and did not ask what dream i meant which surprised me she leaned her head against mine and i kept saying i was perfectly sure it was a dream i never would have believed it wasnt  i think she said several things but if so they are gone from my memory i woke and did not know i had been dreaming she was gone i wondered how she could go without my knowing it but i did not spend any thought upon that i was too busy thinking of how vivid and real was the dream that we had lost her and how unspeakably blessed it was to find that it was not true and that she was still ours and with us                                                         s l c        one day that summer mark twain received a letter from the actress      minnie maddern fiske asking him to write something that would aid      her in her crusade against bullfighting  the idea appealed to him      he replied at once      to mrs fiske   dear mrs fiskei shall certainly write the story but i may not get it to suit me in which case it will go in the fire later i will try againand yet againand again i am used to this it has taken me twelve years to write a short storythe shortest one i ever wrote i thinkprobably the death diskso do not be discouraged i will stick to this one in the same way sincerely yours                           s l clemens        he did not delay in his beginning and a few weeks later was sending      word to his publisher about it      to frederick a duneka in new york                                                    oct  2 05  dear mr dunekai have just finished a short story which i greatly admire and so will youa horses taleabout 15000 words at a rough guess it has good fun in it and several characters and is lively i shall finish revising it in a few days or more then jean will type it  dont you think you can get it into the jan and feb numbers and issue it as a dollar booklet just after the middle of jan when you issue the feb number  it ought to be ably illustrated  why not sell simultaneous rights for this once to the ladies home journal or colliers or both and recoup yourselffor i would like to get it to classes that cant afford harpers although it doesnt preach theres a sermon concealed in it                                yr sincerely                                              mark        five days later he added some rather interesting facts concerning      the new story      to f a duneka in new york                                          oct  7 1906 05  dear mr duneka ive made a poor guess as to number of words i think there must be 20000 my usual page of ms contains about 130 words but when i am deeply interested in my work and dead to everything else my handwriting shrinks and shrinks until theres a great deal more than 130 on a pageoh yes a deal more well i discover this morning that this tale is written in that small hand  this strong interest is natural for the heroine is my daughter susy whom we lost it was not intentionalit was a good while before i found it out  so i am sending you her picture to useand to reproduce with photographic exactness the unsurpassable expression and all may you find an artist who has lost an idol  take as good care of the picture as you can and restore it to me when i come  i hope you will illustrate this tale considerably not humorous pictures no when they are good or bad ones humor gets no chance to play surprises on the reader a humorous subject illustrated seriously is all right but a humorous artist is no fit person for such work you see the humorous writer pretends to absolute seriousness when he knows his trade then for an artistto step in and give his calculated gravity all away with a funny pictureoh my land it gives me the dry gripes just to think of it it would be just about up to the average comic artists intellectual level to make a funny picture of the horse kicking the lungs out of a trader hang it the remark is funnybecause the horse is not aware of it but the fact is not humorous it is tragic and it is no subject for a humorous picture  could i be allowed to sit in judgment upon the pictures before they are acceptedat least those in which cathy may figure  this is not essential it is but a suggestion and it is hereby withdrawn if it would be troublesome or cause delay  i hope you will reproduce the catpile full page and save the photo for me in as good condition as possible when susy and clara were little tots those cats had their profoundest worship and there is no duplicate of this picture these cats all had thundering names or inappropriate onesfurnished by the children with my help one was named buffalo bill  are you interested in coincidences  after discovering about the middle of the book that cathy was susy clemens i put her picture with my ms to be reproduced after the book was finished it was discovered that susy had a dim model of soldier boy in her arms i had forgotten all about that toy  then i examined the catpicture and laid it with the ms for introduction but it was not until yesterday that i remembered that one of the cats was named buffalo bill                                sincerely yours                                                   mark        the reference in this letter to shrinkage of his handwriting with      the increasing intensity of his interest and the consequent      addition of the number of words to the page recalls another fact      noted by mr duneka viz that because of his terse anglosaxon      diction mark twain could put more words on a magazine page than any      other writer  it is hardly necessary to add that he got more force      into what he put on the page for the same reason       there was always a run of reporters at mark twains new york home      his opinion was sought for on every matter of public interest and      whatever happened to him in particular was considered good for at      least half a column of copy with his name as a catchline at the      top  when it was learned that he was to spend the summer in new      hampshire the reporters had all wanted to find out about it  now      that the summer was ending they began to want to know how he had      liked it what work he had done and what were his plans for another      year  as they frequently applied to his publishers for these      details it was finally suggested to him that he write a letter      furnishing the required information  his reply handed to mr      duneka who was visiting him at the moment is full of interest                             mem  for mr duneka                                                    dublin oct 9 1905   as to the other matters here are the details  yes i have tried a number of summer homes here and in europe together  each of these homes had charms of its own charms and delights of its own and some of themeven in europe had comforts several of them had conveniences too they all had a view  it is my conviction that there should always be some water in a viewa lake or a river but not the ocean if you are down on its level i think that when you are down on its level it seldom inflames you with an ecstasy which you could not get out of a sandflat it is like being on board ship over again indeed it is worse than that for theres three months of it on board ship one tires of the aspects in a couple of days and quits looking the same vast circle of heaving humps is spread around you all the time with you in the centre of it and never gaining an inch on the horizon so far as you can see for variety a flight of flyingfish mornings a flock of porpoises throwing summersaults afternoons a remote whale spouting sundays occasional phosphorescent effects nights every other day a streak of black smoke trailing along under the horizon on the one single red letter day the illustrious iceberg i have seen that iceberg thirtyfour times in thirtyseven voyages it is always the same shape it is always the same size it always throws up the same old flash when the sun strikes it you may set it on any new york doorstep of a june morning and light it up with a mirrorflash and i will engage to recognize it it is artificial and it is provided and anchored out by the steamer companies i used to like the sea but i was young then and could easily get excited over any kind of monotony and keep it up till the monotonies ran out if it was a fortnight  last january when we were beginning to inquire about a home for this summer i remembered that abbott thayer had said three years before that the new hampshire highlands was a good place he was rightit was a good place any place that is good for an artist in paint is good for an artist in morals and ink brush is here too so is col t w higginson so is raphael pumpelly so is mr secretary hitchcock so is henderson so is learned so is summer so is franklin macveigh so is joseph l smith so is henry copley greene when i am not occupying his house which i am doing this season paint literature science statesmanship history professorship law moralsthese are all represented here yet crime is substantially unknown  the summer homes of these refugees are sprinkled a mile apart among the forestclad hills with access to each other by firm smooth country roads which are so embowered in dense foliage that it is always twilight in there and comfortable the forests are spiderwebbed with these good roads they go everywhere but for the help of the guideboards the stranger would not arrive anywhere  the villagedublinis bunched together in its own place but a good telephone service makes its markets handy to all those outliars i have spelt it that way to be witty the village executes orders on the boston planpromptness and courtesy  the summer homes are highperched as a rule and have contenting outlooks the house we occupy has one monadnock a soaring double hump rises into the sky at its left elbowthat is to say it is close at hand from the base of the long slant of the mountain the valley spreads away to the circling frame of the hills and beyond the frame the billowy sweep of remote great ranges rises to view and flows fold upon fold wave upon wave soft and blue and unwordly to the horizon fifty miles away in these october days monadnock and the valley and its framing hills make an inspiring picture to look at for they are sumptuously splashed and mottled and betorched from skyline to skyline with the richest dyes the autumn can furnish and when they lie flaming in the full drench of the midafternoon sun the sight affects the spectator physically it stirs his blood like military music  these summer homes are commodious well built and well furnishedfacts which sufficiently indicate that the owners built them to live in themselves they have furnaces and wood fireplaces and the rest of the comforts and conveniences of a city home and can be comfortably occupied all the year round  we cannot have this house next season but i have secured mrs uptons house which is over in the law and science quarter two or three miles from here and about the same distance from the art literary and scholastic groups the science and law quarter has needed improving this good while  the nearest railwaystation is distant something like an hours drive it is three hours from there to boston over a branch line you can go to new york in six hours per branch lines if you change cars every time you think of it but it is better to go to boston and stop over and take the trunk line next day then you do not get lost  it is claimed that the atmosphere of the new hampshire highlands is exceptionally bracing and stimulating and a fine aid to hard and continuous work it is a just claim i think i came in may and wrought 35 successive days without a break it is possible that i could not have done it elsewhere i do not know i have not had any disposition to try it before i think i got the disposition out of the atmosphere this time i feel quite sure in fact that that is where it came from  i am ashamed to confess what an intolerable pile of manuscript i ground out in the 35 days therefore i will keep the number of words to myself i wrote the first half of a long talethe adventures of a microbe and put it away for a finish next summer and started another long talethe mysterious stranger i wrote the first half of it and put it with the other for a finish next summer i stopped then i was not tired but i had no books on hand that needed finishing this year except one that was seven years old after a little i took that one up and finished it not for publication but to have it ready for revision next summer  since i stopped work i have had a two months holiday the summer has been my working time for 35 years to have a holiday in it in america is new for me i have not broken it except to write eves diary and a horses taleshort things occupying the mill 12 days  this year our summer is 6 months long and ends with november and the flight home to new york but next year we hope and expect to stretch it another month and end it the first of december                               no signature        the fact that he was a persistent smoker was widely known and many      friends and admirers of mark twain sent him cigars most of which he      could not use because they were too good  he did not care for      havana cigars but smoked the fragrant inexpensive domestic tobacco      with plenty of pep in it as we say today  now and then he had an      opportunity to head off some liberal friend who wrote asking      permission to contribute to his cigar collection as instance the      following      to rev l m powers in haverhill mass                                                    nov 9 1905  dear mr powersi should accept your hospitable offer at once but for the fact i couldnt do it and remain honest that is to say if i allowed you to send me what you believe to be good cigars it would distinctly mean that i meant to smoke them whereas i should do nothing of the kind i know a good cigar better than you do for i have had 60 years experience  no that is not what i mean i mean i know a bad cigar better than anybody else i judge by the price only if it costs above 5 cents i know it to be either foreign or halfforeign and unsmokeable by me i have many boxes of havana cigars of all prices from 20 cts apiece up to 166 apiece i bought none of them they were all presents they are an accumulation of several years i have never smoked one of them and never shall i work them off on the visitor you shall have a chance when you come  pessimists are born not made optimists are born not made but no man is born either pessimist wholly or optimist wholly perhaps he is pessimistic along certain lines and optimistic along certain others that is my case                      sincerely yours                               s l clemens        in spite of all the fine photographs that were made of him there      recurred constantly among those sent him to be autographed a print      of one which years before sarony had made and placed on public      sale  it was a good photograph mechanically and even artistically      but it did not please mark twain  whenever he saw it he recalled      sarony with bitterness and severity  once he received an inquiry      concerning it and thus feelingly expressed himself      to mr row no address                                               21 fifth avenue new york                                                   november 14 1905  dear mr rowthat alleged portrait has a private history sarony was as much of an enthusiast about wild animals as he was about photography and when du chaillu brought the first gorilla to this country in 1819 he came to me in a fever of excitement and asked me if my father was of record and authentic i said he was then sarony without any abatement of his excitement asked if my grandfather also was of record and authentic i said he was then sarony with still rising excitement and with joy added to it said he had found my great grandfather in the person of the gorilla and had recognized him at once by his resemblance to me i was deeply hurt but did not reveal this because i knew saxony meant no offense for the gorilla had not done him any harm and he was not a man who would say an unkind thing about a gorilla wantonly i went with him to inspect the ancestor and examined him from several points of view without being able to detect anything more than a passing resemblance wait said sarony with confidence let me show you he borrowed my overcoatand put it on the gorilla the result was surprising i saw that the gorilla while not looking distinctly like me was exactly what my great grand father would have looked like if i had had one sarong photographed the creature in that overcoat and spread the picture about the world it has remained spread about the world ever since it turns up every week in some newspaper somewhere or other it is not my favorite but to my exasperation it is everybody elses do you think you could get it suppressed for me i will pay the limit                                sincerely yours                                         s l clemens        the year 1905 closed triumphantly for mark twain  the great      seventieth birthday dinner planned by colonel george harvey is      remembered today as the most notable festival occasion in new york      literary history

summer in dublin billiards and copyright       mark twain at pier seventy as he called it paused to look      backward and to record some memoirs of his long eventful past  the      autobiography dictations begun in florence were resumed and daily      he traveled back recalling longago scenes and allbutforgotten      places  he was not without reminders  now and again there came      some message that brought back the old daysthe tom sawyer and huck      finn daysor the romance of the river that he never recalled other      than with tenderness and a tone of regret that it was gone  an      invitation to the golden wedding of two ancient friends moved and      saddened him and his answer to it conveys about all the story of      life      to mr and mrs gordon                                                         21 fifth avenue                                                        jan 24 06  dear gordonsi have just received your goldenwedding at home and am trying to adjust my focus to it and realize how much it means it is inconceivable with a simple sweep it carries me back over a stretch of time measurable only in astronomical terms and geological periods it brings before me mrs gordon young roundlimbed handsome and with her the youngbloods and their two babies and laura wright that unspoiled little maid that fresh flower of the woods and the prairies fortyeight years ago  life was a fairytale then it is a tragedy now when i was 43 and john hay 41 he said life was a tragedy after 40 and i disputed it three years ago he asked me to testify again i counted my graves and there was nothing for me to say  i am old i recognize it but i dont realize it i wonder if a person ever really ceases to feel youngi mean for a whole day at a time my love to you both and

whiskey with his collection of      pipes and cigars and tobacco on a little table by his bedside      during restless nights he found a small quantity of it conducive to      sleep  andrew carnegie learning of this custom made it his      business to supply scotch of his own special importation  the first      case came direct from scotland  when it arrived clemens sent this      characteristic acknowledgment      to andrew carnegie in scotland                                          21 fifth ave  feb 10 06  dear st andrewthe whisky arrived in due course from over the water last week one bottle of it was extracted from the wood and inserted into me on the instalment plan with this result that i believe it to be the best smoothest whisky now on the planet thanks oh thanks i have discarded peruna  hoping that you three are well and happy and will be coming back before the winter sets in                           i am                               sincerely yours

grant mainly with a view of advertising the lecture      that clemens had agreed to deliver for the benefit of the robert      fulton monument association  it was in fact to be mark twains      farewell lecture and the association had really proposed to pay      him a thousand dollars for it  the exchange of these letters      however was never made outside of mark twains bedroom  propped      against the pillows pen in hand with general grant beside him      they arranged the series with the idea of publication  later the      plan was discarded so that this pleasant foolery appears here for      the first time                            private and confidential                               correspondence                                   telegram

because i get so much instruction and moral upheaval out of it but i lose the bulk of this joy when i charge for it let the terms stand  general if i have your approval i wish to use this good occasion to retire permanently from the platform                                     truly yours                                              s l clemens    dear mr clemenscertainly but as an old

payplatform i shant retire from the gratisplatform until after i am dead and courtesy requires me to keep still and not disturb the others  what shall i talk about my idea is this to instruct the audience about robert fulton and tell mewas that his real name or was it his nom de plume however never mind it is not importanti can skip it and the house will think i knew all about it but forgot could you find out for me if he was one of the signers of the declaration and which one but if it is any trouble let it alone i can skip it was he out with paul jones will you ask horace porter and ask him if he brought both of them home these will be very interesting facts if they can be established but never mind dont trouble porter i can establish them anyway the way i look at it they are historical gemsgems of the very first water  well that is my idea as i have said first excite the audience with a spoonful of information about fulton then quiet down with a barrel of illustration drawn by memory from my booksand if you dont say anything the house will think they never heard of it before because people dont really read your books they only say they do to keep you from feeling bad next excite the house with another spoonful of fultonian fact then tranquilize them again with another barrel of illustration and so on and so on all through the evening and if you are discreet and dont tell them the illustrations dont illustrate anything they wont notice it and i will send them home as wellinformed about robert fulton as i am myself dont be afraid i know all about audiences they believe everything you say except when you are telling the truth                      truly yours                                    s l clemens  ps mark all the advertisements private and

to keep on talking till i get the audience cowed sometimes it takes an hour and fifteen minutes sometimes i can do it in an hour                                sincerely yours

uniform on the stage also the rest of the officials of the association also other distinguished peopleall the attractions we can get also a seat for mr albert bigelow paine who may be useful to me if he is near me and on the front                                          s l c        the seat chosen for the writer of these notes was to be at the front      of the stage in order that the lecturer might lean over now and then      and pretend to be asking information concerning fulton  i was not      entirely happy in the thought of this showy honor and breathed more      freely when this plan was abandoned and the part assigned to general      grant       the lecture was given in carnegie hall which had been gayly      decorated for the occasion  the house was more than filled and a      great sum of money was realized for the fund       it was that spring that gorky and tchaikowski the russian      revolutionists came to america hoping to arouse interest in their      cause  the idea of the overthrow of the russian dynasty was      pleasant to mark twain  few things would have given him greater      comfort than to have known that a little more than ten years would      see the downfall of russian imperialism  the letter which follows      was a reply to an invitation from tchaikowski urging him to speak      at one of the meetings    dear mr tchaikowskii thank you for the honor of the invitation but i am not able to accept it because on thursday evening i shall be presiding at a meeting whose object is to find remunerative work for certain classes of our blind who would gladly support themselves if they had the opportunity  my sympathies are with the russian revolution of course it goes without saying i hope it will succeed and now that i have talked with you i take heart to believe it will government by falsified promises by lies by treacheries and by the butcherknife for the aggrandizement of a single family of drones and its idle and vicious kin has been borne quite long enough in russia i should think and it is to be hoped that the roused nation now rising in its strength will presently put an end to it and set up the republic in its place some of us even of the white headed may live to see the blessed day when czars and grand dukes will be as scarce there as i trust they are in heaven                           most sincerely yours                                                   mark twain        there came another summer at dublin new hampshire this time in the      fine upton residence on the other slope of monadnock a place of      equally beautiful surroundings and an even more extended view      clemens was at this time working steadily on his socalled      autobiography which was not that in fact but a series of      remarkable chapters reminiscent reflective commentative written      without any particular sequence as to time or subjectmatter  he      dictated these chapters to a stenographer usually in the open air      sitting in a comfortable rocker or pacing up and down the long      veranda that faced a vast expanse of wooded slope and lake and      distant blue mountains  it became one of the happiest occupations      of his later years      to w d howells in maine                                     dublin sunday june 17 06  dear howells the dictating goes lazily and pleasantly on with intervals i find that i have been at it off and on nearly two hours a day for 155 days since jan 9 to be exact ive dictated 75 hours in 80 days and loafed 75 days ive added 60000 words in the month that ive been here which indicates that ive dictated during 20 days of that time40 hours at an average of 1500 words an hour its a plenty and i am satisfied  theres a good deal of fat ive dictated from jan 9 210000 words and the fat adds about 50000 more  the fat is old pigeonholed things of the years gone by which i or editors didnt dast to print for instance i am dumping in the little old book which i read to you in hartford about 30 years ago and which you said publishand ask dean stanley to furnish an introduction hell do it captain stormfields visit to heaven it reads quite to suit me without altering a word now that it isnt to see print until i am dead  tomorrow i mean to dictate a chapter which will get my heirs and assigns burnt alive if they venture to print it this side of 2006 adwhich i judge they wont therell be lots of such chapters if i live 3 or 4 years longer the edition of ad 2006 will make a stir when it comes out i shall be hovering around taking notice along with other dead pals you are invited                                     mark       his tendency to estimate the measure of the work he was doing and      had completed must have clung to him from his old printer days       the chapter which was to get his heirs and assigns burned alive was      on the orthodox god and there was more than one such chapter  in      the next letter he refers to two exquisite poems by howells and the      writer of these notes recalls his wonderful reading of them aloud      in our town was a collection of short stories then recently issued      by william allen white  howells had recommended them      to w d howells in maine                                               21 fifth ave tuesday eve  dear howellsit is lovely of you to say those beautiful thingsi dont know how to thank you enough but i love you that i know  i read after the wedding aloud and we felt all the pain of it and the truth it was very moving and very beautifulwould have been overcomingly moving at times but for the haltings and pauses compelled by the difficulties of msthese were a protection in that they furnished me time to brace up my voice and get a new start jean wanted to keep the ms for another readingaloud and for keeps too i suspected but i said it would be safest to write you about it  i like in our town particularly that colonel of the lookout mountain oration and very particularly pages 21216 i wrote and told white so  after after the wedding i read the mother aloud and sounded its human deeps with your deepsea lead i had not read it before since it was first published  i have been dictating some fearful things for 4 successive morningsfor no eye but yours to see until i have been dead a centuryif then but i got them out of my system where they had been festering for yearsand that was the main thing i feel better now  i came down today on businessfrom house to house in 12 12 hours and expected to arrive dead but am neither tired nor sleepy

score finely when subjected to the most exacting of teststhe reading aloud pages 197 and 216 are of that grade i have tried them a couple of times on the family and pages 212 and 216 are qualified to fetch any house of any country caste or color endowed with those riches which are denied to no nation on the planethumor and feeling  talk againthe country is listening                                sincerely yours                                         s l clemens        witter bynner the poet was one of the editors of mcclures      magazine at this time but was trying to muster the courage to give      up routine work for versemaking and the possibility of poverty      clemens was fond of bynner and believed in his work  he did not      advise him however to break away entirely from a salaried      positionat least not immediately but one day bynner did so and      reported the step he had taken with some doubt as to the answer he      would receive      to witter bynner in new york                                                    dublin oct 5 1906  dear poetyou have certainly done right for several good reasons at least of them i can name two  1 with your reputation you can have your freedom and yet earn your living 2 if you fall short of succeeding to your wish your reputation will provide you another job and so in high approval i suppress the scolding and give you the saintly and fatherly pat instead                                                    mark twain        on another occasion when bynner had written a poem to clara      clemens her father pretended great indignation that the first poem      written by bynner to any one in his household should not be to him      and threatened revenge  at dinner shortly after he produced from      his pocket a slip of paper on which he had set down what he said was      his only poem  he read the lines that follow                 of all sad words of tongue or pen                the saddest are these it might have been                ah say not so as life grows longer leaner thinner                we recognize o god it might have bynner       he returned to new york in october and soon after was presented by      mrs h h rogers with a handsome billiardtable       he had a passion for the game but had played comparatively little      since the old hartford days of fifteen years before when a group of      his friends used to assemble on friday nights in the room at the top      of the house for long strenuous games and much hilarity  now the      old fever all came back the fascinations of the game superseded      even his interest in the daily dictations      to mrs h h rogers in new york                                     21 fifth avenue monday nov 1906  dear mrs rogersthe

hand and the walking is not the whole of the exercise nor the most healthgiving part of it i think through the multitude of the positions and attitudes it brings into play every muscle in the body and exercises them all  the games begin right after luncheon daily and continue until midnight with 2 hours intermission for dinner and music and so it is 9 hours exercise per day and 10 or 12 on sunday yesterday and last night it was 12and i slept until 8 this morning without waking the billiard table as a sabbath breaker can beat any coalbreaker in pennsylvania and give it 30 in the game if mr rogers will take to daily billiards he can do without doctors and the massageur i think  we are really going to build a house on my farm an hour and a half from new york it is decided it is to be built by contract and is to come within 25000                      with love and many thanks                                              s l c  ps clara is in the sanitariumtill january 28 when her western concert tour will begin she is getting to be a mighty competent singer you must know clara better she is one of the very finest and completest and most satisfactory characters i have ever met others knew it before but i have always been busy with other matters        the billiardist on the premises was the writer of these notes      who earlier in the year had become his biographer and in the      course of time his daily companion and friend  the farm mentioned      was one which he had bought at redding connecticut where later      he built the house known as stormfield       henry mills alden for nearly forty years editor of harpers      magazine arrived at his seventieth birthday on november 11th that      year and harper  brothers had arranged to give him a great dinner      in the offices of franklin square where for half a century he had      been an active force  mark twain threatened with a cold and      knowing the dinner would be strenuous did not feel able to attend      so wrote a letter which if found suitable could be read at the      gathering      to mr henry alden  aldendear and ancient friendit is a solemn moment you have now reached the age of discretion you have been a long time arriving many years ago you docked me on an article because the subject was too old later you docked me on an article because the subject was too new later still you docked me on an article because the subject was betwixt and between once when i wrote a letter to queen victoria you did not put it in the respectable part of the magazine but interred it in that potters field the editors drawer as a result she never answered it how often we recall with regret that napoleon once shot at a magazine editor and missed him and killed a publisher but we remember with charity that his intentions were good  you will reform now alden you will cease from these economies and you will be discharged but in your retirement you will carry with you the admiration and earnest good wishes of the oppressed and toiling scribes this will be better than bread let this console you when the bread fails  you will carry with you another thing toothe affection of the scribes for they all love you in spite of your crimes for you bear a kind heart in your breast and the sweet and winning spirit that charms away all hostilities and animosities and makes of your enemy your friend and keeps him so you have reigned over us thirtysix years and please god you shall reign another thirtysixand peace to mahmoud on his golden throne                      always yours                                    mark        a copyright bill was coming up in washington and a delegation of      authors went down to work for it  clemens was not the head of the      delegation but he was the most prominent member of it as well as      the most useful  he invited the writer to accompany him and      elsewhere i have told in detail the story of that excursionsee      mark twain a biography chap  ccliwhich need be but briefly      touched upon here       his work was mainly done aside from that of the delegation  they      had him scheduled for a speech however which he made without notes      and with scarcely any preparation  meantime he had applied to      speaker cannon for permission to allow him on the floor of the      house where he could buttonhole the congressmen  he was not      eligible to the floor without having received the thanks of      congress hence the following letter      to hon joseph cannon house of representatives                                                         dec 7 1906  dear uncle josephplease get me the thanks of the congressnot next week but right away it is very necessary do accomplish this for your affectionate old friend right away by persuasion if you can by violence if you must for it is imperatively necessary that i get on the floor for two or three hours and talk to the members man by man in behalf of the support encouragement and protection of one of the nations most valuable assets and industriesits literature i have arguments with me also a barrel with liquid in it  give me a chance get me the thanks of congress dont wait for others there isnt time i have stayed away and let congress alone for seventyone years and i am entitled to thanks congress knows it perfectly well and i have long felt hurt that this quite proper and earned expression of gratitude has been merely felt by the house and never publicly uttered send me an order on the sergeantatarms quick when shall i come with love and a benediction                                mark twain        this was mainly a joke  mark twain did not expect any thanks but      he did hope for access to the floor which once in an earlier day      had been accorded him  we drove to the capitol and he delivered his      letter to uncle joe by hand  uncle joe could not give him the      privilege of the floor the rules had become more stringent  he      declared they would hang him if he did such a thing  he added that      he had a private room downstairs where mark twain might establish      headquarters and that he would assign his colored servant neal of      long acquaintanceship with many of the members to pass the word      that mark twain was receiving       the result was a great success  all that afternoon members of      congress poured into the speakers room and in an atmosphere blue      with tobacco smoke mark twain talked the gospel of copyright to his      hearts content       the bill did not come up for passage that session but mark twain      lived to see his afternoons lobbying bring a return  in 1909      champ clark and those others who had gathered around him that      afternoon passed a measure that added fourteen years to the      copyright term       the next letter refers to a proposed lobby of quite a different      sort      to helen keller in wrentham mass                                                         21 fifth avenue                                                        dec  23 06  dear helen keller you say as a reformer you know that ideas must be driven home again and again  yes i know it and by old experience i know that speeches and documents and public meetings are a pretty poor and lame way of accomplishing it last year i proposed a sane wayone which i had practiced with success for a quarter of a centurybut i wasnt expecting it to get any attention and it didnt  give me a battalion of 200 winsome young girls and matrons and let me tell them what to do and how to do it and i will be responsible for shining results if i could mass them on the stage in front of the audience and instruct them there i could make a public meeting take hold of itself and do something really valuable for once not that the real instruction would be done there for it wouldnt it would be previously done privately and merely repeated there  but it isnt going to happenthe good old way will be stuck to therell be a public meeting with music and prayer and a wearying report and a verbal description of the marvels the blind can do and 17 speechesthen the call upon all present who are still alive to contribute this hoary program was invented in the idiot asylum and will never be changed its function is to breed hostility to good causes  some day somebody will recruit my 200my dear beguilesome knights of the golden fleeceand you will see them make good their ominous name  mind we must meet not in the grim and ghastly air of the platform mayhap but by the friendly firehere at 21                           affectionately your friend                                    s l clemens        they did meet somewhat later that winter in the friendly parlors of      no 21

mark twain   arranged with comment by albert bigelow paine     xlvi letters 190708 a degree from oxford the new home at redding       the author j howard moore sent a copy of his book the universal      kinship with a letter in which he said most humorists have no      anxiety except to glorify themselves and add substance to their      pocketbooks by making their readers laugh  you have shown on many      occasions that your mission is not simply to antidote the      melancholy of a world but includes a real and intelligent concern      for the general welfare of your fellowman       the universal kinship was the kind of a book that mark twain      appreciated as his acknowledgment clearly shows      to mr j howard moore                                                         feb 2 07  dear mr moore the book has furnished me several days of deep pleasure and satisfaction it has compelled my gratitude at the same time since it saves me the labor of stating my own longcherished opinions and reflections and resentments by doing it lucidly and fervently and irascibly for me  there is one thing that always puzzles me as inheritors of the mentality of our reptile ancestors we have improved the inheritance by a thousand grades but in the matter of the morals which they left us we have gone backward as many grades that evolution is strange and to me unaccountable and unnatural necessarily we started equipped with their perfect and blemishless morals now we are wholly destitute we have no real morals but only artificial onesmorals created and preserved by the forced suppression of natural and hellish instincts yet we are dull enough to be vain of them certainly we are a sufficiently comical invention we humans                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        mark twains own books were always being excommunicated by some      librarian and the matter never failed to invite the attention and      amusement of the press and the indignation of many correspondents      usually the books were tom sawyer and huck finn the morals of which      were not regarded as wholly exemplary  but in 1907 a small library      in a very small town attained a days national notoriety by putting      the ban on eves diary not so much on account of its text as for      the chaste and exquisite illustrations by lester ralph  when the      reporters came in a troop to learn about it the author said i      believe this time the trouble is mainly with the pictures  i did      not draw them  i wish i hadthey are so beautiful       just at this time dr william lyon phelps of yale was giving a      literary talk to the teachers club of hartford dwelling on the      superlative value of mark twains writings for readers old and      young  mrs f g whitmore an old hartford friend wrote clemens      of the things that phelps had said as consolation for eves latest      banishment  this gave him a chance to add something to what he had      said to the reporters      to mrs whitmore in hartford                                                         feb 7 1907  dear mrs whitmorebut the truth is that when a library expels a book of mine and leaves an unexpurgated bible lying around where unprotected youth and age can get hold of it the deep unconscious irony of it delights me and doesnt anger me but even if it angered me such words as those of professor phelps would take the sting all out nobody attaches weight to the freaks of the charlton library but when a man like phelps speaks the world gives attention some day i hope to meet him and thank him for his courage for saying those things out in public custom is to think a handsome thing in private but tame it down in the utterance  i hope you are all well and happy and thereto i add my love                                sincerely yours                                         s l clemens        in may 1907 mark twain was invited to england to receive from      oxford the degree of literary doctor  it was an honor that came to      him as a sort of laurel crown at the end of a great career and      gratified him exceedingly  to moberly bell of the london times      he expressed his appreciation  bell had been over in april and      clemens believed him concerned in the matter      to moberly bell in london                                          21

discover also in this letter that      he has begun work on the redding home and the cost is to come      entirely out of the autobiographical chapters then running in the      north american review  it may be of passing interest to note here      that he had the usual housebuilders fortune  he received thirty      thousand dollars for the chapters the house cost him nearly double      that amount

was a dinner      given to him by the staff of punch in the historic offices at 10      bouverie street where no other foreign visitor had been thus      honoreda notable distinction  when the dinner ended little joy      agnew daughter of the chief editor entered and presented to the      chief guest the original drawing of a cartoon by bernard partridge      which had appeared on the front page of punch  in this picture the      presiding genius of the paper is offering to mark twain health long      life and happiness from the punch bowl       a short time after his return to america he received a pretty      childish letter from little miss agnew acknowledging a photograph he      had sent her and giving a list of her pets and occupations  such a      letter always delighted mark twain and his pleasure in this one is      reflected in his reply      to miss joy agnew in london                                                    tuxedo park new york  unto you greetings and

a star when only one      is shining in the sky  oh you were indeed the only onethere wasnt even the remotest chance of competition with you dear ah you are a decoration you little witch  the idea of your house going to the wanton expense of a flower gardenarent you enough and what do you want to go and discourage the other flowers for is that the right spirit is it considerate is it kind how do you suppose they feel when you come aroundlooking the way you look and you so pink and sweet and dainty and lovely and supernatural why it makes them feel embarrassed and artificial of course and in my opinion it is just as pathetic as it can be now then you want to reformdearand do right  well certainly you are well off joy       3 bantams      3 goldfish      3 doves      6 canaries      2 dogs

appointment was made and clemens discussed with her for an hour or      more those crucial phases of life which have made living a complex      problem since the days of eve in eden  mrs glyn had never before      heard anything like mark twains wonderful talk and she was anxious      to print their interview  she wrote what she could remember of it      and sent it to him for approval  if his conversation had been      frank his refusal was hardly less so      to mrs elinor glyn in new york                                                         jan 22 08  dear mrs glyn it reads pretty poorlyi get the sense of it but it is a poor literary job however it would have to be that because nobody can be reported even approximately except by a stenographer approximations synopsized speeches translated poems artificial flowers and chromos all have a sort of value but it is small if you had put upon paper what i really said it would have wrecked your typemachine i said some fetid overvigorous things but that was because it was a confidential conversation i said nothing for print my own report of the same conversation reads like satan roasting a sunday school it and certain other readable chapters of my autobiography will not be published until all the clemens family are deaddead and correspondingly indifferent they were written to entertain me not the rest of the world i am not here to do goodat least not to do it intentionally you must pardon me for dictating this letter i am sick abed and not feeling as well as i might                                sincerely

most      literary subjects and especially so in their admiration of the life      and character of joan of arc  both had written of her and both      held her to be something almost more than mortal  when therefore      anatole france published his exhaustive biography of the maid of      domremy a book in which he followed with exaggerated minuteness      and innumerable footnotes every step of joans physical career at      the expense of her spiritual life which he was inclined to cheapen      lang wrote feelingly and with some contempt of the performance      inviting the author of the personal recollections to come to the      rescue of their heroine  compare every one of his statements with      the passages he cites from authorities and make him the laughter of      the world he wrote  if you are lazy about comparing i can make      you a complete set of what the authorities say and of what this      amazing novelist says that they say  when i tell you that he thinks      the epiphany january 6 twelfth night is december 25thchristmas      dayyou begin to see what an egregious ass he is  treat him like      dowden and obligea reference to mark twains defense of harriet      shelley in which he had heaped ridicule on dowdens life of the      poeta masterly performance one of the best that ever came from      mark twains pen       langs suggestion would seem to have been a

references to itof a sort which discomforted me but of course set my interest on fire i dont want to have to read it in frenchi should lose the nice shades and should do a lot of gross misinterpreting too but therell be a translation soon nicht wahr i will wait for it i note with joy that you say if you are lazy about comparing which i most certainly am i can make you a complete set of what the authorities say and of what this amazing novelist says that they say  ah do it for me then i will attempt the article and if i succeed in doing it to my satisfaction will publish it it is long since i touched a pen 3 12 years and i was intending to continue this happy holiday to the gallows butthere are things that could beguile me to break this blessed sabbath                      yours very sincerely                                    s l clemens        certainly it is an interesting fact that an englishmanone of the      race that burned joanshould feel moved to defend her memory      against the topheavy perversions of a distinguished french author       but lang seems never to have sent the notes  the copying would have      been a tremendous task and perhaps he never found the time for it      we may regret today that he did not for mark twains article on      the french authors joan would have been at least unique       samuel clemens could never accustom himself to the loss of his wife      from the time of her death marriagewhich had brought him his      greatest joy in lifepresented itself to him always with the thought      of bereavement waiting somewhere just behind  the news of an      approaching wedding saddened him and there was nearly always a      somber tinge in his congratulations of which the following to a      dear friend is an example      to father fitzsimon in washington                                                    june 5 08  dear father fitzsimonmarriageyes it is the supreme felicity of life i concede it and it is also the supreme tragedy of life the deeper the love the surer the tragedy and the more disconsolating when it comes  and so i congratulate you not perfunctorily not lukewarmly but with a fervency and fire that no word in the dictionary is strong enough to convey and in the same breath and with the same depth and sincerity i grieve for you not for both of you and not for the one that shall go first but for the one that is fated to be left behind for that one there is no recompensefor that one no recompense is possible  there are timesthousands of timeswhen i can expose the half of my mind and conceal the other half but in the matter of the tragedy of marriage i feel too deeply for that and i have to bleed it all out or shut it all in and so you must consider what i have been through and am passing through and be charitable with me  make the most of the sunshine and i hope it will last longever so long  i do not really want to be present yet for friendships sake and because i honor you so i would be there if i could                           most sincerely your friend                                              s l clemens        the new home at redding was completed in the spring of

howells had made for      his house  he preferred the surprise of it and the general      avoidance of detail  that he was satisfied with the result will be      seen in his letters  he named it at

his philosophy what is man and now and again in his other      writings we find mark twain giving small credit to the human mind      as an originator of ideas  the most original writer of his time he      took no credit for pure invention and allowed none to others  the      mind he declared adapted consciously or unconsciously it did not      create  in a letter which follows he elucidates this doctrine  the      reference in it to the captain and to the kerosene as the reader      may remember have to do with captain hurricane jones and his      theory of the miracles of isaac and of the prophets of baal as      expounded in some rambling notes of an idle excursion       by a trick of memory clemens gives the little duke as his suggestion      for the prince and the pauper he should have written the prince and      the page by the same author      to rev f y christ in new york                                          redding conn aug 08  dear siryou say i often owe my best sermons to a suggestion received in reading or from other exterior sources your remark is not quite in accordance with the facts we must change it toi owe all my thoughts sermons and ideas to suggestions received from sources outside of myself the simplified english of this proposition isno mans brains ever originated an idea it is an astonishing thing that after all these ages the world goes on thinking the human brain machinery can originate a thought  it cant it never has done it in all cases little and big the thought is born of a suggestion and in all cases the suggestions come to the brain from the outside the brain never acts except from exterior impulse  a man can satisfy himself of the truth of this by a single processlet him examine every idea that occurs to him in an hour a day in a weekin a lifetime if he please he will always find that an outside something suggested the thought something which he saw with his eyes or heard with his ears or perceived by his touchnot necessarily today nor yesterday nor last year nor twenty years ago but sometime or other usually the source of the suggestion is immediately traceable but sometimes it isnt  however if you will examine every thought that occurs to you for the next two days you will find that in at least nine cases out of ten you can put your finger on the outside suggestionand that ought to convince you that no 10 had that source too although you cannot at present hunt it down and find it  the idea of writing to me would have had to wait a long time if it waited until your brain originated it it was born of an outside suggestionsir thomas and my old captain  the hypnotist thinks he has invented a new thingsuggestion this is very sad i dont know where my captain got his kerosene idea it was fortyone years ago and he is long ago dead but i know that it didnt originate in his head but it was born from a suggestion from the outside  yesterday a guest said how did you come to think of writing the prince and the pauper i didnt the thought came to me from the outsidesuggested by that pleasant and picturesque little historybook charlotte m yonges little duke i doubt if mrs burnett knows whence came to her the suggestion to write little lord fauntleroy but i know it came to her from reading the prince and the pauper in all my life i have never originated an idea and neither has she nor anybody else  mans mind is a clever machine and can work up materials into ingenious fancies and ideas but it cant create the material none but the gods can do that in sweden i saw a vast machine receive a block of wood and turn it into marketable matches in two minutes it could do everything but make the wood that is the kind of machine the human mind is maybe this is not a large compliment but it is all i can afford                           your friend and wellwisher                                              s l clemens      to mrs h h rogers in fair hawn mass

new bedford boat who pleasantly accosted me in the grand central august 5 but the doctor came up from new york day before yesterday and gave positive orders that i must not stir from here before frost it is because i was threatened with a swoon 10 or 12 days ago and went to new york a day or two later to attend my nephews funeral and got horribly exhausted by the heat and came back here and had a bilious collapse in 24 hours i was as sound as a nut again but nobody believes it but me  this is a prodigiously satisfactory place and i am so glad i dont have to go back to the turmoil and rush of new york the house stands high and the horizons are wide yet the seclusion is perfect the nearest public road is half a mile away so there is nobody to look in and i dont have to wear clothes if i dont want to i have been down stairs in nightgown and slippers a couple of hours and have been photographed in that costume but i will dress now and behave myself  that doctor had half an idea that there is something the matter with my brain doctors do know so little and they do charge so much for it i wish henry rogers would come here and i wish you would come with him you cant rest in that crowded place but you could rest here for sure i would learn bridge and entertain you and rob you                           with love to you both                                         ever yours

sun and the moon are on duty outside of it in the loggia where the breezes blow and the tall arches divide up the scenery and frame it  its a ghastly long distance to come and i wouldnt travel such a distance to see anything short of a memorial museum but if you cant come now you can at least come later when you return to new york for the journey will be only an hour and a half per expresstrain

ever                                    mark        from a gentleman in buffalo clemens one day received a letter      inclosing an incompleted list of the worlds one hundred greatest      men men who had exerted the largest visible influence on the life      and activities of the race  the writer asked that mark twain      examine the list and suggest names adding would you include jesus      as the founder of christianity in the list       to the list of statesmen clemens added the name of thomas paine to      the list of inventors edison and alexander graham bell  the      question he

list  the largest visible influence  these terms require you to add jesus and they doubly and trebly require you to add satan from ad 350 to ad 1850 these gentlemen exercised a vaster influence over a fifth part of the human race than was exercised over that fraction of the race by all other influences combined ninetynine hundredths of this influence proceeded from satan the remaining fraction of it from jesus during those 1500 years the fear of satan and hell made 99 christians where love of god and heaven landed one during those 1500 years satans influence was worth very nearly a hundred times as much to the business as was the influence of all the rest of the holy family put together  you have asked me a question and i have answered it seriously and sincerely you have put in buddhaa god with a following at one time greater than jesus ever had a god with perhaps a little better evidence of his godship than that which is offered for jesuss how then in fairness can you leave jesus out and if you put him in how can you logically leave satan out thunder is good thunder is impressive but it is the lightning that does the work                                very truly yours                                         s l clemens        the childrens theatre of the next letter was an institution of      the new york east side in which mark twain was deeply interested      the children were most if not all of hebrew parentage and the      performances they gave under the direction of alice m herts were      really remarkable  it seemed a pity that lack of funds should have      brought this excellent educational venture to an untimely end       the following letter was in reply to one inclosing a newspaper      clipping reporting a performance of the prince and the pauper given      by chicago school children      to mrs hookway in chicago                                             sept 1908  dear mrs hookwayalthough i am full of the spirit of work this morning a rarity with me latelyi must steal a moment or two for a word in person for i have been reading the eloquent account in the recordherald and am pleasurably stirred to my deepest deeps the reading brings vividly back to me my pet and pride the childrens theatre of the east side new york and it supports and reaffirms what i have so often and strenuously said in public that a childrens theatre is easily the most valuable adjunct that any educational institution for the young can have and that no otherwise good school is complete without it  it is much the most effective teacher of morals and promoter of good conduct that the ingenuity of man has yet devised for the reason that its lessons are not taught wearily by book and by dreary homily but by visible and enthusing action and they go straight to the heart which is the rightest of right places for them book morals often get no further than the intellect if they even get that far on their spectral and shadowy pilgrimage but when they travel from a childrens theatre they do not stop permanently at that halfway house but go on home  the childrens theatre is the only teacher of morals and conduct and high ideals that never bores the pupil but always leaves him sorry when the lesson is over and as for history no other teacher is for a moment comparable to it no other can make the dead heroes of the world rise up and shake the dust of the ages from their bones and live and move and breathe and speak and be real to the looker and listener no other can make the study of the lives and times of the illustrious dead a delight a splendid interest a passion and no other can paint a historylesson in colors that will stay and stay and never fade  it is my conviction that the childrens theatre is one of the very very great inventions of the twentieth century and that its vast educational valuenow but dimly perceived and but vaguely understoodwill presently come to be recognized by the article which i have been reading i find the same things happening in the howland school that we have become familiar with in our childrens theatre of which i am president and sufficiently vain of the distinction these things among others  1 the educating historystudy does not stop with the little players but the whole school catches the infection and revels in it  2 and it doesnt even stop there the children carry it home and infect the family with iteven the parents and grandparents and the whole household fall to studying history and bygone manners and customs and costumes with eager interest and this interest is carried along to the studying of costumes in old bookplates and beyond that to the selecting of fabrics and the making of clothes hundreds of our children learn the plays by listening without book and by making notes then the listener goes home and plays the pieceall the parts to the family and the family are glad and proud glad to listen to the explanations and analyses glad to learn glad to be lifted to planes above their dreary workaday lives our childrens theatre is educating 7000 childrenand their families when we put on a play of shakespeare they fall to studying it diligently so that they may be qualified to enjoy it to the limit when the piece is staged  3 your howland school children do the constructionwork stagedecorations etc that is our way too our young folks do everything that is needed by the theatre with their own hands scenedesigning scenepainting gasfitting electric work costumedesigningcostume making everything and all things indeedand their orchestra and its leader are from their own ranks  the article which i have been reading saysspeaking of the historical play produced by the pupils of the howland school  the question naturally arises what has this drama done for those who so enthusiastically took partthe touching story has made a year out of the past live for the children as could no chronology or bald statement of historical events it has cultivated the fancy and given to the imagination strength and purity work in composition has ceased to be drudgery for when all other themes fall flat a subject dealing with some aspect of the drama presented never fails to arouse interest and a rapid pushing of pens over paper  that is entirely true the interest is not confined to the dramas story it spreads out all around the period of the story and gives to all the outlying and unrelated happenings of that period a fascinating interestan interest which does not fade out with the years but remains always fresh always inspiring always welcome historyfacts dug by the job with sweat and tears out of a dry and spiritless textbookbut never mind all who have suffered know what that is                                     i remain dear madam                                              sincerely yours                                                        s l clemens        mark twain had a special fondness for cats  as a boy he always      owned one and it generally had a seat beside him at the table      there were cats at quarry farm and at hartford and in the house at      redding there was a gray mothercat named tammany of which he was      especially fond  kittens capering about were his chief delight      in a letter to a chicago woman he tells how those of tammany      assisted at his favorite game      to mrs

your letter are very pleasant and very welcome and i thank you for them sincerely if i can find a photograph of my tammany and her kittens i will enclose it in this  one of them likes to be crammed into a cornerpocket of the billiard tablewhich he fits as snugly as does a finger in a glove and then he watches the game and obstructs it by the hour and spoils many a shot by putting out his paw and changing the direction of a passing ball whenever a ball is in his arms or so close to him that it cannot be played upon without risk of hurting him the player is privileged to remove it to anyone of

extravagant and would thereby lose some of their strength and to that degree misrepresent me it is my conviction that dialstone lane holds the supremacy over all purely humorous books in our language but i feel about salthaven as the cape cod poet feels about simon hanks                 the lord knows all things great and small                with doubt hes not perplexed                tis him alone that knows it all                but simon hanks comes next  the poet was moved by envy and malice and jealousy but i am not i place salthaven close up next to dialstone because i think it has a fair and honest right to that high position i have kept the other book moving i shall begin to hand this one around now  and many thanks to you for remembering me  this house is out in the solitudes

make the journey  he was      constantly invited to this or that public gathering or private      party but such affairs had lost interest for him  he preferred the      quiet of his luxurious home with its beautiful outlook while for      entertainment he found the billiard afternoons sufficient  guests      came from the city now and again for weekend visits and if he      ever was restless or lonely he did not show it       among the invitations that came was one from general o o howard      asking him to preside at a meeting to raise an endowment fund for a      lincoln memorial

me very real regret that i am obliged to decline for the object of the meeting appeals strongly to me since that object is to aid in raising the 500000 endowment fund for lincoln memorial university the endowment fund will be the most fitting of all the memorials the country will dedicate to the memory of lincoln serving as it will to uplift his very own people  i hope you will meet with complete success and i am sorry i cannot be there to witness it and help you rejoice but i am older than people think and besides i live away out in the country and never stir from home except at geological intervals to fill leftover engagements in mesozoic times when i was younger and indiscreeter  you ought not to say sarcastic things about my fighting on the other side general grant did not act like that general grant paid me compliments he bracketed me with zenophonit is there in his memoirs for anybody to read he said if all the confederate soldiers had followed my example and adopted my military arts he could never have caught enough of them in a bunch to inconvenience the rebellion general grant was a fair man and recognized my worth but you are prejudiced and you have hurt my

letter from him came one day to stormfield concerning his new      plans  this letter happened to be overweight which gave mark      twain a chance for some amusing exaggerations at his expense

to your hearts desire in your cheapcablegram campaign and i feel sure you will indeed your cheappostage victory achieved in spite of a quartercentury of determined opposition is good and rational prophecy that you will wireless not being as yet imprisoned in a chinese wall of private cash and highplaced and formidable influence will come to your aid and make your new campaign briefer and easier than the other one was  now then after uttering my serious word am i privileged to be frivolous for a moment when you shall have achieved cheap telegraphy are you going to employ it for just your own selfish profit and other peoples pecuniary damage the way you are doing with your cheap postage you get letterpostage reduced to 2 cents an ounce then you mail me a 4ounce letter with a 2cent stamp on it and i have to pay the extra freight at this end of the line i return your envelope for inspection look at it stamped in one place is a vast t and under it the figures 40 and under those figures appears an l a sinister and suspicious and mysterious l in another place stamped within a circle in offensively large capitals you find the words due 8 cents finally in the midst of a desert space up nornoreastard from that circle you find a figure 3 of quite unnecessarily aggressive and insolent magnitudeand done with a blue pencil so as to be as conspicuous as possible i inquired about these strange signs and symbols of the postman he said they were p o department signals for his instruction  instruction for what  to get extra postage  is it so explain tell me about the large t and the 40  its short for take 40or as we postmen say grab 40  go on please while i think up some words to swear with  due 8 means grab 8 more  continue  the bluepencil 3 was an afterthought there arent any stamps for afterthoughts the sums vary according to inspiration and they whirl in the one that suggests itself at the last moment sometimes they go several times higher than this one this one only means hog 3 cents more and so if youve got 51 cents about you or can borrow it  tell me who gets this corruption  half of it goes to the man in england who ships the letter on short postage and the other half goes to the pod to protect cheap postage from inaugurating a deficit    i cant blame you i would say it myself in your place if these ladies were not present but you see im only obeying orders i cant help myself  oh i know it im not blaming you finally what does that l stand for  get the money or give him l its english you know  take it and go its the last cent ive got in the world  after seeing the oxford pageant file by the grand stand picture after picture splendor after splendor three thousand five hundred strong the most moving and beautiful and impressive and

most vividly see your handwrite on a square blue envelop in the mailpile i have hunted the house over but there is no such letter was it an illusion  i am reading lowells letter and smoking i woke an hour ago and am reading to keep from wasting the time on page 305 vol i i have just margined a note  young friend i like that you ought to see him now  it seemed startlingly strange to hear a person call you young it was a brick out of a blue sky and knocked me groggy for a moment ah me the pathos of it is that we were young then and hewhy so was he but he didnt know it he didnt even know it 9 years later when we saw him approaching and you warned me saying dont say anything about agehe has just turned fifty and thinks he is old and broods over it  well clara did sing and you wrote her a dear letter  time to go to sleep                           yours ever                                         mark      to daniel kiefer                                                         no date  danl kiefer esq dear siri should be far from willing to have a political party named after me  i would not be willing to belong to a party which allowed its members to have political aspirations or to push friends forward for political preferment                      yours very truly                                    s l clemens        the copyright extension for which the author had been working so      long was granted by congress in 1909 largely as the result of that      afternoon in washington when mark twain had received in uncle      joe cannons private room and preached the gospel of copyright      until the daylight faded and the rest of the capitol grew still      champ clark was the last to linger that day and they had talked far      into the dusk  clark was powerful and had fathered the bill  now      he wrote to know if it was satisfactory      to champ clark in washington                                stormfield redding conn june 5 09  dear champ clarkis the new copyright law acceptable to me emphatically yes clark it is the only sane and clearly defined and just and righteous copyright law that has ever existed in the united states whosoever will compare it with its predecessors will have no trouble in arriving at that decision  the bill which was before the committee two years ago when i was down there was the most stupefying jumble of conflicting and apparently irreconcilable interests that was ever seen and we all said the case is hopeless absolutely hopelessout of this chaos nothing can be built but we were in error out of that chaotic mass this excellent bill has been instructed the warring interests have been reconciled and the result is as comely and substantial a legislative edifice as lifts its domes and towers and protective lightning rods out of the statute book i think when i think of that other bill which even the deity couldnt understand and of this one which even i can understand i take off my hat to the man or men who devised this one was it r u johnson was it the authors league was it both together i dont know but i take off my hat anyway johnson has written a valuable article about the new lawi enclose it  at lastat last and for the first time in copyright history we are ahead of england ahead of her in two ways by length of time and by fairness to all interests concerned does this sound like shouting then i must modify it all we possessed of copyrightjustice before the fourth of last march we owed to englands initiative                                     truly yours                                         s l clemens        because mark twain amused himself with certain aspects of christian      science and was critical of mrs eddy there grew up a wide      impression that he jeered at the theory of mental healing when as      a matter of fact he was one of its earliest converts and never      lost faith in its power  the letter which follows is an excellent      exposition of his attitude toward the institution of christian      science and the founder of the church in america      to j wylie smith glasgow scotland                                          stormfield august 7 1909  dear sirmy view of the matter has not changed to wit that christian science is valuable that it has just the same value now that it had when mrs eddy stole it from quimby that its healing principle its most valuable asset possesses the same force now that it possessed a million years ago before quimby was born that mrs eddy organized that force and is entitled to high credit for that then with a splendid sagacity she hitched it to a religion the surest of all ways to secure friends for it and support in a fine and lofty wayfiguratively speakingit was a tramp stealing a ride on the lightning express ah how did that ignorant villageborn peasant woman know the human being so well she has no more intellect than a tadpoleuntil it comes to business then she is a marvel am i sorry i wrote the book most certainly not you say you have 500 converts in glasgow fifty years from now your posterity will not count them by the hundred but by the thousand i feel absolutely sure of this                           very truly yours                                    s l clemens        clemens wrote very little for publication that year but he enjoyed      writing for his own amusement setting down the things that boiled      or bubbled within him mainly chapters on the inconsistencies of      human deportment human superstition and human creeds  the letters      from the earth referred to in the following were supposed to have      been written by an immortal visitant from some far realm to a      friend describing the absurdities of mankind  it is true as he      said that they would not do for publication though certainly the      manuscript contains some of his most delicious writing  miss      wallace to whom the next letter is written had known mark twain in      bermuda and after his death published a dainty volume entitled      mark twain in the happy island                                      stormfield redding connecticut

far ill read messages to you this book will never be publishedin fact it couldnt be because it would be felony to soil the mails with it for it has much holy scripture in it of the kind that cant properly be read aloud except from the pulpit and in family worship paine enjoys it but paine is going to be damned one of these days i suppose  the autumn splendors passed you by what a pity i wish you had been here it was beyond words it was heaven and hell and sunset and rainbows and the aurora all fused into one divine harmony and you couldnt look at it and keep the tears back all the hosannahing strong gorgeousnesses have gone back to heaven and hell and the pole now but no matter if you could look out of my bedroom window at this moment you would choke up and when you got your voice you would say this is not real this is a dream such a singing together and such a whispering together and such a snuggling together of cosy soft colors and such kissing and caressing and such pretty blushing when the sun breaks out and catches those dainty weeds at ityou remember that weedgarden of mineand thenthen the far hills sleeping in a dim blue tranceoh hearing about it is nothing you should be here to see it  good i wish i could go on the platform and read and i could if it could be kept out of the papers theres a charityschool of 400 young girls in boston that i would give my ears to talk to if i had some more butoh well i cant go and its no use to grieve about it  this morning jean went to town also paine also the butler also katy also the laundress the cook and the maid

heart trouble of a very serious nature  it was angina pectoris      and while to all appearances he was as well as ever and usually felt      so he was periodically visited by severe attacks of acute breast      pains which as the months passed increased in frequency and      severity  he was alarmed and distressednot on his own account      but because of his daughter jeana handsome girl who had long been      subject to epileptic seizures  in case of his death he feared that      jean would be without permanent anchorage his other daughter      clarafollowing her marriage to ossip gabrilowitsch in october      having taken up residence abroad       this anxiety was soon ended  on the morning of december 24th jean      clemens was found dead in her apartment  she was not drowned in her      bath as was reported but died from heart exhaustion the result of      her malady and the shock of cold water       questionable diagnosis  dw md       the blow to her father was terrible but heavy as it was one may      perhaps understand that her passing in that swift painless way must      have afforded him a measure of relief      to mrs gabrilowitsch in europe

to bermuda a few days      before jean died  now by his physicians advice he went back to      those balmy islands  he had always loved them since his first trip      there with twichell thirtythree years earlier and at bay house      the residence of viceconsul allen where he was always a welcome      guest he could have the attentions and care and comforts of a home      taking claude the butler as his valet he sailed january 5th and      presently sent back a letter in which he said again i am leading      the ideal life and am immeasurably content       by his wish the present writer and his family were keeping the      stormfield house open for him in order that he might be able to      return to its comforts at any time  he sent frequent lettersone      or two by each steamerbut as a rule they did not concern matters      of general interest  a little after his arrival however he wrote      concerning an incident of his former visita trivial matterbut      one which had annoyed him  i had been with him in bermuda on the      earlier visit and as i remember it there had been some slight      oversight on his part in the matter of official etiquettesomething      which doubtless no one had noticed but himself      to a b paine in redding                                               bay house jan 11 1910  dear paine there was a military lecture last night at the officers mess prospect and as the lecturer honored me with a special and urgent invitation and said he wanted to lecture to me particularly i being the greatest living master of the platformart i naturally packed helen and her mother into the provided carriage and went  as soon as we landed at the door with the crowd the governor came to me at once and was very cordial and apparently as glad to see me as he said he was so that incident is closed and pleasantly and entirely satisfactorily everything is all right now and i am no longer in a clumsy and awkward situation  i met up with that charming colonel chapman and other officers of the regiment and had a good time  commandant peters of the carnegie will dine here tonight and arrange a private visit for us to his ship the crowd to be denied access                      sincerely yours                                         s l c        helen of this letter was mr and mrs allens young daughter      a favorite companion of his walks

that foreign and faroff and vaguelyremembered country where you and loomis and lark and other beloved friends are  i have a letter from clara this morning she is solicitous and wants me well and watchfully taken care of my she ought to see helen and her parents and claude administer that trust  also she says i hope to hear from you or mr paine very soon  i am writing her and i know you will respond to your part of her prayer she is pretty desolate now after jeans emancipationthe only kindness god ever did that poor unoffending child in all her hard life                                ys

concerning mark twains article the      turningpoint in my life which had just appeared in one of the      harper publications  howells wrote of it while your wonderful      words are warm in my mind yet i want to tell you what you know      already that you never wrote anything greater finer than that      turningpoint paper of yours       from the early bermuda letters we may gather that mark twains days      were enjoyable enough and that his malady was not giving him      serious trouble thus far  near the end of january he wrote life      continues here the same as usual  there isnt a flaw in it  good      times good home tranquil contentment all day and every day      without a break  i shouldnt know how to go about bettering my      situation  he did little in the way of literary work probably      finding neither time nor inclination for it  when he wrote at all      it was merely to set down some fanciful drolleries with no thought      of publication      to prof william lyon phelps yale college                                               hamilton march 12  dear professor phelpsi thank you ever so much for the bookprofessor phelpss essays on modern novelistswhich i find charmingso charming indeed that i read it through in a single night and did not regret the lost nights sleep i am glad if i deserve what you have said about me and even if i dont i am proud and well contented since you think i deserve it  yes i saw prof lounsbury and had a most pleasant time with him he ought to have staid longer in this little paradisepartly for his own sake but mainly for mine  i knew my poor jean had written you i shall not have so dear and sweet a secretary again  good health to you and all good fortune attend you                           sincerely yours                                    s l clemens        he would appear to have written not many letters besides those to      mrs gabrilowitsch and to stormfield but when a little girl sent      him a report of a dream inspired by reading the prince and the      pauper he took the time and trouble to acknowledge it realizing      no doubt that a line from him would give the child happiness      to miss sulamith in new york                                bay house bermuda march 21 1910  dear miss sulamithi think it is a remarkable dream for a girl of 13 to have dreamed in fact for a person of any age to have dreamed because it moves by regular grade and sequence from the beginning to the end which is not the habit of dreams i think your report of it is a good piece of work a clear and effective statement of the vision  i am glad to know you like the prince and the pauper so well and i believe with you that the dream is good evidence of that liking i think i may say with your sister that i like myself best when i am serious                           sincerely yours                                         s l clemens        through february and most of march letters and reports from him      were about the same  he had begun to plan for his return and      concerning amusements at stormfield for the entertainment of the      neighbors and for the benefit of the library which he had founded      soon after his arrival in redding  in these letters he seldom      mentioned the angina pains that had tortured him earlier  but once      when he sent a small photograph of himself it seemed to us that his      face had become thin and that he had suffered  certainly his next      letter was not reassuring      to a b paine in redding   dear painewe must look into the magiclantern business maybe the modern lantern is too elaborate and troublesome for backsettlement use but we can inquire we must have some kind of a show at stormfield to entertain the countryside with  we are booked to sail in the bermudian april 23rd but dont tell anybody i dont want it known i may have to go sooner if the pain in my breast doesnt mend its ways pretty considerably i dont want to die here for this is an unkind place for a person in that condition i should have to lie in the undertakers cellar until the ship would remove me and it is dark down there and unpleasant  the colliers will meet me on the pier and i may stay with them a week or two before going home it all depends on the breast paini dont want to die there i am growing more and more particular about the place                           with love                                    s  l  c        this letter had been written by the hand of his secretary helen      allen writing had become an effort to him  yet we did not suspect      how rapidly the end was approaching and only grew vaguely alarmed      a week later however it became evident that his condition was      critical    dear paine i have been having a most uncomfortable time for the past 4 days with that breastpain which turns out to be an affection of the heart just as i originally suspected the news from new york is to the effect that nonbronchial weather has arrived there at last therefore if i can get my breast trouble in traveling condition i may sail for home a week or two earlier than has heretofore been proposed                           yours as ever                                    s l clemens                                    per h s a        in this letter he seems to have forgotten that his trouble had been      pronounced an affection of the heart long before he left america      though at first it had been thought that it might be gastritis      the same mail brought a letter from mr allen explaining fully the      seriousness of his condition  i sailed immediately for bermuda      arriving there on the 4th of april  he was not suffering at the      moment though the pains came now with alarming frequency and      violence  he was cheerful and brave  he did not complain  he gave      no suggestion of a man whose days were nearly ended       a part of the stormfield estate had been a farm which he had given      to jean clemens where she had busied herself raising some live      stock and poultry  after her death he had wished the place to be      sold and the returns devoted to some memorial purpose  the sale had      been made during the winter and the price received had been paid in      cash  i found him full of interest in all affairs and anxious to      discuss the memorial plan  a day or two later he dictated the      following letterthe last he would ever send       it seemed fitting that this final word from one who had so long      given happiness to the whole world should record a special gift to      his neighbors      to charles t lark in new york                                                    hamilton bermuda                                                   april 6 1910  dear mr larki have told paine that i want the money derived from the sale of the farm which i had given but not conveyed to my daughter jean to be used to erect a building for the mark twain library of redding the building to be called the jean l clemens memorial building  i wish to place the money 600000 in the hands of three trusteespaine and two others h a lounsbury and william e hazen all of redding these trustees to form a building committee to decide on the size and plan of the building needed and to arrange for and supervise the work in such a manner that the fund shall amply provide for the building complete with necessary furnishings leaving if possible a balance remaining sufficient for such repairs and additional furnishings as may be required for two years from the time of completion  will you please draw a document covering these requirements and have it ready by the time i reach new york april 14th                                very sincerely                                         s l clemens        we sailed on the 12th of april reaching new york on the 14th      as he had planned  a day or two later mr and mrs gabrilowitsch      summoned from italy by cable arrived  he suffered very little      after reaching stormfield and his mind was comparatively clear up      to the last day  on the afternoon of april 21st he sank into a      state of coma and just at sunset he died  three days later at      elmira new york he was laid beside mrs clemens and those others      who had preceded him                         the last day at stormfield

opens his eyes                     after long weariness smiles                     and stretches arms overhead                     while those about him take heart                      with his
