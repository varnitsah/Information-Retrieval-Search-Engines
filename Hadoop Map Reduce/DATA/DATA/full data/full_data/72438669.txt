72438669	youth  by isaac asimov       red and slim found the two strange little animals the morning after     they heard the thunder sounds they knew that they could never show     their new pets to their parents   illustration   there was a spatter of pebbles against the window and the youngster stirred in his sleep another and he was awake  he sat up stiffly in bed seconds passed while he interpreted his strange surroundings he wasnt in his own home of course this was out in the country it was colder than it should be and there was green at the window  slim  the call was a hoarse urgent whisper and the youngster bounded to the open window  slim wasnt his real name but the new friend he had met the day before had needed only one look at his slight figure to say youre slim he added im red  red wasnt his real name either but its appropriateness was obvious they were friends instantly with the quick unquestioning friendship of young ones not yet quite in adolescence before even the first stains of adulthood began to make their appearance  slim cried hi red and waved cheerfully still blinking the sleep out of himself  red kept to his croaking whisper quiet you want to wake somebody  slim noticed all at once that the sun scarcely topped the low hills in the east that the shadows were long and soft and that the grass was wet  slim said more softly whats the matter  red only waved for him to come out  slim dressed quickly gladly confining his morning wash to the momentary sprinkle of a little lukewarm water he let the air dry the exposed portions of his body as he ran out while bare skin grew wet against the dewy grass  red said youve got to be quiet if mom wakes up or dad or your dad or even any of the hands then itll be come on in or youll catch your death of cold  he mimicked voice and tone faithfully so that slim laughed and thought that there had never been so funny a fellow as red  slim said eagerly do you come out here every day like this red real early its like the whole world is just yours isnt it red no one else around and all like that he felt proud at being allowed entrance into this private world  red stared at him sidelong he said carelessly ive been up for hours didnt you hear it last night  hear what  thunder  was there a thunderstorm slim never slept through a thunderstorm  i guess not but there was thunder i heard it and then i went to the window and it wasnt raining it was all stars and the sky was just getting sort of almost gray you know what i mean  slim had never seen it so but he nodded  so i just thought id go out said red  they walked along the grassy side of the concrete road that split the panorama right down the middle all the way down to where it vanished among the hills it was so old that reds father couldnt tell red when it had been built it didnt have a crack or a rough spot in it  red said can you keep a secret  sure red what kind of a secret  just a secret maybe ill tell you and maybe i wont i dont know yet red broke a long supple stem from a fern they passed methodically stripped it of its leaflets and swung what was left whipfashion for a moment he was on a wild charger which reared and champed under his iron control then he got tired tossed the whip aside and stowed the charger away in a corner of his imagination for future use  he said therell be a circus around  slim said thats no secret i knew that my dad told me even before we came here  thats not the secret fine secret ever see a circus  oh sure you bet  like it  say there isnt anything i like better  red was watching out of the corner of his eyes again ever think you would like to be with a circus i mean for good  slim considered i guess not i think ill be an astronomer like my dad i think he wants me to be  huh astronomer said red  slim felt the doors of the new private world closing on him and astronomy became a thing of dead stars and black empty space  he said placatingly a circus would be more fun  youre just saying that  no im not i mean it  red grew argumentative suppose you had a chance to join the circus right now what would you do  ii  see red affected scornful laughter  slim was stung id join up  go on  try me  red whirled at him strange and intense you meant that you want to go in with me  illustration  what do you mean slim stepped back a bit surprised by the unexpected challenge  i got something that can get us into the circus maybe someday we can even have a circus of our own we could be the biggest circusfellows in the world thats if you want to go in with me otherwisewell i guess i can do it on my own i just thought lets give good old slim a chance  the world was strange and glamorous and slim said sure thing red im in what is it huh red tell me what it is  figure it out whats the most important thing in circuses  slim thought desperately he wanted to give the right answer finally he said acrobats  holy smokes i wouldnt go five steps to look at acrobats  i dont know then  animals thats what whats the best sideshow where are the biggest crowds even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts there was no doubt in reds voice  do you think so  everyone thinks so you ask anyone anyway i found animals this morning two of them  and youve got them  sure thats the secret are you telling  of course not  okay ive got them in the barn do you want to see them  they were almost at the barn its huge open door black too black they had been heading there all the time slim stopped in his tracks  he tried to make his words casual are they big  would i fool with them if they were big they cant hurt you theyre only about so long ive got them in a cage  they were in the barn now and slim saw the large cage suspended from a hook in the roof it was covered with stiff canvas  red said we used to have some bird there or something anyway they cant get away from there come on lets go up to the loft  they clambered up the wooden stairs and red hooked the cage toward them  slim pointed and said theres sort of a hole in the canvas  red frowned howd that get there he lifted the canvas looked in and said with relief theyre still there  the canvas appeared to be burned worried slim  you want to look or dont you  slim nodded slowly he wasnt sure he wanted to after all they might be  but the canvas had been jerked off and there they were two of them the way red said they were small and sort of disgustinglooking the animals moved quickly as the canvas lifted and were on the side toward the youngsters red poked a cautious finger at them  watch out said slim in agony  they dont hurt you said red ever see anything like them  no  cant you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these  maybe theyre too small for a circus  red looked annoyed he let go the cage which swung back and forth pendulumfashion youre just trying to back out arent you  no im not its just  theyre not too small dont worry right now ive only got one worry  whats that  well ive got to keep them till the circus comes dont i ive got to figure out what to feed them meanwhile  the cage swung and the little trapped creatures clung to its bars gesturing at the youngsters with queer quick motionsalmost as though they were intelligent   ii  the astronomer entered the dining room with decorum he felt very much the guest  he said where are the youngsters my son isnt in his room  the industrialist smiled theyve been out for hours however breakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago so there is nothing to worry about youth doctor youth  youth the word seemed to depress the astronomer  they ate breakfast in silence the industrialist said once you really think theyll come the day looks sonormal  the astronomer said theyll come  that was all  afterward the industrialist said youll pardon me i cant conceive your playing so elaborate a hoax you really spoke to them  as i speak to you at least in a sense they can project thoughts  i gathered that must be so from your letter how i wonder  i could not say i asked them and of course they were vague or perhaps it was just that i could not understand it involves a projector for the focussing of thought and even more than that conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor it was quite a while before i realized they were trying to think at me such thoughtprojectors may be part of the science they will give us  perhaps said the industrialist yet think of the changes it would bring to society a thoughtprojector  why not change would be good for us  i dont think so  it is only in old age that change is unwelcome said the astronomer and races can be old as well as individuals  the industrialist pointed out the window you see that road it was built beforethewars i dont know exactly when it is as good now as the day it was built we couldnt possibly duplicate it now the race was young when that was built eh  then yes at least they werent afraid of new things  no i wish they had been where is the society of beforethewars destroyed doctor what good were youth and new things we are better off now the world is peaceful and jogs along the race goes nowhere but after all there is nowhere to go they proved that the men who built the road i will speak with your visitors as i agreed if they come but i think i will only ask them to go  the race is not going nowhere said the astronomer earnestly it is going toward final destruction my university has a smaller student body each year fewer books are written less work is done an old man sleeps in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging but each day finds him nearer death all the same  well well said the industrialist  no dont dismiss it listen before i wrote you i investigated your position in the planetary economy  and you found me solvent interrupted the industrialist smiling  why yes oh i see you are joking and yetperhaps the joke is not far off you are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent than his father perhaps your son will no longer be solvent it becomes too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still exist though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of beforethewars we will be back to village economy and then to what the caves  and the infusion of fresh technological knowledge will be the changing of all that  not just the new knowledge rather the whole effect of change of a broadening of horizons look sir i chose you to approach in this matter not only because you were rich and influential with government officials but because you had an unusual reputation for these days of daring to break with tradition our people will resist change and you would know how to handle them how to see to it thatthat  that the youth of the race is revived  yes  with its atomic bombs  the atomic bombs returned the astronomer need not be the end of civilization these visitors of mine had their atomic bomb or whatever their equivalent was on their own worlds and survived it because they didnt give up dont you see it wasnt the bomb that defeated us but our own shell shock this may be the last chance to reverse the process  illustration  tell me said the industrialist what do these friends from space want in return  the astronomer hesitated he said i will be truthful with you they come from a denser planet ours is richer in the lighter atoms  they want magnesium aluminum  no sir carbon and hydrogen they want coal and oil  really  the astronomer said quickly you are going to ask why creatures who have mastered space travel and therefore atomic power would want coal and oil i cant answer that  the industrialist smiled but i can this is the best evidence yet of the truth of your story superficially atomic power would seem to preclude the use of coal and oil however quite apart from the energy gained by their combustion they remain and always will remain the basic raw material for all organic chemistry plastics dyes pharmaceuticals solvents industry could not exist without them even in an atomic age still if coal and oil are the low price for which they would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth my answer is that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis  the astronomer sighed and said there are the boys  they were visible through the open window standing together in the grassy field and lost in animated conversation the industrialists son pointed imperiously and the astronomers son nodded and made off at a run toward the house  the industrialist said there is the youth you speak of our race has as much of it as it ever had  yes but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold  slim scuttled into the room the door banging behind him  the astronomer said in mild disapproval whats this  slim looked up in surprise and came to a halt i beg your pardon i didnt know anyone was here i am sorry to have interrupted his enunciation was almost painfully precise  the industrialist said its all right youngster  but the astronomer said even if you had been entering an empty room son there would be no cause for slamming a door  nonsense insisted the industrialist the youngster has done no harm you simply scold him for being young you with your views  he said to slim come here lad  slim advanced slowly  how do you like the country eh  very much sir thank you  my son has been showing you about the place has he  yes sir redi mean  no no call him red i call him that myself now tell me what are you two up to eh  slim looked away whyjust exploring sir  the industrialist turned to the astronomer there you are youthful curiosity and adventurelust the race has not yet lost it  slim said sir  yes lad  the youngster took a long time in getting on with it he said red sent me in for something good to eat but i dont exactly know what he meant i didnt like to say so  why just ask cook shell have something good for younguns to eat  oh no sir i mean for animals  for animals  yes sir what do animals eat  the astronomer said i am afraid my son is citybred  well said the industrialist theres no harm in that what kind of an animal lad  a small one sir  then try grass or leaves and if they dont want that nuts or berries would probably do the trick  thank you sir slim ran out again closing the door gently behind him  the astronomer said do you suppose theyve trapped an animal alive he was obviously perturbed  thats common enough theres no shooting on my estate and its tame country full of rodents and small creatures red is always coming home with pets of one sort or another they rarely maintain his interest for long  he looked at the wall clock your friends should have been here by now shouldnt they   iii  the swaying had come to a halt and it was dark the explorer was not comfortable in the alien air it felt as thick as soup and he had to breathe shallowly even so  he reached out in a sudden need for company the merchant was warm to the touch his breathing was rough he moved in an occasional spasm and was obviously asleep the explorer hesitated and decided not to wake him it would serve no real purpose  there would be no rescue of course that was the penalty paid for the high profits which unrestrained competition could lead to the merchant who opened a new planet could have a ten year monopoly of its trade which he might hug to himself or more likely rent out to all comers at a stiff price it followed that planets were searched for in secrecy and preferably away from the usual trade routes in a case such as theirs then there was little or no chance that another ship would come within range of their subetherics except for the most improbable of coincidences even if they were in their ship that is rather than in thisthiscage  the explorer grasped the thick bars even if they blasted those away as they could they would be stuck too high in open air for leaping  it was too bad they had landed twice before in the scoutship they had established contact with the natives who were grotesquely huge but mild and unaggressive it was obvious that they had once owned a flourishing technology but hadnt faced up to the consequences of such a technology it would have been a wonderful market  and it was a tremendous world the merchant especially had been taken aback he had known the figures that expressed the planets diameter but from a distance of two lightseconds he had stood at the visiplate and muttered unbelievable  oh there are larger worlds the explorer said it wouldnt do for an explorer to be too easily impressed  inhabited  well no  why you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it  the explorer smiled it was a gentle dig at his arcturian homeland which was smaller than most planets he said not quite  the merchant followed along the line of his thoughts and the inhabitants are large in proportion to their world he sounded as though the news struck him less favorably now  nearly ten times our height  are you sure they are friendly  that is hard to say friendship between alien intelligences is an imponderable they are not dangerous i think weve come across other groups that could not maintain equilibrium after the atomic war stage and you know the results introversion retreat gradual decadence and increasing gentleness  even if they are such monsters  the principle remains  it was about then that the explorer felt the heavy throbbing of the engines  he frowned and said we are descending a bit too quickly  there had been some speculation on the dangers of landing some hours before the planetary target was a huge one for an oxygenwater world though it lacked the size of the uninhabitable hydrogenammonia planets and its low density made its surface gravity fairly normal its gravitational forces fell off but slowly with distance in short its gravitational potential was high and the ships calculator was a runofthemill model not designed to plot landing trajectories at that potential range that meant the pilot would have to use manual controls  it would have been wiser to install a more highpowered model but that would have meant a trip to some outpost of civilization lost time perhaps a lost secret the merchant demanded an immediate landing  the merchant felt it necessary to defend his position now he said angrily to the explorer dont you think the pilot knows his job he landed you safely twice before  yes thought the explorer in a scoutship not in this unmaneuverable freighter aloud he said nothing  he kept his eye on the visiplate they were descending too quickly there was no room for doubt much too quickly  the merchant said peevishly why do you keep silence  well then if you wish me to speak i would suggest that you strap on your floater and help me prepare the ejector  the pilot fought a noble fight he was no beginner the atmosphere abnormally high and thick in the gravitational potential of this world whipped and burned about the ship but to the very last it looked as though he might bring it under control despite that  he even maintained course following the extrapolated line to the point on the northern continent toward which they were headed under other circumstances with a shade more luck the story would eventually have been told and retold as a heroic and masterly reversal of a lost situation but within sight of victory tired body and tired nerves clamped a control bar with a shade too much pressure the ship which had almost levelled off dipped down again  there was no room to retrieve the final error there was only a mile left to fall the pilot remained at his post to the actual landing his only thought that of breaking the force of the crash of maintaining the spaceworthiness of the vessel he did not survive with the ship bucking madly in a soupy atmosphere few ejectors could be mobilized and only one of them in time  when afterwards the explorer lifted out of unconsciousness and rose to his feet he had the definite feeling that but for himself and the merchant there were no survivors and perhaps that was an overcalculation his floater had burnt out while still sufficiently distant from surface to have the fall stun him the merchant might have had less luck even than that  he was surrounded by a world of thick ropy stalks of grass and in the distance were trees that reminded him vaguely of similar structures on his native arcturian world except that their lowest branches were high above what he would consider normal treetops  he called his voice sounding basso in the thick air and the merchant answered the explorer made his way toward him thrusting violently at the coarse stalks that barred his path  are you hurt he asked  the merchant grimaced ive sprained something it hurts to walk  the explorer probed gently i dont think anything is broken youll have to walk despite the pain  cant we rest first  its important to try to find the ship if it is spaceworthy or if it can be repaired we may live otherwise we wont  just a few minutes let me catch my breath  the explorer was glad enough for those few minutes the merchants eyes were already closed he allowed his to do the same  he heard the trampling and his eyes snapped open never sleep on a strange planet he told himself futilely  the merchant was awake too and his steady screaming was a rumble of terror  the explorer called its only a native of this planet it wont harm you  but even as he spoke the giant had swooped down and in a moment they were in its grasp being lifted closer to its monstrous ugliness  the merchant struggled violently and of course quite futilely cant you talk to it he yelled  the explorer could only shake his head i cant reach it with the projector it wont be listening  then blast it blast it down  we cant do that the phrase you fool had almost been added the explorer struggled to keep his selfcontrol they were swallowing space as the monster moved purposefully away  why not cried the merchant you can reach your blaster i see it in plain sight dont be afraid of falling  its simpler than that if this monster is killed youll never trade with this planet youll never even leave it you probably wont live the day out  why why  because this is one of the young of the species you should know what happens when a trader kills a native young even accidentally whats more if this is the targetpoint then we are on the estate of a powerful native this might be one of his brood  that was how they entered their present prison they had carefully burnt away a portion of the thick stiff covering and it was obvious that the height from which they were suspended was a killing one  now once again the prisoncage shuddered and lifted in an upward arc the merchant rolled to the lower rim and startled awake the cover lifted and light flooded in as was the case the time before there were two specimens of the young they were not very different in appearance from adults of the species reflected the explorer though of course they were considerably smaller  a handful of reedy green stalks was stuffed between the bars its odor was not unpleasant but it carried clods of soil at its ends  the merchant drew away and said huskily what are they doing  the explorer said trying to feed us i should judge at least this seems to be the native equivalent of grass  the cover was replaced and they were set swinging again alone with their fodder   iv  slim started at the sound of footsteps and brightened when it turned out to be only red  he said no ones around i had my eye peeled you bet  red said ssh look you take this stuff and stick it in the cage ive got to scoot back to the house  what is it slim reached reluctantly  ground meat holy smokes havent you ever seen ground meat thats what you shouldve got when i sent you to the house instead of coming back with that stupid grass  slim was hurt howd i know they dont eat grass besides ground meat doesnt come loose like that it comes in cellophane and it isnt that color  surein the city out here we grind our own and its always this color till its cooked  you mean it isnt cooked slim drew away quickly  red looked disgusted do you think animals eat cooked food come on take it it wont hurt you i tell you there isnt much time  why whats doing back at the house  i dont know dad and your father are walking around i think maybe theyre looking for me maybe the cook told them i took the meat anyway we dont want them coming here after me  didnt you ask the cook before you took this stuff  who that crab shouldnt wonder if she only let me have a drink of water because dad makes her come on take it  slim took the large glob of meat though his skin crawled at the touch he turned toward the barn and red sped away in the direction from which he had come  he slowed when he approached the two adults took a few deep breaths to bring himself back to normal and then carefully and nonchalantly sauntered past they were walking in the general direction of the barn he noticed but not dead on  he said hi dad hello sir  the industrialist said just a moment red i have a question to ask you  red turned a carefully blank face to his father yes dad  mother tells me you were out early this morning  not real early dad just a little before breakfast  she said you told her it was because you had been awakened during the night and didnt go back to sleep  red waited before answering should he have told mom that  then he said yes sir  what was it that awakened you  red saw no harm in it he said i dont know dad it sounded like thunder sort of and like a collision sort of  could you tell where it came from  it sounded like it was out by the hill that was truthful and useful as well since the direction was almost opposite that in which the barn lay  the industrialist looked at his guest i suppose it would do no harm to walk toward the hill  the astronomer said i am ready  red watched them walk away and when he turned he saw slim peering cautiously out from among the briars of a hedge  red waved at him come on  slim stepped out and approached did they say anything about the meat  no i guess they dont know about that they went down to the hill  what for  search me they kept asking about the noise i heard listen did the animals eat the meat  well said slim cautiously they were sort of looking at it and smelling it or something  okay red said i guess theyll eat it holy smokes theyve got to eat something lets walk along toward the hill and see what dad and your father are going to do  what about the animals  theyll be all right a fellow cant spend all his time on them did you give them water  sure they drank that  see come on well look at them after lunch i tell you what well bring them fruit anythingll eat fruit  together they trotted up the rise red as usual in the lead   v  the astronomer said you think the noise was their ship landing  dont you think it could be  if it were they may all be dead  perhaps not the industrialist frowned  if they have landed and are still alive where are they  think about that for a while he was still frowning  the astronomer said i dont understand you  they may not be friendly  oh no ive spoken with them theyve  youve spoken with them call that reconnaissance what would their next step be invasion  but they only have one ship sir  you know that only because they say so they might have a fleet  ive told you about their size they  their size would not matter if they have handweapons that may well be superior to our artillery  that is not what i meant  i had this partly in mind from the first the industrialist went on it is for that reason i agreed to see them after i received your letter not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade but to judge their real purposes i did not count on their evading the meeting  he sighed i suppose it isnt our fault you are right in one thing at any rate the world has been at peace too long we are losing a healthy sense of suspicion  the astronomers mild voice rose to an unusual pitch and he said i will speak i tell you that there is no reason to suppose they can possibly be hostile they are small yes but that is only important because it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds are small our world has what is for them a normal gravity but because of our much higher gravitational potential our atmosphere is too dense to support them comfortably over sustained periods for a similar reason the use of the world as a base for interstellar travel except for trade in certain items is uneconomical and there are important differences in chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils they couldnt eat our food or we theirs  surely all this can be overcome they can bring their own food build domed stations of lowered air pressure devise specially designed ships  they can and how glibly you can describe feats that are easy to a race in its youth it is simply that they dont have to do any of that there are millions of worlds suitable for them in the galaxy they dont need this one which isnt  how do you know all this is their information again  this i was able to check independently i am an astronomer after all  that is true let me hear what you have to say then while we walk  then sir consider that for a long time our astronomers have believed that two general classes of planetary bodies existed first the planets which formed at distances far enough from their stellar nucleus to become cool enough to capture hydrogen these would be large planets rich in hydrogen ammonia and methane we have examples of these in the giant outer planets the second class would include those planets formed so near the stellar center that the high temperature would make it impossible to capture much hydrogen these would be smaller planets comparatively poorer in hydrogen and richer in oxygen we know that type very well since we live on one ours is the only solar system we know in detail however and it has been reasonable for us to assume that these were the only two planetary classes  i take it then that there is another  yes there is a superdense class still smaller poorer in hydrogen than the inner planets of the solar system the ratio of occurrence of hydrogenammonia planets and these superdense wateroxygen worlds of theirs over the entire galaxyand remember that they have actually conducted a survey of significant sample volumes of the galaxy which we without interstellar travel cannot dois about 3 to 1 this leaves them seven million superdense worlds for exploration and colonization  the industrialist looked at the blue sky and the greencovered trees among which they were making their way he said and worlds like ours  the astronomer said softly ours is the first solar system they have found which contains them apparently the development of our solar system was unique and did not follow the ordinary rules  the industrialist considered that what it amounts to is that these creatures from space are asteroiddwellers  no no the asteroids are something else again they occur i was told in one out of eight stellar systems but theyre completely different from what weve been discussing  and how does your being an astronomer change the fact that you are still only quoting their unsupported statements  but they did not restrict themselves to bald items of information they presented me with a theory of stellar evolution which i had to accept and which is more nearly valid than anything our own astronomy has ever been able to devise if we except possible lost theories dating from beforethewars mind you their theory had a rigidly mathematical development and it predicted just such a galaxy as they describe so you see they have all the worlds they wish they are not landhungry certainly not for our land  reason would say so if what you say is true but creatures may be intelligent and not reasonable our forefathers were presumably intelligent yet they were certainly not reasonable was it reasonable to destroy almost all their tremendous civilization in atomic warfare over causes our historians can no longer accurately determine the industrialist brooded over it from the dropping of the first atom bomb over those islandsi forget the ancient namethere was only one end in sight and in plain sight yet events were allowed to proceed to that end  he looked up said briskly well where are we i wonder if we are not on a fools errand after all  but the astronomer was a little in advance and his voice came thickly no fools errand sir look there   vi  red and slim had trailed their elders with the experience of youth aided by the absorption and anxiety of their fathers their view of the final object of the search was somewhat obscured by the underbrush behind which they remained  red said holy smokes look at that its all shiny silver or something  but it was slim who was really excited he caught at the other i know what this is its a spaceship that must be why my father came here hes one of the biggest astronomers in the world and your father would have to call him if a spaceship landed on his estate  what are you talking about dad didnt even know that thing was there he only came here because i told him i heard the thunder from here besides there isnt any such thing as a spaceship  sure there is look at it see those round things they are ports and you can see the rocket tubes  how do you know so much  slim was flushed he said i read about them my father has books about them old books from beforethewars  huh now i know youre making it up books from beforethewars  my father has to have them he teaches at the university its his job  his voice had risen and red had to pull at him you want them to hear us he whispered indignantly  well it is too a spaceship  look here slim you mean thats a ship from another world  its got to be look at my father going round and round it he wouldnt be so interested if it was anything else  other worlds where are there other worlds  everywhere how about the planets theyre worlds just like ours some of them and other stars probably have planets theres probably zillions of planets  red felt outweighed and outnumbered he muttered youre crazy  all right then ill show you  hey where are you going  down there im going to ask my father i suppose youll believe it if he tells you i suppose youll believe a professor of astronomy knows what  he had scrambled upright  red said hey you dont want them to see us were not supposed to be here do you want them to start asking questions and find out about our animals  i dont care you said i was crazy  snitcher you promised you wouldnt tell  im not going to tell but if they find out themselves its your fault for starting an argument and saying i was crazy  i take it back then grumbled red  well all right you better  in a way slim was disappointed he wanted to see the spaceship at closer quarters still he could not break his vow of secrecy even in spirit without at least the excuse of personal insult  red said its awfully small for a spaceship  sure because its probably a scoutship  ill bet dad couldnt even get into the old thing  so much slim realized to be true it was a weak point in his argument and he made no answer his interest was absorbed by the adults  red rose to his feet an elaborate attitude of boredom all about him well i guess we better be going theres business to do and i cant spend all day here looking at some old spaceship or whatever it is weve got to take care of the animals if were going to be circusfolks thats the first rule with circusfolks theyve got to take care of the animals and he finished virtuously thats what i aim to do anyway  slim said what for red theyve got plenty of meat lets watch  theres no fun in watching besides dad and your father are going away and i guess its about lunch time  red became argumentative look slim we cant start acting suspicious or theyre going to start investigating holy smokes dont you ever read any detective stories when youre trying to work a big deal without being caught its practically the main thing to keep on acting just like always then they dont suspect anything thats the first law  oh all right  slim rose resentfully at the moment the circus appeared to him a rather tawdry and shoddy substitute for the glories of astronomy and he wondered how he had come to fall in with reds silly scheme  down the slope they went slim as usual in the rear   vii  the industrialist said its the workmanship that gets me i never saw such construction  what good is it now said the astronomer bitterly theres nothing left therell be no second landing this ship detected life on our planet through accident other exploring parties would come no closer than necessary to establish the fact that there were no superdense worlds existing in our solar system  well theres no quarreling with a crash landing  the ship hardly seems damaged if only some had survived the ship might have been repaired  if they had survived there would be no trade in any case theyre too different too disturbing in any caseits over  they entered the house and the industrialist greeted his wife calmly lunch about ready dear  im afraid not you see she looked hesitantly at the astronomer  is anything wrong asked the industrialist why not tell me im sure our guest wont mind a little family discussion  pray dont pay any attention whatever to me muttered the astronomer he moved miserably to the other end of the living room  the woman said in low hurried tones really dear cooks that upset ive been soothing her for hours and honestly i dont know why red should have done it  done what the industrialist was more amused than otherwise it had taken the united efforts of himself and his son months to argue his wife into using the name red rather than the perfectly ridiculous viewed youngster fashion name which was his real one  she said hes taken most of the chopped meat  hes eaten it  well i hope not it was raw  then what would he want it for  i havent the slightest idea i havent seen him since breakfast meanwhile cooks just furious she caught him vanishing out the kitchen door and there was the bowl of chopped meat just about empty and she was going to use it for lunch well you know cook she had to change the lunch menu and that means she wont be worth living with for a week youll just have to speak to red dear and make him promise not to do things in the kitchen any more and it wouldnt hurt to have him apologize to cook  oh come she works for us if we dont complain about a change in lunch menu why should she  because shes the one who has doublework made for her and shes talking about quitting good cooks arent easy to get do you remember the one before her  it was a strong argument  the industrialist looked about vaguely he said i suppose youre right he isnt here i suppose when he comes in ill talk to him  youd better start here he comes  red walked into the house and said cheerfully time for lunch i guess he looked from one parent to the other in quick speculation at their fixed stares and said got to clean up first though and made for the other door  the industrialist said one moment son  sir  wheres your little friend  red said carelessly hes around somewhere we were just sort of walking and i looked around and he wasnt there this was perfectly true and red felt on safe ground i told him it was lunch time i said i suppose its about lunch time i said we got to be getting back to the house and he said yes and i just went on and then when i was about at the creek i looked around and  the astronomer interrupted the voluble story looking up from a magazine he had been sightlessly rummaging through i wouldnt worry about my youngster he is quite selfreliant dont wait lunch for him  lunch isnt ready in any case doctor the industrialist turned once more to his son and talking about that son the reason for it is that something happened to the ingredients do you have anything to say  sir  i hate to feel that i have to explain myself more fully why did you take the chopped meat  the chopped meat  the chopped meat he waited patiently  red said well i was sort of  hungry prompted his father for raw meat  no sir i just sort of needed it  for what exactly  red looked miserable and remained silent  the astronomer broke in again if you dont mind my putting in a few wordsyoull remember that just after breakfast my son came in to ask what animals ate  oh youre right how stupid of me to forget look here red did you take it for an animal pet youve got  red recovered indignant breath he said you mean slim came in here and said i had an animal he came in here and said that he said i had an animal  no he didnt he simply asked what animals ate thats all now if he promised he wouldnt tell on you he didnt its your own foolishness in trying to take something without permission that gave you away that happened to be stealing now have you an animal i ask you a direct question  yes sir it was a whisper so low as hardly to be heard  all right youll have to get rid of it do you understand  reds mother intervened do you mean to say youre keeping a meateating animal red it might bite you and give you bloodpoison  theyre only small ones quavered red they hardly budge if you touch them  they how many do you have  two  where are they  the industrialist touched her arm dont chivvy the child any further he said in a low voice if he says hell get rid of them he will and thats punishment enough  he dismissed the matter from his mind   viii  lunch was half over when slim dashed into the dining room for a moment he stood abashed and then he said in what was almost hysteria ive got to speak to red ive got to say something  red looked up in fright but the astronomer said i dont think son youre being very polite youve kept lunch waiting  im sorry father  oh dont rate the lad said the industrialists wife he can speak to red if he wants to and there was no damage done to the lunch  ive got to speak to red alone slim insisted  now thats enough said the astronomer with a kind of gentleness that was obviously manufactured for the benefit of strangers and which had beneath it an easilyrecognized edge take your seat  slim did so but he ate only when someone looked directly upon him even then he was not very successful  red caught his eyes he made soundless words did the animals get loose  slim shook his head slightly he whispered no its  the astronomer looked at him hard and slim faltered to a stop  with lunch over red slipped out of the room with a microscopic motion at slim to follow  they walked in silence to the creek  then red turned fiercely upon his companion look here whats the idea of telling my dad we were feeding animals  slim said i didnt i asked what you feed animals thats not the same as saying we were doing it besides its something else red  but red had not used up his grievances and where did you go anyway i thought you were coming to the house they acted like it was my fault you werent there  but im trying to tell you about that if youd only shut up a second and let me talk you dont give a fellow a chance  well go on and tell me if youve got so much to say  im trying to i went back to the spaceship the folks werent there anymore and i wanted to see what it was like  it isnt a spaceship said red sullenly he had nothing to lose  it is too i looked inside you could look through the ports and i looked inside and they were dead he looked sick they were dead  who were dead  slim screeched animals like our animals only they arent animals theyre peoplethings from other planets  for a moment red might have been turned to stone it didnt occur to him to disbelieve slim at this point slim looked too genuinely the bearer of just such tidings he said finally oh my  well what are we going to do golly will we get a whopping if they find out he was shivering  we better turn them loose said red  theyll tell on us  they cant talk our language not if theyre from another planet  yes they can because i remember my father talking about some stuff like that to my mother when he didnt know i was in the room he was talking about visitors who could talk with the mind telepathery or something i thought he was making it up  well holy smokes i meanholy smokes red looked up i tell you my dad said to get rid of them lets sort of bury them somewhere or throw them in the creek  he told you to do that  he made me say i had animals and then he said get rid of them i got to do what he says holy smokes hes my dad  some of the panic left slims heart it was a thoroughly legalistic way out well lets do it right now then before they find out oh golly if they find out will we be in trouble  they broke into a run toward the barn unspeakable visions in their minds   ix  it was different looking at them as though they were people as animals they had been interesting as people horrible their eyes which were neutral little objects before now seemed to watch them with active malevolence  theyre making noises said slim in a whisper which was barely audible  i guess theyre talking or something said red funny that those noises which they had heard before had not had significance earlier he was making no move toward them neither was slim  the canvas was off but they were just watching the ground meat slim noticed hadnt been touched  slim said arent you going to do something  arent you  you found them  its your turn now  no it isnt you found them its your fault the whole thing i was watching  you joined in slim you know you did  i dont care you found them and thats what ill say when they come here looking for us  red said all right for you but the thought of the consequences inspired him anyway and he reached for the cage door  slim said wait  red was glad to he said now whats biting you  one of thems got something on him that looks like it might be iron or something  where  right there i saw it before but i thought it was just part of him but if hes people maybe its a disintegrator gun  whats that  i read about it in the books from beforethewars mostly people with spaceships have disintegrator guns they point them at you and you get disintegratored  they didnt point it at us till now pointed out red with his heart not quite in it  i dont care im not hanging around here and getting disintegratored im getting my father  cowardycat yellow cowardycat  i dont care you can call all the names you want but if you bother them now youll get disintegratored you wait and see and itll be all your fault  he made for the narrow spiral stairs that led to the main floor of the barn stopped at its head then backed away  reds mother was moving up panting a little with the exertion and smiling a tight smile for the benefit of slim in his capacity as guest  red you red are you up there now dont try to hide i know this is where youre keeping them cook saw where you ran with the meat  red quavered hello ma  now show me those nasty animals im going to see to it that you get rid of them right away  it was over and despite the imminent corporal punishment red felt something like a load fall from him at least the decision was out of his hands  right there ma i didnt do anything to them ma i didnt know they just looked like little animals and i thought youd let me keep them ma i wouldnt have taken the meat only they wouldnt eat grass or leaves and we couldnt find good nuts or berries and cook never lets me have anything or i would have asked her and i didnt know it was for lunch and  he was speaking on the sheer momentum of terror and did not realize that his mother did not hear him but with eyes frozen and popping at the cage was screaming in thin piercing tones   x  the astronomer was saying a quiet burial is all we can do there is no point in any publicity now when they heard the screams  she had not entirely recovered by the time she reached them running and running it was minutes before her husband could extract sense from her  she was saying finally i tell you theyre in the barn i dont know what they are no no  she barred the industrialists quick movement in that direction she said dont you go send one of the hands with a shotgun i tell you i never saw anything like it little horrible beasts withwithi cant describe it to think that red was touching them and trying to feed them he was holding them and feeding them meat  red began i only  and slim said it was not  the industrialist said quickly now you boys have done enough harm today march into the house and not a word not one word im not interested in anything you have to say after this is all over ill hear you out and as for you red ill see that youre properly punished  he turned to his wife now whatever the animals are well have them killed he added quietly once the youngsters were out of hearing come come the children arent hurt and after all they havent done anything really terrible theyve just found a new pet  the astronomer spoke with difficulty pardon me maam but can you describe these animals  she shook her head she was quite beyond words  can you just tell me if they  im sorry said the industrialist apologetically but i think i had better take care of her will you excuse me  a moment please one moment she said she had never seen such animals before surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely unique on an estate such as this  im sorry lets not discuss that now  except that unique animals might have landed during the night  the industrialist stepped away from his wife what are you implying  i think we had better go to the barn sir  the industrialist stared a moment turned and suddenly and quite uncharacteristically began running the astronomer followed and the womans wail rose unheeded behind them   xi  the industrialist stared looked at the astronomer turned to stare again  those  those said the astronomer i have no doubt we appear strange and repulsive to them  what do they say  why that they are uncomfortable and tired and even a little sick but that they are not seriously damaged and that the youngsters treated them well  treated them well scooping them up keeping them in a cage giving them grass and raw meat to eat tell me how to speak to them  it may take a little time think at them try to listen it will come to you but perhaps not right away  the industrialist tried he grimaced with the effort of it thinking over and over again the youngsters were ignorant of your identity  and the thought was suddenly in his mind we were quite aware of it and because we knew they meant well by us according to their own view of the matter we did not attempt to attack them  attack them thought the industrialist and said it aloud in his concentration  why yes came the answering thought we are armed  one of the revolting little creatures in the cage lifted a metal object and there was a sudden hole in the top of the cage and another in the roof of the barn each hole rimmed with charred wood  we hope the creatures thought it will not be too difficult to make repairs  the industrialist found it impossible to organize himself to the point of directed thought he turned to the astronomer and with that weapon in their possession they let themselves be handled and caged i dont understand it  but the calm thought came we would not harm the young of an intelligent species   xii  it was twilight the industrialist had entirely missed the evening meal and remained unaware of the fact  he said do you really think the ship will fly  if they say so said the astronomer im sure it will theyll be back i hope before too long  and when they do said the industrialist energetically i will keep my part of the agreement what is more i will move sky and earth to have the world accept them i was entirely wrong doctor creatures that would refuse to harm children under such provocation as they received are admirable but you knowi almost hate to say this  say what  the kids yours and mine im almost proud of them imagine seizing these creatures feeding them or trying to and keeping them hidden the amazing gall of it red told me it was his idea to get a job in a circus on the strength of them imagine  the astronomer said youth   xiii  the merchant said will we be taking off soon  half an hour said the explorer  it was going to be a lonely trip back all the remaining seventeen of the crew were dead and their ashes were to be left on a strange planet back they would go with a limping ship and the burden of the controls entirely on himself  the merchant said it was a good business stroke not harming the young ones we will get very good terms very good terms  the explorer thought business  the merchant then said theyve lined up to see us off all of them you dont think theyre too close do you it would be bad to burn any of them with the rocket blast at this stage of the game  theyre safe  horriblelooking things arent they  pleasant enough inside their thoughts are perfectly friendly  you wouldnt believe it of them that immature one the one that first picked us up  they call him red provided the explorer  thats a queer name for a monster makes me laugh he actually feels bad that were leaving only i cant make out exactly why the nearest i can come to it is something about a lost opportunity with some organization or other that i cant quite interpret  a circus said the explorer briefly  what why the impertinent monstrosity  why not what would you have done if you had found him wandering on your native world found him sleeping on a field on earth red tentacles six legs pseudopods and all   xiv  red watched the ship leave his red tentacles which gave him his nickname quivered their regret at lost opportunity to the very last and the eyes at their tips filled with drifting yellowish crystals that were the equivalent of earthly tears
