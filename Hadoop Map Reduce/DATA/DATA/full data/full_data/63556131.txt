brother from california   as night crept up from the valley that stormy afternoon sawyers ledge was at first quite blotted out by wind and rain but presently reappeared in little nebulous starlike points along the mountain side as the straggling cabins of the settlement were one by one lit up by the miners returning from tunnel and claim these stars were of varying brilliancy that evening two notably soone that eventually resolved itself into a manycandled illumination of a cabin of evident festivity the other into a glimmering taper in the window of a silent one they might have represented the extreme mutations of fortune in the settlement that night the celebration of a strike by robert falloner a lucky miner and the sickbed of dick lasham an unlucky one  the latter was however not quite alone he was ministered to by daddy folsom a weak but emotional and aggressively hopeful neighbor who was sitting beside the wooden bunk whereon the invalid lay yet there was something perfunctory in his attitude his eyes were continually straying to the window whence the illuminated falloner festivities could be seen between the trees and his ears were more intent on the songs and laughter that came faintly from the distance than on the feverish breathing and unintelligible moans of the sufferer  nevertheless he looked troubled equally by the condition of his charge and by his own enforced absence from the revels a more impatient moan from the sick man however brought a change to his abstracted face and he turned to him with an exaggerated expression of sympathy  in course lordy i know jest what those pains are kinder ez ef you was havin a tooth pulled that had roots branchin all over ye my ive jest had em so bad i couldnt keep from yellin thats hot rheumatics yes sir i oughter know and confidentially the singler thing about em is that they get worse jest as theyre going offsorter wringin yer hand and punchin ye in the back to say goodby there he continued as the man sank exhaustedly back on his rude pillow of floursacks there didnt i tell ye yell be all right in a minit and ez chipper ez a jay bird in the mornin oh dont tell me about rheumaticsive bin thar ony mine was the cold kindthat hangs on longestyours is the hot that burns itself up in no time  if the flushed face and bright eyes of lasham were not enough to corroborate this symptom of high fever the quick wandering laugh he gave would have indicated the point of delirium but the too optimistic daddy folsom referred this act to improvement and went on cheerfully yes sir youre better now andhere he assumed an air of cautious deliberation extravagant as all his assumptions werei aint sayin thatefyouwastoriseup very slowly and heave a blanket or two over your shouldersjest by way o caution you knowand leanin on me kinder meander over to bob falloners cabin and the boys it wouldnt do you a heap o good changes o this kind is often prescribed by the faculty another moan from the sufferer however here apparently corrected daddys too favorable prognosis oh all right well perhaps ye know best and ill jest run over to bobs and say how as ye aint comin and will be back in a jiffy  the letter said the sick man hurriedly the letter the letter  daddy leaned suddenly over the bed it was impossible for even his hopefulness to avoid the fact that lasham was delirious it was a strong factor in the caseone that would certainly justify his going over to falloners with the news for the present moment however this aberration was to be accepted cheerfully and humored after daddys own fashion of coursethe letter the letter he said convincingly thats what the boys hev bin singin jest now       goodby charley when you are away      write me a letter love send me a letter love  thats what you heard and a mighty purty song it is too and kinder clings to you its wonderful how these things gets in your head  the letterwritesend moneymoneymoney and the photographthe photographphotographmoney continued the sick man in the rapid reiteration of delirium  in course you willtomorrowwhen the mail goes returned daddy soothingly plenty of them jest now you try to get a snooze will ye hol ontake some o this  there was an anodyne mixture on the rude shelf which the doctor had left on his morning visit daddy had a comfortable belief that what would relieve pain would also check delirium and he accordingly measured out a dose with a liberal margin to allow of waste by the patient in swallowing in his semiconscious state as he lay more quiet muttering still but now unintelligibly daddy waiting for a more complete unconsciousness and the opportunity to slip away to falloners cast his eyes around the cabin he noticed now for the first time since his entrance that a crumpled envelope bearing a western postmark was lying at the foot of the bed daddy knew that the triweekly post had arrived an hour before he came and that lasham had evidently received a letter sure enough the letter itself was lying against the wall beside him it was open daddy felt justified in reading it  it was curt and businesslike stating that unless lasham at once sent a remittance for the support of his brother and sistertwo children in charge of the writerthey must find a home elsewhere that the arrears were long standing and the repeated promises of lasham to send money had been unfulfilled that the writer could stand it no longer this would be his last communication unless the money were sent forthwith  it was by no means a novel or under the circumstances a shocking disclosure to daddy he had seen similar missives from daughters and even wives consequent on the varying fortunes of his neighbors no one knew better than he the uncertainties of a miners prospects and yet the inevitable hopefulness that buoyed him up he tossed it aside impatiently when his eye caught a strip of paper he had overlooked lying upon the blanket near the envelope it contained a few lines in an unformed boyish hand addressed to my brother and evidently slipped into the letter after it was written by the uncertain candlelight daddy read as follows   dear brother rite to me and cissy rite off why aint you done it its so long since you rote any mister recketts ses you dont care any more wen you rite send your fotograff folks here ses i aint got no big bruther any way as i disremember his looks and cant say wots like him cissys kryin all along of it ive got a hedake william walker make it ake by a blo so no more at present from your loving little bruther jim   the quick hysteric laugh with which daddy read this was quite consistent with his responsive emotional nature so too were the ready tears that sprang to his eyes he put the candle down unsteadily with a casual glance at the sick man it was notable however that this look contained less sympathy for the ailing big brother than his emotion might have suggested for daddy was carried quite away by his own mental picture of the helpless children and eager only to relate his impressions of the incident he cast another glance at the invalid thrust the papers into his pocket and clapping on his hat slipped from the cabin and ran to the house of festivity yet it was characteristic of the man and so engrossed was he by his one idea that to the usual inquiries regarding his patient he answered hes all right and plunged at once into the incident of the dunning letter reservingwith the instinct of an emotional artistthe childs missive until the last as he expected the money demand was received with indignant criticisms of the writer  thats just like em in the states said captain fletcher darned if they dont believe weve only got to bore a hole in the ground and snake out a hundred dollars why theres my wifewith a heap of hoss sense in everything elseis allus wonderin why i cant rake in a cool fifty betwixt one steamer day and another  thats nothin to my old dad interrupted gus houston the infant of the camp a brighteyed young fellow of twenty why he wrote to me yesterday that if id only pick up a single piece of gold every day and just put it aside sayin thats for popper and mommer and not fool it awayit would be all theyd ask of me  thats so added another these ignorant relations is just the ruin o the mining industry bob falloner hez bin lucky in his strike today but hes a darned sight luckier in being without kith or kin that he knows of  daddy waited until the momentary irritation had subsided and then drew the other letter from his pocket that aint all boys he began in a faltering voice but gradually working himself up to a pitch of pathos just as i was thinking all them very things i kinder noticed this yer poor little bit o paper lyin thar lonesome like and forgotten and iread itand wellgentlemenit just choked me right up he stopped and his voice faltered  go slow daddy go slow said an auditor smilingly it was evident that daddys sympathetic weakness was well known  daddy read the childs letter but unfortunately what with his real emotion and the intoxication of an audience he read it extravagantly and interpolated a childs lisp on no authority whatever and a simulated infantile delivery which i fear at first provoked the smiles rather than the tears of his audience nevertheless at its conclusion the little note was handed round the party and then there was a moment of thoughtful silence  tell you what it is boys said fletcher looking around the table we ought to be doin suthin for them kids right off did you turning to daddy say anythin about this to dick  narywhy hes clean off his head with feverdont understand a wordand just babbles returned daddy forgetful of his roseate diagnosis a moment ago and hasnt got a cent  we must make up what we can amongst us afore the mail goes tonight said the infant feeling hurriedly in his pockets come ante up gentlemen he added laying the contents of his buckskin purse upon the table  hold on boys said a quiet voice it was their host falloner who had just risen and was slipping on his oilskin coat youve got enough to do i reckon to look after your own folks ive none let this be my affair ive got to go to the express office anyhow to see about my passage home and ill just get a draft for a hundred dollars for that old skeesickswhats his blamed name oh rickettshe made a memorandum from the letterand ill send it by express meantime you fellows sit down there and write somethingyou know whatsaying that dicks hurt his hand and cant writeyou know but asked you to send a draft which youre doing sabe thats all ill skip over to the express now and get the draft off and you can mail the letter an hour later so put your dust back in your pockets and help yourselves to the whiskey while im gone he clapped his hat on his head and disappeared  there goes a white man you bet said fletcher admiringly as the door closed behind their host now boys he added drawing a chair to the table lets get this yer letter off and then go back to our game  pens and ink were produced and an animated discussion ensued as to the matter to be conveyed daddys plea for an extended explanatory and sympathetic communication was overruled and the letter was written to ricketts on the simple lines suggested by falloner  but what about poor little jims letter that ought to be answered said daddy pathetically  if dick hurt his hand so he cant write to ricketts how in thunder is he goin to write to jim was the reply  but suthin oughter be said to the poor kid urged daddy piteously  well write it yourselfyou and gus houston make up somethin together im going to win some money retorted fletcher returning to the cardtable where he was presently followed by all but daddy and houston  ye cant write it in dicks name because that little brother knows dicks handwriting even if he dont remember his face see suggested houston  thats so said daddy dubiously but he added with elastic cheerfulness we can write that dick says see  your heads level old man just you wade in on that  daddy seized the pen and waded in into somewhat deep and difficult water i fancy for some of it splashed into his eyes and he sniffled once or twice as he wrote suthin like this he said after a pause   dear little jimmieyour big brother havin hurt his hand wants me to tell you that otherways he is all hunky and a1 he says he dont forget you and little cissy you bet and hes sendin money to old ricketts straight off he says dont you and cissy mind whether school keeps or not as long as big brother dick holds the lines he says hed have written before but hes bin follerin up a lead mighty close and expects to strike it rich in a few days   you aint got no sabe about kids said daddy imperturbably theyve got to be humored like sick folks and they want everythin bigthey dont take no stock in things ez they areeven ef they hev em worse than they are so continued daddy reading to prevent further interruption he says youre just to keep your eyes skinned lookin out for him comin home any timeday or night all youve got to do is to sit up and wait he might come and even snake you out of your beds he might come with four white horses and a nigger driver or he might come disguised as an ornary tramp only youve got to be keen on watchin ye see interrupted daddy explanatorily thatll jest keep them kids lively he says cissys to stop cryin right off and if willie walker hits yer on the right cheek you just slug out with your left fist cordin to scripter gosh ejaculated daddy stopping suddenly and gazing anxiously at houston theres that blamed photographi clean forgot that  and dick hasnt got one in the shop and never had returned houston emphatically golly that stumps us unless he added with diabolical thoughtfulness we take bobs the kids dont remember dicks face and bobs about the same age and its a regular star pictureyou bet bob had it taken in sacramentoin all his war paint see he indicated a photograph pinned against the walla really striking likeness which did full justice to bobs long silken mustache and large brown determined eyes ill snake it off while they aint lookin and you jam it in the letter bob wont miss it and we can fix it up with dick after hes well and send another  daddy silently grasped the infants hand who presently secured the photograph without attracting attention from the cardplayers it was promptly inclosed in the letter addressed to master james lasham the infant started with it to the postoffice and daddy folsom returned to lashams cabin to relieve the watcher that had been detached from falloners to take his place beside the sick man  meanwhile the rain fell steadily and the shadows crept higher and higher up the mountain towards midnight the star points faded out one by one over sawyers ledge even as they had come with the difference that the illumination of falloners cabin was extinguished first while the dim light of lashams increased in number later two stars seemed to shoot from the centre of the ledge trailing along the descent until they were lost in the obscurity of the slopethe lights of the stagecoach to sacramento carrying the mail and robert falloner they met and passed two fainter lights toiling up the roadthe buggy lights of the doctor hastily summoned from carterville to the bedside of the dying dick lasham   the slowing up of his train caused bob falloner to start from a half doze in a western pullman car as he glanced from his window he could see that the blinding snowstorm which had followed him for the past six hours had at last hopelessly blocked the line there was no prospect beyond the interminable snowy level the whirling flakes and the monotonous palisades of leafless trees seen through it to the distant banks of the missouri it was a prospect that the mountainbred falloner was beginning to loathe and although it was scarcely six weeks since he left california he was already looking back regretfully to the deep slopes and the free song of the serried ranks of pines  the intense cold had chilled his temperate blood even as the rigors and conventions of eastern life had checked his sincerity and spontaneous flow of animal spirits begotten in the frank intercourse and brotherhood of camps he had just fled from the artificialities of the great atlantic cities to seek out some western farming lands in which he might put his capital and energies the unlookedfor interruption of his progress by a longforgotten climate only deepened his discontent and nowthat train was actually backing it appeared they must return to the last station to wait for a snowplough to clear the line it was explained the conductor barely a mile from shepherdstown where there was a good hotel and a chance of breaking the journey for the night  shepherdstown the name touched some dim chord in bob falloners memory and conscienceyet one that was vague then he suddenly remembered that before leaving new york he had received a letter from houston informing him of lashams death reminding him of his previous bounty and begging himif he went westto break the news to the lasham family there was also some allusion to a joke about his bobs photograph which he had dismissed as unimportant and even now could not remember clearly for a few moments his conscience pricked him that he should have forgotten it all but now he could make amends by this providential delay it was not a task to his liking in any other circumstances he would have written but he would not shirk it now  shepherdstown was on the main line of the kansas pacific road and as he alighted at its station the big through trains from san francisco swept out of the stormy distance and stopped also he remembered as he mingled with the passengers hearing a childish voice ask if this was the californian train he remembered hearing the amused and patient reply of the stationmaster yes sonnyhere she is again and heres her passengers as he got into the omnibus and drove to the hotel here he resolved to perform his disagreeable duty as quickly as possible and on his way to his room stopped for a moment at the office to ask for ricketts address the clerk after a quick glance of curiosity at his new guest gave it to him readily with a somewhat familiar smile it struck falloner also as being odd that he had not been asked to write his name on the hotel register but this was a saving of time he was not disposed to question as he had already determined to make his visit to ricketts at once before dinner it was still early evening  he was washing his hands in his bedroom when there came a light tap at his sittingroom door falloner quickly resumed his coat and entered the sittingroom as the porter ushered in a young lady holding a small boy by the hand but to falloners utter consternation no sooner had the door closed on the servant than the boy with a halfapologetic glance at the young lady uttered a childish cry broke from her and calling dick dick ran forward and leaped into falloners arms  the mere shock of the onset and his own amazement left bob without breath for words the boy with arms convulsively clasping his body was imprinting kisses on bobs waistcoat in default of reaching his face at last falloner managed gently but firmly to free himself and turned a halfappealing halfembarrassed look upon the young lady whose own face however suddenly flushed pink to add to the confusion the boy in some reaction of instinct suddenly ran back to her frantically clutched at her skirts and tried to bury his head in their folds  he dont love me he sobbed he dont care for me any more  the face of the young girl changed it was a pretty face in its flushing in the paleness and thoughtfulness that overcast it it was a striking face and bobs attention was for a moment distracted from the grotesqueness of the situation leaning over the boy she said in a caressing yet authoritative voice run away for a moment dear until i call you opening the door for him in a maternal way so inconsistent with the youthfulness of her figure that it struck him even in his confusion there was something also in her dress and carriage that equally affected him her garments were somewhat oldfashioned in style yet of good material with an odd incongruity to the climate and season  under her rough outer cloak she wore a polka jacket and the thinnest of summer blouses and her hat though dark was of rough straw plainly trimmed nevertheless these peculiarities were carried off with an air of breeding and selfpossession that was unmistakable it was possible that her cool selfpossession might have been due to some instinctive antagonism for as she came a step forward with coldly and clearlyopened gray eyes he was vaguely conscious that she didnt like him nevertheless her manner was formally polite even as he fancied to the point of irony as she began in a voice that occasionally dropped into the lazy southern intonation and a speech that easily slipped at times into southern dialect  i sent the child out of the room as i could see that his advances were annoying to you and a good deal i reckon because i knew your reception of them was still more painful to him it is quite natural i dare say you should feel as you do and i reckon consistent with your attitude towards him but you must make some allowance for the depth of his feelings and how he has looked forward to this meeting when i tell you that ever since he received your last letter he and his sisteruntil her illness kept her homehave gone every day when the pacific train was due to the station to meet you that they have taken literally as gospel truth every word of your letter  my letter interrupted falloner  the young girls scarlet lip curled slightly i beg your pardoni should have said the letter you dictated of course it wasnt in your handwritingyou had hurt your hand you know she added ironically at all events they believed it allthat you were coming at any moment they lived in that belief and the poor things went to the station with your photograph in their hands so that they might be the first to recognize and greet you  with my photograph interrupted falloner again  the young girls clear eyes darkened ominously i reckon she said deliberately as she slowly drew from her pocket the photograph daddy folsom had sent that that is your photograph it certainly seems an excellent likeness she added regarding him with a slight suggestion of contemptuous triumph  in an instant the revelation of the whole mystery flashed upon him the forgotten passage in houstons letter about the stolen photograph stood clearly before him the coincidence of his appearance in shepherdstown and the natural mistake of the children and their fair protector were made perfectly plain but with this relief and the certainty that he could confound her with an explanation came a certain mischievous desire to prolong the situation and increase his triumph she certainly had not shown him any favor  have you got the letter also he asked quietly  she whisked it impatiently from her pocket and handed it to him as he read daddys characteristic extravagance and recognized the familiar idiosyncrasies of his old companions he was unable to restrain a smile he raised his eyes to meet with surprise the fair strangers leveled eyebrows and brightly indignant eyes in which however the rain was fast gathering with the lightning  it may be amusing to you and i reckon likely it was all a california joke she said with slightly trembling lips i dont know nothern gentlemen and their ways and you seem to have forgotten our ways as you have your kindred perhaps all this may seem so funny to them it may not seem funny to that boy who is now crying his heart out in the hall it may not be very amusing to that poor cissy in her sickbed longing to see her brother it may be so far from amusing to her that i should hesitate to bring you there in her excited condition and subject her to the pain that you have caused him but i have promised her she is already expecting us and the disappointment may be dangerous and i can only implore youfor a few moments at leastto show a little more affection than you feel as he made an impulsive deprecating gesture yet without changing his look of restrained amusement she stopped him hopelessly oh of course yes yes i know it is years since you have seen them they have no right to expect more onlyonlyfeeling as you do she burst impulsively whyoh why did you come  here was bobs chance he turned to her politely began gravely i simply came towhen suddenly his face changed he stopped as if struck by a blow his cheek flushed and then paled good god what had he come for to tell them that this brother they were longing forliving forperhaps even dying forwas dead in his crass stupidity his wounded vanity over the scorn of the young girl his anticipation of triumph he had forgottentotally forgottenwhat that triumph meant perhaps if he had felt more keenly the death of lasham the thought of it would have been uppermost in his mind but lasham was not his partner or associate only a brother miner and his single act of generosity was in the ordinary routine of camp life if she could think him cold and heartless before what would she think of him now the absurdity of her mistake had vanished in the grim tragedy he had seemed to have cruelly prepared for her the thought struck him so keenly that he stammered faltered and sank helplessly into a chair  the shock that he had received was so plain to her that her own indignation went out in the breath of it her lip quivered dont you mind she said hurriedly dropping into her southern speech i didnt go to hurt you but i was just that mad with the thought of those pickaninnies and the easy way you took it that i clean forgot id no call to catechise you and you dont know me from the queen of sheba well she went on still more rapidly and in odd distinction to her previous formal slow southern delivery im the daughter of colonel boutelle of bayou sara louisiana and his paw and his paw before him had a plantation there since the time of adam but he lost it and six hundred niggers during the wah we were pooh as pohvertypaw and maw and we four girlsand no more idea of work than a baby but i had an education at the convent at new orleans and could play and speak french and i got a place as schoolteacher here i reckon the first southern woman that has taught school in the noth ricketts who used to be our steward at bayou sara told me about the pickaninnies and how helpless they were with only a brother who occasionally sent them money from california i suppose i cottoned to the pooh little things at first because i knew what it was to be alone amongst strangers mr lasham i used to teach them at odd times and look after them and go with them to the train to look for you perhaps ricketts made me think you didnt care for them perhaps i was wrong in thinking it was true from the way you met jimmy just now but ive spoken my mind and you know why she ceased and walked to the window  falloner rose the storm that had swept through him was over the quick determination resolute purpose and infinite patience which had made him what he was were all there and with it a conscientiousness which his selfish independence had hitherto kept dormant he accepted the situation not passivelyit was not in his naturebut threw himself into it with all his energy  you were quite right he said halting a moment beside her i dont blame you and let me hope that later you may think me less to blame than you do now now whats to be done clearly ive first to make it right with tommyi mean jimmyand then we must make a straight dash over to the girl whoop before she could understand from his face the strange change in his voice he had dashed out of the room in a moment he reappeared with the boy struggling in his arms think of the little scamp not knowing his own brother he laughed giving the boy a really affectionate if slightly exaggerated hug and expecting me to open my arms to the first little boy who jumps into them ive a great mind not to give him the present i fetched all the way from california wait a moment he dashed into the bedroom opened his valisewhere he providentially remembered he had kept with a miners superstition the first little nugget of gold he had ever foundseized the tiny bit of quartz of gold and dashed out again to display it before jimmys eager eyes  if the heartiness sympathy and charming kindness of the mans whole manner and face convinced even while it slightly startled the young girl it was still more effective with the boy children are quick to detect the false ring of affected emotion and bobs was so genuinewhatever its causethat it might have easily passed for a fraternal expression with harder critics the child trustfully nestled against him and would have grasped the gold but the young man whisked it into his pocket not until weve shown it to our little sisterwhere were going now im off to order a sleigh he dashed out again to the office as if he found some relief in action or as it seemed to miss boutelle to avoid embarrassing conversation when he came back again he was carrying an immense bearskin from his luggage he cast a critical look at the girls unseasonable attire  i shall wrap you and jimmy in thisyou know its snowing frightfully  miss boutelle flushed a little im warm enough when walking she said coldly bob glanced at her smart little french shoes and thought otherwise he said nothing but hastily bundled his two guests downstairs and into the street the whirlwind dance of the snow made the sleigh an indistinct bulk in the glittering darkness and as the young girl for an instant stood dazedly still bob incontinently lifted her from her feet deposited her in the vehicle dropped jimmy in her lap and wrapped them both tightly in the bearskin her weight which was scarcely more than a childs struck him in that moment as being tantalizingly incongruous to the matronly severity of her manner and its strange effect upon him he then jumped in himself taking the direction from his companion and drove off through the storm  the wind and darkness were not favorable to conversation and only once did he break the silence is there any one who would be likely to remembermewhere we are going he asked in a lull of the storm  miss boutelle uncovered enough of her face to glance at him curiously hardly you know the children came here from the noth after your mothers death while you were in california  of course returned bob hurriedly i was only thinkingyou know that some of my old friends might have called and then collapsed into silence  after a pause a voice came icily although under the furs perhaps youd prefer that your arrival be kept secret from the public but they seem to have already recognized you at the hotel from your inquiry about ricketts and the photograph jimmy had already shown them two weeks ago bob remembered the clerks familiar manner and the omission to ask him to register but it need go no further if you like she added with a slight return of her previous scorn  ive no reason for keeping it secret said bob stoutly  no other words were exchanged until the sleigh drew up before a plain wooden house in the suburbs of the town bob could see at a glance that it represented the income of some careful artisan or small shopkeeper and that it promised little for an invalids luxurious comfort they were ushered into a chilly sittingroom and miss boutelle ran upstairs with jimmy to prepare the invalid for bobs appearance he noticed that a word dropped by the woman who opened the door made the young girls face grave again and paled the color that the storm had buffeted to her cheek he noticed also that these plain surroundings seemed only to enhance her own superiority and that the woman treated her with a deference in odd contrast to the illconcealed disfavor with which she regarded him strangely enough this latter fact was a relief to his conscience it would have been terrible to have received their kindness under false pretenses to take their just blame of the man he personated seemed to mitigate the deceit  the young girl rejoined him presently with troubled eyes cissy was worse and only intermittently conscious but had asked to see him it was a short flight of stairs to the bedroom but before he reached it bobs heart beat faster than it had in any mountain climb in one corner of the plainly furnished room stood a small truckle bed and in it lay the invalid it needed but a single glance at her flushed face in its aureole of yellow hair to recognize the likeness to jimmy although added to that strange refinement produced by suffering there was a spiritual exaltation in the childs lookpossibly from deliriumthat awed and frightened him an awful feeling that he could not lie to this hopeless creature took possession of him and his step faltered but she lifted her small arms pathetically towards him as if she divined his trouble and he sank on his knees beside her with a tiny finger curled around his long mustache she lay there silent her face was full of trustfulness happiness and consciousnessbut she spoke no word  there was a pause and falloner slightly lifting his head without disturbing that faintly clasping finger beckoned miss boutelle to his side can you drive he said in a low voice  yes  take my sleigh and get the best doctor in town to come here at once bring him with you if you can if he cant come at once drive home yourself i will stay here  buthesitated miss boutelle  i will stay here he repeated  the door closed on the young girl and falloner still bending over the child presently heard the sleighbells pass away in the storm he still sat with his bent head held by the tiny clasp of those thin fingers but the childs eyes were fixed so intently upon him that mrs ricketts leaned over the strangelyassorted pair and said  its your brother dick dearie dont you know him  the childs lips moved faintly dicks dead she whispered  shes wandering said mrs ricketts speak to her but bob with his eyes on the childs lifted a protesting hand the little sufferers lips moved again it isnt dickits the angel god sent to tell me  she spoke no more and when miss boutelle returned with the doctor she was beyond the reach of finite voices falloner would have remained all night with them but he could see that his presence in the contracted household was not desired even his offer to take jimmy with him to the hotel was declined and at midnight he returned alone  what his thoughts were that night may be easily imagined cissys death had removed the only cause he had for concealing his real identity there was nothing more to prevent his revealing all to miss boutelle and to offer to adopt the boy but he reflected this could not be done until after the funeral for it was only due to cissys memory that he should still keep up the role of dick lasham as chief mourner if it seems strange that bob did not at this crucial moment take miss boutelle into his confidence i fear it was because he dreaded the personal effect of the deceit he had practiced upon her more than any ethical consideration she had softened considerably in her attitude towards him that night he was human after all and while he felt his conduct had been unselfish in the main he dared not confess to himself how much her opinion had influenced him he resolved that after the funeral he would continue his journey and write to her en route a full explanation of his conduct inclosing daddys letter as corroborative evidence but on searching his lettercase he found that he had lost even that evidence and he must trust solely at present to her faith in his improbable story  it seemed as if his greatest sacrifice was demanded at the funeral for it could not be disguised that the neighbors were strongly prejudiced against him even the preacher improved the occasion to warn the congregation against the dangers of putting off duty until too late and when robert falloner pale but selfrestrained left the church with miss boutelle equally pale and reserved on his arm he could with difficulty restrain his fury at the passing of a significant smile across the faces of a few curious bystanders it was amy boutelle that was the penitence that fetched him you bet he overheard a barely concealed whisper and the reply and its a good thing shes made out of it too for hes mighty rich  at the church door he took her cold hand into his i am leaving tomorrow morning with jimmy he said with a white face goodby  you are quite right goodby she replied as briefly but with the faintest color he wondered if she had heard it too  whether she had heard it or not she went home with mrs ricketts in some righteous indignation which foundafter the young ladys habitfree expression whatever were mr lashams faults of omission it was most unchristian to allude to them there and an insult to the poor little dears memory who had forgiven them were she in his shoes she would shake the dust of the town off her feet and she hoped he would she was a little softened on arriving to find jimmy in tears he had lost dicks photographor dick had forgotten to give it back at the hotel for this was all he had in his pocket and he produced a letterthe missing letter of daddy which by mistake falloner had handed back instead of the photograph miss boutelle saw the superscription and californian postmark with a vague curiosity  did you look inside dear perhaps it slipped in  jimmy had not miss boutelle didand i grieve to say ended by reading the whole letter  bob falloner had finished packing his things the next morning and was waiting for mr ricketts and jimmy but when a tap came at the door he opened it to find miss boutelle standing there i have sent jimmy into the bedroom she said with a faint smile to look for the photograph which you gave him in mistake for this i think for the present he prefers his brothers picture to this letter which i have not explained to him or any one she stopped and raising her eyes to his said gently i think it would have only been a part of your goodness to have trusted me mr falloner  then you will forgive me he said eagerly  she looked at him frankly yet with a faint trace of coquetry that the angels might have pardoned do you want me to say to you what mrs ricketts says were the last words of poor cissy  a year later when the darkness and rain were creeping up sawyers ledge and houston and daddy folsom were sitting before their brushwood fire in the old lasham cabin the latter delivered himself oracularly  its a mighty queer thing that news about bob its not that hes married for that might happen to any one but this yer account in the paper of his wedding being attended by his little brother that gets me to think all the while he was here he was lettin on to us that he hadnt kith or kin well sir that accounts to me for one thingthe singler way he tumbled to that letter of poor dick lashams little brother and sent him that draft dont ye see it was a feller feelin knew how it was himself i reckon ye all thought i was kinder soft reading that letter o dick lashams little brother to him but ye see what it did     the youngest miss piper   i do not think that any of us who enjoyed the acquaintance of the piper girls or the hospitality of judge piper their father ever cared for the youngest sister not on account of her extreme youth for the eldest miss piper confessed to twentysixand the youth of the youngest sister was established solely i think by one big braid down her back neither was it because she was the plainest for the beauty of the piper girls was a recognized general distinction and the youngest miss piper was not entirely devoid of the family charms nor was it from any lack of intelligence nor from any defective social quality for her precocity was astounding and her goodhumored frankness alarming neither do i think it could be said that a slight deafness which might impart an embarrassing publicity to any statementthe reverse of our general feelingthat might be confided by any one to her private ear was a sufficient reason for it was pointed out that she always understood everything that tom sparrell told her in his ordinary tone of voice briefly it was very possible that delawarethe youngest miss piperdid not like us yet it was fondly believed by us that the other sisters failed to show that indifference to our existence shown by miss delaware although the heartburnings misunderstandings jealousies hopes and fears and finally the chivalrous resignation with which we at last accepted the long foregone conclusion that they were not for us and far beyond our reach is not a part of this veracious chronicle enough that none of the flirtations of her elder sisters affected or were shared by the youngest miss piper she moved in this heartbreaking atmosphere with sublime indifference treating her sisters affairs with what we considered rank simplicity or appalling frankness their few admirers who were weak enough to attempt to gain her mediation or confidence had reason to regret it  its no kind o use givin me goodies she said to a helpless suitor of louisiana pipers who had offered to bring her some sweets for i aint got no influence with lu and if i dont give em up to her when she hears of it shell nag me and hate you like pizen unless she added thoughtfully it was wintergreen lozenges lu cant stand them or anybody who eats them within a mile it is needless to add that the miserable man thus put upon his gallantry was obliged in honor to provide del with the wintergreen lozenges that kept him in disfavor and at a distance unfortunately too any predilection or pity for any particular suitor of her sisters was attended by even more disastrous consequences it was reported that while acting as gooseberrya role usually assigned to herbetween virginia piper and an exceptionally timid young surveyor during a ramble she conceived a rare sentiment of humanity towards the unhappy man after once or twice lingering behind in the ostentatious picking of a wayside flower or running on ahead to look at a mountain view without any apparent effect on the shy and speechless youth she decoyed him aside while her elder sister rambled indifferently and somewhat scornfully on the youngest miss piper leaped upon the rail of a fence and with the stalk of a thimbleberry in her mouth swung her small feet to and fro and surveyed him dispassionately  ye dont seem to be ketchin on she said tentatively  the young man smiled feebly and interrogatively  dont seem to be either follering suit nor trumpin continued del bluntly  i suppose sothat is i fear that miss virginiahe stammered  speak up im a little deaf say it again said del screwing up her eyes and eyebrows  the young man was obliged to admit in stentorian tones that his progress had been scarcely satisfactory  youre goin on too slowthats it said del critically why when captain savage meandered along here with jinny virginia last week afore we got as far as this hed reeled off a heap of byron and jamieson tennyson and sich and only yesterday jinny and doctor beveridge was blowin thistletops to know which was a flirt all along the trail past the crossroads why ye aint picked ez much as a single berry for jinny let alone lads love or johnny jumpups and kissmes and ye keep talkin across me you two till im tired now look here she burst out with sudden decision jinnys gone on ahead in a kind o huff but i reckon shes done that afore too and youll find her jest as spinner did on the rise of the hill sittin on a pine stump and lookin like this here the youngest miss piper locked her fingers over her left knee and drew it slightly upwith a sublime indifference to the exposure of considerable smallankled red stockingand with a faroff plaintive stare achieved a colorable imitation of her elder sisters probable attitude then you jest go up softly like as you was a bear and clap your hands on her eyes and say in a disguised voice like this here del turned on a high falsetto beyond any masculine compass whos who jest like in forfeits  but shell be sure to know me said the surveyor timidly  she wont said del in scornful skepticism  i hardly thinkstammered the young man with an awkward smile that iin factshell discover mebefore i can get beside her  not if you go softly for shell be sittin back to the road sogazing away sothe youngest miss piper again stared dreamily in the distance and youll creep up just behind like this  but wont she be angry i havent known her longthat isdont you see he stopped embarrassedly  cant hear a word you say said del shaking her head decisively youve got my deaf ear speak louder or come closer  but here the instruction suddenly ended once and for all time for whether the young man was seriously anxious to perfect himself whether he was truly grateful to the young girl and tried to show it whether he was emboldened by the childish appeal of the long brown distinguishing braid down her back or whether he suddenly found something peculiarly provocative in the reddish brown eyes between their thickset hedge of lashes and with the trim figure and piquant pose and was seized with that hysteric desperation which sometimes attacks timidity itself i cannot say enough that he suddenly put his arm around her waist and his lips to her soft satin cheek peppered and salted as it was by sunfreckles and mountain air and received a sound box on the ear for his pains the incident was closed he did not repeat the experiment on either sister the disclosure of his rebuff seemed however to give a singular satisfaction to red gulch  while it may be gathered from this that the youngest miss piper was impervious to general masculine advances it was not until later that red gulch was thrown into skeptical astonishment by the rumors that all this time she really had a lover allusion has been made to the charge that her deafness did not prevent her from perfectly understanding the ordinary tone of voice of a certain mr thomas sparrell  no undue significance was attached to this fact through the very insignificance and impossibility of that individuala lanky redhaired youth incapacitated for manual labor through lamenessa clerk in a general store at the cross roads he had never been the recipient of judge pipers hospitality he had never visited the house even with parcels apparently his only interviews with her or any of the family had been over the counter to do him justice he certainly had never seemed to seek any nearer acquaintance he was not at the church door when her sisters beautiful in their sunday gowns filed into the aisle with little delaware bringing up the rear he was not at the democratic barbecue that we attended without reference to our personal politics and solely for the sake of judge piper and the girls nor did he go to the agricultural fair ballopen to all his abstention we believed to be owing to his lameness to a wholesome consciousness of his own social defects or an inordinate passion for reading cheap scientific textbooks which did not however add fluency nor conviction to his speech neither had he the abstraction of a student for his accounts were kept with an accuracy which struck us who dealt at the store as ignobly practical and even malignant possibly we might have expressed this opinion more strongly but for a certain rude vigor of repartee which he possessed and a suggestion that he might have a temper on occasion them redhaired chaps is like to be tetchy and to kinder see blood through their eyelashes had been suggested by an observing customer  in short little as we knew of the youngest miss piper he was the last man we should have suspected her to select as an admirer what we did know of their public relations purely commercial ones implied the reverse of any cordial understanding the provisioning of the piper household was entrusted to del with other practical odds and ends of housekeeping not ornamental and the following is said to be a truthful record of one of their overheard interviews at the store  the youngest miss piper entering displacing a quantity of goods in the centre to make a sideways seat for herself and looking around loftily as she took a memorandumbook and pencil from her pocket  ahem if i aint taking you away from your studies mr sparrell maybe youll be good enough to look here a minitbut in affected politeness if im disturbing you i can come another time  sparrell placing the book he had been reading carefully under the counter and advancing to miss delaware with a complete ignoring of her irony what can we do for you today miss piper  miss delaware with great suavity of manner examining her memorandumbook i suppose it wouldnt be shocking your delicate feelings too much to inform you that the canned lobster and oysters you sent us yesterday wasnt fit for hogs  sparrell blandly they werent intended for them miss piper if we had known you were having company over from red gulch to dinner we might have provided something more suitable for them we have a fair quality of oilcake and corncobs in stock at reduced figures but the canned provisions were for your own family  miss delaware secretly pleased at this sarcastic allusion to her sisters friends but concealing her delight i admire to hear you talk that way mr sparrell its better than minstrels or a circus i suppose you get it outer that book indicating the concealed volume what do you call it  sparrell politely the first principles of geology  miss delaware leaning sideways and curling her little fingers around her pink ear did you say the first principles of geology or politeness you know i am so deaf but of course it couldnt be that  sparrell easily oh no you seem to have that in your handpointing to miss delawares memorandumbookyou were quoting from it when you came in  miss delaware after an affected silence of deep resignation well its too bad folks cant just spend their lives listenin to such elegant talk id admire to do nothing else but theres my family up at cottonwoodand they must eat theyre that low that they expect me to waste my time getting food for em here instead of drinking in the first principles of the grocery  geology suggested sparrell blandly the history of rock formation  geology accepted miss delaware apologetically the history of rocks which is so necessary for knowing just how much sand you can put in the sugar so i reckon ill leave my list here and you can have the things toted to cottonwood when youve got through with your first principles  she tore out a list of her commissions from a page of her memorandumbook leaped lightly from the counter threw her brown braid from her left shoulder to its proper place down her back shook out her skirts deliberately and saying thank you for a most improvin afternoon mr sparrell sailed demurely out of the store  a few auditors of this narrative thought it inconsistent that a daughter of judge piper and a sister of the angelic host should put up with a mere clerks familiarity but it was pointed out that she gave him as good as he sent and the story was generally credited but certainly no one ever dreamed that it pointed to any more precious confidences between them  i think the secret burst upon the family with other things at the big picnic at reservoir canyon this festivity had been arranged for weeks previously and was undertaken chiefly by the red gulch contingent as we were called as a slight return to the piper family for their frequent hospitality the piper sisters were expected to bring nothing but their own personal graces and attend to the ministration of such viands and delicacies as the boys had profusely supplied  the site selected was reservoir canyon a beautiful triangular valley with very steep sides one of which was crowned by the immense reservoir of the pioneer ditch company the sheer flanks of the canyon descended in furrowed lines of vines and clinging bushes like folds of falling skirts until they broke again into flounces of spangled shrubbery over a broad level carpet of monkshood mariposas lupines poppies and daisies tempered and secluded from the suns rays by its lofty shadows the delicious obscurity of the canyon was in sharp contrast to the fiery mountain trail that in the full glare of the noonday sky made its tortuous way down the hillside like a stream of lava to plunge suddenly into the valley and extinguish itself in its coolness as in a lake the heavy odors of wild honeysuckle syringa and ceanothus that hung over it were lightened and freshened by the sharp spicing of pine and bay the mountain breeze which sometimes shook the serrated tops of the large redwoods above with a chill from the remote snow peaks even in the heart of summer never reached the little valley  it seemed an ideal place for a picnic everybody was therefore astonished to hear that an objection was suddenly raised to this perfect site they were still more astonished to know that the objector was the youngest miss piper pressed to give her reasons she had replied that the locality was dangerous that the reservoir placed upon the mountain notoriously old and worn out had been rendered more unsafe by false economy in unskillful and hasty repairs to satisfy speculating stockbrokers and that it had lately shown signs of leakage and sapping of its outer walls that in the event of an outbreak the little triangular valley from which there was no outlet would be instantly flooded asked still more pressingly to give her authority for these details she at first hesitated and then gave the name of tom sparrell  the derision with which this statement was received by us all as the opinion of a sedentary clerk was quite natural and obvious but not the anger which it excited in the breast of judge piper for it was not generally known that the judge was the holder of a considerable number of shares in the pioneer ditch company and that large dividends had been lately kept up by a false economy of expenditure to expedite a sharp deal in the stock by which the judge and others could sell out of a failing company rather it was believed that the judges anger was due only to the discovery of sparrells influence over his daughter and his interference with the social affairs of cottonwood it was said that there was a sharp scene between the youngest miss piper and the combined forces of the judge and the elder sisters which ended in the formers resolute refusal to attend the picnic at all if that site was selected  as delaware was known to be fearless even to the point of recklessness and fond of gayety her refusal only intensified the belief that she was merely stickin up for sparrells judgment without any reference to her own personal safety or that of her sisters the warning was laughed away the opinion of sparrell treated with ridicule as the dyspeptic and envious expression of an impractical man it was pointed out that the reservoir had lasted a long time even in its alleged ruinous state that only a miracle of coincidence could make it break down that particular afternoon of the picnic that even if it did happen there was no direct proof that it would seriously flood the valley or at best add more than a spice of excitement to the affair the red gulch contingent who would be there was quite as capable of taking care of the ladies in case of any accident as any lame crank who wouldnt but could only croak a warning to them from a distance a few even wished something might happen that they might have an opportunity of showing their superior devotion indeed the prospect of carrying the halfsubmerged sisters in a condition of helpless loveliness in their arms to a place of safety was a fascinating possibility the warning was conspicuously ineffective everybody looked eagerly forward to the day and the unchanged locality to the greatest hopefulness and anticipation was added the stirring of defiance and when at last the appointed hour had arrived the picnic party passed down the twisting mountain trail through the heat and glare in a fever of enthusiasm  it was a pretty sight to view this sparkling processionthe girls cool and radiant in their white blue and yellow muslins and flying ribbons the contingent in its cleanest ducks and blue and red flannel shirts the judge whitewaistcoated and panamahatted with a new dignity borrowed from the previous circumstances and three or four impressive chinamen bringing up the rear with hampersas it at last debouched into reservoir canyon  here they dispersed themselves over the limited area scarcely half an acre with the freedom of escaped school children they were secure in their woodland privacy they were overlooked by no high road and its passing teams they were safe from accidental intrusion from the settlement indeed they went so far as to effect the exclusiveness of clique at first they amused themselves by casting humorously defiant eyes at the long low ditch reservoir which peeped over the green wall of the ridge six hundred feet above them at times they even simulated an exaggerated terror of it and one recognized humorist declaimed a grotesque appeal to its forbearance with delightful local allusions others pretended to discover near a woodmans hut among the belt of pines at the top of the descending trail the peeping figure of the ridiculous and envious sparrell but all this was presently forgotten in the actual festivity small as was the range of the valley it still allowed retreats during the dances for waiting couples among the convenient laurel and manzanita bushes which flounced the mountain side after the dancing oldfashioned childrens games were revived with great laughter and halfhearted and coy protests from the ladies notably one pastime known as im apinin in which ingenious performance the victim was obliged to stand in the centre of a circle and publicly pine for a member of the opposite sex some hilarity was occasioned by the mischievous miss georgy piper declaring when it came to her turn that she was pinin for a look at the face of tom sparrell just now  in this local trifling two hours passed until the party sat down to the longlooked for repast it was here that the health of judge piper was neatly proposed by the editor of the argus the judge responded with great dignity and some emotion he reminded them that it had been his humble endeavor to promote harmonythat harmony so characteristic of american principlesin social as he had in political circles and particularly among the strangely constituted yet purely american elements of frontier life he accepted the present festivity with its overflowing hospitalities not in recognition of himselfyes yesnor of his familyenthusiastic protestsbut of that american principle if at one time it seemed probable that these festivities might be marred by the machinations of envygroansor that harmony interrupted by the importation of lowtoned material interestsgroanshe could say that looking around him he had never before felterthathere the judge stopped short reeled slightly forward caught at a campstool recovered himself with an apologetic smile and turned inquiringly to his neighbor  a light laughinstantly suppressedat what was at first supposed to be the effect of the overflowing hospitality upon the speaker himself went around the male circle until it suddenly appeared that half a dozen others had started to their feet at the same time with white faces and that one of the ladies had screamed  what is it everybody was asking with interrogatory smiles  it was judge piper who replied  a little shock of earthquake he said blandly a mere thrill i think he added with a faint smile we may say that nature herself has applauded our efforts in good old californian fashion and signified her assent what are you saying fludder  i was thinking sir said fludder deferentially in a lower voice that if anything was wrong in the reservoir this shock you know might  he was interrupted by a faint crashing and crackling sound and looking up beheld a goodsized boulder evidently detached from some greater height strike the upland plateau at the left of the trail and bound into the fringe of forest beside it a slight cloud of dust marked its course and then lazily floated away in mid air but it had been watched agitatedly and it was evident that that singular loss of nervous balance which is apt to affect all those who go through the slightest earthquake experience was felt by all but some sense of humor however remained  looks as if the water risks we took aint goin to cover earthquakes drawled dick frisney still that wasnt a bad shot if we only knew what they were aiming at  do be quiet said virginia piper her cheeks pink with excitement listen cant you whats that funny murmuring you hear now and then up there  its only the snowwind playin with the pines on the summit you girls wont allow anybody any fun but yourselves  but here a scream from georgy who assisted by captain fairfax had mounted a campstool at the mouth of the valley attracted everybodys attention she was standing upright with dilated eyes staring at the top of the trail look she said excitedly if the trail isnt moving  everybody faced in that direction at the first glance it seemed indeed as if the trail was actually moving wriggling and undulating its tortuous way down the mountain like a huge snake only swollen to twice its usual size but the second glance showed it to be no longer a trail but a channel of water whose stream lifted in a borelike wall four or five feet high was plunging down into the devoted valley  for an instant they were unable to comprehend even the nature of the catastrophe the reservoir was directly over their heads the bursting of its wall they had imagined would naturally bring down the water in a dozen trickling streams or falls over the cliff above them and along the flanks of the mountain but that its suddenly liberated volume should overflow the upland beyond and then descend in a pentup flood by their own trail and their only avenue of escape had been beyond their wildest fancy  they met this smiting truth with that characteristic short laugh with which the american usually receives the blow of fate or the unexpectedas if he recognized only the absurdity of the situation then they ran to the women collected them together and dragged them to vantages of fancied security among the bushes which flounced the long skirts of the mountain walls but i leave this part of the description to the characteristic language of one of the party  when the flood struck us it did not seem to take any stock of us in particular but laid itself out to go for that picnic for all it was worth it wiped it off the face of the earth in about twentyfive seconds it first made a clean break from stem to stern carrying everything along with it the first thing i saw was old judge piper puttin on his best licks to get away from a big can of strawberry ice cream that was trundling after him and trying to empty itself on his collar whenever a bigger wave lifted it he was followed by what was left of the brass band the big drum just humpin itself to keep abreast o the ice cream mixed up with campstools musicstands a few chinamen and then what they call in them big san francisco processions citizens generally the hull thing swept up the canyon inside o thirty seconds then what captain fairfax called the reflex action in the laws o motion happened and darned if the hull blamed procession didnt sweep back againthis time all the heavy artillery such as campkettles lager beer kegs bottles glasses and crockery that was left behind takin the lead now and judge piper and that ice cream can bringin up the rear as the jedge passed us the second time we noticed that that ice cream canhevin swallowed waterwas kinder losing its wind and we encouraged the old man by shoutin out five to one on him and then you wouldnt believe what followed why darn my skin when that reflex met the current at the other end it just swirled around again in what captain fairfax called the centrifugal curve and just went round and round the canyon like ez when yer washin the dirt out o a prospectin panevery now and then washin some one of the boys that was in it like scum up agin the banks  we managed in this way to snake out the judge jest ez he was sailin round on the home stretch passin the quarter post two lengths ahead o the can a good deal o the ice cream had washed away but it took us ten minutes to shake the cracked ice and powdered salt out o the old mans clothes and warm him up again in the laurel bush where he was clinging this sort o here we go round the mulberry bush kep on until most o the humans was got out and only the furniture o the picnic was left in the race then it got kinder mixed up and went sloshin round here and there ez the water kep comin down by the trail then lulu piper what i was holdin up all the time in a laurel bush gets an idea for all she was wet and draggled and ez the things went bobbin round she calls out the figures o a cotillon to em two campstools forward sashay and back to your places change partners hands all round  she was clear grit you bet and the joke caught on and the other girls jined in and it kinder cheered em for they was wantin it then fludder allowed to pacify em by sayin he just figured up the size o the reservoir and the size o the canyon and he kalkilated that the cube was about ekal and the canyon couldnt flood any more and then luluwho was peart as a jay and couldnt be fooledspeaks up and says whats the matter with the ditch dick  lord then we knew that she knew the worst for of course all the water in the ditch itselffifty miles of itwas drainin now into that reservoir and was bound to come down to the canyon  it was at this point that the situation became really desperate for they had now crawled up the steep sides as far as the bushes afforded foothold and the water was still rising the chatter of the girls ceased there were long silences in which the men discussed the wildest plans and proposed to tear their shirts into strips to make ropes to support the girls by sticks driven into the mountain side it was in one of those intervals that the distinct strokes of a woodmans axe were heard high on the upland at the point where the trail descended to the canyon every ear was alert but only those on one side of the canyon could get a fair view of the spot this was the good fortune of captain fairfax and georgy piper who had climbed to the highest bush on that side and were now standing up gazing excitedly in that direction  some one is cutting down a tree at the head of the trail shouted fairfax the response and joyful explanation for a dam across the trail was on everybodys lips at the same time  but the strokes of the axe were slow and painfully intermittent impatience burst out  yell to him to hurry up why havent they brought two men  its only one man shouted the captain and he seems to be a cripple by jiminyit isyesits tom sparrell  there was a dead silence then i grieve to say shame and its twin brother rage took possession of their weak humanity oh yes it was all of a piece why in the name of folly hadnt he sent for an ablebodied man were they to be drowned through his cranky obstinacy  the blows still went on slowly presently however they seemed to alternate with other blowsbut alas they were slower and if possible feebler  have they got another cripple to work roared the contingent in one furious voice  noits a womana little oneyes a girl hello why sure as you live its delaware  a spontaneous cheer burst from the contingent partly as a rebuke to sparrell i think partly from some shame over their previous rage he could take it as he liked  still the blows went on distressingly slow the girls were hoisted on the mens shoulders the men were half submerged then there was a painful pause then a crumbling crash another cheer went up from the canyon  its down straight across the trail shouted fairfax and a part of the bank on the top of it  there was another moment of suspense would it hold or be carried away by the momentum of the flood it held in a few moments fairfax again gave voice to the cheering news that the flow had stopped and the submerged trail was reappearing in twenty minutes it was cleara muddy river bed but possible of ascent of course there was no diminution of the water in the canyon which had no outlet yet it now was possible for the party to swing from bush to bush along the mountain side until the foot of the trailno longer an opposing onewas reached there were some missteps and mishapsflounderings in the water and some dangerous rescuesbut in half an hour the whole concourse stood upon the trail and commenced the ascent it was a slow difficult and lugubrious processioni fear not the besttempered one now that the stimulus of danger and chivalry was past when they reached the dam made by the fallen tree although they were obliged to make a long detour to avoid its steep sides they could see how successfully it had diverted the current to a declivity on the other side  but strangely enough they were greeted by nothing else sparrell and the youngest miss piper were gone and when they at last reached the highroad they were astounded to hear from a passing teamster that no one in the settlement knew anything of the disaster  this was the last drop in their cup of bitterness they who had expected that the settlement was waiting breathlessly for their rescue who anticipated that they would be welcomed as heroes were obliged to meet the illconcealed amusement of passengers and friends at their dishevelled and bedraggled appearance which suggested only the blundering mishaps of an ordinary summer outing boatin in the reservoir and fell in playing at canalboat in the ditch were some of the cheerful hypotheses the fleeting sense of gratitude they had felt for their deliverers was dissipated by the time they had reached their homes and their rancor increased by the information that when the earthquake occurred mr tom sparrell and miss delaware were enjoying a pasear in the foresthe having a halfholiday by virtue of the festivaland that the earthquake had revived his fears of a catastrophe the two had procured axes in the woodmans hut and did what they thought was necessary to relieve the situation of the picnickers but the very modesty of this account of their own performance had the effect of belittling the catastrophe itself and the picnickers report of their exceeding peril was received with incredulous laughter  for the first time in the history of red gulch there was a serious division between the piper family supported by the contingent and the rest of the settlement tom sparrells warning was remembered by the latter and the ingratitude of the picnickers to their rescuers commented upon the actual calamity to the reservoir was more or less attributed to the imprudent and reckless contiguity of the revelers on that day and there were not wanting those who referred the accident itself to the machinations of the scheming ditch director piper  it was said that there was a stormy scene in the piper household that evening the judge had demanded that delaware should break off her acquaintance with sparrell and she had refused the judge had demanded of sparrells employer that he should discharge him and had been met with the astounding information that sparrell was already a silent partner in the concern at this revelation judge piper was alarmed while he might object to a clerk who could not support a wife as a consistent democrat he could not oppose a fairly prosperous tradesman a final appeal was made to delaware she was implored to consider the situation of her sisters who had all made more ambitious marriages or were about to make them why should she now degrade the family by marrying a country storekeeper  it is said that here the youngest miss piper made a memorable reply and a revelation the truth of which was never gainsaid  you all wanter know why im going to marry tom sparrell she queried standing up and facing the whole family circle  yes  why i prefer him to the hull caboodle that you girls have married or are going to marry she continued meditatively biting the end of her braid  yes  well hes the only man of the whole lot that hasnt proposed to me first  it is presumed that sparrell made good the omission or that the family were glad to get rid of her for they were married that autumn and really a later comparison of the family records shows that while captain fairfax remained captain fairfax and the other sonsinlaw did not advance proportionately in standing or riches the lame storekeeper of red gulch became the hon senator tom sparrell     a widow of the santa ana valley   the widow wade was standing at her bedroom window staring out in that vague instinct which compels humanity in moments of doubt and perplexity to seek this change of observation or superior illumination not that mrs wades disturbance was of a serious character she had passed the acute stage of widowhood by at least two years and the slight redness of her soft eyelids as well as the droop of her pretty mouth were merely the recognized outward and visible signs of the grievously minded religious community in which she lived the mourning she still wore was also partly in conformity with the sadcolored garments of her neighbors and the necessities of the rainy season she was in comfortable circumstances the mistress of a large ranch in the valley which had lately become more valuable by the extension of a wagon road through its centre she was simply worrying whether she should go to a sociable ending with a dancea daring innovation of some strangersat the new hotel or continue to eschew such follies that were according to local belief unsuited to a vale of tears  indeed at this moment the prospect she gazed abstractedly upon seemed to justify that lugubrious description the santa ana valleya long monotonous levelwas dimly visible through moving curtains of rain or veils of mist to the black mourning edge of the horizon and had looked like that for months the valleyin some remote epoch an arm of the san francisco bayevery rainy season seemed to be trying to revert to its original condition and long after the early spring had laid on its liberal color in strips bands and patches of blue and yellow the blossoms of mustard and lupine glistened like wet paint nevertheless on that rich alluvial soil natures tears seemed only to fatten the widows acres and increase her crops her neighbors too were equally prosperous yet for six months of the year the recognized expression of santa ana was one of sadness and for the other six monthsof resignation mrs wade had yielded early to this influence as she had to others in the weakness of her gentle nature and partly as it was more becoming the singular tragedy that had made her a widow  the late mr wade had been found dead with a bullet through his head in a secluded part of the road over heavy tree hill in sonora county near him lay two other bodies one afterwards identified as john stubbs a resident of the hill and probably a traveling companion of wades and the other a noted desperado and highwayman still masked as at the moment of the attack wade and his companion had probably sold their lives dearly and against odds for another mask was found on the ground indicating that the attack was not singlehanded and as wades body had not yet been rifled it was evident that the remaining highwayman had fled in haste the hue and cry had been given by apparently the only one of the travelers who escaped but as he was hastening to take the overland coach to the east at the time his testimony could not be submitted to the coroners deliberation the facts however were sufficiently plain for a verdict of willful murder against the highwayman although it was believed that the absent witness had basely deserted his companion and left him to his fate or as was suggested by others that he might even have been an accomplice it was this circumstance which protracted comment on the incident and the sufferings of the widow far beyond that rapid obliteration which usually overtook such affairs in the feverish haste of the early days it caused her to remove to santa ana where her old father had feebly ranched a quarter section in the valley he survived her husband only a few months leaving her the property and once more in mourning perhaps this continuity of woe endeared her to a neighborhood where distinctive ravages of diphtheria or scarlet fever gave a kind of social preeminence to any household and she was so sympathetically assisted by her neighbors in the management of the ranch that from an unkempt and wasteful wilderness it became paying property the slim willowy figure soft redlidded eyes and deep crape of sister wade at church or prayermeeting was grateful to the soul of these gloomy worshipers and in time she herself found that the arm of these dyspeptics of mind and body was nevertheless strong and sustaining small wonder that she should hesitate tonight about plunging into inconsistent even though trifling frivolities  but apart from this superficial reason there was another instinctive one deep down in the recesses of mrs wades timid heart which she had kept to herself and indeed would have tearfully resented had it been offered by another the late mr wade had been in fact a singular example of this kind of frivolous existence carried to a manlike excess besides being a patron of amusements mr wade gambled raced and drank he was often home late and sometimes not at all not that this conduct was exceptional in the roaring days of heavy tree hill but it had given mrs wade perhaps an undue preference for a less certain even if a more serious life his tragic death was of course a kind of martyrdom which exalted him in the feminine mind to a saintly memory yet mrs wade was not without a certain relief in that it was voiced perhaps crudely by the widow of abner drake in a visit of condolence to the tearful mrs wade a few days after wades death its a vale o sorrow mrs wade said the sympathizer but it has its ups and downs and i recken yell be feelin soon pretty much as i did about abner when he was took it was mighty soothin and comfortin to feel that whatever might happen now i always knew just whar abner was passin his nights poor slim mrs wade had no disquieting sense of humor to interfere with her reception of this large truth and she accepted it with a burst of reminiscent tears  a long volleying shower had just passed down the level landscape and was followed by a rolling mist from the warm saturated soil like the smoke of the discharge through it she could see a faint lightening of the hidden sun again darkening through a sudden onset of rain and changing as with her conflicting doubts and resolutions thus gazing she was vaguely conscious of an addition to the landscape in the shape of a man who was passing down the road with a pack on his back like the tramping prospectors she had often seen at heavy tree hill that memory apparently settled her vacillating mind she determined she would not go to the dance but as she was turning away from the window a second figure a horseman appeared in another direction by a crossroad a shorter cut through her domain this she had no difficulty in recognizing as one of the strangers who were getting up the dance she had noticed him at church on the previous sunday as he passed the house he appeared to be gazing at it so earnestly that she drew back from the window lest she should be seen and then for no reason whatever she changed her mind once more and resolved to go to the dance gravely announcing this fact to the wife of her superintendent who kept house with her in her loneliness she thought nothing more about it she should go in her mourning with perhaps the addition of a white collar and frill  it was evident however that santa ana thought a good deal more than she did of this new idea which seemed a part of the innovation already begun by the building up of the new hotel it was argued by some that as the new church and new schoolhouse had been opened by prayer it was only natural that a lighter festivity should inaugurate the opening of the hotel i reckon that dancin is about the next thing to travelin for gettin up an appetite for refreshments and thats what the landlord is kalkilatin to sarve was the remark of a gloomy but practical citizen on the veranda of the valley emporium thats so rejoined a bystander and i notice on that last box o pills i got for chills the directions say that a little agreeable exercisenot too violentis a great assistance to the working o the pills  i reckon that that mr brooks whos down here lookin arter mill property got up the dance hes bin round town canvassin all the women folks and drummin up likely gals for it they say he actooally sent an invite to the widder wade remarked another lounger gosh hes got cheek  well gentlemen said the proprietor judicially while we dont intend to hev any minin camp fandangos or frisco falals round santa anysanta ana was proud of its simple agricultural virtuesi aint so hardshelled as not to give new things a fair trial and after all its the women folk that has the say about it why theres old miss ford sez she hasnt kicked a fut sence she left mizoori but wouldnt mind trying it agin ez to brooks takin that troublewell i suppose its along o his bein healthy he heaved a deep dyspeptic sigh which was faintly echoed by the others why look at him now ridin round on that black hoss o his in the wet since daylight and not carin for blind chills or rhumatiz  he was looking at a serapedraped horseman the one the widow had seen on the previous night who was now cantering slowly up the street seeing the group on the veranda he rode up threw himself lightly from his saddle and joined them he was an alert determined goodlooking fellow of about thirtyfive whose smooth smiling face hardly commended itself to santa ana though his eyes were distinctly sympathetic he glanced at the depressed group around him and became ominously serious  when did it happen he asked gravely  what happen said the nearest bystander  the funeral flood fight or fire which of the four fs was it  what are ye talkin about said the proprietor stiffly scenting some dangerous humor  you said brooks promptly youre all standing here croaking like crows this fine morning i passed your farm johnson not an hour ago the wheat just climbing out of the black adobe mud as thick as rows of pins on paperwhat have you to grumble at i saw your stock briggs over on twomile bottom waddling along fat as the adobe they were sticking in their coats shining like fresh paintwhats the matter with you and turning to the proprietor theres your shed saunders over on the creek just bursting with last years grain that you know has gone up two hundred per cent since you bought it at a bargainwhat are you growling at its enough to provoke a fire or a famine to hear you groaningand take care it dont some day as a lesson to you  all this was so perfectly true of the prosperous burghers that they could not for a moment reply but briggs had recourse to what he believed to be a retaliatory taunt  i heard youve been askin widow wade to come to your dance he said with a wink at the others of course she said yes  of course she did returned brooks coolly ive just got her note  what ejaculated the three men together mrs wade comin  certainly why shouldnt she and it would do you good to come too and shake the limp dampness out o you returned brooks as he quietly remounted his horse and cantered away  darned ef i dont think hes got his eye on the widder said johnson faintly  or the quarter section added briggs gloomily  for all that the eventful evening came with many lights in the staring undraped windows of the hotel coldly bright bunting on the still damp walls of the long diningroom and a gentle downpour from the hidden skies above a close carryall was especially selected to bring mrs wade and her housekeeper the widow arrived looking a little slimmer than usual in her closely buttoned black dress white collar and cuffs very glistening in eye and in hairwhose glossy black ringlets were perhaps more elaborately arranged than was her customand with a faint coming and going of color due perhaps to her agitation at this tentative reentering into worldly life which was nevertheless quite virginal in effect a vague solemnity pervaded the introductory proceedings and a singular want of sociability was visible in the sociable part of the entertainment people talked in whispers or with that grave precision which indicates good manners in rural communities conversed painfully with other people whom they did not want to talk to rather than appear to be alone or rushed aimlessly together like water drops and then floated in broken adherent masses over the floor the widow became a helpless religious centre of deacons and sundayschool teachers which brooks untiring yet fruitless in his attempt to produce gayety tried in vain to break to this gloom the untried dangers of the impending dance duly prefigured by a lonely cottage piano and two violins in a desert of expanse added a nervous chill when at last the music struck upsomewhat hesitatingly and protestingly from the circumstance that the player was the church organist and fumbled mechanically for his stops the attempt to make up a cotillon set was left to the heroic brooks yet he barely escaped disaster when in posing the couples he incautiously begged them to look a little less as if they were waiting for the coffin to be borne down the aisle between them and was rewarded by a burst of tears from mrs johnson who had lost a child two years before and who had to be led away while her place in the set was taken by another yet the cotillon passed off a spanish dance succeeded moneymusk with the virginia reel put a slight intoxicating vibration into the air and healthy youth at last asserted itself in a score of freckled but buxom girls in white muslin with romping figures and laughter at the lower end of the room still a rigid decorum reigned among the elder dancers and the figures were called out in grave formality as if to brookss fancy they were hymns given from the pulpit until at the close of the set in halfreal halfmock despair he turned desperately to mrs wade his partner  do you waltz  mrs wade hesitated she had before marriage and was a good waltzer i do she said timidly but do you think they  but before the poor widow could formulate her fears as to the reception of round dances brooks had darted to the piano and the next moment she heard with a fearful joy the opening bars of a waltz it was an old julien waltz fresh still in the fifties daring provocative to foot swamping to intellect arresting to judgment irresistible supreme before mrs wade could protest brookss arm had gathered up her slim figure and with one quick backward sweep and swirl they were off the floor was cleared for them in a sudden bewilderment of alarma suspense of burning curiosity the widows little feet tripped quickly her long black skirt swung out as she turned the corner there was not only a sudden revelation of her pretty ankles but what was more startling a dazzling flash of frilled and laced petticoat which at once convinced every woman in the room that the act had been premeditated for days yet even that criticism was presently forgotten in the pervading intoxication of the music and the movement the younger people fell into it with wild rompings whirlings and clasping of hands and waists and stranger than all a corybantic enthusiasm seized upon the emotionally religious and those priests and priestesses of cybele who were famous for their frenzy and passion in campmeeting devotions seemed to find an equal expression that night in the waltz and when flushed and panting mrs wade at last halted on the arm of her partner they were nearly knocked over by the revolving johnson and mrs stubbs in a whirl of gloomy exultation deacons and sundayschool teachers waltzed together until the long room shook and the very bunting on the walls waved and fluttered with the gyrations of those religious dervishes nobody knewnobody cared how long this frenzy lastedit ceased only with the collapse of the musicians then with much vague bewilderment inward trepidation awkward and incoherent partings everybody went dazedly home there was no other dancing after thatthe waltz was the one event of the festival and of the history of santa ana and later that night when the timid mrs wade in the seclusion of her own room and the disrobing of her slim figure glanced at her spotless frilled and laced petticoat lying on a chair a faint smilethe first of her widowhoodcurved the corners of her pretty mouth  a week of ominous silence regarding the festival succeeded in santa ana the local paper gave the fullest particulars of the opening of the hotel but contented itself with saying the entertainment concluded with a dance mr brooks who felt himself compelled to call upon his late charming partner twice during the week characteristically soothed her anxieties as to the result the fact of it is mrs wade theres really nobody in particular to blameand thats what gets them theyre all mixed up in it deacons and sundayschool teachers and when old johnson tried to be nasty the other evening and hoped you hadnt suffered from your exertions that night i told him you hadnt quite recovered yet from the physical shock of having been run into by him and mrs stubbs but that you being a lady you didnt tell just how you felt at the exhibition he and she made of themselves that shut him up  but you shouldnt have said that said mrs wade with a frightened little smile  no matter returned brooks cheerfully ill take the blame of it with the others you see theyll have to have a scapegoatand im just the man for i got up the dance and as im going away i suppose i shall bear off the sin with me into the wilderness  youre going away repeated mrs wade in more genuine concern  not for long returned brooks laughingly i came here to look up a mill site and ive found it meantime i think ive opened their eyes  you have opened mine said the widow with timid frankness  they were soft pretty eyes when opened in spite of their heavy red lids and mr brooks thought that santa ana would be no worse if they remained open possibly he looked it for mrs wade said hurriedly i meanthat isive been thinking that life neednt always be as gloomy as we make it here and even here you know mr brooks we have six months sunshinethough we always forget it in the rainy season  thats so said brooks cheerfully i once lost a heap of money through my own foolishness and ive managed to forget it and i even reckon to get it back again out of santa ana if my mill speculation holds good so goodby mrs wadebut not for long he shook her hand frankly and departed leaving the widow conscious of a certain sympathetic confidence and a little grateful forshe knew not what  this feeling remained with her most of the afternoon and even imparted a certain gayety to her spirits to the extent of causing her to hum softly to herself the air being oddly enough the julien waltz and when later in the day the shadows were closing in with the rain word was brought to her that a stranger wished to see her in the sittingroom she carried a less mournful mind to this function of her existence for mrs wade was accustomed to give audience to traveling agents tradesmen workinghands and servants as chatelaine of her ranch and the occasion was not novel yet on entering the room which she used partly as an office she found some difficulty in classifying the stranger who at first glance reminded her of the tramping miner she had seen that night from her window he was rather incongruously dressed some articles of his apparel being finer than others he wore a diamond pin in a scarf folded over a rough hickory shirt his light trousers were tucked in common mining boots that bore stains of travel and a suggestion that he had slept in his clothes what she could see of his unshaven face in that uncertain light expressed a kind of dogged concentration overlaid by an assumption of ease he got up as she came in and with a slight how do maam shut the door behind her and glanced furtively around the room  what ive got to say to ye mrs wadeas i reckon you beis strictly private and confidential why yell see afore i get through but i thought i might just as well caution ye agin our being disturbed  overcoming a slight instinct of repulsion mrs wade returned you can speak to me here no one will interrupt youunless i call them she added with a little feminine caution  and i reckon ye wont do that he said with a grim smile you are the widow o pulaski wade late o heavy tree hill i reckon  i am said mrs wade  and your husbands buried up thar in the graveyard with a monument over him setting forth his virtues ez a christian and a square man and a highminded citizen and that he was foully murdered by highwaymen  yes said mrs wade that is the inscription  well maam a bigger pack o lies never was cut on stone  mrs wade rose half in indignation half in terror  keep your sittin said the stranger with a warning wave of his hand wait till im through and then you call in the hull state o californy ef ye want  the strangers manner was so doggedly confident that mrs wade sank back tremblingly in her chair the man put his slouch hat on his knee twirled it round once or twice and then said with the same stubborn deliberation  the highwayman in that business was your husbandpulaski wadeand his gang and he was killed by one o the men he was robbin ye see maam it used to be your husbands little game to rope in three or four strangers in a poker deal at spanish jims salooni see youve heard o the place he interpolated as mrs wade drew back suddenlyand when he couldnt clean em out in that way or they showed a little more money than they played hed lay for em with his gang in a lone part of the trail and go through them like any road agent thats what he did that nightand thats how he got killed  how do you know this said mrs wade with quivering lips  i was one o the men he went through before he was killed and id hev got my money back but the rest o the gang came up and i got away jest in time to save my life and nothin else ye might remember thar was one man got away and giv the alarm but he was goin on to the states by the overland coach that night and couldnt stay to be a witness i was that man i had paid my passage through and i couldnt lose that too with my other money so i went  mrs wade sat stunned she remembered the missing witness and how she had longed to see the man who was last with her husband she remembered spanish jims saloonhis wellknown haunt his frequent and unaccountable absences the sudden influx of money which he always said he had won at cards the diamond ring he had given her as the result of a bet the forgotten recurrence of other robberies by a secret masked gang a hundred other things that had worried her instinctively vaguely she knew now too the meaning of the unrest that had driven her from heavy tree hillthe strange unformulated fears that had haunted her even here yet with all this she felt too her present weaknessknew that this man had taken her at a disadvantage that she ought to indignantly assert herself deny everything demand proof and brand him a slanderer  how didyouknow it was my husband she stammered  his mask fell off in the fight you know another mask was foundit was his i saw him as plainly as i see him there he pointed to a daguerreotype of her husband which stood upon her desk  mrs wade could only stare vacantly hopelessly after a pause the man continued in a less aggressive manner and more confidential tone which however only increased her terror i aint sayin that you knowed anything about this maam and whatever other folks might say when they know of it ill allers say that you didnt  what then did you come here for said the widow desperately  what do i come here for repeated the man grimly looking around the room what did i come to this yer comfortable homethis yer big ranch and to a rich woman like yourself for well mrs wade i come to get the six hundred dollars your husband robbed me of thats all i aint askin more i aint askin interest i aint askin compensation for havin to run for my lifeand again looking grimly round the walls i aint askin more than you will giveor is my rights  but this house never was his it was my fathers gasped mrs wade you have no right  mebbe yes and mebbe no mrs wade interrupted the man with a wave of his hat but how about them two checks to bearer for two hundred dollars each found among your husbands effects and collected by your lawyer for youmy checks mrs wade  a wave of dreadful recollection overwhelmed her she remembered the checks found upon her husbands body known only to her and her lawyer believed to be gambling gains and collected at once under his legal advice yet she made one more desperate effort in spite of the instinct that told her he was speaking the truth  but you shall have to prove itbefore witnesses  do you want me to prove it before witnesses said the man coming nearer her do you want to take my word and keep it between ourselves or do you want to call in your superintendent and his men and all santy any to hear me prove your husband was a highwayman thief and murderer do you want to knock over that monument on heavy tree hill and upset your standing here among the deacons and elders do you want to do all this and be forced even by your neighbors to pay me in the end as you will ef you do call in your witnesses now and lets have it over mebbe it would look better ef i got the money out of your friends than yea woman praps youre right  he made a step towards the door but she stopped him  no no wait its a large sumi havent it with me she stammered thoroughly beaten  ye kin get it  give me time she implored look ill give you a hundred down nowall i have herethe rest another time she nervously opened a drawer of her desk and taking out a buckskin bag of gold thrust it in his hand there go away now she lifted her thin hands despairingly to her head go do  the man seemed struck by her manner i dont want to be hard on a woman he said slowly ill go now and come back again at nine tonight you can git the money or whats as good a check to bearer by then and ef yell take my advice you wont ask no advice from others ef you want to keep your secret just now its safe with me im a square man ef i seem to be a hard one he made a gesture as if to take her hand but as she drew shrinkingly away he changed it to an awkward bow and the next moment was gone  she started to her feet but the unwonted strain upon her nerves and frail body had been greater than she knew she made a step forward felt the room whirl round her and then seem to collapse beneath her feet and clutching at her chair sank back into it fainting  how long she lay there she never knew she was at last conscious of some one bending over her and a voicethe voice of mr brooksin her ear saying i beg your pardon you seem ill shall i call some one  no she gasped quickly recovering herself with an effort and staring round her where iswhen did you come in  only this moment i was leaving tonight sooner than i expected and thought id say goodby they told me that you had been engaged with a stranger but he had just gone i beg your pardoni see you are ill i wont detain you any longer  no no dont go i am betterbetter she said feverishly as she glanced at his strong and sympathetic face a wild idea seized her he was a stranger here an alien to these people like herself the advice that she dare not seek from others from her halfestranged religious friends from even her superintendent and his wife dare she ask from him perhaps he saw this frightened doubt this imploring appeal in her eyes for he said gently is it anything i can do for you  yes she said with the sudden desperation of weakness i want you to keep a secret  yoursyes he said promptly  whereat poor mrs wade instantly burst into tears then amidst her sobs she told him of the strangers visit of his terrible accusations of his demands his expected return and her own utter helplessness to her terror as she went on she saw a singular change in his kind face he was following her with hard eager intensity she had half hoped even through her fateful instincts that he might have laughed manlike at her fears or poohpoohed the whole thing but he did not you say he positively recognized your husband he repeated quickly  yes yes sobbed the widow and knew that daguerreotype she pointed to the desk  brooks turned quickly in that direction luckily his back was towards her and she could not see his face and the quick startled look that came into his eyes but when they again met hers it was gone and even their eager intensity had changed to a gentle commiseration you have only his word for it mrs wade he said gently and in telling your secret to another you have shorn the rascal of half his power over you and he knew it now dismiss the matter from your mind and leave it all to me i will be here a few minutes before nineand alone in this room let your visitor be shown in here and dont let us be disturbed dont be alarmed he added with a faint twinkle in his eye there will be no fuss and no exposure   it lacked a few minutes of nine when mr brooks was ushered into the sittingroom as soon as he was alone he quietly examined the door and the windows and having satisfied himself took his seat in a chair casually placed behind the door presently he heard the sound of voices and a heavy footstep in the passage he lightly felt his waistcoat pocketit contained a pretty little weapon of power and precision with a barrel scarcely two inches long  the door opened and the person outside entered the room in an instant brooks had shut the door and locked it behind him the man turned fiercely but was faced by brooks quietly with one finger calmly hooked in his waistcoat pocket the man slightly recoiled from himnot as much from fear as from some vague stupefaction whats that for whats your little game he said half contemptuously  no game at all returned brooks coolly you came here to sell a secret i dont propose to have it given away first to any listener  you dontwho are you  thats a queer question to ask of the man you are trying to personatebut i dont wonder youre doing it dd badly  personateyou said the stranger with staring eyes  yes me said brooks quietly i am the only man who escaped from the robbery that night at heavy tree hill and who went home by the overland coach  the stranger stared but recovered himself with a coarse laugh oh well were on the same lay it appears both after the widowafore we show up her husband  not exactly said brooks with his eyes fixed intently on the stranger you are here to denounce a highwayman who is dead and escaped justice i am here to denounce one who is livingstop drop your hand its no use you thought you had to deal only with a woman tonight and your revolver isnt quite handy enough there downdown so thatll do  you cant prove it said the man hoarsely  fool in your story to that woman you have given yourself away there were but two travelers attacked by the highwaymen one was killedi am the other where do you come in what witness can you beexcept as the highwayman that you are who is left to identify wade buthis accomplice  the mans suddenly whitened face made his unshaven beard seem to bristle over his face like some wild animals well ef you kalkilate to blow me youve got to blow wade and his widder too jest you remember that he said whiningly  ive thought of that said brooks coolly and i calculate that to prevent it is worth about that hundred dollars you got from that poor womanand no more now sit down at that table and write as i dictate  the man looked at him in wonder but obeyed  write said brooks i hereby certify that my accusations against the late pulaski wade of heavy tree hill are erroneous and groundless and the result of mistaken identity especially in regard to any complicity of his in the robbery of john stubbs deceased and henry brooks at heavy tree hill on the night of the 13th august 1854  the man looked up with a repulsive smile whos the fool now capn whats become of your hold on the widder now  write said brooks fiercely  the sound of a pen hurriedly scratching paper followed this first outburst of the quiet brooks  sign it said brooks  the man signed it  now go said brooks unlocking the door but remember if you should ever be inclined to revisit santa ana you will find me living here also  the man slunk out of the door and into the passage like a wild animal returning to the night and darkness brooks took up the paper rejoined mrs wade in the parlor and laid it before her  but said the widow trembling even in her joy do youdo you think he was really mistaken  positive said brooks coolly its true its a mistake that has cost you a hundred dollars but there are some mistakes that are worth that to be kept quiet    they were married a year later but there is no record that in after years of conjugal relations with a weak charming but sometimes trying woman henry brooks was ever tempted to tell her the whole truth of the robbery of heavy tree hill     the mermaid of lighthouse point   some forty years ago on the northern coast of california near the golden gate stood a lighthouse of a primitive class since superseded by a building more in keeping with the growing magnitude of the adjacent port it attracted little attention from the desolate shore and it was alleged still less from the desolate sea beyond a gray structure of timber stone and glass it was buffeted and harried by the constant trade winds baked by the unclouded six months sun lost for a few hours in the afternoon seafog and laughed over by circling guillemots from the farallones it was kept by a reclusea preoccupied man of scientific tastes who in shameless contrast to his fellow immigrants had applied to the government for this scarcely lucrative position as a means of securing the seclusion he valued more than gold some believed that he was the victim of an early disappointment in lovea view charitably taken by those who also believed that the government would not have appointed a crank to a position of responsibility howbeit he fulfilled his duties and with the assistance of an indian even cultivated a small patch of ground beside the lighthouse his isolation was complete there was little to attract wanderers here the nearest mines were fifty miles away the virgin forest on the mountains inland were penetrated only by sawmills and woodmen from the bay settlements equally remote although by the shoreline the lights of the great port were sometimes plainly visible yet the solitude around him was peopled only by indiansa branch of the great northern tribe of rootdiggerspeaceful and simple in their habits as yet undisturbed by the white man nor stirred into antagonism by aggression civilization only touched him at stated intervals and then by the more expeditious sea from the government boat that brought him supplies but for his contiguity to the perpetual turmoil of wind and sea he might have passed a restful arcadian life in his surroundings for even his solitude was sometimes haunted by this faint reminder of the great port hard by that pulsated with an equal unrest nevertheless the sands before his door and the rocks behind him seemed to have been untrodden by any other white mans foot since their upheaval from the ocean it was true that the little bay beside him was marked on the map as sir francis drakes bay tradition having located it as the spot where that ingenious pirate and empiremaker had once landed his vessels and scraped the barnacles from his adventurous keels but of this edgar pomfreyor captain pomfrey as he was called by virtue of his halfnautical officehad thought little  for the first six months he had thoroughly enjoyed his seclusion in the company of his books of which he had brought such a fair store that their shelves lined his snug corners to the exclusion of more comfortable furniture he found his principal recreation even his unwonted manual labor the trimming of his lamp and cleaning of his reflectors and his personal housekeeping in which his indian help at times assisted he found a novel and interesting occupation for outdoor exercise a ramble on the sands a climb to the rocky upland or a pull in the lighthouse boat amply sufficed him crank as he was supposed to be he was sane enough to guard against any of those early lapses into barbarism which marked the lives of some solitary goldminers his own taste as well as the duty of his office kept his person and habitation sweet and clean and his habits regular even the little cultivated patch of ground on the lee side of the tower was symmetrical and well ordered thus the outward light of captain pomfrey shone forth over the wilderness of shore and wave even like his beacon whatever his inward illumination may have been  it was a bright summer morning remarkable even in the monotonous excellence of the season with a slight touch of warmth which the invincible northwest trades had not yet chilled there was still a faint haze off the coast as if last nights fog had been caught in the quick sunshine and the shining sands were hot but without the usual dazzling glare a faint perfume from a quaint lilaccolored beachflower whose clustering heads dotted the sand like bits of blown spume took the place of that smell of the sea which the odorless pacific lacked a few rocks half a mile away lifted themselves above the ebb tide at varying heights as they lay on the trough of the swell were crested with foam by a striking surge or cleanly erased in the full sweep of the sea beside and partly upon one of the higher rocks a singular object was moving  pomfrey was interested but not startled he had once or twice seen seals disporting on these rocks and on one occasion a sealionan estray from the familiar rocks on the other side of the golden gate but he ceased work in his garden patch and coming to his house exchanged his hoe for a telescope when he got the mystery in focus he suddenly stopped and rubbed the objectglass with his handkerchief but even when he applied the glass to his eye for a second time he could scarcely believe his eyesight for the object seemed to be a woman the lower part of her figure submerged in the sea her long hair depending over her shoulders and waist there was nothing in her attitude to suggest terror or that she was the victim of some accident she moved slowly and complacently with the sea and evena more staggering suggestionappeared to be combing out the strands of her long hair with her fingers with her body half concealed she might have been a mermaid  he swept the foreshore and horizon with his glass there was neither boat nor shipnor anything that moved except the long swell of the pacific she could have come only from the sea for to reach the rocks by land she would have had to pass before the lighthouse while the narrow strip of shore which curved northward beyond his range of view he knew was inhabited only by indians but the woman was unhesitatingly and appallingly white and her hair light even to a golden gleam in the sunshine  pomfrey was a gentleman and as such was amazed dismayed and cruelly embarrassed if she was a simple bather from some vicinity hitherto unknown and unsuspected by him it was clearly his business to shut up his glass and go back to his garden patchalthough the propinquity of himself and the lighthouse must have been as plainly visible to her as she was to him on the other hand if she was the survivor of some wreck and in distressor as he even fancied from her reckless manner bereft of her senses his duty to rescue her was equally clear in his dilemma he determined upon a compromise and ran to his boat he would pull out to sea pass between the rocks and the curving sandspit and examine the sands and sea more closely for signs of wreckage or some overlooked waiting boat near the shore he would be within hail if she needed him or she could escape to her boat if she had one  in another moment his boat was lifting on the swell towards the rocks he pulled quickly occasionally turning to note that the strange figure whose movements were quite discernible to the naked eye was still there but gazing more earnestly towards the nearest shore for any sign of life or occupation in ten minutes he had reached the curve where the trend opened northward and the long line of shore stretched before him he swept it eagerly with a single searching glance sea and shore were empty he turned quickly to the rock scarcely a hundred yards on his beam it was empty too forgetting his previous scruples he pulled directly for it until his keel grated on its submerged base there was nothing there but the rock slippery with the yellowgreen slime of seaweed and kelpneither trace nor sign of the figure that had occupied it a moment ago he pulled around it there was no cleft or hidingplace for an instant his heart leaped at the sight of something white caught in a jagged tooth of the outlying reef but it was only the bleached fragment of a bamboo orangecrate cast from the deck of some south sea trader such as often strewed the beach he lay off the rock keeping way in the swell and scrutinizing the glittering sea at last he pulled back to the lighthouse perplexed and discomfited  was it simply a sporting seal transformed by some trick of his vision but he had seen it through his glass and now remembered such details as the face and features framed in their contour of golden hair and believed he could even have identified them he examined the rock again with his glass and was surprised to see how clearly it was outlined now in its barren loneliness yet he must have been mistaken his scientific and accurate mind allowed of no errant fancy and he had always sneered at the marvelous as the result of hasty or superficial observation he was a little worried at this lapse of his healthy accuracyfearing that it might be the result of his seclusion and lonelinessakin to the visions of the recluse and solitary it was strange too that it should take the shape of a woman for edgar pomfrey had a storythe usual old and foolish one  then his thoughts took a lighter phase and he turned to the memory of his books and finally to the books themselves from a shelf he picked out a volume of old voyages and turned to a remembered passage in other seas doe abound marvells soche as sea spyders of the bigness of a pinnace the wich they have been known to attack and destroy sea vypers which reach to the top of a goodly maste whereby they are able to draw marinners from the rigging by the suction of their breathes and devill fyshe which vomit fire by night which makyth the sea to shine prodigiously and mermaydes they are half fyshe and half mayde of grate beauty and have been seen of divers godly and creditable witnesses swymming beside rocks hidden to their waist in the sea combing of their hayres to the help of whych they carry a small mirrore of the bigness of their fingers pomfrey laid the book aside with a faint smile to even this credulity he might come  nevertheless he used the telescope again that day but there was no repetition of the incident and he was forced to believe that he had been the victim of some extraordinary illusion the next morning however with his calmer judgment doubts began to visit him there was no one of whom he could make inquiries but his indian helper and their conversation had usually been restricted to the language of signs or the use of a few words he had picked up he contrived however to ask if there was a waugee white woman in the neighborhood the indian shook his head in surprise there was no waugee nearer than the remote mountainridge to which he pointed pomfrey was obliged to be content with this even had his vocabulary been larger he would as soon have thought of revealing the embarrassing secret of this woman whom he believed to be of his own race to a mere barbarian as he would of asking him to verify his own impressions by allowing him to look at her that morning the next day however something happened which forced him to resume his inquiries he was rowing around the curving spot when he saw a number of black objects on the northern sands moving in and out of the surf which he presently made out as indians a nearer approach satisfied him that they were wading squaws and children gathering seaweed and shells he would have pushed his acquaintance still nearer but as his boat rounded the point with one accord they all scuttled away like frightened sandpipers pomfrey on his return asked his indian retainer if they could swim oh yes as far as the rock yes yet pomfrey was not satisfied the color of his strange apparition remained unaccounted for and it was not that of an indian woman  trifling events linger long in a monotonous existence and it was nearly a week before pomfrey gave up his daily telescopic inspection of the rock then he fell back upon his books again and oddly enough upon another volume of voyages and so chanced upon the account of sir francis drakes occupation of the bay before him he had always thought it strange that the great adventurer had left no trace or sign of his sojourn there still stranger that he should have overlooked the presence of gold known even to the indians themselves and have lost a discovery far beyond his wildest dreams and a treasure to which the cargoes of those philippine galleons he had more or less successfully intercepted were trifles had the restless explorer been content to pace those dreary sands during three weeks of inactivity with no thought of penetrating the inland forests behind the range or of even entering the nobler bay beyond or was the location of the spot a mere tradition as wild and unsupported as the marvells of the other volume pomfrey had the skepticism of the scientific inquiring mind  two weeks had passed and he was returning from a long climb inland when he stopped to rest in his descent to the sea the panorama of the shore was before him from its uttermost limit to the lighthouse on the northern point the sun was still one hour high it would take him about that time to reach home but from this coign of vantage he could seewhat he had not before observedthat what he had always believed was a little cove on the northern shore was really the estuary of a small stream which rose near him and eventually descended into the ocean at that point he could also see that beside it was a long low erection of some kind covered with thatched brush which looked like a barrow yet showed signs of habitation in the slight smoke that rose from it and drifted inland it was not far out of his way and he resolved to return in that direction on his way down he once or twice heard the barking of an indian dog and knew that he must be in the vicinity of an encampment a campfire with the ashes yet warm proved that he was on the trail of one of the nomadic tribes but the declining sun warned him to hasten home to his duty when he at last reached the estuary he found that the building beside it was little else than a long hut whose thatched and mudplastered moundlike roof gave it the appearance of a cave its single opening and entrance abutted on the waters edge and the smoke he had noticed rolled through this entrance from a smouldering fire within pomfrey had little difficulty in recognizing the purpose of this strange structure from the accounts he had heard from loggers of the indian customs the cave was a sweathousea calorific chamber in which the indians closely shut themselves naked with a smudge or smouldering fire of leaves until perspiring and half suffocated they rushed from the entrance and threw themselves into the water before it the still smouldering fire told him that the house had been used that morning and he made no doubt that the indians were encamped near by he would have liked to pursue his researches further but he found he had already trespassed upon his remaining time and he turned somewhat abruptly awayso abruptly in fact that a figure which had evidently been cautiously following him at a distance had not time to get away his heart leaped with astonishment it was the woman he had seen on the rock  although her native dress now only disclosed her head and hands there was no doubt about her color and it was distinctly white save for the tanning of exposure and a slight red ochre marking on her low forehead and her hair long and unkempt as it was showed that he had not erred in his first impression of it it was a tawny flaxen with fainter bleachings where the sun had touched it most her eyes were of a clear northern blue her dress which was quite distinctive in that it was neither the cast off finery of civilization nor the cheap government flannels and calicoes usually worn by the californian tribes was purely native and of fringed deerskin and consisted of a long loose shirt and leggings worked with bright feathers and colored shells a necklace also of shells and fancy pebbles hung round her neck she seemed to be a fully developed woman in spite of the girlishness of her flowing hair and notwithstanding the shapeless length of her gaberdinelike garment taller than the ordinary squaw  pomfrey saw all this in a single flash of perception for the next instant she was gone disappearing behind the sweathouse he ran after her catching sight of her again half doubled up in the characteristic indian trot dodging around rocks and low bushes as she fled along the banks of the stream but for her distinguishing hair she looked in her flight like an ordinary frightened squaw this which gave a sense of unmanliness and ridicule to his own pursuit of her with the fact that his hour of duty was drawing near and he was still far from the lighthouse checked him in full career and he turned regretfully away he had called after her at first and she had not heeded him what he would have said to her he did not know he hastened home discomfited even embarrassedyet excited to a degree he had not deemed possible in himself  during the morning his thoughts were full of her theory after theory for her strange existence there he examined and dismissed his first thought that she was a white womansome settlers wifemasquerading in indian garb he abandoned when he saw her moving no white woman could imitate that indian trot nor would remember to attempt it if she were frightened the idea that she was a captive white held by the indians became ridiculous when he thought of the nearness of civilization and the peaceful timid character of the digger tribes that she was some unfortunate demented creature who had escaped from her keeper and wandered into the wilderness a glance at her clear frank intelligent curious eyes had contradicted there was but one theory leftthe most sensible and practical onethat she was the offspring of some white man and indian squaw yet this he found oddly enough the least palatable to his fancy and the few halfbreeds he had seen were not at all like her  the next morning he had recourse to his indian retainer jim with infinite difficulty protraction and not a little embarrassment he finally made him understand that he had seen a white squaw near the sweathouse and that he wanted to know more about her with equal difficulty jim finally recognized the fact of the existence of such a person but immediately afterwards shook his head in an emphatic negation with greater difficulty and greater mortification pomfrey presently ascertained that jims negative referred to a supposed abduction of the woman which he understood that his employer seriously contemplated but he also learned that she was a real indian and that there were three or four others like her male and female in that vicinity that from a skeena mowitch little baby they were all like that and that their parents were of the same color but never a white or waugee man or woman among them that they were looked upon as a distinct and superior caste of indians and enjoyed certain privileges with the tribe that they superstitiously avoided white men of whom they had the greatest fear and that they were protected in this by the other indians that it was marvelous and almost beyond belief that pomfrey had been able to see one for no other white man had or was even aware of their existence  how much of this he actually understood how much of it was lying and due to jims belief that he wished to abduct the fair stranger pomfrey was unable to determine there was enough however to excite his curiosity strongly and occupy his mind to the exclusion of his bookssave one among his smaller volumes he had found a travel book of the chinook jargon with a lexicon of many of the words commonly used by the northern pacific tribes an hour or twos trial with the astonished jim gave him an increased vocabulary and a new occupation each day the incongruous pair took a lesson from the lexicon in a week pomfrey felt he would be able to accost the mysterious stranger but he did not again surprise her in any of his rambles or even in a later visit to the sweathouse he had learned from jim that the house was only used by the bucks or males and that her appearance there had been accidental he recalled that he had had the impression that she had been stealthily following him and the recollection gave him a pleasure he could not account for but an incident presently occurred which gave him a new idea of her relations towards him  the difficulty of making jim understand had hitherto prevented pomfrey from intrusting him with the care of the lantern but with the aid of the lexicon he had been able to make him comprehend its working and under pomfreys personal guidance the indian had once or twice lit the lamp and set its machinery in motion it remained for him only to test jims unaided capacity in case of his own absence or illness it happened to be a warm beautiful sunset when the afternoon fog had for once delayed its invasion of the shoreline that he left the lighthouse to jims undivided care and reclining on a sanddune still warm from the sun lazily watched the result of jims first essay as the twilight deepened and the first flash of the lantern strove with the dying glories of the sun pomfrey presently became aware that he was not the only watcher a little gray figure creeping on all fours suddenly glided out of the shadow of another sanddune and then halted falling back on its knees gazing fixedly at the growing light it was the woman he had seen she was not a dozen yards away and in her eagerness and utter absorption in the light had evidently overlooked him he could see her face distinctly her lips parted half in wonder half with the breathless absorption of a devotee a faint sense of disappointment came over him it was not him she was watching but the light as it swelled out over the darkening gray sand she turned as if to watch its effect around her and caught sight of pomfrey with a little startled crythe first she had utteredshe darted away he did not follow a moment before when he first saw her an indian salutation which he had learned from jim had risen to his lips but in the odd feeling which her fascination of the light had caused him he had not spoken he watched her bent figure scuttling away like some frightened animal with a critical consciousness that she was really scarce human and went back to the lighthouse he would not run after her again yet that evening he continued to think of her and recalled her voice which struck him now as having been at once melodious and childlike and wished he had at least spoken and perhaps elicited a reply  he did not however haunt the sweathouse near the river again yet he still continued his lessons with jim and in this way perhaps although quite unpremeditatedly enlisted a humble ally a week passed in which he had not alluded to her when one morning as he was returning from a row jim met him mysteriously on the beach  spose him come slow slow said jim gravely airing his newly acquired english make no noiseplenty catchee indian maiden the last epithet was the polite lexicon equivalent of squaw  pomfrey not entirely satisfied in his mind nevertheless softly followed the noiselessly gliding jim to the lighthouse here jim cautiously opened the door motioning pomfrey to enter  the base of the tower was composed of two living rooms a storeroom and oiltank as pomfrey entered jim closed the door softly behind him the abrupt transition from the glare of the sands and sun to the semidarkness of the storeroom at first prevented him from seeing anything but he was instantly distracted by a scurrying flutter and wild beating of the walls as of a caged bird in another moment he could make out the fair stranger quivering with excitement passionately dashing at the barred window the walls the locked door and circling around the room in her desperate attempt to find an egress like a captured seagull amazed mystified indignant with jim himself and even his unfortunate captive pomfrey called to her in chinook to stop and going to the door flung it wide open she darted by him raising her soft blue eyes for an instant in a swift sidelong glance of half appeal halffrightened admiration and rushed out into the open but here to his surprise she did not run away on the contrary she drew herself up with a dignity that seemed to increase her height and walked majestically towards jim who at her unexpected exit had suddenly thrown himself upon the sand in utterly abject terror and supplication she approached him slowly with one small hand uplifted in a menacing gesture the man writhed and squirmed before her then she turned caught sight of pomfrey standing in the doorway and walked quietly away amazed yet gratified with this new assertion of herself pomfrey respectfully but alas incautiously called after her in an instant at the sound of his voice she dropped again into her slouching indian trot and glided away over the sandhills  pomfrey did not add any reproof of his own to the discomfiture of his indian retainer neither did he attempt to inquire the secret of this savage girls power over him it was evident he had spoken truly when he told his master that she was of a superior caste pomfrey recalled her erect and indignant figure standing over the prostrate jim and was again perplexed and disappointed at her sudden lapse into the timid savage at the sound of his voice would not this wellmeant but miserable trick of jims have the effect of increasing her unreasoning animallike distrust of him a few days later brought an unexpected answer to his question  it was the hottest hour of the day he had been fishing off the reef of rocks where he had first seen her and had taken in his line and was leisurely pulling for the lighthouse suddenly a little musical cry not unlike a birds struck his ear he lay on his oars and listened it was repeated but this time it was unmistakably recognizable as the voice of the indian girl although he had heard it but once he turned eagerly to the rock but it was empty he pulled around it but saw nothing he looked towards the shore and swung his boat in that direction when again the cry was repeated with the faintest quaver of a laugh apparently on the level of the sea before him for the first time he looked down and there on the crest of a wave not a dozen yards ahead danced the yellow hair and laughing eyes of the girl the frightened gravity of her look was gone lost in the flash of her white teeth and quivering dimples as her dripping face rose above the sea when their eyes met she dived again but quickly reappeared on the other bow swimming with lazy easy strokes her smiling head thrown back over her white shoulder as if luring him to a race if her smile was a revelation to him still more so was this first touch of feminine coquetry in her attitude he pulled eagerly towards her with a few long overhand strokes she kept her distance or if he approached too near she dived like a loon coming up astern of him with the same childlike mocking cry in vain he pursued her calling her to stop in her own tongue and laughingly protested she easily avoided his boat at every turn suddenly when they were nearly abreast of the river estuary she rose in the water and waving her little hands with a gesture of farewell turned and curving her back like a dolphin leaped into the surging swell of the estuary bar and was lost in its foam it would have been madness for him to have attempted to follow in his boat and he saw that she knew it he waited until her yellow crest appeared in the smoother water of the river and then rowed back in his excitement and preoccupation he had quite forgotten his long exposure to the sun during his active exercise and that he was poorly equipped for the cold seafog which the heat had brought in earlier and which now was quietly obliterating sea and shore this made his progress slower and more difficult and by the time he had reached the lighthouse he was chilled to the bone  the next morning he woke with a dull headache and great weariness and it was with considerable difficulty that he could attend to his duties at nightfall feeling worse he determined to transfer the care of the light to jim but was amazed to find that he had disappeared and what was more ominous a bottle of spirits which pomfrey had taken from his locker the night before had disappeared too like all indians jims rudimentary knowledge of civilization included firewater he evidently had been tempted had fallen and was too ashamed or too drunk to face his master pomfrey however managed to get the light in order and working and then he scarcely knew how betook himself to bed in a state of high fever he turned from side to side racked by pain with burning lips and pulses strange fancies beset him he had noticed when he lit his light that a strange sail was looming off the estuarya place where no sail had ever been seen or should beand was relieved that the lighting of the tower might show the reckless or ignorant mariner his real bearings for the gate at times he had heard voices above the familiar song of the surf and tried to rise from his bed but could not sometimes these voices were strange outlandish dissonant in his own language yet only partly intelligible but through them always rang a single voice musical familiar yet of a tongue not his ownhers and then out of his deliriumfor such it proved afterwards to became a strange vision he thought that he had just lit the light when from some strange and unaccountable reason it suddenly became dim and defied all his efforts to revive it to add to his discomfiture he could see quite plainly through the lantern a strangelooking vessel standing in from the sea she was so clearly out of her course for the gate that he knew she had not seen the light and his limbs trembled with shame and terror as he tried in vain to rekindle the dying light yet to his surprise the strange ship kept steadily on passing the dangerous reef of rocks until she was actually in the waters of the bay but stranger than all swimming beneath her bows was the golden head and laughing face of the indian girl even as he had seen it the day before a strange revulsion of feeling overtook him believing that she was luring the ship to its destruction he ran out on the beach and strove to hail the vessel and warn it of its impending doom but he could not speakno sound came from his lips and now his attention was absorbed by the ship itself highbowed and pooped and curved like the crescent moon it was the strangest craft that he had ever seen even as he gazed it glided on nearer and nearer and at last beached itself noiselessly on the sands before his own feet a score of figures as bizarre and outlandish as the ship itself now thronged its high forecastlereally a castle in shape and warlike purposeand leaped from its ports the common seamen were nearly naked to the waist the officers looked more like soldiers than sailors what struck him more strangely was that they were one and all seemingly unconscious of the existence of the lighthouse sauntering up and down carelessly as if on some uninhabited strand and even talkingso far as he could understand their old bookish dialectas if in some hitherto undiscovered land their ignorance of the geography of the whole coast and even of the sea from which they came actually aroused his critical indignation their coarse and stupid allusions to the fair indian swimmer as the mermaid that they had seen upon their bow made him more furious still yet he was helpless to express his contemptuous anger or even make them conscious of his presence then an interval of incoherency and utter blankness followed when he again took up the thread of his fancy the ship seemed to be lying on her beam ends on the sand the strange arrangement of her upper deck and tophamper more like a dwelling than any ship he had ever seen was fully exposed to view while the seamen seemed to be at work with the rudest contrivances calking and scraping her barnacled sides he saw that phantom crew when not working at wassail and festivity heard the shouts of drunken roisterers saw the placing of a guard around some of the most uncontrollable and later detected the stealthy escape of half a dozen sailors inland amidst the fruitless volley fired upon them from obsolete blunderbusses then his strange vision transported him inland where he saw these seamen following some indian women suddenly one of them turned and ran frenziedly towards him as if seeking succor closely pursued by one of the sailors pomfrey strove to reach her struggled violently with the fearful apathy that seemed to hold his limbs and then as she uttered at last a little musical cry burst his bonds andawoke  as consciousness slowly struggled back to him he could see the bare woodenlike walls of his sleepingroom the locker the one window bright with sunlight the open door of the tankroom and the little staircase to the tower there was a strange smoky and herblike smell in the room he made an effort to rise but as he did so a small sunburnt hand was laid gently yet restrainingly upon his shoulder and he heard the same musical cry as before but this time modulated to a girlish laugh he raised his head faintly half squatting half kneeling by his bed was the yellowhaired stranger  with the recollection of his vision still perplexing him he said in a weak voice who are you  her blue eyes met his own with quick intelligence and no trace of her former timidity a soft caressing light had taken its place pointing with her finger to her breast in a childlike gesture she said meolooya  olooya he remembered suddenly that jim had always used that word in speaking of her but until then he had always thought it was some indian term for her distinct class  olooya he repeated then with difficulty attempting to use her own tongue he asked when did you come here  last night she answered in the same tongue there was no witchfire there she continued pointing to the tower when it came not olooya came olooya found white chief sick and alone white chief could not get up olooya lit witchfire for him  you he repeated in astonishment i lit it myself  she looked at him pityingly as if still recognizing his delirium and shook her head white chief was sickhow can know olooya made witchfire  he cast a hurried glance at his watch hanging on the wall beside him it had run down although he had wound it the last thing before going to bed he had evidently been lying there helpless beyond the twentyfour hours  he groaned and turned to rise but she gently forced him down again and gave him some herbal infusion in which he recognized the taste of the yerba buena vine which grew by the river then she made him comprehend in her own tongue that jim had been decoyed while drunk aboard a certain schooner lying off the shore at a spot where she had seen some men digging in the sands she had not gone there for she was afraid of the bad men and a slight return of her former terror came into her changeful eyes she knew how to light the witchlight she reminded him she had been in the tower before  you have saved my light and perhaps my life he said weakly taking her hand  possibly she did not understand him for her only answer was a vague smile but the next instant she started up listening intently and then with a frightened cry drew away her hand and suddenly dashed out of the building in the midst of his amazement the door was darkened by a figurea stranger dressed like an ordinary miner pausing a moment to look after the flying olooya the man turned and glanced around the room and then with a coarse familiar smile approached pomfrey  hope i aint disturbin ye but i allowed id just be neighborly and drop inseein as this is govnment property and me and my pardners as american citizens and taxpayers helps to support it were coastin from trinidad down here and prospectin along the beach for gold in the sand ye seem to hev a mighty soft berth of it herenothing to doand lots of purty halfbreeds hangin round  the mans effrontery was too much for pomfreys selfcontrol weakened by illness it is government property he answered hotly and you have no more right to intrude upon it than you have to decoy away my servant a government employee during my illness and jeopardize that property  the unexpectedness of this attack and the sudden revelation of the fact of pomfreys illness in his flushed face and hollow voice apparently frightened and confused the stranger he stammered a surly excuse backed out of the doorway and disappeared an hour later jim appeared crestfallen remorseful and extravagantly penitent pomfrey was too weak for reproaches or inquiry and he was thinking only of olooya  she did not return his recovery in that keen air aided as he sometimes thought by the herbs she had given him was almost as rapid as his illness the miners did not again intrude upon the lighthouse nor trouble his seclusion when he was able to sun himself on the sands he could see them in the distance at work on the beach he reflected that she would not come back while they were there and was reconciled but one morning jim appeared awkward and embarrassed leading another indian whom he introduced as olooyas brother pomfreys suspicions were aroused except that the stranger had something of the girls superiority of manner there was no likeness whatever to his fairhaired acquaintance but a fury of indignation was added to his suspicions when he learned the amazing purport of their visit it was nothing less than an offer from the alleged brother to sell his sister to pomfrey for forty dollars and a jug of whiskey unfortunately pomfreys temper once more got the better of his judgment with a scathing exposition of the laws under which the indian and white man equally lived and the legal punishment of kidnaping he swept what he believed was the impostor from his presence he was scarcely alone again before he remembered that his imprudence might affect the girls future access to him but it was too late now  still he clung to the belief that he should see her when the prospectors had departed and he hailed with delight the breaking up of the camp near the sweathouse and the disappearance of the schooner it seemed that their goldseeking was unsuccessful but pomfrey was struck on visiting the locality to find that in their excavations in the sand at the estuary they had uncovered the decaying timbers of a ships small boat of some ancient and obsolete construction this made him think of his strange dream with a vague sense of warning which he could not shake off and on his return to the lighthouse he took from his shelves a copy of the old voyages to see how far his fancy had been affected by his reading in the account of drakes visit to the coast he found a footnote which he had overlooked before and which ran as follows the admiral seems to have lost several of his crew by desertion who were supposed to have perished miserably by starvation in the inhospitable interior or by the hands of savages but later voyagers have suggested that the deserters married indian wives and there is a legend that a hundred years later a singular race of halfbreeds bearing unmistakable anglosaxon characteristics was found in that locality pomfrey fell into a reverie of strange hypotheses and fancies he resolved that when he again saw olooya he would question her her terror of these men might be simply racial or some hereditary transmission  but his intention was never fulfilled for when days and weeks had elapsed and he had vainly haunted the river estuary and the rocky reef before the lighthouse without a sign of her he overcame his pride sufficiently to question jim the man looked at him with dull astonishment  olooya gone he said  gonewhere  the indian made a gesture to seaward which seemed to encompass the whole pacific  how with whom repeated his angry yet halffrightened master  with white man in ship you say you no want olooyaforty dollars too much white man give fifty dollarstakee olooya all same     under the eaves   the assistant editor of the san francisco daily informer was going home so much of his time was spent in the office of the informer that no one ever cared to know where he passed those six hours of sleep which presumably suggested a domicile his business appointments outside the office were generally kept at the restaurant where he breakfasted and dined or of evenings in the lobbies of theatres or the anterooms of public meetings yet he had a home and an interval of seclusion of which he was jealously mindful and it was to this he was going tonight at his usual hour  his room was in a new building on one of the larger and busier thoroughfares the lower floor was occupied by a bank but as it was closed before he came home and not yet opened when he left it did not disturb his domestic sensibilities the same may be said of the next floor which was devoted to stockbrokers and companies offices and was equally tomblike and silent when he passed the floor above that was a desert of empty rooms which echoed to his footsteps night and morning with here and there an oasis in the green sign of a mining secretarys office with however the desolating announcement that it would only be open for transfers from two to four on saturdays the top floor had been frankly abandoned in an unfinished state by the builder whose ambition had oerleaped itself in that sanguine era of the citys growth there was a smell of plaster and the first coat of paint about it still but the whole front of the building was occupied by a long room with odd bullseye windows looking out through the heavy ornamentations of the cornice over the adjacent roofs  it had been originally intended for a clubroom but after the ill fortune which attended the letting of the floor below and possibly because the earthquakefearing san franciscans had their doubts of successful hilarity at the top of so tall a building it remained unfinished with the two smaller rooms at its side its incomplete and lonely grandeur had once struck the editor during a visit of inspection and the landlord whom he knew had offered to make it habitable for him at a nominal rent it had a lavatory with a marble basin and a tap of cold water the offer was a novel one but he accepted it and fitted up the apartment with some cheap secondhand furniture quite inconsistent with the carved mantels and decorations and made a fair sittingroom and bedroom of it here on a sunday when its stillness was intensified and even a passing footstep on the pavement fifty feet below was quite startling he would sit and work by one of the quaint open windows in the rainy season through the filmed panes he sometimes caught a glimpse of the distant whitecapped bay but never of the street below him  the lights were out but groping his way up to the first landing he took from a cupboarded niche in the wall his candlestick and matches and continued the ascent to his room the humble candlelight flickered on the ostentatious gold letters displayed on the groundglass doors of opulent companies which he knew were famous and rooms where millionaires met in secret conclave but the contrast awakened only his sense of humor yet he was always relieved after he had reached his own floor possibly its incompleteness and inchoate condition made it seem less lonely than the desolation of the finished and furnished rooms below and it was only this recollection of past human occupancy that was depressing  he opened his door lit the solitary gas jet that only half illuminated the long room and it being already past midnight began to undress himself this process presently brought him to that corner of his room where his bed stood when he suddenly stopped and his sleepy yawn changed to a gape of surprise for lying in the bed its head upon the pillow and its rigid arms accurately stretched down over the turnedback sheet was a childs doll it was a small dolla banged and battered doll that had seen service but it had evidently been tucked in with maternal tenderness and lay there with its staring eyes turned to the ceiling the very genius of insomnia  his first start of surprise was followed by a natural resentment of what might have been an impertinent intrusion on his privacy by some practicaljoking adult for he knew there was no child in the house  his room was kept in order by the wife of the night watchman employed by the bank and no one else had a right of access to it but the woman might have brought a child there and not noticed its disposal of its plaything he smiled it might have been worse it might have been a real baby  the idea tickled him with a promise of future copyof a story with farcical complications or even a dramatic ending in which the baby adopted by him should turn out to be somebodys stolen offspring he lifted the little image that had suggested these fancies carefully laid it on his table went to bed and presently forgot it all in slumber  in the morning his goodhumor and interest in it revived to the extent of writing on a slip of paper goodmorning thank youive slept very well putting the slip in the dolls jointed arms and leaving it in a sitting posture outside his door when he left his room when he returned late at night it was gone  but it so chanced that a few days later owing to press of work on the informer he was obliged to forego his usual sunday holiday out of town and that morning found him while the bells were ringing for church in his room with a pile of manuscript and proof before him for these were troublous days in san francisco the great vigilance committee of 56 was in session and the offices of the daily papers were thronged with eager seekers of news such affairs indeed were not in the functions of the assistant editor nor exactly to his taste he was neither a partisan of the socalled law and order party nor yet an enthusiastic admirer of the citizen revolutionists known as the vigilance committee both extremes being incompatible with his habits of thought consequently he was not displeased at this opportunity of doing his work away from the office and the heady talk of controversy  he worked on until the bells ceased and a more than sabbath stillness fell upon the streets so quiet was it that once or twice the conversation of passing pedestrians floated up and into his window as of voices at his elbow  presently he heard the sound of a childs voice singing in subdued tone as if fearful of being overheard this time he laid aside his penit certainly was no delusion the sound did not come from the open window but from some space on a level with his room yet there was no contiguous building as high  he rose and tried to open his door softly but it creaked and the singing instantly ceased there was nothing before him but the bare empty hall with its lathed and plastered partitions and the two smaller rooms unfinished like his own on either side of him their doors were shut the one at his right hand was locked the other yielded to his touch  for the first moment he saw only the bare walls of the apparently empty room but a second glance showed him two childrena boy of seven and a girl of fivesitting on the floor which was further littered by a mattress pillow and blanket there was a cheap tray on one of the trunks containing two soiled plates and cups and fragments of a meal but there was neither a chair nor table nor any other article of furniture in the room yet he was struck by the fact that in spite of this poverty of surrounding the children were decently dressed and the few scattered pieces of luggage in quality bespoke a superior condition  the children met his astonished stare with an equal wonder and he fancied some little fright the boys lips trembled a little as he said apologetically  i told jinny not to sing but she didnt make much noise  mamma said i could play with my dolly but i fordot and singed said the little girl penitently  wheres your mamma asked the young man the fancy of their being near relatives of the night watchman had vanished at the sound of their voices  dorn out said the girl  when did she go out  last night  were you all alone here last night  yes  perhaps they saw the look of indignation and pity in the editors face for the boy said quickly  she dont go out every night last night she went to  he stopped suddenly and both children looked at each other with a half laugh and half cry and then repeated in hopeless unison shes dorn out  when is she coming back again  tonight but we wont make any more noise  who brings you your food continued the editor looking at the tray  woberts  evidently roberts the night watchman the editor felt relieved here was a clue to some explanation he instantly sat down on the floor between them  so that was the dolly that slept in my bed he said gayly taking it up  god gives helplessness a wonderful intuition of its friends the children looked up at the face of their grownup companion giggled and then burst into a shrill fit of laughter he felt that it was the first one they had really indulged in for many days nevertheless he said hush confidentially why he scarcely knew except to intimate to them that he had taken in their situation thoroughly make no noise he added softly and come into my big room  they hung back however with frightened yet longing eyes mamma said we mussent do out of this room said the girl  not alone responded the editor quickly but with me you know thats different  the logic sufficed them poor as it was their hands slid quite naturally into his but at the door he stopped and motioning to the locked door of the other room asked  and is that mammas room too  their little hands slipped from his and they were silent presently the boy as if acted upon by some occult influence of the girl said in a half whisper yes  the editor did not question further but led them into his room here they lost the slight restraint they had shown and began child fashion to become questioners themselves  in a few moments they were in possession of his name his business the kind of restaurant he frequented where he went when he left his room all day the meaning of those funny slips of paper and the written manuscripts and why he was so quiet but any attempt of his to retaliate by counter questions was met by a sudden reserve so unchildlike and painful to himas it was evidently to themselvesthat he desisted wisely postponing his inquiries until he could meet roberts  he was glad when they fell to playing games with each other quite naturally yet not entirely forgetting his propinquity as their occasional furtive glances at his movements showed him he too became presently absorbed in his work until it was finished and it was time for him to take it to the office of the informer the wild idea seized him of also taking the children afterwards for a holiday to the mission dolores but he prudently remembered that even this negligent mother of theirs might have some rights over her offspring that he was bound to respect  he took leave of them gayly suggesting that the doll be replaced in his bed while he was away and even assisted in tucking it up but during the afternoon the recollection of these lonely playfellows in the deserted house obtruded itself upon his work and the talk of his companions sunday night was his busiest night and he could not therefore hope to get away in time to assure himself of their mothers return  it was nearly two in the morning when he returned to his room he paused for a moment on the threshold to listen for any sound from the adjoining room but all was hushed  his intention of speaking to the night watchman was however anticipated the next morning by that guardian himself a tap upon his door while he was dressing caused him to open it somewhat hurriedly in the hope of finding one of the children there but he met only the embarrassed face of roberts inviting him into the room the editor continued dressing carefully closing the door behind him the man began with evident hesitation  i oughter hev told ye suthin afore mr breeze but i kalkilated so to speak that you wouldnt be bothered one way or another and so ye hadnt any call to know that there was folks here  oh i see interrupted breeze cheerfully youre speaking of the family next doorthe landlords new tenants  they aint exactly that said roberts still with embarrassment the fact isye seethe thing points this way they aint no right to be here and its as much as my place is worth if it leaks out that they are  mr breeze suspended his collarbuttoning and stared at roberts  you see sir theyre mighty poor and theyve nowhere else to goand i reckoned to take em in here for a spell and say nothing about it  but the landlord wouldnt object surely ill speak to him myself said breeze impulsively  oh no dont said roberts in alarm he wouldnt like it you see mr breeze its just this way the mother shes a born lady and did my old woman a good turn in old times when the family was rich but now shes obligedjust to support herself you knowto take up with what she gets and she acts in the bally in the theatre you see and hez to come in late o nights in them cheap boardinghouses you know the folks looks down upon her for that and wont hev her and in the cheap hotels the men areyou knowa darned sight wuss and thats how i took her and her kids in here where no one knows em  i see nodded the editor sympathetically and very good it was of you my man  roberts looked still more confused and stammered with a forced laugh andsoim just keeping her on here unbeknownst until her husband getshe stopped suddenly  so she has a husband living then said breeze in surprise  in the mines yesin the mines repeated roberts with a monotonous deliberation quite distinct from his previous hesitation and shes only waitin until he gets money enoughtoto take her away he stopped and breathed hard  but couldnt youcouldnt weget her some more furniture theres nothing in that room you know not a chair or table and unless the other room is better furnished  eh oh yes said roberts quickly yet still with a certain embarrassment of course thats better furnished and shes quite satisfied and so are the kids with anything and now mr breeze i reckon youll say nothin o this and youll never go back on me  my dear mr roberts said the editor gravely from this moment i am not only blind but deaf to the fact that anybody occupies this floor but myself  i knew you was white all through mr breeze said the night watchman grasping the young mans hand with a grip of iron and i telled my wife so i sez jest you let me tell him everythin but shehe stopped again and became confused  and she was quite right i dare say said breeze with a laugh and i do not want to know anything and that poor woman must never know that i ever knew anything either but you may tell your wife that when the mother is away she can bring the little ones in here whenever she likes  thank yethank ye sirand ill just run down and tell the old woman now and wont intrude upon your dressin any longer  he grasped breezes hand again went out and closed the door behind him it might have been the editors fancy but he thought there was a certain interval of silence outside the door before the night watchmans heavy tread was heard along the hall again  for several evenings after this mr breeze paid some attention to the ballet in his usual round of the theatres although he had never seen his fair neighbor he had a vague idea that he might recognize her through some likeness to her children but in vain in the opulent charms of certain nymphs and in the angular austerities of others he failed equally to discern any of those refinements which might have distinguished the born lady of robertss story or which he himself had seen in her children  these he did not meet again during the week as his duties kept him late at the office but from certain signs in his room he knew that mrs roberts had availed herself of his invitation to bring them in with her and he regularly found jinnys doll tucked up in his bed at night and he as regularly disposed of it outside his door in the morning with a few sweets like an offering tucked under its rigid arms  but another circumstance touched him more delicately his room was arranged with greater care than before and with an occasional exhibition of taste that certainly had not distinguished mrs robertss previous ministrations one evening on his return he found a small bouquet of inexpensive flowers in a glass on his writingtable he loved flowers too well not to detect that they were quite fresh and could have been put there only an hour or two before he arrived  the next evening was saturday and as he usually left the office earlier on that day it occurred to him as he walked home that it was about the time his fair neighbor would be leaving the theatre and that it was possible he might meet her  at the front door however he found roberts who returned his greeting with a certain awkwardness which struck him as singular when he reached the niche on the landing he found his candle was gone but he proceeded on groping his way up the stairs with an odd conviction that both these incidents pointed to the fact that the woman had just returned or was expected  he had also a strange feelingwhich may have been owing to the darknessthat some one was hidden on the landing or on the stairs where he would pass this was further accented by a faint odor of patchouli as with his hand on the rail he turned the corner of the third landing and he was convinced that if he had put out his other hand it would have come in contact with his mysterious neighbor but a certain instinct of respect for her secret which she was even now guarding in the darkness withheld him and he passed on quickly to his own floor  here it was lighter the moon shot a beam of silver across the passage from an unshuttered window as he passed he reached his room door entered but instead of lighting the gas and shutting the door stood with it half open listening in the darkness  his suspicions were verified there was a slight rustling noise and a figure which had evidently followed him appeared at the end of the passage it was that of a woman habited in a grayish dress and cloak of the same color but as she passed across the band of moonlight he had a distinct view of her anxious worried face it was a face no longer young it was worn with illness but still replete with a delicacy and faded beauty so inconsistent with her avowed profession that he felt a sudden pang of pain and doubt the next moment she had vanished in her room leaving the same faint perfume behind her he closed his door softly lit the gas and sat down in a state of perplexity that swift glimpse of her face and figure had made her story improbable to the point of absurdity or possibly to the extreme of pathos  it seemed incredible that a woman of that quality should be forced to accept a vocation at once so low so distasteful and so unremunerative with her evident antecedents had she no friends but this common western night watchman of a bank had roberts deceived him was his whole story a fabrication and was there some complicity between the two what was it he knit his brows  mr breeze had that overpowering knowledge of the world which only comes with the experience of twentyfive and to this he superadded the active imagination of a newspaper man a plot to rob the bank these mysterious absences that luggage which he doubted not was empty and intended for spoil but why encumber herself with the two children here his common sense and instinct of the ludicrous returned and he smiled  but he could not believe in the ballet dancer he wondered indeed how any manager could have accepted the grim satire of that pale worried face among the fairies that sad refinement amid their vacant smiles and rouged checks and then growing sad again he comforted himself with the reflection that at least the children were not alone that night and so went to sleep  for some days he had no further meeting with his neighbors the disturbed state of the cityfor the vigilance committee were still in sessionobliged the daily press to issue extras and his work at the office increased  it was not until sunday again that he was able to be at home needless to say that his solitary little companions were duly installed there while he sat at work with his proofs on the table before him  the stillness of the empty house was only broken by the habitually subdued voices of the children at their play when suddenly the harsh stroke of a distant bell came through the open window but it was no sabbath bell and mr breeze knew it it was the tocsin of the vigilance committee summoning the members to assemble at their quarters for a capture a trial or an execution of some wrongdoer to him it was equally a summons to the officeto distasteful news and excitement  he threw his proofs aside in disgust laid down his pen seized his hat and paused a moment to look round for his playmates but they were gone he went into the hall looked into the open door of their room but they were not there he tried the door of the second room but it was locked  satisfied that they had stolen downstairs in their eagerness to know what the bell meant he hurried down also met roberts in the passagea singularly unusual circumstance at that hourcalled to him to look after the runaways and hurried to his office  here he found the staff collected excitedly discussing the news one of the vigilance committee prisoners a notorious bully and ruffian detained as a criminal and a witness had committed suicide in his cell fortunately this was all reportorial work and the services of mr breeze were not required he hurried back relieved to his room  when he reached his landing breathlessly he heard the same quick rustle he had heard that memorable evening and was quite satisfied that he saw a figure glide swiftly out of the open door of his room it was no doubt his neighbor who had been seeking her children and as he heard their voices as he passed his uneasiness and suspicions were removed  he sat down again to his scattered papers and proofs finished his work and took it to the office on his way to dinner he returned early in the hope that he might meet his neighbor again and had quite settled his mind that he was justified in offering a civil goodevening to her in spite of his previous respectful ignoring of her presence she must certainly have become aware by this time of his attention to her children and consideration for herself and could not mistake his motives but he was disappointed although he came up softly he found the floor in darkness and silence on his return and he had to be content with lighting his gas and settling down to work again  a near church clock had struck ten when he was startled by the sound of an unfamiliar and uncertain step in the hall followed by a tap at his door breeze jumped to his feet and was astonished to find dick the printers devil standing on the threshold with a roll of proofs in his hand  how did you get here he asked testily  they told me at the restaurant they reckoned you lived yere and the night watchman at the door headed me straight up when he knew whar i kem from he wanted to know what the news was but i told him hed better buy an extra and see  well what did you come for said the editor impatiently  the foreman said it was important and he wanted to know afore he went to press ef this yer correction was yours  he went to the table unrolled the proofs and taking out the slip pointed to a marked paragraph the foreman says the reporter who brought the news allows he got it straight firsthand but ef youve corrected it he reckons you know best  breeze saw at a glance that the paragraph alluded to was not of his own writing but one of several news items furnished by reporters these had been set up in the same galley and consequently appeared in the same proofslip he was about to say curtly that neither the matter nor the correction was his when something odd in the correction of the item struck him it read as follows  it appears that the notorious jim bodine who is in hiding and badly wanted by the vigilance committee has been tempted lately into a renewal of his old recklessness he was seen in sacramento street the other night by two separate witnesses one of whom followed him but he escaped in some friendly doorway  the words in sacramento street were stricken out and replaced by the correction on the saucelito shore and the words friendly doorway were changed to friendly dinghy the correction was not his nor the handwriting which was further disguised by being an imitation of print a strange idea seized him  has any one seen these proofs since i left them at the office  no only the foreman sir  he remembered that he had left the proofs lying openly on his table when he was called to the office at the stroke of the alarm bell he remembered the figure he saw gliding from his room on his return she had been there alone with the proofs she only could have tampered with them  the evident object of the correction was to direct the public attention from sacramento street to saucelito as the probable whereabouts of this jimmy bodine the street below was sacramento street the friendly doorway might have been their own  that she had some knowledge of this bodine was not more improbable than the ballet story her strange absences the mystery surrounding her all seemed to testify that she had some connectionperhaps only an innocent onewith these desperate people whom the vigilance committee were hunting down her attempt to save the man was after all no more illegal than their attempt to capture him true she might have trusted him breeze without this tampering with his papers yet perhaps she thought he was certain to discover itand it was only a silent appeal to his mercy the corrections were ingenious and naturalit was the act of an intelligent quickwitted woman  mr breeze was prompt in acting upon his intuition whether right or wrong he took up his pen wrote on the margin of the proof print as corrected said to the boy carelessly the corrections are all right and dismissed him quickly  the corrected paragraph which appeared in the informer the next morning seemed to attract little public attention the greater excitement being the suicide of the imprisoned bully and the effect it might have upon the prosecution of other suspected parties against whom the dead man had been expected to bear witness  mr breeze was unable to obtain any information regarding the desperado bodines associates and relations his correction of the paragraph had made the other members of the staff believe he had secret and superior information regarding the fugitive and he thus was estopped from asking questions but he felt himself justified now in demanding fuller information from roberts at the earliest opportunity  for this purpose he came home earlier that night hoping to find the night watchman still on his first beat in the lower halls but he was disappointed he was amazed however on reaching his own landing to find the passage piled with new luggage some of that ruder type of rolled blanket and knapsack known as a miners kit he was still more surprised to hear mens voices and the sound of laughter proceeding from the room that was always locked a sudden sense of uneasiness and disgust he knew not why came over him  he passed quickly into his room shut the door sharply and lit the gas but he presently heard the door of the locked room open a mans voice slightly elevated by liquor and opposition saying i know whats due from one genleman to nothera querulous objecting voice saying hole on not now and a fainter feminine protest all of which were followed by a rap on his door  breeze opened it to two strangers one of whom lurched forward unsteadily with outstretched hand he had a handsome face and figure and a certain consciousness of it even in the abandon of liquor he had an aggressive treacherousness of eye which his potations had not subdued he grasped breezes hand tightly but dropped it the next moment perfunctorily as he glanced round the room  i told them i was bound to come in he said without looking at breeze and say howdy to the man thats bin a pal to my women folks and the kidsand acted white all through i said to mame i reckon he knows who i am and that i kin be hightoned to them thats hightoned kin return shake for shake and shot for shot aye thats me so i was bound to come in like a genleman sir and here i am  he threw himself in an unproffered chair and stared at breeze  im afraid said breeze dryly that nevertheless i never knew who you were and that even now i am ignorant whom i am addressing  thats just it said the second man with a querulous protest which did not however conceal his admiring vassalage to his friend thats what im allus telling jim jim i says how is folks to know youre the man that shot kernel baxter and dropped three o them mariposa vigilants they didnt see you do it they just look at your fancy style and them mustaches of yours and allow ye might be death on the girls but they dont know ye an this man yerehes a scribe in them paperswrites what the boss editor tells him and lives up yere on the roof longside yer wife and the childrenwhats he knowin about you jims all right enough he continued in easy confidence to breeze but hes too fresh bout himself  mr james bodine accepted this tribute and criticism of his henchman with a complacent laugh which was not however without a certain contempt for the speaker and the man spoken to his bold selfish eyes wandered round the room as if in search of some other amusement than his companions offered  i reckon this is the room which that hound of a landlord rakes allowed hed fix up for our poker clubthe club that dan simmons and me got up with a few other sports it was to be a slapup affair right under the roof where there was no chance of the police raiding us but the cur weakened when the vigilants started out to make war on any game a genleman might hev that wasnt in their gummybag salt pork trade well its gettin a long time between drinks genlemen aint it he looked round him significantly  only the thought of the woman and her children in the next room and the shame that he believed she was enduring enabled breeze to keep his temper or even a show of civility  im afraid he said quietly that youll find very little here to remind you of the clubnot even the whiskey for i use the room only as a bedroom and as i am a workingman and come in late and go out early i have never found it available for hospitality even to my intimate friends i am very glad however that the little leisure i have had in it has enabled me to make the floor less lonely for your children  mr bodine got up with an affected yawn turned an embarrassed yet darkening eye on breeze and lunged unsteadily to the door and as i only happened in to do the reglar thing between hightoned genlemen i reckon we kin say quits he gave a coarse laugh said so long nodded stumbled into the passage and thence into the other room  his companion watched him pass out with a relieved yet protecting air and then closing the door softly drew nearer to breeze and said in husky confidence  ye aint seein him at his best mister hes bin drinkin too much and this yer news has upset him  what news asked breeze  this yer suicide o irish jack  was he his friend  friend ejaculated the man horrified at the mere suggestion not much why irish jack was the only man that could hev hung jim now hes dead in course the vigilants aint got no proof agin jim jim wants to face it out now an stay here but his wife and me dont see it noways so we are taking advantage o the lull agin him to get him off down the coast this very night thats why hes been off his head drinkin ye see when a man has been for weeks hidinpart o the time in that room and part o the time on the wharf where them vigilants has been watchin every ship that left in order to ketch him hes inclined to celebrate his chance o getting away  part of the time in that room interrupted breeze quickly  sartin dont ye see he allus kem in as you went outsabeand got away before you kem back his wife all the time just ahoverin between the two places and keeping watch for him it was killin to her you see for she wasnt brought up to it whiles jim didnt keerhad two revolvers and kalkilated to kill a dozen vigilants afore he dropped but thats over now and when ive got him safe on that plunger down at the wharf tonight and put him aboard the schooner thats lying off the heads hes all right agin  and roberts knew all this and was one of his friends asked breeze  roberts knew it and robertss wife used to be a kind of servant to jims wife in the south when she was a girl but i dont know ez roberts is his friend  he certainly has shown himself one said breeze  yees said the stranger meditatively yees he stopped opened the door softly and peeped out and then closed it again softly its singlar mr breeze he went on in a sudden yet embarrassed burst of confidence that jim thara man thet can shoot straight and hez frequent a man thet knows every skin game gointhat thet man jim very slowly heznt reallygotany friendscept meand his wife  indeed said mr breeze dryly  sure why you yourself didnt cotton to himi could see thet  mr breeze felt himself redden slightly and looked curiously at the man this vulgar parasite whom he had set down as a worshiper of sham heroes undoubtedly did not look like an associate of bodines and had a certain seriousness that demanded respect as he looked closer into his wide round face seamed with smallpox he fancied he saw even in its fatuous imbecility something of that haunting devotion he had seen on the refined features of the wife he said more gently  but one friend like you would seem to be enough  i aint what i uster be mr breeze said the man meditatively and mebbe ye dont know who i am im abe shuckster of shucksters ranchone of the biggest in petalumy i was a rich man until a year ago when jim got inter trouble what with mortgages and interest payin up jims friends and buying off some ez was set agin him thar aint much left and when ive settled that bill for the schooner lying off the heads there i reckon im about played out but ive allus a shanty at petalumy and mebbe when things is froze over and jim gets backyoull come and see himfor you aint seen him at his best  i suppose his wife and children go with him said breeze  no hes agin it and wants them to come later but thats all right for you see she kin go back to their own house at the mission now that the vigilants are givin up shadderin it so long mr breeze were startin afore daylight sorry you didnt see jim in condition  he grasped breezes hand warmly and slipped out of the door softly for an instant mr breeze felt inclined to follow him into the room and make a kinder adieu to the pair but the reflection that he might embarrass the wife who it would seem had purposely avoided accompanying her husband when he entered withheld him and for the last few minutes he had been doubtful if he had any right to pose as her friend beside the devotion of the man who had just left him his own scant kindness to her children seemed ridiculous  he went to bed but tossed uneasily until he fancied he heard stealthy footsteps outside his door and in the passage even then he thought of getting up dressing and going out to bid farewell to the fugitives but even while he was thinking of it he fell asleep and did not wake until the sun was shining in at his windows  he sprang to his feet threw on his dressinggown and peered into the passage everything was silent he stepped outsidethe light streamed into the hall from the open doors and windows of both roomsthe floor was empty not a trace of the former occupants remained he was turning back when his eye fell upon the battered wooden doll set upright against his doorjamb holding stiffly in its jointed arms a bit of paper folded like a note opening it he found a few lines written in pencil   god bless you for your kindness to us and try to forgive me for touching your papers but i thought that you would detect it know why i did it and then help us as you did goodby  mamie bodine   mr breeze laid down the paper with a slight accession of color as if its purport had been ironical how little had he done compared to the devotion of this delicate woman or the sacrifices of that rough friend how deserted looked this nest under the eaves which had so long borne its burden of guilt innocence shame and suffering for many days afterwards he avoided it except at night and even then he often found himself lying awake to listen to the lost voices of the children  but one evening a fortnight later he came upon roberts in the hall well said breeze with abrupt directness did he get away  roberts started uttered an oath which it is possible the recording angel passed to his credit and said yes he got away all right  why hasnt his wife joined him  no never in this world i reckon and if anywhere in the next i dont want to go there said roberts furiously  is he dead  dead that kind dont die  what do you mean  robertss lips writhed and then with a strong effort he said with deliberate distinctness i meanthat the hound went off with another womanthatwasinthat schooner and left that fool shuckster adrift in the plunger  and the wife and children  shuckster sold his shanty at petaluma to pay their passage to the states goodnight     how reuben allen saw life in san francisco   the junior partner of the firm of sparlow  kane druggists and apothecaries of san francisco was gazing meditatively out of the corner of the window of their little shop in dupont street he could see the dimly lit perspective of the narrow thoroughfare fade off into the level sand wastes of market street on the one side and plunge into the halfexcavated bulk of telegraph hill on the other he could see the glow and hear the rumble of montgomery streetthe great central avenue farther down the hill above the housetops was spread the warm blanket of seafog under which the city was regularly laid to sleep every summer night to the cool lullaby of the northwest trades it was already halfpast eleven footsteps on the wooden pavement were getting rarer and more remote the last cart had rumbled by the shutters were up along the street the glare of his own red and blue jars was the only beacon left to guide the wayfarers ordinarily he would have been going home at this hour when his partner who occupied the surgery and a small bedroom at the rear of the shop always returned to relieve him that night however a professional visit would detain the doctor until halfpast twelve there was still an hour to wait he felt drowsy the mysterious incense of the shop that combined essence of drugs spice scented soap and orris rootwhich always reminded him of the arabian nightswas affecting him he yawned and then turning away passed behind the counter took down a jar labeled glycyrr glabra selected a piece of spanish licorice and meditatively sucked it not receiving from it that diversion and sustenance he apparently was seeking he also visited in an equally familiar manner a jar marked jujubes and returned ruminatingly to his previous position  if i have not in this incident sufficiently established the youthfulness of the junior partner i may add briefly that he was just nineteen that he had early joined the emigration to california and after one or two previous lighthearted essays at other occupations for which he was singularly unfitted he had saved enough to embark on his present venture still less suited to his temperament in those adventurous days trades and vocations were not always filled by trained workmen it was extremely probable that the experienced chemist was already making his success as a goldminer with a lawyer and a physician for his partners and mr kanes inexperienced position was by no means a novel one a slight knowledge of latin as a written language an american schoolboys acquaintance with chemistry and natural philosophy were deemed sufficient by his partner a regular physician for practical cooperation in the vending of drugs and putting up of prescriptions he knew the difference between acids and alkalies and the peculiar results which attended their incautious combination but he was excessively deliberate painstaking and cautious the legend which adorned the desk at the counter physicians prescriptions carefully prepared was more than usually true as regarded the adverb there was no danger of his poisoning anybody through haste or carelessness but it was possible that an urgent case might have succumbed to the disease while he was putting up the remedy nor was his caution entirely passive in those days the heroic practice of medicine was in keeping with the abnormal development of the country there were record doses of calomel and quinine and he had once or twice incurred the fury of local practitioners by sending back their prescriptions with a modest query  the faroff clatter of carriage wheels presently arrested his attention looking down the street he could see the lights of a hackney carriage advancing towards him they had already flashed upon the open crossing a block beyond before his vague curiosity changed into an active instinctive presentiment that they were coming to the shop he withdrew to a more becoming and dignified position behind the counter as the carriage drew up with a jerk before the door  the driver rolled from his box and opened the carriage door to a woman whom he assisted between some hysterical exclamations on her part and some equally incoherent explanations of his own into the shop kane saw at a glance that both were under the influence of liquor and one the woman was disheveled and bleeding about the head yet she was elegantly dressed and evidently en fete with one or two tricolor knots and ribbons mingled with her finery her golden hair matted and darkened with blood had partly escaped from her french bonnet and hung heavily over her shoulders the driver who was supporting her roughly and with a familiarity that was part of the incongruous spectacle was the first to speak  madame le blank ye know got cut about the head down at the fete at south park tried to dance upon the table and rolled over on some champagne bottles see wants plastering up  ah brute hog nozzing of ze kine why will you lie i dance ze cowards fools traitors zere upset ze table and i fall i am cut ah my god how i am cut  she stopped suddenly and lapsed heavily against the counter at which kane hurried around to support her into the surgery with the one fixed idea in his bewildered mind of getting her out of the shop and suggestively into the domain and under the responsibility of his partner the hackman apparently relieved and washing his hands of any further complicity in the matter nodded and smiled and saying i reckon ill wait outside pardner retreated incontinently to his vehicle to add to kanes halfludicrous embarrassment the fair patient herself slightly resisted his support accused the hackman of abandoning her and demanded if kane knew zee reason of zees affair yet she presently lapsed again into the large recliningchair which he had wheeled forward with open mouth halfshut eyes and a strange pierrette mask of face combined of the pallor of faintness and chalk and the rouge of paint and blood at which kanes cautiousness again embarrassed him a little brandy from the bottle labeled vini galli seemed to be indicated but his inexperience could not determine if her relaxation was from bloodlessness or the reacting depression of alcohol in this dilemma he chose a medium course with aromatic spirits of ammonia and mixing a diluted quantity in a measuringglass poured it between her white lips a start a struggle a cougha volley of imprecatory french and the knocking of the glass from his hand followedbut she came to he quickly sponged her head of the halfcoagulated blood and removed a few fragments of glass from a long laceration of the scalp the shock of the cold water and the appearance of the ensanguined basin frightened her into a momentary passivity but when kane found it necessary to cut her hair in the region of the wound in order to apply the adhesive plaster she again endeavored to rise and grasp the scissors  youll bleed to death if youre not quiet said the young man with dogged gravity  something in his manner impressed her into silence again he cut whole locks away ruthlessly he was determined to draw the edges of the wound together with the strip of plaster and stop the bleedingif he cropped the whole head his excessive caution for her physical condition did not extend to her superficial adornment her yellow tresses lay on the floor her neck and shoulders were saturated with water from the sponge which he continually applied until the heated strips of plaster had closed the wound almost hermetically she whimpered tears ran down her cheeks but so long as it was not blood the young man was satisfied  in the midst of it he heard the shop door open and presently the sound of rapping on the counter another customer  mr kane called out wait a moment and continued his ministrations after a pause the rapping recommenced kane was just securing the last strip of plaster and preserved a preoccupied silence then the door flew open abruptly and a figure appeared impatiently on the threshold it was that of a miner recently returned from the gold diggingsso recently that he evidently had not had time to change his clothes at his adjacent hotel and stood there in his high boots duck trousers and flannel shirt over which his coat was slung like a hussars jacket from his shoulder kane would have uttered an indignant protest at the intrusion had not the intruder himself as quickly recoiled with an astonishment and contrition that was beyond the effect of any reproval he literally gasped at the spectacle before him a handsomely dressed woman reclining in a chair lace and jewelry and ribbons depending from her saturated shoulders tresses of golden hair filling her lap and lying on the floor a pail of ruddy water and a sponge at her feet and a pale young man bending over her head with a spirit lamp and strips of yellow plaster  scuse me pard i was just dropping in dont you hurry i kin wait he stammered falling back and then the door closed abruptly behind him  kane gathered up the shorn locks wiped the face and neck of his patient with a clean towel and his own handkerchief threw her gorgeous opera cloak over her shoulders and assisted her to rise she did so weakly but obediently she was evidently stunned and cowed in some mysterious way by his material attitude perhaps or her sudden realization of her position at least the contrast between her aggressive entrance into the shop and her subdued preparation for her departure was so remarkable that it affected even kanes preoccupation  there he said slightly relaxing his severe demeanor with an encouraging smile i think this will do weve stopped the bleeding it will probably smart a little as the plaster sets closer i can send my partner dr sparlow to you in the morning  she looked at him curiously and with a strange smile and zees doctor sparrloweez he like you msieu  he is older and very well known said the young man seriously i can safely recommend him  ah she repeated with a pensive smile which made kane think her quite pretty ahhe ez olderyour doctor sparrlowbut you are strong msieu  and said kane vaguely he will tell you what to do  ah she repeated again softly with the same smile he will tell me what to do if i shall not know myself dat ez good  kane had already wrapped her shorn locks in a piece of spotless white paper and tied it up with narrow white ribbon in the dainty fashion dear to druggists clerks as he handed it to her she felt in her pocket and produced a handful of gold  what shall i pay for zees msieu  kane reddened a littlesolely because of his slow arithmetical faculties adhesive plaster was cheaphe would like to have charged proportionately for the exact amount he had used but the division was beyond him and he lacked the traders instinct  twentyfive cents i think he hazarded briefly  she started but smiled again twentyfive cents for all zeesze medicine ze strips for ze head ze hair cutshe glanced at the paper parcel he had given herit is only twentyfive cents  thats all  he selected from her outstretched palm with some difficulty the exact amount the smallest coin it held she again looked at him curiouslyhalf confusedlyand moved slowly into the shop the miner who was still there retreated as before with a gaspingly apologetic gestureeven flattening himself against the window to give her sweeping silk flounces freer passage as she passed into the street with a merci msieu good anight and the hackman started from the vehicle to receive her the miner drew a long breath and bringing his fist down upon the counter ejaculated  bgosh shes a stunner  kane a good deal relieved at her departure and the success of his ministration smiled benignly  the stranger again stared after the retreating carriage looked around the shop and even into the deserted surgery and approached the counter confidentially look yer pardner i kem straight from st jo mizzorri to gold hillwhar ive got a claimand i reckon this is the first time i ever struck san francisker i aint up to towny ways nohow and i allow that mebbe im rather green so well let that pass now look yer he added leaning over the

but very mysteriously and sinking his voice to the lowest confidential pitch as he put his hand to his ear as if to catch the hushed reply what mout hev bin happening pard  considerably amused at the mans simplicity kane replied goodhumoredly danced among some champagne bottles on a table at a party fell and got cut by glass  the stranger nodded his head slowly and approvingly as he repeated with infinite deliberateness danced on champagne bottles champagne you said pard at a pahty yes musingly and approvingly i reckon thats about the gait they take shed do it  is there anything i can do for you sorry to have kept you waiting said kane glancing at the clock  o me lord ye neednt mind me why i should wait for anythin o the like o that and be just proud to do it and ye see i sorter helped myself while you war busy  helped yourself said kane in astonishment  yes outer that bottle he pointed to the ammonia bottle which still stood on the counter it seemed to be handy and popular  man you might have poisoned yourself  the stranger paused a moment at the idea so i mout i reckon he said musingly thats so pizined myself jest ez you was lookin arter that hightoned case and kinder bothered you its like me  i mean it required diluting you ought to have taken it in water said kane  i reckon it did sorter hist me over to the door for a little fresh air at first seemed rayther scaldy to the lips but wot of it that got thar he put his hand gravely to his stomach did me powful good  what was the matter with you asked kane  well ye see pard confidentially again i reckon its suthin along o my heart times it gets to poundin away like a quartz stamp and then it stops suddent like and kinder leaves me out too  kane looked at him more attentively he was a strong powerfully built man with a complexion that betrayed nothing more serious than the effects of mining cookery it was evidently a common case of indigestion  i dont say it would not have done you some good if properly administered he replied if you like ill put up a diluted quantity and directions  thats me every time pardner said the stranger with an accent of relief and look yer dont you stop at that ye just put me up some samples like of anythin you think mout be likely to hit ill go in for a fair show and then meander in every now and then betwixt times to let you know ye dont mind my drifting in here do ye its about

o your insides you jest stick to that feller to set ye right  the junior partners face reddened as he turned to his shelves ostensibly for consultation conscious of his inexperience the homely praise of even this ignorant man was not ungrateful he felt too that his treatment of the frenchwoman though successful might not be considered remunerative from a business point of view by his partner he accordingly acted upon the suggestion of the stranger and put up two or three specifics for dyspepsia they were received with grateful alacrity and the casual display of considerable gold in the strangers pocket in the process of payment he was evidently a successful miner  after bestowing the bottles carefully about his person he again leaned confidentially towards kane i reckon of course you know this hightoned lady being in the way of seein that kind o folks i suppose you wont mind telling me ez a stranger but he added hastily with a deprecatory wave of his hand perhaps ye would  mr kane in fact had hesitated he knew vaguely and by report that madame le blanc was the proprietress of a famous restaurant over which she had rooms where private gambling was carried on to a great extent it was also alleged that she was protected by a famous gambler and a somewhat notorious bully mr kanes caution suggested that he had no right to expose the reputation of his chance customer he was silent  the strangers face became intensely sympathetic and apologetic i seenot another word pard it aint the square thing to be givin her away and i oughtnt to hev asked wellso long i reckon ill jest drift back to the hotel i aint been in san francisker mor n three hours and i calkilate pard that ive jest seen about ez square a sample of hightoned life as fellers ez haz bin here a year well hastermanyannerez the greasers say ill be droppin in tomorrow my names reuben allen o mariposa i know yours its on the sign and it aint sparlow  he cast another lingering glance around the shop as if loath to leave it and then slowly sauntered out of the door pausing in the street a moment in the glare of the red light before he faded into darkness without knowing exactly why kane had an instinct that the stranger knew no one in san francisco and after leaving the shop was going into utter silence and obscurity  a few moments later dr sparlow returned to relieve his wearied partner a pushing active man he listened impatiently to kanes account of his youthful practice with madame le blanc without however dwelling much on his methods you ought to have charged her more the elder said decisively shed have paid it she only came here because she was ashamed to go to a big shop in montgomery streetand she wont come again  but she wants you to see her tomorrow urged kane and i told her you would  you say it was only a superficial cut queried the doctor and you closed it umph what can she want to see me for he paid more attention however to the case of the stranger allen when he comes here again manage to let me see him mr kane promised yet for some indefinable reason he went home that night not quite as well satisfied with himself  he was much more concerned the next morning when after relieving the doctor for his regular morning visits he was startled an hour later by the abrupt return of that gentleman his face was marked by some excitement and anxiety which nevertheless struggled with that sense of the ludicrous which californians in those days imported into most situations of perplexity or catastrophe putting his hands deeply into his trousers pockets he confronted his youthful partner behind the counter  how much did you charge that frenchwoman he said gravely  twentyfive cents said kane timidly  well id give it back and add two hundred and fifty dollars if she had never entered the shop  whats the matter  her head will beand a mass of it in a day i reckon why man you put enough plaster on it to clothe and paper the dome of the capitol you drew her scalp together so that she couldnt shut her eyes without climbing up the bedpost you mowed her hair off so that shell have to wear a wig for the next two yearsand handed it to her in a beautiful sealed package they talk of suing me and killing you out of hand  she was bleeding a great deal and looked faint said the junior partner i thought i ought to stop that  and you didby thunder though it might have been better business for the shop if id found her a crumbling ruin here than lathed and plastered in this fashion over there however he added with a laugh seeing an angry light in his junior partners eye she dont seem to mind itthe cursing all comes from them she rather likes your style and praises itthats what gets me did you talk to her much he added looking critically at his partner  i only told her to sit still or shed bleed to death said kane curtly  humphshe jabbered something about your being strong and knowing just how to handle her well it cant be helped now i think i came in time for the worst of it and have drawn their fire dont do it again the next time a woman with a cut head and long hair tackles you fill up her scalp with lint and tannin and pack her off to some of the big shops and make them pick it out and with a goodhumored nod he started off to finish his interrupted visits  with a vague sense of remorse and yet a consciousness of some injustice done him mr kane resumed his occupation with filters and funnels and mortars and triturations he was so gloomily preoccupied that he did not as usual glance out of the window or he would have observed the mining stranger of the previous night before it it was not until the mans bowed shoulders blocked the light of the doorway that he looked up and recognized him kane was in no mood to welcome his appearance his presence too actively recalled the last nights adventure of which he was a witnessalbeit a sympathizing one kane shrank from the illusions which he felt he would be sure to make and with his present ill luck he was by no means sure that his ministrations even to him had been any more successful than they had been to the frenchwoman but a glance at his goodhumored face and kindling eyes removed that suspicion nevertheless he felt somewhat embarrassed and impatient and perhaps could not entirely conceal it he forgot that the rudest natures are sometimes the most delicately sensitive to slights and the stranger had noticed his manner and began apologetically  i allowed id just drop in anyway to tell ye that these thar pills you giv me did me a heap o good so farthough mebbe its only fair to give the others a show too which im reckoning to do he paused and then in a submissive confidence went on but first i wanted to hev you excuse me for havin asked all them questions about that hightoned lady last night when it warnt none of my business i am a darned fool  mr kane instantly saw that it was no use to keep up his attitude of secrecy or impose upon the ignorant simple man and said hurriedly oh no the lady is very well known she is the proprietress of a restaurant down the streeta house open to everybody her name is madame le blanc you may have heard of her before  to his surprise the man exhibited no diminution of interest nor change of sentiment at this intelligence then he said slowly i reckon i might get to see her again ye see mr kane i rather took a fancy to her general style and gaitarter seein her in that fix last night it was rather like them play pictures on the stage ye dont think shed make any fuss to seein a rough old fortyniner like me  hardly said kane but there might be some objection from her gentlemen friends he added with a smilejack lane a gambler who keeps a faro bank in her rooms and jimmy oryan a prizefighter who is one of her chuckers out  his further relation of madame le blancs entourage apparently gave the miner no concern he looked at kane nodded and repeated slowly and appreciatively yes keeps a gamblin and faro bank and a prizefighteri reckon that might be about her gait and style too and you say she lives  he stopped for at this moment a man entered the shop quickly shut the door behind him and turned the key in the lock it was done so quickly that kane instinctively felt that the man had been loitering in the vicinity and had approached from the side street a single glance at the intruders face and figure showed him that it was the bully of whom he had just spoken he had seen that square brutal face once before confronting the police in a riot and had not forgotten it but today with the flush of liquor on it it had an impatient awkwardness and confused embarrassment that he could not account for he did not comprehend that the genuine bully is seldom deliberate of attack and is obligedin common with many of the combative lower animalsto lash himself into a previous fury of provocation this probably saved him as perhaps some instinctive feeling that he was in no immediate danger kept him cool he remained standing quietly behind the counter allen glanced around carelessly looking at the shelves  the silence of the two men apparently increased the ruffians rage and embarrassment suddenly he leaped into the air with a whoop and clumsily executed a negro double shuffle on the floor which jarred the glassesyet was otherwise so singularly ineffective and void of purpose that he stopped in the midst of it and had to content himself with glaring at kane  well said kane quietly what does all this mean what do you want here  what does it mean repeated the bully finding his voice in a high falsetto designed to imitate kanes it means im going to play merry hll with this shop it means im goin to clean it out and the blank haircuttin blank that keeps it what do i want here wellwhat i want i intend to help myself to and all hll cant stop me and working himself to the striking point who the blank are you to ask me he sprang towards the counter but at the same moment allen seemed to slip almost imperceptibly and noiselessly between them and kane found himself confronted only by the miners broad back  hol yer hosses stranger said allen slowly as the ruffian suddenly collided with his impassive figure im a sick man comin in yer for medicine ive got somethin wrong with my heart and goins on like this yer kinder sets it to thumpin  blank you and your blank heart screamed the bully turning in a fury of amazement and contempt at this impotent interruption whobut his voice stopped allens powerful right arm had passed over his head and shoulders like a steel hoop and pinioned his elbows against his sides held rigidly upright he attempted to kick but allens right leg here advanced and firmly held his lower limbs against the counter that shook to his struggles and blasphemous outcries allen turned quietly to kane and with a gesture of his unemployed arm said confidentially  would ye mind passing me down that ar romantic spirits of ammonyer ye gave me last night  kane caught the idea and handed him the bottle  thar said allen taking out the stopper and holding the pungent spirit against the bullys dilated nostrils and vociferous mouth thar smell that and taste it it will do ye good it was powerful kammin to me last night  the ruffian gasped coughed choked but his blaspheming voice died away in a suffocating hiccough  thar continued allen as his now subdued captive relaxed his struggling ye r better and so am i its quieter here now and ye aint affectin my heart so bad a little fresh air will make us both all right he turned again to kane in his former subdued confidential manner  would ye mind openin that door  kane flew to the door unlocked it and held it wide open the bully again began to struggle but a second inhalation of the hartshorn quelled him and enabled his captor to drag him to the door as they emerged upon the sidewalk the bully with a final desperate struggle freed his arm and grasped his pistol at his hippocket but at the same moment allen deliberately caught his hand and with a powerful side throw cast him on the pavement retaining the weapon in his own hand ive one of my own he said to the prostrate man but i reckon ill keep this yer too until youre better  the crowd that had collected quickly recognizing the notorious and discomfited bully were not of a class to offer him any sympathy and he slunk away followed by their jeers allen returned quietly to the shop kane was profuse in his thanks and yet oppressed with his simple friends fatuous admiration for a woman who could keep such ruffians in her employ you know who that man was i suppose he said  i reckon it was that er prizefighter belongin to that hightoned lady returned allen simply but he dont know anything about rastlin bgosh only that i was afraid o bringin on that heart trouble i mout hev hurt him bad  they thinkhesitated kane thatiwas rough in my treatment of that woman and maliciously cut off her hair this attack was revengeorhe hesitated still more as he remembered dr sparlows indication of the womans feelingor that bullys idea of revenge  i see nodded allen opening his small sympathetic eyes on kane with an exasperating air of secrecyjust jealousy  kane reddened in sheer hopelessness of explanation no it was earning his wages as he thought  never ye mind pard said allen confidentially ill set em both right ye see this sorter gives me a show to call at that thar restaurant and give him back his sixshooter and set her on the right trail for you why lordy i was here when you was fixin herim testimony o the way you did itand shell remember me ill sorter waltz round thar this afternoon but i reckon i wont be keepin you from your work any longer and look yari say pardthis is seein life in friscoaint it gosh ive had more high times in this very shop in two days than ive had in two years of st jo so long mr kane he waved his hand lounged slowly out of the shop gave a parting glance up the street passed the window and was gone  the next day being a halfholiday for kane he did not reach the shop until afternoon your mining friend allen has been here said doctor sparlow i took the liberty of introducing myself and induced him to let me carefully examine him he was a little shy and i am sorry for it as i fear he has some serious organic trouble with his heart and ought to have a more thorough examination seeing kanes unaffected concern he added you might influence him to do so hes a good fellow and ought to take some care of himself by the way he told me to tell you that hed seen madame le blanc and made it all right about you he seems to be quite infatuated with the woman  im sorry he ever saw her said kane bitterly  well his seeing her seems to have saved the shop from being smashed up and you from getting a punched head returned the doctor with a laugh hes no foolyet its a freak of human nature that a simple hayseed like thata man whos lived in the backwoods all his life is likely to be the first to tumble before a pot of french rouge like her  indeed in a couple of weeks there was no further doubt of mr reuben allens infatuation he dropped into the shop frequently on his way to and from the restaurant where he now regularly took his meals he spent his evenings in gambling in its private room yet kane was by no means sure that he was losing his money there unfairly or that he was used as a pigeon by the proprietress and her friends the bully oryan was turned away sparlow grimly suggested that allen had simply taken his place but kane ingeniously retorted that the doctor was only piqued because allen had evaded his professional treatment certainly the patient had never consented to another examination although he repeatedly and gravely bought medicines and was a generous customer once or twice kane thought it his duty to caution allen against his new friends and enlighten him as to madame le blancs reputation but his suggestions were received with a goodhumored submission that was either the effect of unbelief or of perfect resignation to the fact and he desisted one morning dr sparlow said cheerfully  would you like to hear the last thing about your friend and the frenchwoman the boys cant account for her singling out a fellow like that for her friend so they say that the night that she cut herself at the fete and dropped in here for assistance she found nobody here but allena chance customer that it was he who cut off her hair and bound up her wounds in that sincere fashion and she believed he had saved her life the doctor grinned maliciously as he added and as thats the way history is written you see your reputation is safe  it may have been a month later that san francisco was thrown into a paroxysm of horror and indignation over the assassination of a prominent citizen and official in the gamblingrooms of madame le blanc at the hands of a notorious gambler the gambler had escaped but in one of those rare spasms of vengeful morality which sometimes overtakes communities who have too long winked at and suffered the existence of evil the fair proprietress and her whole entourage were arrested and haled before the coroners jury at the inquest the greatest excitement prevailed it was said that if the jury failed in their duty the vigilance committee had arranged for the destruction of the establishment and the deportation of its inmates the crowd that had collected around the building was reinforced by kane and dr sparlow who had closed their shop in the next block to attend when kane had fought his way into the building and the temporary court held in the splendidly furnished gambling saloon whose gilded mirrors reflected the eager faces of the crowd the chief of police was giving his testimony in a formal official manner impressive only for its relentless and impassive revelation of the character and antecedents of the proprietress the house had been long under the espionage of the police madame le blanc had a dozen aliases she was wanted in new orleans in new york in havana it was in her house that dyer the bank clerk committed suicide it was there that colonel hooley was set upon by her bully oryan it was shekane heard with reddening cheekswho defied the police with riotous conduct at a fete two months ago as he coolly recited the counts of this shameful indictment kane looked eagerly around for allen whom he knew had been arrested as a witness how would he take this terrible disclosure he was sitting with the others his arm thrown over the back of his chair and his goodhumored face turned towards the woman in his old confidential attitude she gorgeously dressed painted but unblushing was cool collected and cynical  the coroner next called the only witness of the actual tragedy reuben allen the man did not move nor change his position the summons was repeated a policeman touched him on the shoulder there was a pause and the officer announced he has fainted your honor  is there a physician present asked the coroner  sparlow edged his way quickly to the front im a medical man he said to the coroner as he passed quickly to the still upright immovable figure and knelt beside it with his head upon his heart there was an awed silence as after a pause he rose slowly to his feet  the witness is a patient your honor whom i examined some weeks ago and found suffering from valvular disease of the heart he is dead     three vagabonds of trinidad   oh its you is it said the editor  the chinese boy to whom the colloquialism was addressed answered literally after his habit  allee same li tee me no changee me no ollee china boy  thats so said the editor with an air of conviction i dont suppose theres another imp like you in all trinidad county well next time dont scratch outside there like a gopher but come in  lass time suggested li tee blandly me tap tappee you no like tap tappee you say alle same dam woodpeckel  it was quite truethe highly sylvan surroundings of the trinidad sentinel officea little clearing in a pine forestand its attendant fauna made these signals confusing an accurate imitation of a woodpecker was also one of li tees accomplishments  the editor without replying finished the note he was writing at which li tee as if struck by some coincident recollection lifted up his long sleeve which served him as a pocket and carelessly shook out a letter on the table like a conjuring trick the editor with a reproachful glance at him opened it it was only the ordinary request of an agricultural subscriberone johnsonthat the editor would notice a giant radish grown by the subscriber and sent by the bearer  wheres the radish li tee said the editor suspiciously  no hab got ask mellikan boy  what  here li tee condescended to explain that on passing the schoolhouse he had been set upon by the schoolboys and that in the struggle the big radishbeing like most such monstrosities of the quick californian soil merely a mass of organized waterwas mashed over the head of some of his assailants the editor painfully aware of these regular persecutions of his errand boy and perhaps realizing that a radish which could not be used as a bludgeon was not of a sustaining nature forebore any reproof but i cannot notice what i havent seen li tee he said goodhumoredly  spose you lieallee same as johnson suggested li with equal cheerfulness he foolee you with lotten stuffyou foolee mellikan man allee same  the editor preserved a dignified silence until he had addressed his letter take this to mrs martin he said handing it to the boy and mind you keep clear of the schoolhouse dont go by the flat either if the men are at work and dont if you value your skin pass flanigans shanty where you set off those firecrackers and nearly burnt him out the other day look out for barkers dog at the crossing and keep off the main road if the tunnel men are coming over the hill then remembering that he had virtually closed all the ordinary approaches to mrs martins house he added better go round by the woods where you wont meet any one  the boy darted off through the open door and the editor stood for a moment looking regretfully after him he liked his little protege ever since that unfortunate childa waif from a chinese washhousewas impounded by some indignant miners for bringing home a highly imperfect and insufficient washing and kept as hostage for a more proper return of the garments unfortunately another gang of miners equally aggrieved had at the same time looted the washhouse and driven off the occupants so that li tee remained unclaimed for a few weeks he became a sporting appendage of the miners camp the stolid butt of goodhumored practical jokes the victim alternately of careless indifference or of extravagant generosity he received kicks and halfdollars intermittently and pocketed both with stoical fortitude but under this treatment he presently lost the docility and frugality which was part of his inheritance and began to put his small wits against his tormentors until they grew tired of their own mischief and his but they knew not what to do with him his pretty nankeenyellow skin debarred him from the white public school while although as a heathen he might have reasonably claimed attention from the sabbathschool the parents who cheerfully gave their contributions to the heathen abroad objected to him as a companion of their children in the church at home at this juncture the editor offered to take him into his printing office as a devil for a while he seemed to be endeavoring in his old literal way to act up to that title he inked everything but the press he scratched chinese characters of an abusive import on leads printed them and stuck them about the office he put punk in the foremans pipe and had been seen to swallow small type merely as a diabolical recreation as a messenger he was fleet of foot but uncertain of delivery some time previously the editor had enlisted the sympathies of mrs martin the goodnatured wife of a farmer to take him in her household on trial but on the third day li tee had run away yet the editor had not despaired and it was to urge her to a second attempt that he dispatched that letter  he was still gazing abstractedly into the depths of the wood when he was conscious of a slight movementbut no soundin a clump of hazel near him and a stealthy figure glided from it he at once recognized it as jim a wellknown drunken indian vagrant of the settlementtied to its civilization by the single link of fire water for which he forsook equally the reservation where it was forbidden and his own camps where it was unknown unconscious of his silent observer he dropped upon all fours with his ear and nose alternately to the ground like some tracking animal then having satisfied himself he rose and bending forward in a dogged trot made a straight line for the woods he was followed a few seconds later by his doga slinking rough wolflike brute whose superior instinct however made him detect the silent presence of some alien humanity in the person of the editor and to recognize it with a yelp of habit anticipatory of the stone that he knew was always thrown at him  thats cute said a voice but its just what i expected all along  the editor turned quickly his foreman was standing behind him and had evidently noticed the whole incident  its what i allus said continued the man that boy and that injin are thick as thieves ye cant see one without the otherand theyve got their little tricks and signals by which they follow each other tother day when you was kalkilatin li tee was doin your errands i tracked him out on the marsh just by followin that ornery pizenous dog o jims there was the whole caboodle of emincluding jimcampin out and eatin raw fish that jim had ketched and green stuff they had both sneaked outer johnsons garden mrs martin may take him but she wont keep him long while jims round what makes li foller that blamed old injin soaker and what makes jim who at least is a merican take up with a furrin heathen just gets me  the editor did not reply he had heard something of this before yet after all why should not these equal outcasts of civilization cling together    li tees stay with mrs martin was brief his departure was hastened by an untoward eventapparently ushered in as in the case of other great calamities by a mysterious portent in the sky one morning an extraordinary bird of enormous dimensions was seen approaching from the horizon and eventually began to hover over the devoted town careful scrutiny of this ominous fowl however revealed the fact that it was a monstrous chinese kite in the shape of a flying dragon the spectacle imparted considerable liveliness to the community which however presently changed to some concern and indignation it appeared that the kite was secretly constructed by li tee in a secluded part of mrs martins clearing but when it was first tried by him he found that through some error of design it required a tail of unusual proportions this he hurriedly supplied by the first means he foundmrs martins clothesline with part of the weekly wash depending from it this fact was not at first noticed by the ordinary sightseer although the tail seemed peculiaryet perhaps not more peculiar than a dragons tail ought to be but when the actual theft was discovered and reported through the town a vivacious interest was created and spyglasses were used to identify the various articles of apparel still hanging on that ravished clothesline these garments in the course of their slow disengagement from the clothespins through the gyrations of the kite impartially distributed themselves over the townone of mrs martins stockings falling upon the veranda of the polka saloon and the other being afterwards discovered on the belfry of the first methodist churchto the scandal of the congregation it would have been well if the result of li tees invention had ended here alas the kiteflyer and his accomplice injin jim were tracked by means of the kites telltale cord to a lonely part of the marsh and rudely dispossessed of their charge by deacon hornblower and a constable unfortunately the captors overlooked the fact that the kiteflyers had taken the precaution of making a halfturn of the stout cord around a log to ease the tremendous pull of the kitewhose power the captors had not reckoned uponand the deacon incautiously substituted his own body for the log a singular spectacle is said to have then presented itself to the onlookers the deacon was seen to be running wildly by leaps and bounds over the marsh after the kite closely followed by the constable in equally wild efforts to restrain him by tugging at the end of the line the extraordinary race continued to the town until the constable fell losing his hold of the line this seemed to impart a singular specific levity to the deacon who to the astonishment of everybody incontinently sailed up into a tree when he was succored and cut down from the demoniac kite he was found to have sustained a dislocation of the shoulder and the constable was severely shaken by that one infelicitous stroke the two outcasts made an enemy of the law and the gospel as represented in trinidad county it is to be feared also that the ordinary emotional instinct of a frontier community to which they were now simply abandoned was as little to be trusted in this dilemma they disappeared from the town the next dayno one knew where a pale blue smoke rising from a lonely island in the bay for some days afterwards suggested their possible refuge but nobody greatly cared the sympathetic mediation of the editor was characteristically opposed by mr parkin skinner a prominent citizen  its all very well for you to talk sentiment about niggers chinamen and injins and you fellers can laugh about the deacon being snatched up to heaven like elijah in that blamed chinese chariot of a kitebut i kin tell you gentlemen that this is a white mans country yes sir you cant get over it the nigger of every descriptionyeller brown or black call him chinese injin or kanaka or what you likehez to clar off of gods footstool when the anglosaxon gets started it stands to reason that they cant live alongside o printin presses mcormicks reapers and the bible yes sir the bible and deacon hornblower kin prove it to you its our manifest destiny to clar them outthats what we was put here forand its just the work weve got to do  i have ventured to quote mr skinners stirring remarks to show that probably jim and li tee ran away only in anticipation of a possible lynching and to prove that advanced sentiments of this high and ennobling nature really obtained forty years ago in an ordinary american frontier town which did not then dream of expansion and empire  howbeit mr skinner did not make allowance for mere human nature one morning master bob skinner his son aged twelve evaded the schoolhouse and started in an old indian dugout to invade the island of the miserable refugees his purpose was not clearly defined to himself but was to be modified by circumstances he would either capture li tee and jim or join them in their lawless existence he had prepared himself for either event by surreptitiously borrowing his fathers gun he also carried victuals having heard that jim ate grasshoppers and li tee rats and misdoubting his own capacity for either diet he paddled slowly well in shore to be secure from observation at home and then struck out boldly in his leaky canoe for the islanda tufted tussocky shred of the marshy promontory torn off in some tidal storm it was a lovely day the bay being barely ruffled by the afternoon trades but as he neared the island he came upon the swell from the bar and the thunders of the distant pacific and grew a little frightened the canoe losing way fell into the trough of the swell shipping salt water still more alarming to the prairiebred boy forgetting his plan of a stealthy invasion he shouted lustily as the helpless and waterlogged boat began to drift past the island at which a lithe figure emerged from the reeds threw off a tattered blanket and slipped noiselessly like some animal into the water it was jim who half wading half swimming brought the canoe and boy ashore master skinner at once gave up the idea of invasion and concluded to join the refugees  this was easy in his defenceless state and his manifest delight in their rude encampment and gypsy life although he had been one of li tees oppressors in the past but that stolid pagan had a philosophical indifference which might have passed for christian forgiveness and jims native reticence seemed like assent and possibly in the minds of these two vagabonds there might have been a natural sympathy for this other truant from civilization and some delicate flattery in the fact that master skinner was not driven out but came of his own accord howbeit they fished together gathered cranberries on the marsh shot a wild duck and two plovers and when master skinner assisted in the cooking of their fish in a conical basket sunk in the ground filled with water heated by rolling redhot stones from their driftwood fire into the buried basket the boys felicity was supreme and what an afternoon to lie after this feast on their bellies in the grass replete like animals hidden from everything but the sunshine above them so quiet that gray clouds of sandpipers settled fearlessly around them and a shining brown muskrat slipped from the ooze within a few feet of their faceswas to feel themselves a part of the wild life in earth and sky not that their own predatory instincts were hushed by this divine peace that intermitting black spot upon the water declared by the indian to be a seal the stealthy glide of a yellow fox in the ambush of a callow brood of mallards the momentary straying of an elk from the upland upon the borders of the marsh awoke their tingling nerves to the happy but fruitless chase and when night came too soon and they pigged together around the warm ashes of their campfire under the low lodge poles of their wigwam of dried mud reeds and driftwood with the combined odors of fish woodsmoke and the warm salt breath of the marsh in their nostrils they slept contentedly the distant lights of the settlement went out one by one the stars came out very large and very silent to take their places the barking of a dog on the nearest point was followed by another farther inland but jims dog curled at the feet of his master did not reply what had he to do with civilization  the morning brought some fear of consequences to master skinner but no abatement of his resolve not to return but here he was oddly combated by li tee spose you go back allee same you tellee famlee canoe go topside downyou plentee swimee to bush allee night in bush housee big way offhow can get sabe  and ill leave the gun and tell dad that when the canoe upset the gun got drowned said the boy eagerly  li tee nodded  and come again saturday and bring more powder and shot and a bottle for jim said master skinner excitedly  good grunted the indian  then they ferried the boy over to the peninsula and set him on a trail across the marshes known only to themselves which would bring him home and when the editor the next morning chronicled among his news adrift on the baya schoolboys miraculous escape he knew as little what part his missing chinese errand boy had taken in it as the rest of his readers  meantime the two outcasts returned to their island camp it may have occurred to them that a little of the sunlight had gone from it with bob for they were in a dull stupid way fascinated by the little white tyrant who had broken bread with them he had been delightfully selfish and frankly brutal to them as only a schoolboy could be with the addition of the consciousness of his superior race yet they each longed for his return although he was seldom mentioned in their scanty conversationcarried on in monosyllables each in his own language or with some common english word or more often restricted solely to signs by a delicate flattery when they did speak of him it was in what they considered to be his own language  boston boy plenty like catchee him jim would say pointing to a distant swan or li tee hunting a striped water snake from the reeds would utter stolidly melikan boy no likee snake yet the next two days brought some trouble and physical discomfort to them bob had consumed or wasted all their provisionsand still more unfortunately his righteous visit his gun and his superabundant animal spirits had frightened away the game which their habitual quiet and taciturnity had beguiled into trustfulness they were half starved but they did not blame him it would come all right when he returned they counted the days jim with secret notches on the long pole li tee with a string of copper cash he always kept with him the eventful day came at lasta warm autumn day patched with inland fog like blue smoke and smooth tranquil open surfaces of wood and sea but to their waiting confident eyes the boy came not out of either they kept a stolid silence all that day until night fell when jim said mebbe boston boy go dead li tee nodded it did not seem possible to these two heathens that anything else could prevent the christian child from keeping his word  after that by the aid of the canoe they went much on the marsh hunting apart but often meeting on the trail which bob had taken with grunts of mutual surprise these suppressed feelings never made known by word or gesture at last must have found vicarious outlet in the taciturn dog who so far forgot his usual discretion as to once or twice seat himself on the waters edge and indulge in a fit of howling it had been a custom of jims on certain days to retire to some secluded place where folded in his blanket with his back against a tree he remained motionless for hours in the settlement this had been usually referred to the after effects of drink known as the horrors but jim had explained it by saying it was when his heart was bad and now it seemed by these gloomy abstractions that his heart was bad very often and then the long withheld rains came one night on the wings of a fierce southwester beating down their frail lodge and scattering it abroad quenching their campfire and rolling up the bay until it invaded their reedy island and hissed in their ears it drove the game from jims gun it tore the net and scattered the bait of li tee the fisherman cold and half starved in heart and body but more dogged and silent than ever they crept out in their canoe into the stormtossed bay barely escaping with their miserable lives to the marshy peninsula here on their enemys ground skulking in the rushes or lying close behind tussocks they at last reached the fringe of forest below the settlement here too sorely pressed by hunger and doggedly reckless of consequences they forgot their caution and a flight of teal fell to jims gun on the very outskirts of the settlement  it was a fatal shot whose echoes awoke the forces of civilization against them for it was heard by a logger in his hut near the marsh who looking out had seen jim pass a careless goodnatured frontiersman he might have kept the outcasts mere presence to himself but there was that damning shot an indian with a gun that weapon contraband of law with dire fines and penalties to whoso sold or gave it to him a thing to be looked intosome one to be punished an indian with a weapon that made him the equal of the white who was safe he hurried to town to lay his information before the constable but meeting mr skinner imparted the news to him the latter poohpoohed the constable who he alleged had not yet discovered the whereabouts of jim and suggested that a few armed citizens should make the chase themselves the fact was that mr skinner never quite satisfied in his mind with his sons account of the loss of the gun had put two and two together and was by no means inclined to have his own gun possibly identified by the legal authority moreover he went home and at once attacked master bob with such vigor and so highly colored a description of the crime he had committed and the penalties attached to it that bob confessed more than that i grieve to say that bob lied the indian had stoled his gun and threatened his life if he divulged the theft he told how he was ruthlessly put ashore and compelled to take a trail only known to them to reach his home in two hours it was reported throughout the settlement that the infamous jim had added robbery with violence to his illegal possession of the weapon the secret of the island and the trail over the marsh was told only to a few  meantime it had fared hard with the fugitives their nearness to the settlement prevented them from lighting a fire which might have revealed their hidingplace and they crept together shivering all night in a clump of hazel scared thence by passing but unsuspecting wayfarers wandering off the trail they lay part of the next day and night amid some tussocks of salt grass blown on by the cold seabreeze chilled but securely hidden from sight indeed thanks to some mysterious power they had of utter immobility it was wonderful how they could efface themselves through quiet and the simplest environment the lee side of a straggling vine in the meadow or even the thin ridge of castup drift on the shore behind which they would lie for hours motionless was a sufficient barrier against prying eyes in this occupation they no longer talked together but followed each other with the blind instinct of animalsyet always unerringly as if conscious of each others plans strangely enough it was the real animal alonetheir nameless dogwho now betrayed impatience and a certain human infirmity of temper the concealment they were resigned to the sufferings they mutely accepted he alone resented when certain scents or sounds imperceptible to their senses were blown across their path he would with bristling back snarl himself into guttural and strangulated fury yet in their apathy even this would have passed them unnoticed but that on the second night he disappeared suddenly returning after two hours absence with bloody jawsreplete but still slinking and snappish it was only in the morning that creeping on their hands and knees through the stubble they came upon the torn and mangled carcass of a sheep the two men looked at each other without speakingthey knew what this act of rapine meant to themselves it meant a fresh hue and cry after themit meant that their starving companion had helped to draw the net closer round them the indian grunted li tee smiled vacantly but with their knives and fingers they finished what the dog had begun and became equally culpable but that they were heathens they could not have achieved a delicate ethical responsibility in a more christianlike way  yet the ricefed li tee suffered most in their privations his habitual apathy increased with a certain physical lethargy which jim could not understand when they were apart he sometimes found li tee stretched on his back with an odd stare in his eyes and once at a distance he thought he saw a vague thin vapor drift from where the chinese boy was lying and vanish as he approached when he tried to arouse him there was a weak drawl in his voice and a druglike odor in his breath jim dragged him to a more substantial shelter a thicket of alder it was dangerously near the frequented road but a vague idea had sprung up in jims now troubled mind that equal vagabonds though they were li tee had more claims upon civilization through those of his own race who were permitted to live among the white men and were not hunted to reservations and confined there like jims people if li tee was heap sick other chinamen might find and nurse him as for li tee he had lately said in a more lucid interval me go deadallee samee mellikan boy you go dead tooallee samee and then lay down again with a glassy stare in his eyes far from being frightened at this jim attributed his condition to some enchantment that li tee had evoked from one of his godsjust as he himself had seen medicinemen of his own tribe fall into strange trances and was glad that the boy no longer suffered the day advanced and li tee still slept jim could hear the church bells ringing he knew it was sundaythe day on which he was hustled from the main street by the constable the day on which the shops were closed and the drinking saloons open only at the back door the day whereon no man workedand for that reason though he knew it not the day selected by the ingenious mr skinner and a few friends as especially fitting and convenient for a chase of the fugitives the bell brought no suggestion of thisthough the dog snapped under his breath and stiffened his spine and then he heard another sound far off and vague yet one that brought a flash into his murky eye that lit up the heaviness of his hebraic face and even showed a slight color in his high cheekbones he lay down on the ground and listened with suspended breath he heard it now distinctly it was the boston boy calling and the word he was calling was jim  then the fire dropped out of his eyes as he turned with his usual stolidity to where li tee was lying him he shook saying briefly boston boy come back but there was no reply the dead body rolled over inertly under his hand the head fell back and the jaw dropped under the pinched yellow face the indian gazed at him slowly and then gravely turned again in the direction of the voice yet his dull mind was perplexed for blended with that voice were other sounds like the tread of clumsily stealthy feet but again the voice called jim and raising his hands to his lips he gave a low whoop in reply this was followed by silence when suddenly he heard the voicethe boys voiceonce again this time very near him saying eagerly  there he is  then the indian knew all his face however did not change as he took up his gun and a man stepped out of the thicket into the trail  drop that gun you dd injin  the indian did not move  drop it i say  the indian remained erect and motionless  a rifle shot broke from the thicket at first it seemed to have missed the indian and the man who had spoken cocked his own rifle but the next moment the tall figure of jim collapsed where he stood into a mere blanketed heap  the man who had fired the shot walked towards the heap with the easy air of a conqueror but suddenly there arose before him an awful phantom the incarnation of savagerya creature of blazing eyeballs flashing tusks and hot carnivorous breath he had barely time to cry out a wolf before its jaws met in his throat and they rolled together on the ground  but it was no wolfas a second shot provedonly jims slinking dog the only one of the outcasts who at that supreme moment had gone back to his original nature     a vision of the fountain   mr jackson potter halted before the little cottage half shop half hostelry opposite the great gates of domesday park where tickets of admission to that venerable domain were sold here mr potter revealed his nationality as a western american not only in his accent but in a certain halfhumorous halfpractical questioning of the ticketselleras that quasiofficial stamped his ticketwhich was nevertheless delivered with such unfailing goodhumor and such frank suggestiveness of the perfect equality of the ticketseller and the welldressed stranger that far from producing any irritation it attracted the pleased attention not only of the official but his wife and daughter and a customer possibly the good looks of the stranger had something to do with it jackson potter was a singularly handsome young fellow with one of those ideal faces and figures sometimes seen in western frontier villages attributable to no ancestor but evolved possibly from novels and books devoured by ancestresses in the long solitary winter evenings of their lonely cabins on the frontier a beardless classical head covered by short flocculent blonde curls poised on a shapely neck and shoulders was more greek in outline than suggestive of any ordinary american type finally after having thoroughly amused his small audience he lifted his straw hat to the ladies and lounged out across the road to the gateway here he paused consulting his guidebook and read aloud st johns gateway this massive structure according to leland was built inmurmurednever mind when well pass st john marked the page with his pencil and tendering his ticket to the gatekeeper heard with some satisfaction that as there were no other visitors just then and as the cicerone only accompanied parties he would be left to himself and at once plunged into a bypath  it was that loveliest of rare creationsa hot summer day in england with all the dampness of that seablown isle wrung out of it exhaled in the quivering blue vault overhead or passing as dim wraiths in the distant wood and all the longmatured growth of that great old garden vivified and made resplendent by the fervid sun the ashes of dead and gone harvests even the dust of those who had for ages wrought in it turned again and again through incessant cultivation seemed to move and live once more in that present sunshine all color appeared to be deepened and mellowed until even the very shadows of the trees were as velvety as the sward they fell upon the prairiebred potter accustomed to the youthful caprices and extravagances of his own virgin soil could not help feeling the influence of the ripe restraints of this  as he glanced through the leaves across green sunlit spaces to the ivyclad ruins of domesday abbey which seemed itself a growth of the very soil he murmured to himself things had been made mighty comfortable for folks here you bet forgotten books he had read as a boy scraps of school histories or rarer novels came back to him as he walked along and peopled the solitude about him with their heroes  nevertheless it was unmistakably hota heat homelike in its intensity yet of a different effect throwing him into languid reverie rather than filling his veins with fire secure in his seclusion in the leafy chase he took off his jacket and rambled on in his shirt sleeves through the opening he presently saw the abbey again with the restored wing where the noble owner lived for two or three weeks in the year but now given over to the prevailing solitude and then issuing from the chase he came upon a broad mossgrown terrace before him stretched a tangled and luxuriant wilderness of shrubs and flowers darkened by cypress and cedars of lebanon its dun depths illuminated by dazzling white statues vases trellises and paved paths choked and lost in the trailing growths of years of abandonment and forgetfulness he consulted his guidebook again it was the old italian garden constructed under the design of a famous italian gardener by the third duke but its studied formality being displeasing to his successor it was allowed to fall into picturesque decay and negligent profusion which were not however disturbed by later descendantsa fact deplored by the artistic writer of the guidebook who mournfully called attention to the rare beauty of the marble statues urns and fountains ruined by neglect although one or two of the rarer objects had been removed to deep dene lodge another seat of the present duke  it is needless to say that mr potter conceived at once a humorous opposition to the artistic enthusiasm of the critic and plunging into the garden took a mischievous delight in its wildness and the victorious struggle of nature with the formality of art at every step through the tangled labyrinth he could see where precision and order had been invaded and even the rigid masonry broken or upheaved by the rebellious force yet here and there the two powers had combined to offer an example of beauty neither could have effected alone a passion vine had overrun and enclasped a vase with a perfect symmetry no sculptor could have achieved a heavy balustrade was made ethereal with a delicate fretwork of vegetation between its balusters like lace here however the lap and gurgle of water fell gratefully upon the ear of the perspiring and thirsty mr potter and turned his attention to more material things following the sound he presently came upon an enormous oblong marble basin containing three timeworn fountains with grouped figures the pipes were empty silent and choked with reeds and water plants but the great basin itself was filled with water from some invisible source  a terraced walk occupied one side of the long parallelogram at intervals and along the opposite bank half shadowed by willows tinted marble figures of tritons fauns and dryads arose half hidden in the reeds they were more or less mutilated by time and here and there only the empty mosscovered plinths that had once supported them could be seen but they were so lifelike in their subdued color in the shade that he was for a moment startled  the water looked deliciously cool an audacious thought struck him he was alone and the place was a secluded one he knew there were no other visitors the marble basin was quite hidden from the rest of the garden and approached only from the path by which he had come and whose entire view he commanded he quietly and deliberately undressed himself under the willows and unhesitatingly plunged into the basin the water was four or five feet deep and its extreme length afforded an excellent swimming bath despite the waterlilies and a few aquatic plants that mottled its clear surface or the sedge that clung to the bases of the statues he disported for some moments in the delicious element and then seated himself upon one of the halfsubmerged plinths almost hidden by reeds that had once upheld a river god here lazily resting himself upon his elbow half his body still below the water his quick ear was suddenly startled by a rustling noise and the sound of footsteps for a moment he was inclined to doubt his senses he could see only the empty path before him and the deserted terrace but the sound became more distinct and to his great uneasiness appeared to come from the other side of the fringe of willows where there was undoubtedly a path to the fountain which he had overlooked his clothes were under those willows but he was at least twenty yards from the bank and an equal distance from the terrace he was about to slip beneath the water when to his crowning horror before he could do so a young girl slowly appeared from the hidden willow path full upon the terrace she was walking leisurely with a parasol over her head and a book in her hand even in his intense consternation her whole figurea charming one in its white dress sailor hat and tan shoeswas imprinted on his memory as she instinctively halted to look upon the fountain evidently an unexpected surprise to her  a sudden idea flashed upon him she was at least sixty yards away he was half hidden in the reeds and well in the long shadows of the willows if he remained perfectly motionless she might overlook him at that distance or take him for one of the statues he remembered also that as he was resting on his elbow his halfsubmerged body lying on the plinth below water he was somewhat in the attitude of one of the river gods and there was no other escape if he dived he might not be able to keep under water as long as she remained and any movement he knew would betray him he stiffened himself and scarcely breathed luckily for him his attitude had been a natural one and easy to keep it was well too for she was evidently in no hurry and walked slowly stopping from time to time to admire the basin and its figures suddenly he was instinctively aware that she was looking towards him and even changing her position moving her pretty head and shading her eyes with her hand as if for a better view he remained motionless scarcely daring to breathe yet there was something so innocently frank and undisturbed in her observation that he knew as instinctively that she suspected nothing and took him for a halfsubmerged statue he breathed more freely but presently she stopped glanced around her and keeping her eyes fixed in his direction began to walk backwards slowly until she reached a stone balustrade behind her on this she leaped and sitting down opened in her lap the sketchbook she was carrying and taking out a pencil to his horror began to sketch  for a wild moment he recurred to his first idea of diving and swimming at all hazards to the bank but the conviction that now his slightest movement must be detected held him motionless he must save her the mortification of knowing she was sketching a living man if he died for it she sketched rapidly but fixedly and absorbedly evidently forgetting all else in her work from time to time she held out her sketch before her to compare it with her subject yet the seconds seemed minutes and the minutes hours suddenly to his great relief a distant voice was heard calling lottie it was a womans voice by its accent it also seemed to him an american one  the young girl made a slight movement of impatience but did not look up and her pencil moved still more rapidly again the voice called this time nearer the young girls pencil fairly flew over the paper as still without looking up she lifted a pretty voice and answered back yees  it struck him that her accent was also that of a compatriot  where on earth are you continued the first voice which now appeared to come from the other side of the willows on the path by which the young girl had approached here aunty replied the girl closing her sketchbook with a snap and starting to her feet  a stout woman fashionably dressed made her appearance from the willow path  what have you been doing all this while she said querulously not sketching i hope she added with a suspicious glance at the book you know your professor expressly forbade you to do so in your holidays  the young girl shrugged her shoulders ive been looking at the fountains she replied evasively  and horrid looking pagan things they are too said the elder woman turning from them disgustedly without vouchsafing a second glance come if we expect to do the abbey we must hurry up or we wont catch the train your uncle is waiting for us at the top of the garden  and to potters intense relief she grasped the young girls arm and hurried her away their figures the next moment vanishing in the tangled shrubbery  potter lost no time in plunging with his cramped limbs into the water and regaining the other side here he quickly half dried himself with some sunwarmed leaves and baked mosses hurried on his clothes and hastened off in the opposite direction to the path taken by them yet with such circuitous skill and speed that he reached the great gateway without encountering anybody a brisk walk brought him to the station in time to catch a stopping train and in half an hour he was speeding miles away from domesday park and his halfforgotten episode    meantime the two ladies continued on their way to the abbey i dont see why i maynt sketch things i see about me said the young lady impatiently of course i understand that i must go through the rudimentary drudgery of my art and study from casts and learn perspective and all that but i cant see whats the difference between working in a stuffy studio over a hand or arm that i know is only a study and sketching a full or half length in the open air with the wonderful illusion of light and shade and distanceand grouping and combining them allthat one knows and feels makes a picture the real picture one makes is already in ones self  for goodness sake lottie dont go on again with your usual absurdities since you are bent on being an artist and your popper has consented and put you under the most expensive master in paris the least you can do is to follow the rules and i dare say he only wanted you to sink the shop in company its such horrid bad form for you artistic people to be always dragging out your sketchbooks what would you say if your popper came over here and began to examine every ladys dress in society to see what material it was just because he was a big drygoods dealer in america  the young girl accustomed to her aunts extravagances made no reply but that night she consulted her sketch and was so far convinced of her own instincts and the profound impression the fountain had made upon her that she was enabled to secretly finish her interrupted sketch from memory for miss charlotte forrest was a born artist and in no mere caprice had persuaded her father to let her adopt the profession and accepted the drudgery of a novitiate she looked earnestly upon this first real work of her hand and found it good still it was but a pencil sketch and wanted the vivification of color  when she returned to paris she beganstill secretlya larger study in oils she worked upon it in her own room every moment she could spare from her studio practice unknown to her professor it absorbed her existence she grew thin and pale when it was finished and only then she showed it tremblingly to her master he stood silent in profound astonishment the easel before him showed a foreground of tangled luxuriance from which stretched a sheet of water like a darkened mirror while through parted reeds on its glossy surface arose the halfsubmerged figure of a river god exquisite in contour yet whose delicate outlines were almost a vision by the crowning illusion of light shadow and atmosphere  it is a beautiful copy mademoiselle and i forgive you breaking my rules he said drawing a long breath but i cannot now recall the original picture  its no copy of a picture professor said the young girl timidly and she disclosed her secret it was the only perfect statue there she added diffidently but i think it wantedsomething  true said the professor abstractedly where the elbow rests there should be a halfinverted urn flowing with water but the drawing of that shoulder is so perfectas is your study of itthat one guesses the missing forearm one cannot see which clasped it beautiful beautiful  suddenly he stopped and turned his eyes almost searchingly on hers  you say you have never drawn from the human model mademoiselle  never said the young girl innocently  true murmured the professor again these are the classic ideal measurements there are no limbs like those now yet it is wonderful and this gem you say is in england  yes  good i am going there in a few days i shall make a pilgrimage to see it until then mademoiselle i beg you to break as many of my rules as you like  three weeks later she found the professor one morning standing before her picture in her private studio you have returned from england she said joyfully  i have said the professor gravely  you have seen the original subject she said timidly  i have not i have not seen it mademoiselle he said gazing at her mildly through his glasses because it does not exist and never existed  the young girl turned pale  listen i have go to england i arrive at the park of domesday i penetrate the beautiful wild garden i approach the fountain i see the wonderful water the exquisite light and shade the lilies the mysterious reedsbeautiful yet not as beautiful as you have made it mademoiselle but no statueno river god i demand it of the concierge he knows of it absolutely nothing i transport myself to the noble proprietor monsieur le duc at a distant chateau where he has collected the ruined marbles it is not there  yet i saw it said the young girl earnestly yet with a troubled face o professor she burst out appealingly what do you think it was  i think mademoiselle said the professor gravely that you created it believe me it is a function of genius more it is a proof a necessity you saw the beautiful lake the ruined fountain the soft shadows the empty plinth curtained by reeds you yourself say you feel there was something wanting unconsciously you yourself supplied it all that you had ever dreamt of mythology all that you had ever seen of statuary thronged upon you at that supreme moment and evolved from your own fancy the river god was born it is your own chere enfant as much the offspring of your genius as the exquisite atmosphere you have caught the charm of light and shadow that you have brought away accept my felicitations you have little more to learn of me  as he bowed himself out and descended the stairs he shrugged his shoulders slightly she is an adorable genius he murmured yet she is also a woman being a woman naturally she has a loverthis river god why not  the extraordinary success of miss forrests picture and the instantaneous recognition of her merit as an artist apart from her novel subject perhaps went further to remove her uneasiness than any serious conviction of the professors theory nevertheless it appealed to her poetic and mystic imagination and although other subjects from her brush met with equally phenomenal success and she was able in a year to return to america with a reputation assured beyond criticism she never entirely forgot the strange incident connected with her initial effort  and by degrees a singular change came over her rich famous and attractive she began to experience a sentimental and romantic interest in that episode once when reproached by her friends for her indifference to her admirers she had half laughingly replied that she had once found her ideal but never would again yet the jest had scarcely passed her lips before she became pale and silent with this change came also a desire to repurchase the picture which she had sold in her early success to a speculative american picturedealer on inquiry she found alas that it had been sold only a day or two before to a chicago gentleman of the name of potter who had taken a fancy to it  miss forrest curled her pretty lip but nothing daunted resolved to effect her purpose and sought the purchaser at his hotel she was ushered into a private drawingroom where on a handsome easel stood the newly acquired purchase mr potter was out but would return in a moment  miss forrest was relieved for alone and undisturbed she could now let her full soul go out to her romantic creation as she stood there she felt the glamour of the old english garden come back to her the play of light and shadow the silent pool the godlike face and bust with its castdown meditative eyes seen through the parted reeds she clasped her hands silently before her should she never see it again as then  pray dont let me disturb you but wont you take a seat  miss forrest turned sharply round then she started uttered a frightened little cry and fainted away  mr potter was touched but a master of himself as she came to he said quietly i came upon you suddenlyas you stood entranced by this picturejust as i did when i first saw it thats why i bought it are you any relative of the miss forrest who painted it he continued quietly looking at her card which he held in his hand  miss forrest recovered herself sufficiently to reply and stated her business with some dignity  ah said mr potter that is another question you see the picture has a special value to me as i once saw an oldfashioned garden like that in england but that chap therei beg your pardon i mean that figurei fancy is your own creation entirely however ill think over your proposition and if you will allow me ill call and see you about it  mr potter did callnot once but many timesand showed quite a remarkable interest in miss forrests art the question of the sale of the picture however remained in abeyance a few weeks later after a longer call than usual mr potter said  dont you think the best thing we can do is to make a kind of compromise and let us own the picture together  and they did     a romance of the line   as the train moved slowly out of the station the writer of stories looked up wearily from the illustrated pages of the magazines and weeklies on his lap to the illustrated advertisements on the walls of the station sliding past his carriage windows it was getting to be monotonous for a while he had been hopefully interested in the bustle of the departing trains and looked up from his comfortable and early invested position to the later comers with that sense of superiority common to travelers had watched the conventional leavetakingsalways feebly prolonged to the uneasiness of both partiesand contrasted it with the impassive business promptitude of the railway officials but it was the old experience repeated falling back on the illustrated advertisements again he wondered if their perpetual recurrence at every station would not at last bring to the tired traveler the loathing of satiety whether the passenger in railway carriages continually offered somebodys oats inks washing blue candles and soap apparently as a necessary equipment for a few hours journey would not there and thereafter forever ignore the use of these articles or recoil from that particular quality or as an unbiased observer he wondered if on the other hand impressible passengers after passing three or four stations had ever leaped from the train and refused to proceed further until they were supplied with one or more of those articles had he ever known any one who confided to him in a moment of expansiveness that he had dated his use of somebodys soap to an advertisement persistently borne upon him through the medium of a railway carriage window no would he not have connected that man with that other certifying individual who always appends a name and address singularly obscure and unconvincing yet who at some supreme moment recommends somebodys pills to a dying friendafflicted with a similar addresswhich restore him to life and undying obscurity yet these pictorial and literary appeals must have a potency independent of the wares they advertise or they wouldnt be there  perhaps he was the more sensitive to this monotony as he was just then seeking change and novelty in order to write a new story he was not looking for materialhis subjects were usually the samehe was merely hoping for that relaxation and diversion which should freshen and fit him for later concentration still he had often heard of the odd circumstances to which his craft were sometimes indebted for suggestion the invasion of an eccentriclooking individualprobably an innocent tradesman into a railway carriage had given the hint for a night with a lunatic a nervously excited and belated passenger had once unconsciously sat for an escaped forger the picking up of a forgotten novel in the rack with passages marked in pencil had afforded the plot of a love story or the germ of a romance had been found in an obscure news paragraph which under less listless moments would have passed unread on the other hand he recalled these inconvenient and inconsistent moments from which the socalled inspiration sprang the utter incongruity of time and place in some brilliant conception and wondered if sheer vacuity of mind were really so favorable  going back to his magazine again he began to get mildly interested in a story turning the page however he was confronted by a pictorial advertising leaflet inserted between the pages yet so artistic in character that it might have been easily mistaken for an illustration of the story he was reading and perhaps was not more remote or obscure in reference than many he had known but the next moment he recognized with despair that it was only a smaller copy of one he had seen on the hoarding at the last station he threw the leaflet aside but the flavor of the story was gone the peerless detergent of the advertisement had erased it from the tablets of his memory he leaned back in his seat again and lazily watched the flying suburbs here were the usual promising open spaces and patches of green quickly succeeded again by solid blocks of houses whose rear windows gave directly upon the line yet seldom showed an inquisitive faceeven of a wondering child it was a strange revelation of the depressing effects of familiarity expresses might thunder by goods trains drag their slow length along shunting trains pipe all day beneath their windows but the tenants heeded them not here too was the junction with its labyrinthine interlacing of tracks that dazed the tired brain the overburdened telegraph posts that looked as if they really could not stand another wire the long lines of empty homeless and deserted trains in sidings that had seen better days the idle trains with staring vacant windows which were eventually seized by a pert engine hissing come along will you and departed with a discontented grunt from every individual carriage coupling the racing trains that suddenly appeared parallel with ones carriage windows begot false hopes of a challenge of speed and then without warning drew contemptuously and superciliously away the swift eclipse of everything in a tunneled bridge the long slithering passage of an up express and then the flash of a station incoherent and unintelligible with pictorial advertisements again  he closed his eyes to concentrate his thought and by degrees a pleasant languor stole over him the train had by this time attained that rate of speed which gave it a slight swing and roll on curves and switches not unlike the rocking of a cradle once or twice he opened his eyes sleepily upon the waltzing trees in the double planes of distance and again closed them then in one of these slight oscillations he felt himself ridiculously slipping into slumber and awoke with some indignation another station was passed in which process the pictorial advertisements on the hoardings and the pictures in his lap seemed to have become jumbled up confused and to dance before him and then suddenly and strangely without warning the train stopped shortat another station and then he arose andwhat five minutes before he never conceived of doinggathered his papers and slipped from the carriage to the platform when i say he i mean of course the writer of stories yet the man who slipped out was half his age and a differentlooking person    the change from the motion of the trainfor it seemed that he had been traveling several hoursto the firmer platform for a moment bewildered him the station looked strange and he fancied it lacked a certain kind of distinctness but that quality was also noticeable in the porters and loungers on the platform he thought it singular until it seemed to him that they were not characteristic nor in any way important or necessary to the business he had in hand then with an effort he tried to remember himself and his purpose and made his way through the station to the open road beyond a van bearing the inscription removals to town and country stood before him and blocked his way but a dogcart was in waiting and a grizzled groom who held the reins touched his hat respectfully although still dazed by his journey and uncertain of himself he seemed to recognize in the man that distinctive character which was wanting in the others the correctness of his surmise was revealed a few moments later when after he had taken his seat beside him and they were rattling out of the village street the man turned towards him and said  thall know sir jarge  i do not said the young man  ay but theers many as cooms here as doant for all they cooms thall say it ill becooms mea as war man and boy in sir jarges sarvice for fifty year to say owt agen him but im here to do it or they couldnt

downroight that sir jarge forged his uncles will and so gotten the grange that ee keeps his niece in mortal fear o he that thall be put in haunted chamber wi a boggle  i think said the young man hesitatingly that there must be some mistake i do not know any sir george and i am not going to the grange  eay then thee arent the ero sent down from london by the story writer  not by that one said the young man diffidently  the old mans face changed it was no mere figure of speech it actually was another face that looked down upon the traveler  then mayhap your honor will be bespoken at the angels inn he said with an entirely distinct and older dialect and a finer hostel for a young gentleman of your condition yell not find on this side of oxford a fair chamber looking to the sun sheets smelling of lavender from dame margerys own store and for the matter of that spread by the fair hands of maudlin her daughterthe best favored lass that ever danced under a maypole ha have at ye there young sir not to speak of the october ale of old gregory her fatheray nor the rare hollands that never paid excise duties to the king  im afraid said the young traveler timidly theres over a century between us theres really some mistake  what said the groom ye are not the young spark who is to marry mistress amy at the hall yet makes a pother and mess of it all by a duel with sir roger de cadgerly the wicked baronet for his overfree discourse with our fair maudlin this very eve ye are not the traveler whose postchaise is now at the falcon ye are not he that was bespoken by the story writer in london  i dont think i am said the young man apologetically indeed as i am feeling far from well i think ill get out and walk  he got downthe vehicle and driver vanished in the distance it did not surprise him i must collect my thoughts he said he did so possibly the collection was not large for presently he said with a sigh of relief  i see it all now my name is paul bunker i am of the young branch of an old quaker family rich and respected in the country and i am on a visit to my ancestral home but i have lived since a child in america and am alien to the traditions and customs of the old country and even of the seat to which my fathers belong i have brought with me from the far west many peculiarities of speech and thought that may startle my kinsfolk but i certainly shall not address my uncle as hoss nor shall i say guess oftener than is necessary  much brightened and refreshed by his settled identity he had time as he walked briskly along to notice the scenery which was certainly varied and conflicting in character and quite inconsistent with his preconceived notions of an english landscape on his right a lake of the brightest cobalt blue stretched before a manytowered and terraced town which was relieved by a background of luxuriant foliage and emeraldgreen mountains on his left arose a rugged mountain which he was surprised to see was snowcapped albeit a tunnel was observable midway of its height and a train just issuing from it almost regretting that he had not continued on his journey as he was fully sensible that it was in some way connected with the railway he had quitted presently his attention was directed to the gateway of a handsome park whose mansion was faintly seen in the distance hurrying towards him down the avenue of limes was a strange figure it was that of a man of middle age clad in quaker garb yet with an extravagance of cut and detail which seemed antiquated even for england he had evidently seen the young man approaching and his face was beaming with welcome if paul had doubted that it was his uncle the first words he spoke would have reassured him  welcome to hawthorn hall said the figure grasping his hand heartily but thee will excuse me if i do not tarry with thee long at present for i am hastening even now with some nourishing and sustaining food for giles hayward a farm laborer he pointed to a package he was carrying but thee will find thy cousins jane and dorcas bunker taking tea in the summerhouse go to them naypositivelyi may not linger but will return to thee quickly and to pauls astonishment he trotted away on his sturdy respectable legs still beaming and carrying his package in his hand  well ill be doggoned but the old man aint going to be left you bet he ejaculated suddenly remembering his dialect hell get there whether school keeps or not then reflecting that no one heard him he added simply he certainly was not over civil towards the nephew he has never seen before and those girlswhom i dont know how very awkward  nevertheless he continued his way up the avenue towards the mansion the park was beautifully kept remembering the native wildness and virgin seclusion of the western forest he could not help contrasting it with the conservative gardening of this pretty woodland every rood of which had been patrolled by keepers and rangers and preserved and fostered hundreds of years before he was born until warmed for human occupancy at times the avenue was crossed by grass drives where the original woodland had been displaced not by the exigency of a clearing for tillage as in his own west but for the leisurely pleasure of the owner then a few hundred yards from the house itselfa quaint jacobean mansionhe came to an open space where the sylvan landscape had yielded to floral cultivation and so fell upon a charming summerhouse or arbor embowered with roses it must have been the one of which his uncle had spoken for there to his wondering admiration sat two little maids before a rustic table drinking tea demurely yes with all the evident delight of a childish escapade from their elders while in the picturesque quaintness of their attire there was still a formal suggestion of the sect to which their father belonged their summer frocksdiffering in color yet each of the same subdued tintwere alike in cut and fashion and short enough to show their dainty feet in prim slippers and silken hose that matched their frocks as the afternoon sun glanced through the leaves upon their pink cheeks tied up in quaint hats by ribbons under their chins they made a charming picture at least paul thought so as he advanced towards them hat in hand they looked up at his approach but again cast down their eyes with demure shyness yet he fancied that they first exchanged glances with each other full of mischievous intelligence  i am your cousin paul he said smilingly though i am afraid i am introducing myself almost as briefly as your father just now excused himself to me he told me i would find you here but he himself was hastening on a samaritan mission  with a box in his hand said the girls simultaneously exchanging glances with each other again  with a box containing some restorative i think responded paul a little wonderingly  restorative so thats what he calls it now is it said one of the girls saucily well no one knows whats in the box though he always carries it with him thee never sees him without it  and a roll of paper suggested the other girl  yes a roll of paperbut one never knows what it is said the first speaker its very strange but no matter now paul welcome to hawthorn hall i am jane bunker and this is dorcas she stopped and then looking down demurely added thee may kiss us both cousin paul  the young man did not wait for a second invitation but gently touched his lips to their soft young cheeks  thee does not speak like an american paul is thee really and truly one continued jane  paul remembered that he had forgotten his dialect but it was too late now  i am really and truly one and your own cousin and i hope you will find me a very dear  oh said dorcas starting up primly you must really allow me to withdraw to the young mans astonishment she seized her parasol and with a youthful affectation of dignity glided from the summerhouse and was lost among the trees  thy declaration to me was rather sudden said jane quietly in answer to his look of surprise and dorcas is peculiarly sensitive and less like the worlds people than i am and it was just a little cruel considering that she has loved thee secretly all these years followed thy fortunes in america with breathless eagerness thrilled at thy narrow escapes and wept at thy privations  but she has never seen me before said the astounded paul  and thee had never seen me before and yet thee has dared to propose to me five minutes after thee arrived and in her presence  but my dear girl expostulated paul  stand off she said rapidly opening her parasol and interposing it between them another step neareray even another word of endearmentand i shall be compellednay forced she added in a lower voice to remove this parasol lest it should be crushed and ruined  i see he said gloomily you have been reading novels but so have i and the same ones nevertheless i intended only to tell you that i hoped you would always find me a kind friend  she shut her parasol up with a snap and i only intended to tell thee that my heart was given to another  you intendedand now  is it the kind friend who asks  if it were not  really  yes  ah  oh  but thee loves another she said toying with her cup  he attempted to toy with his but broke it a man lacks delicacy in this kind of persiflage you mean i am loved by another he said bluntly  you dare to say that she said flashing in spite of her prim demeanor  no but you did just now you said your sister loved me  did i she said dreamily dear dear thats the trouble of trying to talk like mr blanks delightful dialogues one gets so mixed  yet you will be a sister to me he said tis an old american joke but twill serve  there was a long silence  had thee not better go to sister dorcas she is playing with the cows said jane plaintively  you forget he returned gravely that on page 27 of the novel we have both read at this point he is supposed to kiss her  she had forgotten but they both remembered in time at this moment a scream came faintly from the distance they both started and rose  it is sister dorcas said jane sitting down again and pouring out another cup of tea i have always told her that one of those swiss cows would hook her  paul stared at her with a strange revulsion of feeling i could save dorcas he muttered to himself in less time than it takes to describe he paused however as he reflected that this would depend entirely upon the methods of the writer of this description i could rescue her i have only to take the first clothesline that i find and with that knowledge and skill with the lasso which i learned in the wilds of america i could stop the charge of the most furious ruminant i will and without another word he turned and rushed off in the direction of the sound    he had not gone a hundred yards before he paused a little bewildered to the left could still be seen the cobalt lake with the terraced background to the right the rugged mountains he chose the latter luckily for him a cottagers garden lay in his path and from a line supported by a single pole depended the homely linen of the cottager to tear these garments from the line was the work of a moment although it represented the whole weeks washing and hastily coiling the rope dexterously in his hand he sped onward already panting with exertion and excitement a few roods farther he was confronted with a spectacle that left him breathless  a womanyoung robust yet gracefully formedwas running ahead of him driving before her with an open parasol an animal which he instantly recognized as one of that simple yet treacherous species most feared by the sexknown as the moo cow  for a moment he was appalled by the spectacle but it was only for a moment recalling his manhood and her weakness he stopped and bracing his foot against a stone with a graceful flourish of his lasso around his head threw it in the air it uncoiled slowly sped forward with unerring precision and missed with the single cry of saved the fair stranger sank fainting in his arms he held her closely until the color came back to her pale face then he quietly disentangled the lasso from his legs  where am i she said faintly  in the same place he replied slowly but firmly but he added you have changed  she had indeed even to her dress it was now of a vivid brick red and so much longer in the skirt that it seemed to make her taller only her hat remained the same  yes she said in a low reflective voice and a disregard of her previous dialect as she gazed up in his eyes with an eloquent lucidity i have changed paul i feel myself changing at those words you uttered to jane there are moments in a womans life that man knows nothing of moments bitter and cruel sweet and merciful that change her whole being moments in which the simple girl becomes a worldly woman moments in which the slow procession of her years is never notedexcept by another woman moments that change her outlook on the world and her relations to itand her husbands relations moments when the maid becomes a wife the wife a widow the widow a remarried woman by a simple swift illumination of the fancy moments when wrought upon by a single worda lookan emphasis and rising inflection all logical sequence is cast away processes are lostinductions lead nowhere moments when the inharmonious becomes harmonious the indiscreet discreet the inefficient efficient and the inevitable evitable i mean she corrected herself hurriedlyyou know what i mean if you have not felt it you have read it  i have he said thoughtfully we have both read it in the same novel she is a fine writer  yees she hesitated with that slight resentment of praise of another woman so delightful in her sex but you have forgotten the moo cow and she pointed to where the distracted animal was careering across the lawn towards the garden  you are right he said the incident is not yet closed let us pursue it  they both pursued it discarding the useless lasso he had recourse to a few wellaimed epithets the infuriated animal swerved and made directly towards a small fountain in the centre of the garden in attempting to clear it it fell directly into the deep cuplike basin and remained helplessly fixed with its forelegs projecting uneasily beyond the rim  let us leave it there she said and forget itand all that has gone before believe me she added with a faint sigh it is best our paths diverge from this moment i go to the summerhouse and you go to the hall where my father is expecting you he would have detained her a moment longer but she glided away and was gone  left to himself again that slight sense of bewilderment which had clouded his mind for the last hour began to clear away his singular encounter with the girls strangely enough affected him less strongly than his brief and unsatisfactory interview with his uncle for after all he was his host and upon him depended his stay at hawthorn hall the mysterious and slighting allusions of his cousins to the old mans eccentricities also piqued his curiosity why had they sneered at his description of the contents of the package he carriedand what did it really contain he did not reflect that it was none of his businesspeople in his situation seldom doand he eagerly hurried towards the hall but he found in his preoccupation he had taken the wrong turning in the path and that he was now close to the wall which bounded and overlooked the highway here a singular spectacle presented itself a cyclist covered with dust was seated in the middle of the road trying to restore circulation to his bruised and injured leg by chafing it with his hands while beside him lay his damaged bicycle he had evidently met with an accident in an instant paul had climbed the wall and was at his side  can i offer you any assistance he asked eagerly  thanksno ive come a beastly cropper over something or other on this road and im only bruised though the machine has suffered worse replied the stranger in a fresh cheery voice he was a goodlooking fellow of about pauls own age and the young americans heart went out towards him  how did it happen asked paul  thats what puzzles me said the stranger i was getting out of the way of a queer old chap in the road and i ran over something that seemed only an old scroll of paper but the shock was so great that i was thrown and i fancy i was for a few moments unconscious yet i cannot see any other obstruction in the road and theres only that bit of paper he pointed to the papera halfcrushed roll of ordinary foolscap showing the mark of the bicycle upon it  a strange idea came into pauls mind he picked up the paper and examined it closely besides the mark already indicated it showed two sharp creases about nine inches long and another exactly at the point of the impact of the bicycle taking a folded twofoot rule from his pocket he carefully measured these parallel creases and made an exhaustive geometrical calculation with his pencil on the paper the stranger watched him with awed and admiring interest rising he again carefully examined the road and was finally rewarded by the discovery of a sharp indentation in the dust which on measurement and comparison with the creases in the paper and the calculations he had just made proved to be identical  there was a solid body in that paper said paul quietly a parallelogram exactly nine inches long and three wide  i say youre wonderfully clever dont you know said the stranger with unaffected wonder i see it alla brick  paul smiled gently and shook his head that is the hasty inference of an inexperienced observer you will observe at the point of impact of your wheel the parallel crease is curved as from the yielding of the resisting substances and not broken as it would be by the crumbling of a brick  i say youre awfully detective dont you know just like that fellowwhats his name said the stranger admiringly  the words recalled paul to himself why was he acting like a detective and what was he seeking to discover nevertheless he felt impelled to continue and that queer old chap whom you metwhy didnt he help you  because i passed him before i ran into thethe parallelogram and i suppose he didnt know what happened behind him  did he have anything in his hand  cant say  and you say you were unconscious afterwards  yes  long enough for the culprit to remove the principal evidence of his crime  come i say really you areyou know you are  have you any secret enemy  no  and you dont know mr bunker the man who owns this vast estate  not at all im from upper tooting  good afternoon said paul abruptly and turned away  it struck him afterwards that his action might have seemed uncivil and even inhuman to the bruised cyclist who could hardly walk but it was getting late and he was still far from the hall which oddly enough seemed to be no longer visible from the road he wandered on for some time half convinced that he had passed the lodge gates yet hoping to find some other entrance to the domain dusk was falling the rounded outlines of the park trees beyond the wall were solid masses of shadow the full moon presently rising restored them again to symmetry and at last he to his relief came upon the massive gateway two lions ramped in stone on the side pillars he thought it strange that he had not noticed the gateway on his previous entrance but he remembered that he was fully preoccupied with the advancing figure of his uncle in a few minutes the hall itself appeared and here again he was surprised that he had overlooked before its noble proportions and picturesque outline its broad terraces dazzlingly white in the moonlight its long line of mullioned windows suffused with a warm red glow from within made it look like part of a wintry landscapeand suggested a christmas card the venerable ivy that hid the ravages time had made in its walls looked like black carving his heart swelled with strange emotions as he gazed at his ancestral hall how many of his blood had lived and died there how many had gone forth from that great porch to distant lands he tried to think of his fathera little childpeeping between the balustrades of that terrace he tried to think of it and perhaps would have succeeded had it not occurred to him that it was a known fact that his uncle had bought the estate and house of an impoverished nobleman only the year before yethe could not tell whyhe seemed to feel higher and nobler for that trial  the terrace was deserted and so quiet that as he ascended to it his footsteps seemed to echo from the walls when he reached the portals the great oaken door swung noiselessly on its hingesopened by some unseen but waiting servitorand admitted him to a lofty hall dark with hangings and family portraits but warmed by a red carpet the whole length of its stone floor for a moment he waited for the servant to show him to the drawingroom or his uncles study but no one appeared believing this to be a part of the characteristic simplicity of the quaker household he boldly entered the first door and found himself in a brilliantly lit and perfectly empty drawingroom the same experience met him with the other rooms on that floorthe diningroom displaying an already set exquisitely furnished and decorated table with chairs for twenty guests he mechanically ascended the wide oaken staircase that led to the corridor of bedrooms above a central salon here he found only the same solitude bedroom doors yielded to his touch only to show the same brilliantly lit vacancy he presently came upon one room which seemed to give unmistakable signs of his own occupancy surely there stood his own dressingcase on the table and his own evening clothes carefully laid out on another as if fresh from a valets hands he stepped hastily into the corridorthere was no one there he rang the bellthere was no response but he noticed that there was a jug of hot water in his basin and he began dressing mechanically  there was little doubt that he was in a haunted house but this did not particularly disturb him indeed he found himself wondering if it could be logically called a haunted houseunless he himself was haunting it for there seemed to be no other there perhaps the apparitions would come later when he was dressed clearly it was not his uncles houseand yet as he had never been inside his uncles house he reflected that he ought not to be positive  he finished dressing and sat down in an armchair with a kind of thoughtful expectancy but presently his curiosity became impatient of the silence and mystery and he ventured once more to explore the house opening his bedroom door he found himself again upon the deserted corridor but this time he could distinctly hear a buzz of voices from the drawingroom below assured that he was near a solution of the mystery he rapidly descended the broad staircase and made his way to the open door of the drawingroom but although the sound of voices increased as he advanced when he entered the room to his utter astonishment it was as empty as before  yet in spite of his bewilderment and confusion he was able to follow one of the voices which in its peculiar distinctness and halfperfunctory tone he concluded must belong to the host of the invisible assembly  ah said the voice greeting some unseen visitor so glad you have come afraid your engagements just now would keep you away then the voice dropped to a lower and more confidential tone you must take down lady dartman but you will have miss morecampa clever girlon the other side of you ah sir george so good of you to come all well at the priory so glad to hear it lower and more confidentially you know mrs monkston youll sit by her a little cut up by her husband losing his seat try to amuse her  emboldened by desperation paul turned in the direction of the voice i am paul bunker he said hesitatingly im afraid youll think me intrusive but i was looking for my uncle and  intrusive my dear boy the son of my near neighbor in the country intrusive really now i like that grace the voice turned in another direction here is the american nephew of our neighbor bunker at widdlestone who thinks he is a stranger  we all knew of your expected arrival at widdlestoneit was so good of you to waive ceremony and join us said a wellbred feminine voice which paul at once assumed to belong to the hostess but i must find some one for your dinner partner mary here her voice was likewise turned away this is mr bunker the nephew of an old friend and neighbor in upshire the voice again turned to him you will take miss morecamp in my dear once again averted i must find some one else to console poor dear lord billingtree with here the hostesss voice was drowned by fresh arrivals  bewildered and confused as he was standing in this empty desert of a drawingroom yet encompassed on every side by human voices so marvelous was the power of suggestion he seemed to almost feel the impact of the invisible crowd he was trying desperately to realize his situation when a singularly fascinating voice at his elbow unexpectedly assisted him it was evidently his dinner partner  i suppose you must be tired after your journey when did you arrive  only a few hours ago said paul  and i dare say you havent slept since you arrived one doesnt on the passage you know the twenty hours pass so quickly and the experience is so excitingto us at least but i suppose as an american you are used to it  paul gasped he had passively accepted the bodiless conversation because it was at least intelligible but now was he going mad  she evidently noticed his silence never mind she continued you can tell me all about it at dinner do you know i always think that this sort of thingwhat were doing nowthis ridiculous formality of receptionwhich i suppose is after all only a concession to our english force of habitis absurd we ought to pass as it were directly from our houses to the dinnertable it saves time  yesnothat isim afraid i dont follow you stammered paul  there was a slight pout in her voice as she replied no matter nowwe must follow themfor our host is moving off with lady billingtree and its our turn now  so great was the illusion that he found himself mechanically offering his arm as he moved through the empty room towards the door then he descended the staircase without another word preceded however by the sound of his hosts voice following this as a blind man might he entered the diningroom which to his discomfiture was as empty as the salon above still following the hosts voice he dropped into a chair before the empty table wondering what variation of the barmecide feast was in store for him yet the hum of voices from the vacant chairs around the board so strongly impressed him that he could almost believe that he was actually at dinner  are you seated asked the charming voice at his side  yes a little wonderingly as his was the only seat visibly occupied  i am so glad that this silly ceremony is over by the way where are you  paul would have liked to answer lord only knows but he reflected that it might not sound polite where am i he feebly repeated  yes where are you dining  it seemed a cool question under the circumstances but he answered promptly  with you  of course said the charming voice but where are you eating your dinner  considering that he was not eating anything paul thought this cooler still but he answered briefly in upshire  oh at your uncles  no said paul bluntly in the next house  why thats sir williamsour hostsand he and his family are here in london you are joking  listen said paul desperately then in a voice unconsciously lowered he hurriedly told her where he washow he came therethe empty housethe viewless company to his surprise the only response was a musical little laugh but the next moment her voice rose higher with an unmistakable concern in it apparently addressing their invisible host  oh sir william only think how dreadful heres poor mr bunker alone in an empty house which he has mistaken for his unclesand without any dinner  really dear dear how provoking but how does he happen to be with us james how is this  if you please sir william said a servants respectful voice widdlestone is in the circuit and is switched on with the others we heard that a gentlemans luggage had arrived at widdlestone and we telegraphed for the rooms to be made ready thinking wed have her ladyships orders later  a single gleam of intelligence flashed upon paul his luggageyes had been sent from the station to the wrong house and he had unwittingly followed but these voices whence did they come and where was the actual dinner at which his host was presiding it clearly was not at this empty table  see that he has everything he wants at once said sir william there must be some one there then his voice turned in the direction of paul again and he said laughingly possess your soul and appetite in patience for a moment mr bunker you will be only a course behind us but we are lucky in having your companyeven at your own discomfort  still more bewildered paul turned to his invisible partner may i ask where you are dining  certainly at home in curzon street returned the pretty voice it was raining so i did not go out  andlord billington faltered paul  oh hes in scotlandat his own place  then in fact nobody is dining here at all said paul desperately  there was a slight pause and then the voice responded with a touch of startled suggestion in it good heavens mr bunker is it possible you dont know were dining by telephone  by what  telephone yes were a telephonic dinnerparty we are dining in our own houses but being all friends were switched on to each other and converse exactly as we would at table it saves a great trouble and expense for any one of us can give the party and the poorest can equal the most extravagant people who are obliged to diet can partake of their own slops at home and yet mingle with the gourmets without awkwardness or the necessity of apology we are spared the spectacle at least of those who eat and drink too much we can switch off a bore at once we can retire when we are fatigued without leaving a blank space before the others and all this without saying anything of the higher spiritual and intellectual effectfreed from material grossness of appetite and showwhich the dinner party thus attains but you are surely joking you an american and not know it why it comes from boston havent you read that book jumping a century its by an american  a strange illumination came upon paul where had he heard something like this before but at the same moment his thoughts were diverted by the material entrance of a footman bearing a silver salver with his dinner it was part of his singular experience that the visible entrance of this real commonplace mortalthe only one he had seenin the midst of this voiceless solitude was distinctly unreal and had all the effect of an apparition he distrusted it and the dishes before him but his lively partners voice was now addressing an unseen occupant of the next chair had she got tired of his ignorance or was it feminine tact to enable him to eat something he accepted the latter hypothesis and tried to eat but he felt himself following the fascinating voice in all the charm of its youthful and spiritual inflections taking advantage of its momentary silence he said gently  i confess my ignorance and am willing to admit all you claim for this wonderful invention but do you think it compensates for the loss of the individual person take my own caseif you will not think me personal i have never had the pleasure of seeing you do you believe that i am content with only that suggestion of your personality which the satisfaction of hearing your voice affords me  there was a pause and then a very mischievous ring in the voice that replied it certainly is a personal question and it is another blessing of this invention that youll never know whether i am blushing or not but i forgive you for i never before spoke to any one i had never seenand i suppose its confusion but do you really think you would know methe real oneany better it is the real person who thinks and speaks not the outward semblance that we see which very often unfairly either attracts or repels us we can always show ourselves at our best but we must at last reveal our true colors through our thoughts and speech isnt it better to begin with the real thing first  i hope at least to have the privilege of judging by myself said paul gallantly you will not be so cruel as not to let me see you elsewhere otherwise i shall feel as if i were in some dream and will certainly be opposed to your preference for realities  i am not certain if the dream would not be more interesting to you said the voice laughingly but i think your hostess is already saying goodby you know everybody goes at once at this kind of party the ladies dont retire first and the gentlemen join them afterwards in another moment well all be switched off but sir william wants me to tell you that his coachman will drive you to your uncles unless you prefer to try and make yourself comfortable for the night here goodby  the voices around him seemed to grow fainter and then utterly cease the lights suddenly leaped up went out and left him in complete darkness he attempted to rise but in doing so overset the dishes before him which slid to the floor a cold air seemed to blow across his feet the goodby was still ringing in his ears as he straightened himself to find he was in his railway carriage whose door had just been opened for a young lady who was entering the compartment from a wayside station goodby she repeated to the friend who was seeing her off the writer of stories hurriedly straightened himself gathered up the magazines and papers that had fallen from his lap and glanced at the station walls the old illustrations glanced back at him he looked at his watch he had been asleep just ten minutes     bohemian days in san francisco   it is but just to the respectable memory of san francisco that in these vagrant recollections i should deprecate at once any suggestion that the levity of my title described its dominant tone at any period of my early experiences on the contrary it was a singular fact that while the rest of california was swayed by an easy careless unconventionalism or swept over by waves of emotion and sentiment san francisco preserved an intensely material and practical attitude and even a certain austere morality i do not of course allude to the brief days of 49 when it was a straggling beach of huts and stranded hulks but to the earlier stages of its development into the metropolis of california its first tottering steps in that direction were marked by a distinct gravity and decorum even during the period when the revolver settled small private difficulties and vigilance committees adjudicated larger public ones an unmistakable seriousness and respectability was the ruling sign of its governing class it was not improbable that under the reign of the committee the lawless and vicious class were more appalled by the moral spectacle of several thousand blackcoated seriousminded business men in embattled procession than by mere force of arms and one suspecta prizefighteris known to have committed suicide in his cell after confrontation with his grave and passionless shopkeeping judges even that peculiar quality of californian humor which was apt to mitigate the extravagances of the revolver and the uncertainties of poker had no place in the decorous and responsible utterance of san francisco the press was sober materialistic practicalwhen it was not severely admonitory of existing evil the few smaller papers that indulged in levity were considered libelous and improper fancy was displaced by heavy articles on the revenues of the state and inducements to the investment of capital local news was under an implied censorship which suppressed anything that might tend to discourage timid or cautious capital episodes of romantic lawlessness or pathetic incidents of mining life were carefully editedwith the comment that these things belonged to the past and that life and property were now as safe in san francisco as in new york or london  wonderloving visitors in quest of scenes characteristic of the civilization were coldly snubbed with this assurance fires floods and even seismic convulsions were subjected to a like grimly materialistic optimism i have a vivid recollection of a ponderous editorial on one of the severer earthquakes in which it was asserted that only the unexpectedness of the onset prevented san francisco from meeting it in a way that would be deterrent of all future attacks the unconsciousness of the humor was only equaled by the gravity with which it was received by the whole business community strangely enough this grave materialism flourished side by side withand was even sustained bya narrow religious strictness more characteristic of the pilgrim fathers of a past century than the western pioneers of the present san francisco was early a city of churches and church organizations to which the leading men and merchants belonged the lax sundays of the dying spanish race seemed only to provoke a revival of the rigors of the puritan sabbath with the spaniard and his sunday afternoon bullfight scarcely an hour distant the san francisco pulpit thundered against sunday picnics one of the popular preachers declaiming upon the practice of sunday dinnergiving averred that when he saw a guest in his best sunday clothes standing shamelessly upon the doorstep of his host he felt like seizing him by the shoulder and dragging him from that threshold of perdition  against the actual heathen the feeling was even stronger and reached its climax one sunday when a chinaman was stoned to death by a crowd of children returning from sundayschool i am offering these examples with no ethical purpose but merely to indicate a singular contradictory condition which i do not think writers of early californian history have fairly recorded it is not my province to suggest any theory for these appalling exceptions to the usual goodhumored lawlessness and extravagance of the rest of the state they may have been essential agencies to the growth and evolution of the city they were undoubtedly sincere the impressions i propose to give of certain scenes and incidents of my early experience must therefore be taken as purely personal and bohemian and their selection as equally individual and vagrant i am writing of what interested me at the time though not perhaps of what was more generally characteristic of san francisco  i had been there a weekan idle week spent in listless outlook for employment a full week in my eager absorption of the strange life around me and a photographic sensitiveness to certain scenes and incidents of those days which start out of my memory today as freshly as the day they impressed me  one of these recollections is of steamer night as it was calledthe night of steamer daypreceding the departure of the mail steamship with the mails for home indeed at that time san francisco may be said to have lived from steamer day to steamer day bills were made due on that day interest computed to that period and accounts settled the next day was the turning of a new leaf another essay to fortune another inspiration of energy so recognized was the fact that even ordinary changes of condition social and domestic were put aside until after steamer day ill see what i can do after next steamer day was the common cautious or hopeful formula it was the saturday night of many a wageearnerand to him a night of festivity the thoroughfares were animated and crowded the saloons and theatres full i can recall myself at such times wandering along the city front as the business part of san francisco was then known here the lights were burning all night the first streaks of dawn finding the merchants still at their countinghouse desks i remember the dim lines of warehouses lining the insecure wharves of rotten piles half filled inthat had ceased to be wharves but had not yet become streetstheir treacherous yawning depths with the uncertain gleam of tarlike mud below at times still vocal with the lap and gurgle of the tide i remember the weird stories of disappearing men found afterward imbedded in the ooze in which they had fallen and gasped their life away i remember the two or three ships still left standing where they were beached a year or two before built in between warehouses their bows projecting into the roadway there was the dignity of the sea and its boundless freedom in their beautiful curves which the abutting houses could not destroy and even something of the seas loneliness in the farspaced ports and cabin windows lit up by the lamps of the prosaic landsmen who plied their trades behind them one of these ships transformed into a hotel retained its name the niantic and part of its characteristic interior unchanged i remember these ships old tenantsthe ratswho had increased and multiplied to such an extent that at night they fearlessly crossed the wayfarers path at every turn and even invaded the gilded saloons of montgomery street in the niantic their pitapat was met on every staircase and it was said that sometimes in an excess of sociability they accompanied the traveler to his room in the early clothandpapered housesso called because the ceilings were not plastered but simply covered by stretched and whitewashed cloththeir scamperings were plainly indicated in zigzag movements of the sagging cloth or they became actually visible by finally dropping through the holes they had worn in it i remember the house whose foundations were made of boxes of plug tobaccopart of a jettisoned cargoused instead of more expensive lumber and the adjacent warehouse where the trunks of the early and forgotten fortyniners were stored andnever claimed by their dead or missing ownerswere finally sold at auction i remember the strong breath of the sea over all and the constant onset of the trade winds which helped to disinfect the deposit of dirt and grime decay and wreckage which were stirred up in the later evolutions of the city  or i recall with the same sense of youthful satisfaction and unabated wonder my wanderings through the spanish quarter where three centuries of quaint customs speech and dress were still preserved where the proverbs of sancho panza were still spoken in the language of cervantes and the highflown illusions of the la manchian knight still a part of the spanish californian hidalgos dream i recall the more modern greaser or mexicanhis index finger steeped in cigarette stains his velvet jacket and his crimson sash the manyflounced skirt and lace manta of his women and their caressing intonationsthe one musical utterance of the whole hardvoiced city i suppose i had a boys digestion and bluntness of taste in those days for the combined odor of tobacco burned paper and garlic which marked that melodious breath did not affect me  perhaps from my puritan training i experienced a more fearful joy in the gambling saloons they were the largest and most comfortable even as they were the most expensively decorated rooms in san francisco here again the gravity and decorum which i have already alluded to were present at that earlier periodthough perhaps from concentration of another kind people staked and lost their last dollar with a calm solemnity and a resignation that was almost christian the oaths exclamations and feverish interruptions which often characterized more dignified assemblies were absent here there was no room for the lesser vices there was little or no drunkenness the gaudily dressed and painted women who presided over the wheels of fortune or performed on the harp and piano attracted no attention from those ascetic players the man who had won ten thousand dollars and the man who had lost everything rose from the table with equal silence and imperturbability i never witnessed any tragic sequel to those losses i never heard of any suicide on account of them neither can i recall any quarrel or murder directly attributable to this kind of gambling it must be remembered that these public games were chiefly rouge et noir monte faro or roulette in which the antagonist was fate chance method or the impersonal bank which was supposed to represent them all there was no individual opposition or rivalry nobody challenged the decision of the croupier or dealer  i remember a conversation at the door of one saloon which was as characteristic for its brevity as it was a type of the prevailing stoicism hello said a departing miner as he recognized a brother miner coming in when did you come down this morning was the reply made a strike on the bar suggested the first speaker you bet said the other and passed in i chanced an hour later to be at the same place as they met againtheir relative positions changed hello whar now said the incomer back to the bar cleaned out you bet not a word more explained a common situation  my first youthful experience at those tables was an accidental one i was watching roulette one evening intensely absorbed in the mere movement of the players either they were so preoccupied with the game or i was really older looking than my actual years but a bystander laid his hand familiarly on my shoulder and said as to an ordinary habitue ef youre not chippin in yourself pardner spose you give me a show now i honestly believe that up to that moment i had no intention nor even a desire to try my own fortune but in the embarrassment of the sudden address i put my hand in my pocket drew out a coin and laid it with an attempt at carelessness but a vivid consciousness that i was blushing upon a vacant number to my horror i saw that i had put down a large cointhe bulk of my possessions i did not flinch however i think any boy who reads this will understand my feeling it was not only my coin but my manhood at stake i gazed with a miserable show of indifference at the players at the chandelieranywhere but at the dreadful ball spinning round the wheel there was a pause the game was declared the rake rattled up and down but still i did not look at the table indeed in my inexperience of the game and my embarrassment i doubt if i should have known if i had won or not i had made up my mind that i should lose but i must do so like a man and above all without giving the least suspicion that i was a greenhorn i even affected to be listening to the music the wheel spun again the game was declared the rake was busy but i did not move at last the man i had displaced touched me on the arm and whispered better make a straddle and divide your stake this time i did not understand him but as i saw he was looking at the board i was obliged to look too i drew back dazed and bewildered where my coin had lain a moment before was a glittering heap of gold  my stake had doubled quadrupled and doubled again i did not know how much theni do not know nowit may have been not more than three or four hundred dollarsbut it dazzled and frightened me make your game gentlemen said the croupier monotonously i thought he looked at meindeed everybody seemed to be looking at meand my companion repeated his warning but here i must again appeal to the boyish reader in defense of my idiotic obstinacy to have taken advice would have shown my youth i shook my headi could not trust my voice i smiled but with a sinking heart and let my stake remain the ball again sped round the wheel and stopped there was a pause the croupier indolently advanced his rake and swept my whole pile with others into the bank i had lost it all perhaps it may be difficult for me to explain why i actually felt relieved and even to some extent triumphant but i seemed to have asserted my grownup independencepossibly at the cost of reducing the number of my meals for days but what of that i was a man i wish i could say that it was a lesson to me i am afraid it was not it was true that i did not gamble again but then i had no especial desire toand there was no temptation i am afraid it was an incident without a moral yet it had one touch characteristic of the period which i like to remember the man who had spoken to me i think suddenly realized at the moment of my disastrous coup the fact of my extreme youth he moved toward the banker and leaning over him whispered a few words the banker looked up half impatiently half kindlyhis hand straying tentatively toward the pile of coin i instinctively knew what he meant and summoning my determination met his eyes with all the indifference i could assume and walked away  i had at that period a small room at the top of a house owned by a distant relationa second or third cousin i think he was a man of independent and original character had a ulyssean experience of men and cities and an old english name of which he was proud while in london he had procured from the heralds college his family arms whose crest was stamped upon a quantity of plate he had brought with him to california the plate together with an exceptionally good cook which he had also brought and his own epicurean tastes he utilized in the usual practical californian fashion by starting a rather expensive halfclub halfrestaurant in the lower part of the buildingwhich he ruled somewhat autocratically as became his crest the restaurant was too expensive for me to patronize but i saw many of its frequenters as well as those who had rooms at the club they were men of very distinct personality a few celebrated and nearly all notorious they represented a bohemianismif such it could be calledless innocent than my later experiences i remember however one handsome young fellow whom i used to meet occasionally on the staircase who captured my youthful fancy i met him only at midday as he did not rise till late and this fact with a certain scrupulous elegance and neatness in his dress ought to have made me suspect that he was a gambler in my inexperience it only invested him with a certain romantic mystery  one morning as i was going out to my very early breakfast at a cheap italian cafe on long wharf i was surprised to find him also descending the staircase he was scrupulously dressed even at that early hour but i was struck by the fact that he was all in black and his slight figure buttoned to the throat in a tightly fitting frock coat gave i fancied a singular melancholy to his pale southern face nevertheless he greeted me with more than his usual serene cordiality and i remembered that he looked up with a halfpuzzled halfamused expression at the rosy morning sky as he walked a few steps with me down the deserted street i could not help saying that i was astonished to see him up so early and he admitted that it was a break in his usual habits but added with a smiling significance i afterwards remembered that it was an even chance if he did it again as we neared the street corner a man in a buggy drove up impatiently in spite of the drivers evident haste my handsome acquaintance got in leisurely and lifting his glossy hat to me with a pleasant smile was driven away i have a very lasting recollection of his face and figure as the buggy disappeared down the empty street i never saw him again it was not until a week later that i knew that an hour after he left me that morning he was lying dead in a little hollow behind the mission doloresshot through the heart in a duel for which he had risen so early  i recall another incident of that period equally characteristic but happily less tragic in sequel i was in the restaurant one morning talking to my cousin when a man entered hastily and said something to him in a hurried whisper my cousin contracted his eyebrows and uttered a suppressed oath then with a gesture of warning to the man he crossed the room quietly to a table where a regular habitue of the restaurant was lazily finishing his breakfast a large silver coffeepot with a stiff wooden handle stood on the table before him my cousin leaned over the guest familiarly and apparently made some hospitable inquiry as to his wants with his hand resting lightly on the coffeepot handle thenpossibly because my curiosity having been excited i was watching him more intently than the othersi saw what probably no one else sawthat he deliberately upset the coffeepot and its contents over the guests shirt and waistcoat as the victim sprang up with an exclamation my cousin overwhelmed him with apologies for his carelessness and with protestations of sorrow for the accident actually insisted upon dragging the man upstairs into his own private room where he furnished him with a shirt and waistcoat of his own the side door had scarcely closed upon them and i was still lost in wonder at what i had seen when a man entered from the street he was one of the desperate set i have already spoken of and thoroughly well known to those present he cast a glance around the room nodded to one or two of the guests and then walked to a side table and took up a newspaper i was conscious at once that a singular constraint had come over the other guestsa nervous awkwardness that at last seemed to make itself known to the man himself who after an affected yawn or two laid down the paper and walked out  that was a mighty close call said one of the guests with a sigh of relief  you bet and that coffeepot spill was the luckiest kind of accident for peters returned another  for both added the first speaker for peters was armed too and would have seen him come in  a word or two explained all peters and the last comer had quarreled a day or two before and had separated with the intention to shoot on sight that is wherever they meta form of duel common to those days the accidental meeting in the restaurant would have been the occasion with the usual sanguinary consequence but for the word of warning given to my cousin by a passerby who knew that peters antagonist was coming to the restaurant to look at the papers had my cousin repeated the warning to peters himself he would only have prepared him for the conflictwhich he would not have shirkedand so precipitated the affray  the ruse of upsetting the coffeepot which everybody but myself thought an accident was to get him out of the room before the other entered i was too young then to venture to intrude upon my cousins secrets but two or three years afterwards i taxed him with the trick and he admitted it regretfully i believe that a strict interpretation of the code would have condemned his act as unsportsmanlike if not unfair  i recall another incident connected with the building equally characteristic of the period the united states branch mint stood very near it and its tall factorylike chimneys overshadowed my cousins roof some scandal had arisen from an alleged leakage of gold in the manipulation of that metal during the various processes of smelting and refining one of the excuses offered was the volatilization of the precious metal and its escape through the draft of the tall chimneys all san francisco laughed at this explanation until it learned that a corroboration of the theory had been established by an assay of the dust and grime of the roofs in the vicinity of the mint these had yielded distinct traces of gold san francisco stopped laughing and that portion of it which had roofs in the neighborhood at once began prospecting claims were staked out on these airy placers and my cousins roof being the very next one to the chimney and presumably in the lead was disposed of to a speculative company for a considerable sum i remember my cousin telling me the storyfor the occurrence was quite recentand taking me with him to the roof to explain it but i am afraid i was more attracted by the mystery of the closely guarded building and the strangely tinted smoke which arose from this temple where money was actually being made than by anything else nor did i dream as i stood therea very lanky openmouthed youththat only three or four years later i should be the secretary of its superintendent in my more adventurous ambition i am afraid i would have accepted the suggestion halfheartedly merely to have helped to stamp the gold which other people had adventurously found was by no means a part of my youthful dreams  at the time of these earlier impressions the chinese had not yet become the recognized factors in the domestic and business economy of the city which they had come to be when i returned from the mines three years later yet they were even then a more remarkable and picturesque contrast to the bustling breathless and brandnew life of san francisco than the spaniard the latter seldom flaunted his faded dignity in the principal thoroughfares john was to be met everywhere it was a common thing to see a long file of sampan coolies carrying their baskets slung between them on poles jostling a modern welldressed crowd in montgomery street or to get a whiff of their burned punk in the side streets while the road leading to their temporary burialground at lone mountain was littered with slips of colored paper scattered from their funerals they brought an atmosphere of the arabian nights into the hard modern civilization their shopsnot always confined at that time to a chinese quarterwere replicas of the bazaars of canton and peking with their quaint display of little dishes on which tidbits of food delicacies were exposed for sale all of the dimensions and unreality of a dolls kitchen or a childs housekeeping  they were a revelation to the eastern immigrant whose preconceived ideas of them were borrowed from the ballet or pantomime they did not wear scalloped drawers and hats with jingling bells on their points nor did i ever see them dance with their forefingers vertically extended they were always neatly dressed even the commonest of coolies and their festive dresses were marvels as traders they were grave and patient as servants they were sad and civil and all were singularly infantine in their natural simplicity the living representatives of the oldest civilization in the world they seemed like children yet they kept their beliefs and sympathies to themselves never fraternizing with the fanqui or foreign devil or losing their singular racial qualities they indulged in their own peculiar habits of their social and inner life san francisco knew but little and cared less even at this early period and before i came to know them more intimately i remember an incident of their daring fidelity to their own customs that was accidentally revealed to me i had become acquainted with a chinese youth of about my own age as i imaginedalthough from mere outward appearance it was generally impossible to judge of a chinamans age between the limits of seventeen and forty yearsand he had in a burst of confidence taken me to see some characteristic sights in a chinese warehouse within a stones throw of the plaza i was struck by the singular circumstance that while the warehouse was an erection of wood in the ordinary hasty californian style there were certain brick and stone divisions in its interior like small rooms or closets evidently added by the chinamen tenants my companion stopped before a long very narrow entrance a mere longitudinal slit in the brick wall and with a wink of infantine deviltry motioned me to look inside i did so and saw a room really a cell of fair height but scarcely six feet square and barely able to contain a rude slanting couch of stone covered with matting on which lay at a painful angle a richly dressed chinaman a single glance at his dull staring abstracted eyes and halfopened mouth showed me he was in an opium trance this was not in itself a novel sight and i was moving away when i was suddenly startled by the appearance of his hands which were stretched helplessly before him on his body and at first sight seemed to be in a kind of wicker cage  i then saw that his fingernails were seven or eight inches long and were supported by bamboo splints indeed they were no longer human nails but twisted and distorted quills giving him the appearance of having gigantic claws velly big chinaman whispered my cheerful friend firstchop manhigh classeeno can washeeno can eatno dlinke no catchee him own glub allee same nothee manchina boy must catchee glub for him allee time oh him firstchop manyou bettee  i had heard of this singular custom of indicating caste before and was amazed and disgusted but i was not prepared for what followed my companion evidently thinking he had impressed me grew more reckless as showman and saying to me now me showee you one funny thingheap makee you laugh led me hurriedly across a little courtyard swarming with chickens and rabbits when he stopped before another inclosure suddenly brushing past an astonished chinaman who seemed to be standing guard he thrust me into the inclosure in front of a most extraordinary object it was a chinaman wearing a huge square wooden frame fastened around his neck like a collar and fitting so tightly and rigidly that the flesh rose in puffy weals around his cheeks he was chained to a post although it was as impossible for him to have escaped with his wooden cage through the narrow doorway as it was for him to lie down and rest in it yet i am bound to say that his eyes and face expressed nothing but apathy and there was no appeal to the sympathy of the stranger my companion said hurriedly  velly bad man stealee heap from chinamen and then apparently alarmed at his own indiscreet intrusion hustled me away as quickly as possible amid a shrill cackling of protestation from a few of his own countrymen who had joined the one who was keeping guard in another moment we were in the street againscarce a step from the plaza in the full light of western civilizationnot a stones throw from the courts of justice  my companion took to his heels and left me standing there bewildered and indignant i could not rest until i had told my story but without betraying my companion to an elder acquaintance who laid the facts before the police authorities i had expected to be closely crossexaminedto be doubtedto be disbelieved to my surprise i was told that the police had already cognizance of similar cases of illegal and barbarous punishments but that the victims themselves refused to testify against their countrymenand it was impossible to convict or even to identify them a white man cant tell one chinese from another and there are always a dozen of em ready to swear that the man youve got isnt the one i was startled to reflect that i too could not have conscientiously sworn to either jailor or the tortured prisoneror perhaps even to my cheerful companion the police on some pretext made a raid upon the premises a day or two afterwards but without result i wondered if they had caught sight of the highclass firstchop individual with the helplessly outstretched fingers as that story i had kept to myself  but these barbaric vestiges in john chinamans habits did not affect his relations with the san franciscans he was singularly peaceful docile and harmless as a servant and with rare exceptions honest and temperate if he sometimes matched cunning with cunning it was the flattery of imitation he did most of the menial work of san francisco and did it cleanly except that he exhaled a peculiar druglike odor he was not personally offensive in domestic contact and by virtue of being the recognized laundryman of the whole community his own blouses were always freshly washed and ironed his conversational reserve arose not from his having to deal with an unfamiliar languagefor he had picked up a picturesque and varied vocabulary with easebut from his natural temperament he was devoid of curiosity and utterly unimpressed by anything but the purely business concerns of those he served domestic secrets were safe with him his indifference to your thoughts actions and feelings had all the contempt which his three thousand years of history and his innate belief in your inferiority seemed to justify he was blind and deaf in your household because you didnt interest him in the least it was said that a gentleman who wished to test his impassiveness arranged with his wife to come home one day and in the hearing of his chinese waiter who was more than usually intelligentto disclose with wellsimulated emotion the details of a murder he had just committed he did so the chinaman heard it without a sign of horror or attention even to the lifting of an eyelid but continued his duties unconcerned unfortunately the gentleman in order to increase the horror of the situation added that now there was nothing left for him but to cut his throat at this john quietly left the room the gentleman was delighted at the success of his ruse until the door reopened and john reappeared with his masters razor which he quietly slippedas if it had been a forgotten forkbeside his masters plate and calmly resumed his serving i have always considered this story to be quite as improbable as it was inartistic from its tacit admission of a certain interest on the part of the chinaman i never knew one who would have been sufficiently concerned to go for the razor  his taciturnity and reticence may have been confounded with rudeness of address although he was always civil enough i see you have listened to me and done exactly what i told you said a lady commending some performance of her servant after a previous lengthy lecture thats very nice yes said john calmly you talkee allee time talkee allee too much i always find ling very polite said another lady speaking of her cook but i wish he did not always say to me goodnight john in a high falsetto voice she had not recognized the fact that he was simply repeating her own salutation with his marvelous instinct of relentless imitation even as to voice i hesitate to record the endless stories of his misapplication of that faculty which were then current from the one of the laundryman who removed the buttons from the shirts that were sent to him to wash that they might agree with the condition of the one offered him as a pattern for doing up to that of the unfortunate employer who while showing john how to handle valuable china carefully had the misfortune to drop a plate himselfan accident which was followed by the prompt breaking of another by the neophyte with the addition of oh hellee in humble imitation of his master  i have spoken of his general cleanliness i am reminded of one or two exceptions which i think however were errors of zeal his manner of sprinkling clothes in preparing them for ironing was peculiar he would fill his mouth with perfectly pure water from a glass beside him and then by one dexterous movement of his lips in a prolonged expiration squirt the water in an almost invisible misty shower on the article before him shocking as this was at first to the sensibilities of many american employers it was finally accepted and even commended it was some time after this that the mistress of a household admiring the deft way in which her cook had spread a white sauce on certain dishes was cheerfully informed that the method was allee same  his recreations at that time were chiefly gambling for the chinese theatre wherein the latter produced his plays which lasted for several months and comprised the events of a whole dynasty was not yet built but he had one or two companies of jugglers who occasionally performed also at american theatres i remember a singular incident which attended the debut of a newly arrived company it seemed that the company had been taken on their chinese reputation solely and there had been no previous rehearsal before the american stage manager the theatre was filled with an audience of decorous and respectable san franciscans of both sexes it was suddenly emptied in the middle of the performance the curtain came down with an alarmed and blushing manager apologizing to deserted benches and the show abruptly terminated exactly what had happened never appeared in the public papers nor in the published apology of the manager it afforded a few days mirth for wicked san francisco and it was epigrammatically summed up in the remark that no woman could be found in san francisco who was at that performance and no man who was not yet it was alleged even by johns worst detractors that he was innocent of any intended offense equally innocent but perhaps more morally instructive was an incident that brought his career as a singularly successful physician to a disastrous close an ordinary native chinese doctor practicing entirely among his own countrymen was reputed to have made extraordinary cures with two or three american patients with no other advertising than this and apparently no other inducement offered to the public than what their curiosity suggested he was presently besieged by hopeful and eager sufferers hundreds of patients were turned away from his crowded doors two interpreters sat day and night translating the ills of ailing san francisco to this medical oracle and dispensing his prescriptionsusually small powdersin exchange for current coin in vain the regular practitioners pointed out that the chinese possessed no superior medical knowledge and that their religion which proscribed dissection and autopsies naturally limited their understanding of the body into which they put their drugs finally they prevailed upon an eminent chinese authority to give them a list of the remedies generally used in the chinese pharmacopoeia and this was privately circulated for obvious reasons i may not repeat it here but it was summed upagain after the usual californian epigrammatic styleby the remark that whatever were the comparative merits of chinese and american practice a simple perusal of the list would prove that the chinese were capable of producing the most powerful emetic known the craze subsided in a single day the interpreters and their oracle vanished the chinese doctors signs which had multiplied disappeared and san francisco awoke cured of its madness at the cost of some thousand dollars  my bohemian wanderings were confined to the limits of the city for the very good reason that there was little elsewhere to go san francisco was then bounded on one side by the monotonously restless waters of the bay and on the other by a stretch of equally restless and monotonously shifting sand dunes as far as the pacific shore two roads penetrated this waste one to lone mountainthe cemetery the other to the cliff househappily described as an eightmile drive with a cocktail at the end of it nor was the humor entirely confined to this felicitous description the cliff house itself half restaurant half drinking saloon fronting the ocean and the seal rock where disporting seals were the chief object of interest had its own peculiar symbol the decanters wineglasses and tumblers at the bar were all engraved in old english script with the legal initials l s locus sigillithe place of the seal  on the other hand lone mountain a dreary promontory giving upon the golden gate and its striking sunsets had little to soften its weird suggestiveness as the common goal of the successful and unsuccessful the carved and lettered shaft of the man who had made a name and the staring blank headboard of the man who had none climbed the sandy slopes together i have seen the funerals of the respectable citizen who had died peacefully in his bed and the notorious desperado who had died with his boots on followed by an equally impressive cortege of sorrowing friends and often the selfsame priest but more awful than its barren loneliness was the utter absence of peacefulness and rest in this dismal promontory by some wicked irony of its situation and climate it was the personification of unrest and change the incessant trade winds carried its loose sands hither and thither uncovering the decaying coffins of early pioneers to bury the wreaths and flowers laid on a grave of today under their obliterating waves no tree to shade them from the glaring sky above could live in those winds no turf would lie there to resist the encroaching sand below the dead were harried and hustled even in their graves by the persistent sun the unremitting wind and the unceasing sea the departing mourner saw the contour of the very mountain itself change with the shifting dunes as he passed and his last look beyond rested on the hurrying eager waves forever hastening to the golden gate  if i were asked to say what one thing impressed me as the dominant and characteristic note of san francisco i should say it was this untiring presence of sun and wind and sea they typified even if they were not as i sometimes fancied the actual incentive to the fierce restless life of the city i could not think of san francisco without the trade winds i could not imagine its strange incongruous multigenerous procession marching to any other music they were always there in my youthful recollections they were there in my more youthful dreams of the past as the mysterious vientes generales that blew the philippine galleons home  for six months they blew from the northwest for six months from the southwest with unvarying persistency they were there every morning glittering in the equally persistent sunlight to chase the san franciscan from his slumber they were there at midday to stir his pulses with their beat they were there again at night to hurry him through the bleak and flaring gaslit streets to bed they left their mark on every windward street or fence or gable on the outlying sand dunes they lashed the slow coasters home and hurried them to sea again they whipped the bay into turbulence on their way to contra costa whose level shoreland oaks they had trimmed to windward as cleanly and sharply as with a pruningshears untiring themselves they allowed no laggards they drove the san franciscan from the wall against which he would have leaned from the scant shade in which at noontide he might have rested they turned his smallest fires into conflagrations and kept him ever alert watchful and eager in return they scavenged his city and held it clean and wholesome in summer they brought him the soft seafog for a few hours to soothe his abraded surfaces in winter they brought the rains and dashed the whole coastline with flowers and the staring sky above it with soft unwonted clouds they were always therestrong vigilant relentless material unyielding triumphant
