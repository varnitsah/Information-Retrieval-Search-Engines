22449538	the prairie chief by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the alarm  whitewing was a red indian of the north american prairies  though not a chief of the highest standing he was a very great man in the estimation of his tribe for besides being possessed of qualities which are highly esteemed among all savagessuch as courage strength agility and the likehe was a deep thinker and held speculative views in regard to the great manitou god as well as the ordinary affairs of life which perplexed even the oldest men of his tribe and induced the younger men to look on him as a profound mystery  indeed the feelings of the latter towards whitewing amounted almost to veneration for while on the one hand he was noted as one of the most fearless among the braves and a daring assailant of that king of the northern wilderness the grizzly bear he was on the other hand modest and retiringnever boasted of his prowess disbelieved in the principle of revenge which to most savages is not only a pleasure but a duty and refused to decorate his sleeves or leggings with the scalplocks of his enemies  indeed he had been known to allow more than one enemy to escape from his hand in time of war when he might easily have killed him  altogether whitewing was a monstrous puzzle to his fellows and much beloved by many of them  the only ornament which he allowed himself was the white wing of a ptarmigan  hence his name  this symbol of purity was bound to his forehead by a band of red cloth wrought with the quills of the porcupine  it had been made for him by a darkeyed girl whose name was an indian word signifying light heart  but let it not be supposed that lighthearts head was like her heart  on the contrary she had a good sound brain and although much given to laughter jest and raillery among her female friends would listen with unflagging patience and profound solemnity to her lovers soliloquies in reference to things past present and to come  one of the peculiarities of whitewing was that he did not treat women as mere slaves or inferior creatures  his own mother a wrinkled brown old thing resembling a piece of singed shoeleather he loved with a tenderness not usual in north american indians some tribes of whom have a tendency to forsake their aged ones and leave them to perish rather than be burdened with them  whitewing also thought that his betrothed was fit to hold intellectual converse with him in which idea he was not far wrong  at the time we introduce him to the reader he was on a visit to the indian camp of lighthearts tribe in clearvale for the purpose of claiming his bride  his own tribe of which the celebrated old warrior bald eagle was chief dwelt in a valley at a considerable distance from the camp referred to  there were two other visitors at the indian camp at that time  one was a wesleyan missionary who had penetrated to that remote region with a longing desire to carry the glad tidings of salvation in jesus to the red men of the prairie  the other was a nondescript little white trapper who may be aptly described as a mass of contradictions  he was small in stature but amazingly strong ugly oneeyed scarred in the face and misshapen yet wonderfully attractive because of a sweet smile a hearty manner and a kindly disposition  with the courage of the lion little tim as he was styled combined the agility of the monkey and the laziness of the sloth  strange to say tim and whitewing were bosom friends although they differed in opinion on most things  the white man speaks again about manitou today said the indian referring to the missionarys intention to preach as he and little tim concluded their midday meal in the wigwam that had been allotted to them  its little i cares for that replied tim curtly as he lighted the pipe with which he always wound up every meal  of course both men spoke in the indian language but that being probably unknown to the reader we will try to convey in english as nearly as possible the slightly poetical tone of the one and the rough backwoods style of the other  it seems strange to me returned the indian that my white brother thinks and cares so little about his manitou  he thinks much of his gun and his traps and his skins and his powder and his friend but cares not for manitou who gave him all theseall that he possesses  look ee here whitewing returned the trapper in his matteroffact way theres nothing strange about it  i see you and i see my gun and these other things and can handle em but i dont know nothin about manitou and i dont see him so whats the good o thinkin about him  instead of answering the red man looked silently and wistfully up into the blue sky which could be seen through the raised curtain of the wigwam  then pointing to the landscape before them he said in subdued but earnest tones i see him in the cloudsin the sun and moon and stars in the prairies and in the mountains i hear him in the singing waters and in the winds that scatter the leaves and i feel him here  whitewing laid his hand on his breast and looked in his friends face  but he continued sadly i do not understand him he whispers so softly that though i hear i cannot comprehend  i wonder why this is so  ay thats just it whitewing said the trapper  we cant make it out nohow an so i just leaves all that sort o thing to the parsons and give my mind to the things that i understand  when little tim was a very small boy said the indian after a few minutes meditation did he understand how to trap the beaver and the martin and how to point the rifle so as to carry death to the grizzly bear  of course not returned the trapper seems to me that thats a foolish question  but continued the indian you came to know it at last  i should just think i did returned the trapper a look of selfsatisfied pride crossing his scarred visage as he thought of the celebrity as a hunter to which he had attained  it took me a goodish while of course to circumvent it all but in time i got to bewell you know what an im not fond o blowin my own trumpet  yes you came to it at last repeated whitewing by giving your mind to things that at first you did not understand  come come my friend said little tim with a laugh im no match for you in argiment but as i said before i dont understand manitou an i dont see or feel or hear him so its of no use tryin  what my friend knows not another may tell him said whitewing  the white man says he knows manitou and brings a message from him  three times i have listened to his words  they seem the words of truth  i go again today to hear his message  the indian stood up as he spoke and the trapper also rose  well well he said knocking the ashes out of his pipe ill go too though im afeared it wont be o much use  the sermon which the man of god preached that day to the indians was neither long nor profound but it was delivered with the intense earnestness of one who thoroughly believes every word he utters and feels that life and death may be trembling in the balance with those who listen  it is not our purpose to give this sermon in detail but merely to show its influence on whitewing and how it affected the stirring incidents which followed  already the good man had preached three times the simple gospel of jesus to these indians and with so much success that some were ready to believe but others doubted just as in the days of old  for the benefit of the former he had this day chosen the text let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus  whitewing had been much troubled in spirit  his mind if very inquiring was also very sceptical  it was not that he would notbut that he could not receive anything unless convinced  with a strong thirst after truth he went to hear that day but strange to say he could not fix his attention  only one sentence seemed to fasten firmly on his memory it is the spirit that quickeneth  the text itself also made a profound impression on him  the preacher had just concluded and was about to raise his voice in prayer when a shout was heard in the distance  it came from a man who was seen running over the prairie towards the camp with the desperate haste of one who runs for his life  all was at once commotion  the men sprang up and while some went out to meet the runner others seized their weapons  in a few seconds a young man with bloodshot eyes labouring chest and streaming brow burst into their midst with the news that a band of blackfoot warriors many hundred strong was on its way to attack the camp of bald eagle that he was one of that old chiefs braves and was hasting to give his tribe timely warning but that he had run so far and so fast as to be quite unable to go another step and had turned aside to borrow a horse or beg them to send on a fresh messenger  i will go said whitewing on hearing this and my horse is ready  he wasted no more time with words but ran towards the hollow where his steed had been hobbled that is the two front legs tied together so as to admit of moderate freedom without the risk of desertion  he was closely followed by his friend little tim who knowing well the red mans staid and selfpossessed character was somewhat surprised to see by his flashing eyes and quick breathing that he was unusually excited  whitewing is anxious he said as they ran together  the woman whom i love better than life is in bald eagles camp was the brief reply  oho thought little tim but he spoke no word for he knew his friend to be extremely reticent in regard to matters of the heart  for some time he had suspected him of what he styled a weakness in that organ now thought he i know it  little tim will go with me asked the indian as they turned into the hollow where the horses had been left  ay whitewing answered the trapper with a touch of enthusiasm little tim will stick to you through thick and thin as long as  an exclamation from the indian at that moment stopped him for it was discovered that the horses were not there  the place was so open that concealment was not possible  the steeds of both men had somehow got rid of their hobbles and galloped away  a feeling of despair came over the indian at this discovery  it was quickly followed by a stern resolve  he was famed as being the fleetest and most enduring brave of his tribe  he would run home  without saying a word to his friend he tightened his belt and started off like a hound loosed from the leash  little tim ran a few hundred yards after him at top speed but suddenly pulled up  pooh  its useless he exclaimed  i might as well run after a streak o greased lightnin  well well women have much to answer for whod iver have thowt to see whitewing shook off his balance like that it strikes me ill sarve him best by lookin after the nags  while the trapper soliloquised thus he ran back to the camp to get one of the indian horses wherewith to go off in search of his own and that of his friend  he found the indians busy making preparations to ride to the rescue of their bald eagle allies but quick though these sons of the prairie were they proved too slow for little tim who leaped on the first horse he could lay hold of and galloped away  meanwhile whitewing ran with the fleet untiring step of a trained runner whose heart is in his work but the way was long and as evening advanced even his superior powers began to fail a little  still he held on greatly overtaxing his strength  nothing could have been more injudicious in a prolonged race  he began to suspect that it was unwise when he came to a stretch of broken ground which in the distance was traversed by a range of low hills  as he reached these he reduced the pace a little but while he was clambering up the face of a rather precipitous cliff the thought of the blackfoot band and of the muchloved one came into his mind prudence went to the winds and in a moment he was on the summit of the cliff panting vehementlyso much so indeed that he felt it absolutely necessary to sit down for a few moments to rest  while resting thus with his back against a rock in the attitude of one utterly worn out part of the missionarys text flashed into his mind the race that is set before us  surely he murmured looking up this race is set before me  the object is good  it is my duty as well as my desire  the thought gave an impulse to his feelings the impulse sent his young blood careering and springing up he continued to run as if the race had only just begun  but ere long the pace again began to tell producing a sinking of the heart which tended to increase the evil hour after hour had passed without his making any perceptible abatement in the pace and the night was now closing in  this however mattered not for the full moon was sailing in a clear sky ready to relieve guard with the sun  again the thought recurred that he acted unwisely in thus pressing on beyond his powers and once more he stopped and sat down  this time the text could not be said to flash into his mind for while running it had never left him  he now deliberately set himself to consider it and the word patience arrested his attention  let us run with patience he thought  i have not been patient  but the white man did not mean this kind of race at all he said it was the whole race of life  well if so this is part of that race and it is set before me  patience patience  i will try  with childlike simplicity the red man rose and began to run slowly  for some time he kept it up but as his mind reverted to the object of his race his patience began to ooze out  he could calculate pretty well the rate at which the blackfoot foes would probably travel and knowing the exact distance perceived that it would be impossible for him to reach the camp before them unless he ran all the way at full speed  the very thought of this induced him to put on a spurt which broke him down altogether  stumbling over a piece of rough ground he fell with such violence that for a moment or two he lay stunned  soon however he was on his legs again and tried to resume his headlong career but felt that the attempt was useless  with a deep irrepressible groan he sank upon the turf  it was in this hour of his extremity that the latter part of the preachers text came to his mind looking unto jesus  poor whitewing looked upwards as if he half expected to see the saviour with the bodily eye and a mist seemed to be creeping over him  he was roused from this semiconscious state by the clattering of horses hoofs  the blackfoot band at once occurred to his mind  starting up he hid behind a piece of rock  the sounds drew nearer and presently he saw horsemen passing him at a considerable distance  how many he could not make out  there seemed to be very few  the thought that it might be his friend the trapper occurred but if he were to shout and it should turn out to be foes not only would his own fate but that of his tribe be sealed  the case was desperate still anything was better than remaining helplessly where he was  he uttered a sharp cry  it was responded to at once in the voice of little tim and next moment the faithful trapper galloped towards whitewing leading his horse by the bridle  well now this is good luck cried the trapper as he rode up  no replied the indian gravely it is not luck  well as to that i dont much care what you call itbut get up  why whats wrong wi you  the run has been very long and i pressed forward impatiently trusting too much to my own strength  let my friend help me to mount  well now i come to think of it said the trapper as he sprang to the ground you have come a tremendous waya most awful long wayin an uncommon short time  a fellow dont think o that when hes mounted ye see  there now he added resuming his own seat in the saddle off we go  but theres no need to overdrive the cattle well be there in good time i warrant ye for the nags are both good and fresh  little tim spoke the simple truth for his own horse which he had discovered along with that of his friend some time after parting from him was a splendid animal much more powerful and active than the ordinary indian horses  the steed of whitewing was a halfwild creature of spanish descent from the plains of mexico  nothing more was spoken after this  the two horsemen rode steadily on side by side proceeding with long but not too rapid strides over the ground now descending into the hollows or ascending the gentle undulations of the plains anon turning out and in to avoid the rocks and ruts and rugged places or sweeping to right or left to keep clear of clumps of stunted wood and thickets but never for a moment drawing rein until the goal was reached which happened very shortly before the break of day  the riding was absolute rest to whitewing who recovered strength rapidly as they advanced  there is neither sight nor sound of the foe here murmured the indian  no all safe replied the trapper in a tone of satisfaction as they cantered to the summit of one of the prairie waves and beheld the wigwams of bald eagle shining peacefully in the moonlight on the plain below    chapter two  the surprise and combat  how frequently that slip twixt the cup and the lip is observed in the affairs of this life  little tim the trapper had barely pronounced the words all safe when an appalling yell rent the air and a cloud of dark forms was seen to rush over the open space that lay between the wigwams of the old chief bald eagle and a thicket that grew on its westward side  the blackfoot band had taken the slumbering indians completely by surprise and whitewing had the mortification of finding that he had arrived just a few minutes too late to warn his friends  although bald eagle was thus caught unprepared he was not slow to meet the enemy before the latter had reached the village all the fighting men were up and armed with bows scalpingknives and tomahawks  they had even time to rush towards the foe and thus prevent the fight from commencing in the midst of the village  the world is all too familiar with the scenes that ensued  it is not our purpose to describe them  we detest war regarding it in ninetynine cases out of a hundred as unnecessary  sufficient to say here that the overwhelming numbers of the blackfoot indians were too much for their enemies  they soon began to overpower and drive them back towards the wigwams where the poor women and children were huddled together in terror  before this point had arrived however whitewing and little tim were galloping to the rescue  the former knew at a glance that resistance on the part of his friends would be hopeless  he did not therefore gallop straight down to the field of battle to join them but turning sharply aside with his friend swept along one of the bottoms or hollows between the undulations of the plain where their motions could not be seen as they sped along  whitewing looked anxiously at little tim who observing the look said  im with ee whitewing niver fear  does my brother know that we ride to death asked the indian in an earnest tone  yer brother dont know nothin o the sort replied the trapper and considerin your natur id have expected ye to think that manitou might have some hand in the matter  the white man speaks wisely returned the chief accepting the reproof with a humbled look  we go in his strength  and once again the latter part of the preachers text seemed to shoot through the indians brain like a flash of lightlooking unto jesus  whitewing was one of those men who are swift to conceive and prompt in action  tim knew that he had a plan of some sort in his head and having perfect faith in his capacity forbore to advise him or even to speak  he merely drew his huntingknife and urged his steed to its utmost speed for every moment of time was precious  the said huntingknife was one of which little tim was peculiarly fond  it had been presented to him by a mexican general for conspicuous gallantry in saving the life of one of his officers in circumstances of extreme danger  it was unusually long and heavy and being doubleedged bore some resemblance to the short sword of the ancient romans  itll do some execution before i go down thought tim as he regarded the bright blade with an earnest look  but tim was wrong  the blade was not destined to be tarnished that day  in a very few minutes the two horsemen galloped to the thicket which had concealed the enemy  entering this they dashed through it as fast as possible until they reached the other side whence they could see the combatants on the plain beyond  all along they had heard the shouts and yells of battle  for one moment whitewing drew up to breathe his gallant steed but the animal was roused by that time and it was difficult to restrain him his companions horse was also nearly unmanageable  my brothers voice is strong  let him use it well said the chief abruptly  ay ay replied the little trapper with an intelligent chuckle go ahead my boy  ill give it out fit to bust the bellows  instantly whitewing shot from the wood like the panther rushing on his prey uttering at the same time the tremendous warcry of his tribe little tim followed suit with a roar that was all but miraculous in its tone and character and may be described as a compound of the steamwhistle and the buffalo bull only with something about it intensely human  it rose high above the din of battle  the combatants heard and paused  the two horsemen were seen careering towards them with furious gesticulations  red indians seldom face certain death the blackfoot men knew that an attack by only two men would be sheer insanity the natural conclusion was that they were the leaders of a band just about to emerge from the thicket  they were thus taken in rear  a panic seized them which was intensified when little tim repeated his roar and flourished the instrument of death which he styled his little carvingknife  the blackfeet turned and fled right and left scattering over the plains individually and in small groups as being the best way of baffling pursuit  with that sudden access of courage which usually results from the exhibition of fear in a foe bald eagles men yelled and gave chase bald eagle himself however had the wisdom to call them back  at a council of war hastily summoned on the spot he said  my braves you are a parcel of fools  clearing his throat after this plain statement either for the purpose of collecting his thoughts or giving his young warriors time to weigh and appreciate the compliment he continued  you chase the enemy as thoughtlessly as the north wind chases the leaves in autumn  my wise chief whitewing and his friend leetil tim whose heart is big and whose voice is bigger and whose scalpingknife is biggest of allhave come to our rescue alone  whitewing tells me there is no one at their backs  if our foes discover their mistake they will turn again and the contempt which they ought to pour on themselves because of their own cowardice they will heap on our heads and overwhelm us by their numbersfor who can withstand numbers  they will scatter us like small dust before the hurricane  waugh  the old man paused for breath for the recent fight had taken a good deal out of him and the assembled warriors exclaimed waugh by which they meant to express entire approval of his sentiments  now it is my counsel he continued that as we have been saved by whitewing we should all shut our mouths and hear what whitewing has got to say  bald eagle sat down amid murmurs of applause and whitewing arose  there was something unusually gentle in the tone and aspect of the young chief on this occasion  our father the ancient one who has just spoken words of wisdom he said stretching forth his right hand has told you the truth yet not quite the truth  he is right when he says that leetil tim and i have come to your rescue but he is wrong when he says we come alone  it is true that there are no men at our backs to help us but is not manitou behind usin frontaround  it was manitou who sent us here and it was he who gave us the victory  whitewing paused and there were some exclamations of approval but they were not so numerous or so decided as he could have wished for red men are equally unwilling with white men to attribute their successes directly to their creator  and now he continued as bald eagle has said if our foes find out their mistake they will without doubt return  we must therefore take up our goods our wives and our little ones and hasten to meet our brothers of clearvale who are even now on their way to help us  our band is too small to fight the blackfeet but united with our friends and with manitou on our side for our cause is just we shall be more than a match for them  i counsel then that we raise the camp without delay  the signs of approval were much more decided at the close of this brief address and the old chief again rose up  my braves he said have listened to the words of wisdom  let each warrior go to his wigwam and get ready  we quit the camp when the sun stands there  he printed to a spot in the sky where the sun would be shining about an hour after daybreak which was already brightening the eastern sky  as he spoke the dusky warriors seemed to melt from the scene as if by magic and ere long the whole camp was busy packing up goods catching horses fastening on dogs little packages suited to their size and strength and otherways making preparation for immediate departure  follow me said whitewing to little tim as he turned like the rest to obey the orders of the old chief  ay its time to be lookin after her said tim with something like a wink of one eye but the indian was too much occupied with his own thoughts to observe the act or appreciate the allusion  he strode swiftly through the camp  well well soliloquised the trapper as he followed i niver did expect to see whitewing in this state o mind  hes ornarily sitch a cool unexcitable man  ah women youve much to answer for  having thus apostrophised the sex he hurried on in silence leaving his horse to the care of a youth who also took charge of whitewings steed  close to the outskirts of the camp stood a wigwam somewhat apart from the rest  it belonged to whitewing  only two women were in it at the time the young indian chief approached  one was a goodlooking young girl whose most striking feature was her large earnestlooking dark eyes  the other was a wrinkled old woman who might have been any age between fifty and a hundred for a life of exposure and hardship coupled with a somewhat delicate constitution had dried her up to such an extent that when asleep she might easily have passed for an egyptian mummy  one redeeming point in the poor old thing was the fact that all the deep wrinkles in her weatherworn and wigwamsmoked visage ran in the lines of kindliness  her loving character was clearly stamped upon her mahogany countenance so that he who ran might easily read  with the characteristic reserve of the red man whitewing merely gave the two women a slight look of recognition which was returned with equal quietness by the young woman but with a marked rippling of the wrinkles on the part of the old  there still remained a touch of anxiety caused by the recent fight on both countenances  it was dispelled however by a few words from whitewing who directed the younger woman to prepare for instant flight  she acted with prompt unquestioning obedience and at the same time the indian went to work to pack up his goods with all speech  of course tim lent efficient aid to tie up the packs and prepare them for slinging on horse and dog  i say whitewing whispered tim touching the chief with his elbow and glancing at the young woman with approvalfor tim who was an affectionate fellow and anxious about his friends welfare rejoiced to observe that the girl was obedient and prompt as well as prettyi say is that her  whitewing looked with a puzzled expression at his friend  is that herthe girl you know said little tim with a series of looks and nods which were intended to convey worlds of deep meaning  she is my sisterbrighteyes replied the indian quietly as he continued his work  whew whistled the trapper  well well he murmured in an undertone youre on the wrong scent this time altogether tim  ye think yerself a mighty deal cliverer than ye are  niver mind the one that he says he loves more nor lifell turn up soon enough no doubt but im real sorry for the old un he added in an undertone casting a glance of pity on the poor creature who bent over the little fire in the middle of the tent and gazed silently yet inquiringly at what was going on  shell niver be able to stand a flight like this  the mere joltin o the nags ud shake her old bones amost out of her skin there are some redskins now that would leave her to starve but whitewingll niver do that  i know him better  now thenaloudhave ye anything more for me to do  let my brother help brighteyes to bring up and pack the horses  jist so  come along brighteyes  with the quiet promptitude of one who has been born and trained to obey the indian girl followed the trapper out of the wigwam  being left alone with the old woman some of the young chiefs reserve wore off though he did not descend to familiarity  mother he said sitting down beside her and speaking loud for the old creature was rather deaf we must fly  the blackfeet are too strong for us  are you ready  i am always ready to do the bidding of my son replied this pattern mother  but sickness has made me old before my time  i have not strength to ride far  manitou thinks it time for me to die  it is better for whitewing to leave me and give his care to the young ones  the young ones can take care of themselves replied the chief somewhat sternly  we know not what manitou thinks  it is our business to live as long as we can  if you cannot ride mother i will carry you  often you have carried me when i could not ride  it is difficult to guess why whitewing dropped his poetical language and spoke in this matteroffact and sharp manner  great thoughts had been swelling in his bosom for some time past and perchance he was affected by the suggestion that the cruel practice of deserting the aged was not altogether unknown in his tribe  it may be that the supposition of his being capable of such cruelty nettled him  at all events he said nothing more except to tell his mother to be ready to start at once  the old woman herself who seemed to be relieved that her proposition was not favourably received began to obey her sons directions by throwing a gaycoloured handkerchief over her head and tying it under her chin  she then fastened her moccasins more securely on her feet wrapped a woollen kerchief round her shoulders and drew a large green blanket around her strapping it to her person by means of a broad strip of deerskin  having made these simple preparations for whatever journey lay before her she warmed her withered old hands over the embers of the wood fire and awaited her sons pleasure  meanwhile that son went outside to see the preparations for flight carried into effect  were all ready said little tim whom he met not far from the wigwam horses and dogs down in the hollow brighteyes an a lot o youngsters lookin after them  all you want now is to get hold o her and be off an the sooner the better for blackfoot warriors dont take long to get over scares an find out mistakes  but im most troubled about the old woman  shell niver be able to stand it  to this whitewing paid little attention  in truth his mind seemed to be taken up with other thoughts and his friend was not much surprised having come as we have seen to the conclusion that the indian was under a temporary spell for which woman was answerable  is my horse at hand asked whitewing  ay down by the creek all ready  and my brothers horse  ready too at the same place but well want another good unfor her you know said tim suggestively  let the horses be brought to my wigwam returned whitewing either not understanding or disregarding the last remark  the trapper was slightly puzzled but coming to the wise conclusion that his friend knew his own affairs best and had no doubt made all needful preparations he went off quietly to fetch the horses while the indian returned to the wigwam  in a few minutes little tim stood before the door holding the bridles of the two horses  immediately afterwards a little indian boy ran up with a third and somewhat superior horse and halted beside him  ha thats it at last  the horse for her said the trapper to himself with some satisfaction i knowed that whitewing would have everything straighteven though he is in a raither stumped condition just now  as he spoke brighteyes ran towards the wigwam and looked in at the door  next moment she went to the steed which little tim had in his own mind set aside for her and vaulted into the saddle as a young deer might have done had it taken to riding  of course tim was greatly puzzled and forced to admit a second time that he had overestimated his own cleverness and was again off the scent  before his mind had a chance of being cleared up the skin curtain of the wigwam was raised and whitewing stepped out with a bundle in his arms  he gave it to little tim to hold while he mounted his somewhat restive horse and then the trapper became awarefrom certain squeaky sounds and a pair of eyes that glittered among the folds of the bundle that he held the old woman in his arms  i say whitewing he said remonstratively as he handed up the bundle which the indian received tenderly in his left arm most of the camp has started  in quarter of an hour or so therell be none left  dont ee think its about time to look after her  whitewing looked at the trapper with a perplexed expressiona look which did not quite depart after his friend had mounted and was riding through the halfdeserted camp beside him  now whitewing said the trapper with some decision of tone and manner im quite as able as you are to carry that old critter  if youll make her over to me youll be better able to look after her you know  eh  my brother speaks strangely today replied the chief  his words are hidden from his indian friend  what does he mean by her  well well now ye are slow answered tim i wouldnt ha believed that anything short o scalpin could ha took away yer wits like that why of course i mean the woman ye said was dearer to ee than life  that woman is here replied the chief gravely casting a brief glance down at the wrinkled old visage that nestled upon his breastmy mother  whew whistled the trapper opening his eyes very wide indeed  for the third time that day he was constrained to admit that he had been thrown completely off the scent and that in regard to cleverness he was no better than a squawkin babby  but little tim said never a word  whatever his thoughts might have been after that he kept them to himself and imitating his indian brother maintained profound silence as he galloped between him and brighteyes over the rolling prairie    chapter three  the massacre and the chase  the sun was setting when whitewing and his friend rode into clearvale the entrance to the valley was narrow and for a short distance the road or indian track wound among groups of trees and bushes which effectually concealed the village from their sight  at this point in the ride little tim began to recover from the surprise at his own stupidity which had for so long a period of time reduced him to silence  riding up alongside of whitewing who was a little in advance of the party still bearing his mother in his arms he accosted him thus  i say whitewing the longer i know you the more of a puzzle you are to me  i thowt id got about at the bottom o all yer notions an ways by this time but i find that im mistaken  as no question was asked the red man deemed no reply needful but the faintest symptom of a smile told the trapper that his remark was understood and appreciated  one thing that throws me off the scent continued little tim is the way you injins have got o holdin yer tongues so that a feller cant make out what yer minds are after  why dont you speak why aint you more commoonicative  the children of the prairie think that wisdom lies in silence answered whitewing gravely  they leave it to their women and white brothers to chatter out all their minds  humph  the children o the prairie aint complimentary to their white brothers returned the trapper  mayhap yer right  some of us do talk a leetle too much  its a way weve got o lettin off the steam  im afeard id bust sometimes if i didnt let my feelins off through my mouth  but your silent ways are apt to lead fellers off on wrong tracks when theres no need to  didnt i think now that you was after a young woman as ye meant to take for a squawand after all it turned out to be your mother  my white brother sometimes makes mistakes quietly remarked the indian  true but your white brother wouldnt have made the mistake if ye had told him who it was you were after when ye set off like a mad grizzly wi its pups in danger  didnt i go tearin after you neck and crop as if i was a boy o sixteen in the belief that i was helpin ye in a love affair  it was a love affair said the indian quietly  true but not the sort o thing that i thowt it was  would you have refused to help me if you had known better demanded whitewing somewhat sharply  nay i wont say that returned tim for i hold that a womans a woman be she old or young pretty or ugly an id scorn the man as would refuse to help her in trouble besides as the wrinkled old critter is your mother ive got a sneakin sort o fondness for her but if id only known a deal o what they call romance would ha bin took out o the little spree  then it is well that my brother did not know  to this the trapper merely replied humph  after a few minutes he resumed in a more confidential tone  but i say whitewing has it niver entered into your head to take to yourself a wife  a mans always the better of havin a female companion to consult with an talk over things you know as well as to make his moccasins and leggins  does little tim act on his own opinions asked the indian quickly  ha thats a fair slap in the face said tim with a laugh but there may be reasons for that you see  gals aint always as willin as they should be sometimes they dont know a good man when they see him besides i aint too old yet though praps some of em thinks me raither short for a husband  come now dont keep yer old comrade in the dark  havent ye got a notion o some young woman in partikler  yes replied the indian gravely  jist so i thowt as much returned the trapper with a tone and look of satisfaction  what may her name be  lightheart  ay  lightheart  a good namespecially if she takes after it as ive no doubt she do  an what tribe does  the trapper stopped abruptly for at that moment the cavalcade swept out of the thicket into the open valley and the two friends suddenly beheld the indian camp which they had so recently left reduced to a smoking ruin  it is impossible to describe the consternation of the indians who had ridden so far and so fast to join their friends  and how shall we speak of the state of poor whitewings feelings  no sound escaped his compressed lips but a terrible light seemed to gleam from his dark eyes as clasping his mother convulsively to his breast with his left arm he grasped his tomahawk and urged his horse to its utmost speed little tim was at his side in a moment with the long dagger flashing in his right hand while bald eagle and his dusky warriors pressed close behind  the women and children were necessarily left in the rear but whitewings sister brighteyes being better mounted than these kept up with the men of war  the scene that presented itself when they reached the camp was indeed terrible  many of the wigwams were burned some of them still burning and those that had escaped the fire had been torn down and scattered about while the trodden ground and pools of blood told of the dreadful massacre that had so recently taken place  it was evident that the camp had been surprised and probably all the men slain while a very brief examination sufficed to show that such of the women and children as were spared had been carried off into slavery  in every direction outside the camp were found the scalped bodies of the slain left as they had fallen in unavailing defence of home  the examination of the camp was made in hot haste and profound silence because instant action had to be taken for the rescue of those who had been carried away and indians are at all times careful to restrain and hide their feelings  only the compressed lip the heaving bosom the expanding nostrils and the scowling eyes told of the fires that raged within  in this emergency bald eagle who was getting old and rather feeble tacitly gave up the command of the braves to whitewing  it need scarcely be said that the young chief acted with vigour  he with the trapper having traced the trail of the blackfoot warpartyevidently a different band from that which had attacked bald eagles campand ascertained the direction they had taken divided his force into two bands in command of which he placed two of the best chiefs of his tribe  bald eagle himself agreed to remain with a small force to protect the women and children  having made his dispositions and given his orders whitewing mounted his horse and galloped a short distance on the enemys trail followed by his faithful friend  reining up suddenly he said  what does my brother counsel  well whitewing since ye ask i would advise you to follow yer own devices  youve got a good head on your shoulders and know whats best  manitou knows what is best said the indian solemnly  he directs all  but his ways are very dark  whitewing cannot understand them  still we must act you know suggested the trapper  yes we must act and i ask counsel of my brother because it may be that manitou shall cause wisdom and light to flow from the lips of the white man  well i dont know as to that whitewing but my advice whatever its worth is that we should try to fall on the reptiles in front and rear at the same time and that you and i should go out in advance to scout  good said the indian my plan is so arranged  without another word he gave the rein to his impatient horse and was about to set off at full speed when he was arrested by the trapper exclaiming hold on heres some one coming after us  a rider was seen galloping from the direction of the burned camp  it turned out to be brighteyes  what brings my sister demanded whitewing  the girl with downcast look modestly requested leave to accompany them  her brother sternly refused  it is not womans part to fight he said  true but woman sometimes helps the fighter replied the girl not venturing to raise her eyes  go returned whitewing  time may not be foolishly wasted  the old ones and the children need thy care  without a word brighteyes turned her horses head towards the camp and was about to ride humbly away when little tim interfered  hold on girl  i say whitewing shes not so far wrong  many a time has woman rendered good service in warfare  shes well mounted and might ride back with a message or something o that sort  youd better let her come  she may come said whitewing and next moment he was bounding over the prairie at the full speed of his fiery steed closely followed by little tim and brighteyes  that same night at a late hour a band of savage warriors entered a thicket on the slopes of one of those hills on the western prairies which form what are sometimes termed the spurs of the rocky mountains though there was little sign of the great mountain range itself which was still distant several days march from the spot  a group of wearied women and children some riding some on foot accompanied the band  it was that which had so recently destroyed the indian village  they had pushed on with their prisoners and booty as far and as fast as their jaded horses could go in order to avoid pursuitthough having slain all the fighting men there was little chance of that except in the case of friends coming to the rescue which they thought improbable still with the wisdom of savage warriors they took every precaution to guard against surprise  no fire was lighted in the camp and sentries were placed all round it to guard them during the few hours they meant to devote to muchneeded repose  while these blackfeet were eating their supper whitewing and little tim came upon them  fortunately the sharp and practised eyes and intellects of our two friends were on the alert  so small a matter as a slight wavering in the blackfoot mind as to the best place for encamping produced an effect on the trail sufficient to be instantly observed  hm theyve took it into their heads here said little tim that it might be advisable to camp an feed  whitewing did not speak at once but his reining up at the moment his friend broke silence showed that he too had observed the signs  its always the way remarked the trapper with a quiet chuckle as he peered earnestly at the ground which the moon enabled him to see distinctly if a band o men only mention campin when theyre on the march theyre sure to waver a bit an spoil the straight goahead run o the trail  one turned aside to examine yonder bluff said the indian pointing to a trail which he saw clearly although it was undistinguishable to ordinary vision  ay an the bluff didnt suit returned tim for here he rejoins his friends an they go off agin at the run  no more waverin  theyd fixed their eyes a good bit ahead an made up their minds  they are in the thicket yonder said the indian pointing to the place referred to  jist what i was goin to remark observed the trapper  now whitewing it behoves us to be cautious  ay i see your mind an mine always jumps togither  this latter remark had reference to the fact that the indian had leaped off his horse and handed the reins to brighteyes  placing his horse also in charge of the indian girl tim said as the two set off  we have to do the rest on fut an the last part on our knees  by this the trapper meant that he and his friend would have to creep up to the enemys camp on hands and knees but whitewing whose mind had been recently so much exercised on religious matters at once thought of what he had been taught about the importance of prayer and again the words looking unto jesus rushed with greater power than ever upon his memory so that despite his anxiety as to the fate of his affianced bride and the perilous nature of the enterprise in hand he kept puzzling his inquiring brain with such difficulties as the absolute dependence of man on the will and leading of god coupled with the fact of his being required to go into vigorous decisive and apparently independent action trusting entirely to his own resources  mystery thought the red man as he and his friend walked swiftly along taking advantage of the shelter afforded by every glade thicket or eminence all is mystery  but whitewing was wrong as many men in all ages have been on first bending their minds to the consideration of spiritual things  all is not mystery  in the dealings of god with man much very much is mysterious and by us in this life apparently insoluble but many thingsespecially those things that are of vital importance to the soulare as clear as the sun at noonday  however our red man was at this time only beginning to run the spiritual race and like many others he was puzzled  but no sign did he show of what was going on within as he glided along bending his keen eyes intently on the blackfoot trail  at last they came to the immediate neighbourhood of the spot where it was rightly conjectured the enemy lay concealed  here as tim had foretold they went upon their knees and advanced with the utmost caution  coming to a grassy eminence they lay flat down and worked their way slowly and painfully to the top  well was it for them that a few clouds shrouded the moon at that time for one of the blackfoot sentinels had been stationed on that grassy eminence and if whitewing and the trapper had been less expert in the arts of savage war they must certainly have been discovered  as it was they were able to draw off in time and reach another part of the mound where a thick bush effectually concealed them from view  from this point when the clouds cleared away the camp could be clearly seen in the vale below  even the forms of the women and children were distinguishable but not their faces  it wont be easy to get at them by surprise whispered the trapper their position is strong and they keep a bright lookout besides the moon wont be down for some hours yetnot much before daybreak  whitewing will take the prey from under their very noses returned the indian  that wont be easy but ive no doubt youll try an sure little tims the man to back ye anyhow  at that moment a slight rustling noise was heard  looking through the bush they saw the blackfoot sentinel approaching  instantly they sank down into the grass where they lay so flat and still that it seemed as if they had vanished entirely from the scene  when the sentinel was almost abreast of them a sound arose from the camp which caused him to stop and listen  it was the sound of song the missionarythe only man the blackfoot indians had not slain having finished supper had gathered some of the women and children round him and after an earnest prayer had begun a hymn of praise  at first the blackfoot chief was on the point of ordering them to cease but as the sweet notes arose he seemed to be spellbound and remained a silent and motionless listener  the sentinel on the mound also became like a dark statue  he had never heard such tones before  after listening a few minutes in wonder he walked slowly to the end of the mound nearest to the singers  nows our chance whitewing said the trapper rising from his lair  the indian made no reply but descended the slope as carefully as he had ascended it followed by his friend  in a short time they were back at the spot where the horses had been left in charge of brighteyes  whitewing took his sister aside and for a few minutes they conversed in low tones  i have arranged it all with brighteyes said the indian returning to the trapper  didnt i tell ee said tim with a low laugh that women was good at helpin men in time o war  depend upon it that the sex must have a finger in every pie and moreover the pies not worth much that they havent got a finger in  to these remarks the young chief vouchsafed no answer but gravely went about making preparations to carry out his plans  while tying the three horses to three separate trees so as to be ready for instant flight he favoured his friend with a few explanations  it is not possible he said to take more than three just now for the horses cannot carry more  but these three brighteyes will rescue from the camp and we will carry them off  then we will return with our braves and have all the restif manitou allows  the trapper looked at his friend in surprise  he had never before heard him make use of such an expression as the last  nevertheless he made no remark but while the three were gliding silently over the prairie again towards the blackfoot camp he kept murmuring to himself youre a great puzzle whitewing an i cant make ye out nohow  yet i make no doubt yer right  whativer ye do comes right somehow but yer a great puzzleabout the greatest puzzle thats comed across my tracks since i was a squallin little babbyboy    chapter four  circumventing the blackfeet  on reaching the neighbourhood of the blackfoot camp whitewing and his companions crept to the top of the eminence which overlooked it taking care however to keep as far away as possible from the sentinel who still watched there  brighteyes proved herself to be quite as expert as her male companions in advancing like a snake through the long grass though encumbered with a blanket wrapped round her shoulders  the use of this blanket soon became apparent  as the three lay prone on their faces looking down at the camp from which the sound of voices still arose in subdued murmurs the young chief said to his sister  let the signal be a few notes of the song brighteyes learned from the white preacher  go  without a word of reply the girl began to move gently forward maintaining her recumbent position as she went and gradually as it were melted away  the moon was still shining brightly touching every object with pale but effective lights and covering hillocks and plains with correspondingly dark shadows  in a few minutes brighteyes had crept past the young sentinel and lay within sightalmost within ear shot of the camp  much to her satisfaction she observed that the indians had not bound their captives  even the missionarys hands were free  evidently they thought and were perhaps justified in thinking that escape was impossible for the horses of the party were all gathered together and hobbled besides being under a strong guard and what chance could women and children have out on the plains on foot against mounted men expert to follow the faintest trail  as for the white man he was a man of peace and unarmed as well as ignorant of warriors ways  the captives were therefore not only unbound but left free to move about the camp at will while some of their captors slept some fed and others kept watch  the missionary had just finished singing a hymn and was about to begin to read a portion of gods word when one of the women left the group and wandered accidentally close to the spot where brighteyes lay  it was lightheart  sister whispered brighteyes  the girl stopped abruptly and bent forward to listen with intense anxiety depicted on every feature of her pretty brown face  sister repeated brighteyes sink in the grass and wait  lightheart was too well trained in indian ways to speak or hesitate  at once but slowly she sank down and disappeared  another moment and brighteyes was at her side  sister she said manitou has sent help  listen  we must be wise and quick  from this point she went on to explain in as few words as possible that three fleet horses were ready close at hand to carry off three of those who had been taken captive and that she lightheart must be one of the three  but i cannot will not escape said lightheart while the others and the white preacher go into slavery  to this brighteyes replied that arrangements had been made to rescue the whole party and that she and two others were merely to be as it were the firstfruits of the enterprise  still lightheart objected but when her companion added that the plan had been arranged by her affianced husband she acquiesced at once with indianlike humility  i had intended said brighteyes to enter the blackfoot camp as if i were one of the captives and thus make known our plans but that is not now necessary  lightheart will carry the news she is wise and knows how to act  whitewing and leetil tim are hid on yonder hillock like snakes in the grass  i will return to then and let lightheart when she comes be careful to avoid the sentinel there  she stopped short for at the moment a step was heard near them  it was that of a savage warrior whose sharp eye had observed lightheart quit the camp and who had begun to wonder why she did not return  in another instant brighteyes flung her blanket round her whispered to her friend lie close sprang up and brushing swiftly past the warrior with a light laughas though amused at having been discovered ran into camp joined the group round the missionary and sat down although much surprised the captives were too wise to express their feelings  even the missionary knew enough of indian tactics to prevent him from committing himself  he calmly continued the reading in which he had been engaged and the blackfoot warrior returned to his place congratulating himself perhaps on having interrupted the little plan of one intending runaway  meanwhile lightheart easily understanding her friends motives crept in a serpentine fashion to the hillock where she soon found whitewing to the intense but unexpressed joy of that valiant red man  will leetil tim go back with lightheart to the horses and wait while his brother remains here said the young chief  no little tim wont growled the trapper in a tone of decision that surprised his red friend  brighteyes is in the blackfoot camp he continued in growling explanation  true returned the indian but brighteyes will escape and even if she fails to do so now she will be rescued with the others at last  she will be rescued with us just now returned little tim in a tone so emphatic that his friend looked at him with an expression of surprise that was unusually strong for a redskin warrior  suddenly a gleam of intelligence broke from his black eyes and with the soft exclamation wah he sank flat on the grass again and remained perfectly still  brighteyes found that it was not all plain sailing when she had mingled with her friends in the camp  in the first place the missionary refused absolutely to quit the captives  he would remain with them he said and await gods will and leading  in the second place no third person had been mentioned by her brother whose chief anxiety had been for his bride and the white man and it did not seem to brighteyes creditable to quit the camp after all her risk and trouble without some trophy of her prowess  in this dilemma she put to herself the question whom would lightheart wish me to rescue  now there were two girls among the captives one of whom was a bosom friend of lightheart the other was a younger sister  to these brighteyes went and straightway ordered them to prepare for flight they were of course quite ready to obey  all the preparation needed was to discard the blankets which indian women are accustomed to wear as convenient cloaks by day  thus unhampered the two girls wandered about the camp as several of the others had occasionally been doing separating from each other they got into the outskirts in different directions  meanwhile a hymn had been raised which facilitated their plans by attracting the attention of the savage warriors  high above the rest in one prolonged note the voice of brighteyes rang out like a silver flute  theres the signal said little tim as the sweet note fell on his listening ear  rising as he spoke the trapper glided in a stooping posture down the side of the hillock and round the base of it until he got immediately behind the youthful sentinel  then lying down and creeping towards him with the utmost caution he succeeded in getting so near that he could almost touch him  with one catlike bound little tim was on the indians back and had him in his arms while his broad horny hand covered his mouth and his powerful forefinger and thumb grasped him viciously by the nose  it was a somewhat curious struggle that ensued  the savage was much bigger than the trapper but the trapper was much stronger than the savage  hence the latter made fearful and violent efforts to shake the former off while the former made not less fearful though seemingly not quite so violent efforts to hold on  the red man tried to bite but tims hand was too broad and hard to be bitten  he tried to shake his nose free but unfortunately his nose was large and tims grip of it was perfect  the savage managed to get just enough of breath through his mouth to prevent absolute suffocation but nothing more  he had dropped his tomahawk at the first onset and tried to draw his knife but tims arms were so tight round him that he could not get his hand to his back where the knife reposed in his belt  in desperation he stooped forward and tried to throw his enemy over his head but tims legs were wound round him and no limpet ever embraced a rock with greater tenacity than did little tim embrace that blackfoot brave  half choking and wholly maddened the savage suddenly turned heels over head and fell on tim with a force that ought to have burst him  but tim didnt burst  he was much too tough for that  he did not even complain  rising again a sudden thought seemed to strike the indian for he began to run towards the camp with his foe on his back  but tim was prepared for that  he untwined one leg lowered it and with an adroit twist tripped up the savage causing him to fall on his face with tremendous violence  before he could recover tim still covering the mouth and holding tight to the nose got a knee on the small of the savages back and squeezed it smaller  at the same time he slid his left hand up to the savages windpipe and compressed it  with a violent heave the blackfoot sprang up  with a still more violent heave the trapper flung him down bumped his head against a convenient stone and brought the combat to a sudden close  without a moments loss of time tim gagged and bound his adversary  then he rose up with a deep inspiration and wiped his forehead as he contemplated him  all this comes o your desire not to shed human blood whitewing he muttered  well praps youre rightwhat would ha bin the use o killin the poor critturs  but it was a tough jobsaying which he lifted the indian on his broad shoulders and carried him away  while this fight was thus silently going on hidden from view of the camp by the hillock whitewing crept forward to meet brighteyes and the two girls and these with lightheart were eagerly awaiting the trapper  my brother is strong said whitewing allowing the faintest possible smile to play for a moment on his usually grave face  your brother is tough returned little tim rubbing the back of his head with a rueful look an hes bin bumped about an tumbled on to that extent that its a miracle a whole bone is left in his carcass but lend a hand lad weve got no time to waste  taking the young blackfoot between them and followed by the silent girls they soon reached the thicket where the horses had been left here they bound their captive securely to a tree and gave him a drink of water with a knife pointed at his heart to keep him quiet after which they regagged him  then whitewing led lightheart through the thicket towards his horse and took her up behind him  little tim took charge of brighteyes  the young sister and the bosom friend mounted the third horse and thus paired they all galloped away  but the work that our young chief had cut out for himself that night was only half accomplished  on reaching the rendezvous which he had appointed he found the braves of his tribe impatiently awaiting him  my father sees that we have been successful he said to bald eagle who had been unable to resist the desire to ride out to the rendezvous with the fighting men  the great manitou has given us the victory thus far as the white preacher said he would  my son is right  whitewing will be a great warrior when bald eagle is in the grave  go and conquer i will return to camp with the women  thus relieved of his charge whitewing who however had little desire to achieve the fame prophesied for him proceeded to fulfil the prophecy to some extent  he divided his force into four bands with which he galloped off towards the blackfoot camp  on nearing it he so arranged that they should attack the camp simultaneously at four opposite points little tim commanded one of the bands and he resolved in his own mind that his band should be the last to fall on the foe  bloodshed may be avoided he muttered to himself an i hope it will as whitewing is so anxious about it  anyhow ill do my best to please him  accordingly on reaching his allotted position tim halted his men and bided his time  the moon still shone over prairie and hill and not a breath of air stirred blade or leaf  all in nature was peace save in the hearts of savage man  the blackfoot camp was buried in slumber  only the sentinels were on the alert  suddenly one of theselike the warhorse who is said to scent the battle from afarpricked his ears distended his nostrils and listened  a low muffled thunderous sort of pattering on the plain in front  it might be a herd of buffaloes  the sentinel stood transfixed  the humps of buffaloes are large but they do not usually attain to the size of men  the sentinel clapped his hand to his mouth and gave vent to a yell which sent the blood spirting through the veins of all and froze the very marrow in the bones of some  prompt was the reply and turnout of the blackfoot warriors well used to wars alarms there was no quaking in their bosoms  they were well named braves  but the noise in the camp prevented them from hearing or observing the approach of the enemy on the other side till almost too late  a whoop apprised the chief of the danger  he divided his forces and lost some of his selfconfidence  here comes number three muttered little tim as he observed the third band emerge from a hollow on the left  the blackfoot chief observed it too divided his forces again and lost more of his selfconfidence  none of the three bands had as yet reached the camp but they all came thundering down on it at the same time and at the same whirlwind pace  now for number four muttered little tim  come boys an at em he cried unconsciously paraphrasing the duke of wellingtons waterloo speech  at the some time he gave utterance to what he styled a rocky mountain trappers roar and dashed forward in advance of his men who in trying to imitate the roar intensified and rather complicated their own yell  it was the last touch to the blackfoot chief who losing the small remnant of his selfconfidence literally sloped into the long grass and vanished leaving his men to still further divide themselves which they did effectually by scattering right and left like smallshot from a blunderbuss  great was the terror of the poor captives while this brief but decisive action lasted for although they knew that the assailants were their friends they could not be certain of the issue of the combat naturally they crowded round their only male friend the missionary  do not fear he said in attempting to calm them the good manitou has sent deliverance  we will trust in him  the dispersion of their foes and the arrival of friends almost immediately followed these words  but the friends who arrived were few in number at first for whitewing had given strict orders as to the treatment of the enemy  in compliance therewith his men chased them about the prairie in a state of gasping terror but no weapon was used and not a man was killed though they were scattered beyond the possibility of reunion for at least some days to come  before that eventful night was over the victors were far from the scene of victory on their way home  its not a bad style o fightin remarked little tim to his friend as they rode away lots o fun and fuss without much damage  pity we cant do all our fightin in that fashion  waugh exclaimed whitewing but as he never explained what he meant by waugh we must leave it to conjecture  it is probable however that he meant assent for he turned aside in passing to set free the blackfoot who had been bound to a tree  that red man having expected death went off with a lively feeling of surprise and at top speed his pace being slightly accelerated by a shotwide of the mark and at long rangefrom little tim  three weeks after these events a number of indians were baptised by our missionary  among them were the young chief whitewing and lightheart and these two were immediately afterwards united in marriage  next day the trapper with much awkwardness and hesitation requested the missionary to unite him and brighteyes  the request was complied with and thenceforward the white man and the red became more inseparable than ever  they hunted and dwelt togetherto the ineffable joy of whitewings wrinkled old mother whose youth seemed absolutely to revive under the influence of the highpressure affection brought to bear on a colony of brown and whiteybrown grandchildren by whom she was at last surrounded  the doubts and difficulties of whitewing were finally cleared away  he not only accepted fully the gospel for himself but became anxious to commend it to others as the only real and perfect guide in life and comfort in death  in the prosecution of his plans he imitated the example of his white father roaming the prairie and the mountains far and wide with his friend the trapper and even venturing to visit some of the lodges of his old foes the blackfoot indians in his desire to run earnestly yet with patience the race that had been set before himlooking unto jesus  full twenty years rolled by during which no record was kept of the sayings or doings of those whose fortunes we have followed thus far  at the end of that period however striking incidents in their career brought the most prominent among them again to the frontas the following chapters will show    chapter five  the mountain fortress  in one of those numerous narrow ravines of the rocky mountains which open out into the rolling prairies of the saskatchewan there stood some years ago a log hut or blockhouse such as the roving hunters of the far west sometimes erected as temporary homes during the inclement winter of those regions  with a view to render the hut a castle of refuge as well as a home its builder had perched it close to the edge of a nearly inaccessible cliff overhanging one of those brawling torrents which carry the melting snows of the great rocky range into one of the tributaries of the saskatchewan river  on what may be called the land side of the hut there was a slight breastwork of logs  it seemed a weak defence truly yet a resolute man with several guns and ammunition might have easily held it against a considerable band of savages  one fine morning about the time when the leaves of the forest were beginning to put on their gorgeous autumnal tints a woman might have been seen ascending the zigzag path that led to the hut or fortress  she was young well formed and pretty and wore the indian costume yet there was something in her air and carriage as well as the nutbrown colour of her hair which told that either her father or her mother had been what the red men term a paleface  with a light bounding step very different from that of the ordinary indian squaw she sprang from rock to rock as if in haste and climbing over the breastwork before mentioned entered the hut  the interior of the little fortress was naturally characteristic of its owner  a leathern capote and leggings hung from a nail in one corner in another lay a pile of buffalo robes  the rough walls were adorned with antlers of the moose and other deer from the various branches of which hung several powderhorns firebags and bulletpouches  near the rude fireplace the chimney of which was plastered outside and in with mud was a range of six guns of various patterns and ages all of which being well polished and oiled were evidently quite ready for instant service  beside them hung an old cavalry sabre  neither table nor chairs graced the simple mansion but a large chest at one side served for the former and doubtless contained the owners treasures whatever these might be while three rough stools with only nine legs among them did service for the latter  the action of the young woman on entering was somewhat suggestive of the cause of her haste  without a moments delay she seized a powderhorn and bulletpouch and began to charge the guns some with ball others with slugs as fast as she could  there was a cool quiet celerity in her proceedings which proved that she was accustomed to the handling of such weapons  no one looking upon the scene would have guessed that softswan as she was poetically named was a bride at that time in the midst of the honeymoon  yet such was the case  her husband being the kindliest stoutest and handsomest fellow in all that region had won her heart and hand had obtained her parents consent had been married in the nearest settlement by a travelling missionary and had carried off his pretty bride to spend the honeymoon in his mountain fortress  we can scarcely call it his home however for it was only as we have said a temporary residencethe rocky mountains from the gulf of mexico to the arctic circle being his home  while the indian bride was engaged in charging the firearms a rifleshot was heard to echo among the surrounding cliffs  it was followed by a cry as if some one had been wounded and then there arose that terrible warwhoop of the red men which once heard can never be forgotten and which inspires even the bravest with feelings of at least anxiety  that softswan was not free from alarm was pretty evident from the peculiar curl of her pretty eyebrows but that the sounds did not unnerve her was also obvious from the quiet though prompt way in which she gathered up all the loaded firearms and bore them swiftly to the breastwork in front of the cabin  arranging the guns in a row at her side so as to be handy the girl selected one laid it on the parapet and carefully examined the priming  having satisfied herself that it was all right she cocked the piece and quietly awaited the issue of events  the weapon that softswan had selected was not picked up at haphazard it was deliberately chosen as being less deadly than the others the charge being a few slugs or clippings of lead which were not so apt to kill as rifle bullets for softswan as her name might suggest was gentle of spirit and was influenced by none of that thirst for blood and revenge which characterised some of her indian relatives  after a time the poor girls anxiety increased for well she knew that a whoop and a cry such as she had heard were the sure precursors of something worse  besides she had seen the footprints of blackfoot indians in the valley below and she knew from their appearance that those who had made them were on the warpath in which circumstances savages usually dismiss any small amount of tender mercies with which they may have been naturally endowed  oh why why yous not come home big tim she exclaimed at last in broken english  it may be well to explain at once that big tim who was the only son of little tim had such a decided preference for the tongue of his white father that he had taught it to his bride and refused to converse with her in any other though he understood the language of his mother brighteyes quite as well as english  if big tim had heard the pathetic question he would have flown to the rescue more speedily than any other hunter of the rocky mountains for he was the swiftest runner of them all but unfortunately he was too far off at that moment to hear not too far off however to hear the shot and cry which had alarmed his bride  from the position which softswan occupied she could see and command every portion of the zigzag approach to the hut so that no one could reach her without being completely exposed to her fire if she were disposed to dispute the passage  as we have said the hut stood on a cliff which overhung the torrent that brawled through the gorge so that she was secure from attack in rear  in a few minutes another rifleshot was heard and the warwhoop was repeated this time much nearer than before  with compressed lips and heightened colour the solitary girl prepared to defend her castle  presently she heard footsteps among the thick bushes below as if of some one running in hot haste  softswan laid her finger on the trigger but carefully for the advancing runner might be her husband  oh why did he not shout to warn her  the poor girl trembled a little despite her selfrestraint as she thought of the danger and the necessity for immediate action  suddenly the bushes on her left moved and a man pushing them aside peeped from among them  he was a savage in the warpaint and panoply of a blackfoot brave  the spot to which he had crept was indeed the nearest to the hut that could be reached in that direction but softswan knew well that an impassable chasm separated her from the intruder so she kept well concealed behind the breastwork and continued to watch him through one of the peepholes made in it for that purpose  she might have easily shot him for he was within range but her nature revolted from doing so for he seemed to think that the hut was untenanted and instead of looking towards her place of concealment leaned over the cliff so as to get a good view of the lower end of the zigzag track where it entered the woods  could he be a foe to the approaching indians or one of them thought the poor girl rendered almost desperate by doubt and indecision  just then a man burst out of the woods below with a defiant shout and sprang up the narrow track  it was big tim  the savage on the cliff pointed his rifle at him  indecision doubt mercy were instantly swept away and with the speed of the lightning flash the girl sent her charge of slugs into the savage  he collapsed rolled over the cliff and went crashing into the bushes underneath but instantly sprang up as if unhurt and disappeared just as a dozen of his comrades burst upon the scene from the woods below  the echoing report of the gun and the fall of their companion evidently disconcerted the aim of the savages for their scattering fire left the bounding tim untouched  before they could reload softswan sent them a present of another charge of slugs which the distance being great so scattered itself as to embrace nearly the whole party who thereupon went wounded and howling back into the forest  well done my soft one exclaimed big tim as he took a flying leap over the low breastwork and caught his bride in his arms for even in that moment of danger he could not help expressing his joy and thankfulness at finding her safe and well when he had half expected to find her dead and scalped if he found her at all  another moment and he was kneeling at the breastwork examining the firearms and ready for action  fetch the sabre my soft one said big tim addressing his bride by the title which he had bestowed on her on his weddingday  the tone in which he said this struck the girl as being unusually light and joyous not quite in keeping with the circumstance of being attacked by overwhelming odds but she was becoming accustomed to the eccentricities of her bold and stalwart husband and had perfect confidence in him  without therefore expressing surprise by word or look she obeyed the order  unsheathing the weapon the hunter felt its edge with his thumb and a slight smile played on his features as he said  i have good news for the soft one today  the soft one looked but did not say indeed what is it  yes continued the youth sheathing the sabre the man with the kind heart and the snowy pinion has come back to the mountains  he will be here before the shadows of the trees grow much longer  whitewing exclaimed softswan with a gleam of pleasure in her bright black eyes  just so  the prairie chief has come back to us and is now a preacher  has the paleface preacher com vis him asked the bride with a slightly troubled look for she did not yet feel quite at home in her broken english and feared that her husband might laugh at her mistakes though nothing was further from the mind of the stout hunter than to laugh at his pretty bride  he did indeed sometimes indulge the propensity in that strange conventional region his sleeve but no owl of the desert was more solemn in countenance than big tim when softswan perpetrated her lingual blunders  i know not he replied as he renewed the priming of one of the guns hist did you see something move under the willow bush yonder  the girl shook her head  a rabbit no doubt said the hunter lowering the rifle which he had raised and resuming his easy unconcerned attitude yet keeping his keen eye on the spot with a steadiness that showed his indifference was assumed  i know not whether the paleface preacher is with him he continued those who told me about him could only say that a white man dressed like the crows was travelling a short distance in advance of whitewing but whether he was one of his party or not they could not tell  indeed it is said that whitewing has no party with him that he travels alone if he does he is more reckless than ever seeing that his enemies the blackfeet are on the warpath just now but you never know what a halfmad redskin will do and whitewing is a queer customer  big tims style of speech was in accordance with his halfcaste nature sometimes flowing in channels of slightly poetic imagery like that of his indian mother at other times dropping into the very matteroffact style of his white sire  leetil tim vill be glad said softswan  ay daddy will be pleased  by the way i wonder what keeps him out so long  i half expected to find him here when i arrived  indeed i made sure it was him that tumbled yon blackfoot off the cliff so smartly you see i didnt know you were such a plucky little woman my soft one though i might have guessed it seeing that you possess all the good qualities under the sun but a man hardly expects his squaw to be great on the warpath dye see  softswan neither smiled nor looked pleased at the compliment intended in these words  me loves not to draw bloods she said gravely with a pensive look on the ground  dont let that disturb you soft one said her husband with a quiet laugh  by the way he jumped after it i guess he has got no more harm than if youd gin him an overdose o physic  but them reptiles bein in these parts makes me raither anxious about daddy  did he say where he meant to hunt when he went off this morning  yes leetil tim says hims go for hunt near lipstock hill  just so lopstick hill returned tim correcting her with offhand gravity  but me hears a shote an a cry said the girl with a suddenly anxious look  that was from one o the redskins whose thigh i barked for sendin an arrow raither close to my head said the young man  but continued his bride with increasing anxiety the shote an the cry was long before you comes home  praps it bees leetil tim  impossible said big tim quickly father must have bin miles away at that time for lopsuck hill is good three hours walk from here as the crow flies an the blackfeet came from the opposite airt o the compass  the young hunters prolonged silence after this as well as the expression of his face showed that he was not quite as easy in his mind as his words implied  did the cry seem to be far off he asked at last quickly  not far returned his wife  without speaking big tim began to buckle on the cavalry sabre not in the looselyswinging cavalry fashion but closely and firmly to his side with his broad waistbelt so that it might not impede his movements  he then selected from the arms a short doublebarrelled gun and slinging a powderhorn and shotpouch over his shoulders prepared to depart  now listen my soft one he said on completing his arrangements  i feel amost sartin sure that the cry ye heard was not daddys nevertheless the bare possibility o such a thing makes it my dooty to go an see if it was the old man  i think the blackfeet have drawed off to have a palaver an wont be back for a bit so ill jist slip down the precipice by our secret path an if they do come back when im away pepper them well wi slugs  ill hear the shots an be back to you afore they can git up the hill  but if they should make a determined rush dont you make too bold a stand agin em  just let fly with the bigbore when theyre halfway up the track an then slip into the cave  ill soon meet ye there an well give the reptiles a surprise  now youll be careful soft one  soft one promised to be careful and big tim entering the hut passed out at a back door and descended the cliff to the torrent below by a concealed path which even a climbing monkey might have shuddered to attempt  meanwhile softswan rearranging and reexamining her firearm sat down behind the breastwork to guard the fort  the sun was still high in the heavens illuming a magnificent prospect of hill and dale and virgin forest and glittering in the lakelets pools and rivers which brightened the scene as far as the distant horizon where the snowclad peaks of the rocky mountains rose grandly into the azure sky  the girl sat there almost motionless for a long time exhibiting in her face and figure at once the keen watchfulness of the savage and the endurance of the paleface  unlike many girls of her class she had at one period been brought for a short time under the influence of men who loved the lord jesus christ and esteemed it equally a duty and a privilege to urge others to flee from the wrath to come and accept the gospel offer of salvationmen who themselves had long before been influenced by the paleface preacher to whom softswan had already referred  the seed had in her case fallen into good ground and had brought forth the fruit of an earnest desire to show goodwill to all with whom she had to do  it had also aroused in her a hungering and thirsting for more knowledge of god and his ways  it was natural therefore as she gazed on the splendid scene spread out before her that the thoughts of this child of the backwoods should rise to contemplation of the creator and become less attentive to inferior matters than circumstances required  she was recalled suddenly to the danger of her position by the appearance of a dark object which seemed to crawl out of the bushes below just where the zigzag track entered them  at the first glance it seemed to resemble a bear a second and more attentive look suggested that it might be a man  whether bear or man however it was equally a foe at least so thought softswan and she raised one of the guns to her shoulder with a promptitude that would have done credit to big tim himself  but she did not fire  the natural disinclination to shed blood restrained herfortunately as it turned outfor the crawling object on reaching the open ground rose with apparent difficulty and staggered forward a few paces in what seemed to be the form of a drunken man after one or two ineffectual efforts to ascend the track the unfortunate being fell and remained a motionless heap upon the ground    chapter six  a strange visitor  curious mingling of eagerness hope and fear rendered softswan for some minutes undecided how to act as she gazed at the fallen man  his garb was of a dark uniform grey colour which she had often heard described but had not seen until now  that he was wounded she felt quite sure but she knew that there would be great danger in descending to aid him besides if he were helpless as he seemed to be she had not physical strength to lift him and would expose herself to easy capture if the blackfeet should be in ambush  still the eager and indefinable hope that was in her heart induced the girl to rise with the intention of descending the path when she observed that the fallen man again moved  rising on his hands and knees he crept forward a few paces and then stopped  suddenly by a great effort he raised himself to a kneeling position clasped his hands and looked up  the act sufficed to decide the wavering girl  leaping lightly over the breastwork she ran swiftly down until she reached the man who gazed at her in openmouthed astonishment  he was a white man and the ghastly pallor of his face with a few spots of blood on it and on his hands told that he had been severely wounded  manitou seems to have sent an angel of light to me in my extremity he gasped in the indian tongue  come me vill help you answered softswan in her broken english as she stooped and assisted him to rise  no other word was uttered for even with the girls assistance it was with the utmost difficulty that the man reached the breastwork of the hut and when he had succeeded in clambering over it he lay down and fainted  after softswan had glanced anxiously in the direction of the forest and placed one of the guns in a handy position she proceeded to examine the wounded stranger  being expert in such matters she opened his vest and quickly found a wound near the region of the heart  it was bleeding steadily though not profusely  to stanch this and bind it up was the work of a few minutes  then she reclosed the vest  in doing so she found something hard in a pocket near the wound  it was a little book which she gently removed as it might interfere with the bandage  in doing so she observed that the book had been struck by the bullet which it deflected so as to cause a more deadly wound than might otherwise have been inflicted  she was thus engaged when the patient recovered consciousness and seizing her wrist exclaimed take not the word from me  it has been my joy and comfort in all my  he stopped on observing who it was that touched his treasure  nay then he continued with a faint smile as he released his hold it can come to no harm in thy keeping child  for an instant i thought that rougher hands had seized it  but why remove it  softswan explained but seeing how eager the man was to keep it she at once returned the little bible to the inner pocket in which it was carried when not in use  then running into the hut she quickly returned with a rib of venison and a tin mug of water  the man declined the food but drained the mug with an air of satisfaction which showed how much he stood in need of water  much refreshed he pulled out the bible again and looked earnestly at it  strange he said in the indian tongue turning his eyes on his surgeonnurse often have i heard of men saved from death by bullets being stopped by bibles but in my case it would seem as if god had made it a key to unlock the gates of the better land  does my white father think he is going to die asked the girl in her own tongue with a look of anxiety  it may be so replied the man gently for i feel very very weak but feelings are deceptive one cannot trust them  it matters little however  if i live it is to work for jesus  if i die it is to be with jesus  but tell me little one who art thou whom the lord has sent to succour me  me is softswan daughter of the great chief bounding bull replied the girl with a look of pride when she mentioned her father which drew a slight smile from the stranger  but softswan has white blood in her veins he said and why does she sometimes speak in the language of the paleface  my mother returned the girl in a low sad tone was paleface womans from the saskatchewan  me speaks english for my husban likes it  your husbandwhat is his name  big tim  what exclaimed the wounded man with sudden energy as a flush overspread his pale face is he the son of little tim the brotherinlaw of whitewing the prairie chief  he is the son of leetil tim an this be hims house  then exclaimed the stranger with a pleased look i have reached if not the end of my journey at least a most important point in it for i had appointed to meet whitewing at this very spot and did not know when the blackfoot indian shot me that i was so near the hut  it looked like a mere accident my finding the track which leads to it near the spot where i fell but it is the lords doing  tell me softswan have you never heard whitewing and little tim speak of the paleface missionarythe preacher they used to call me  yes yes oftin answered the girl eagerly  me tinks it bees you me very glad an leetil tim he  her speech was cut short at this point by a repetition of the appalling warwhoop which had already disturbed the echoes of the gorge more than once that day  naturally the attention of softswan had been somewhat distracted by the foregoing conversation and she had allowed the indians to burst from the thicket and rush up the track a few paces before she was able to bring the bigbore gun to bear on them  slay them not softswan cried the preacher anxiously as he tried to rise and prevent her firing  we cannot escape them  he was too late  she had already pressed the trigger and the roar of the huge gun was reverberating from cliff to cliff like miniature thunder but his cry had not been too late to produce wavering in the girls wind inducing her to take bad aim so that the handful of slugs with which the piece had been charged went hissing over the assailants heads instead of killing them  the stupendous hissing and noise however had the effect of momentarily arresting the savages and inducing each man to seek the shelter of the nearest shrub  com queek cried softswan seizing the preachers hand  you be deaded soon if you not com queek  feeling the full force of this remark the wounded man exerting all his strength arose and suffered himself to be led into the hut  passing quickly out by a door at the back the preacher and the bride found themselves on a narrow ledge of rock from one side of which was the precipice down which big tim had made his perilous descent  close to their feet lay a great flat rock or natural slab two yards beyond which the ledge terminated in a sheer precipice  no escape here remarked the preacher sadly as he looked round  in my present state i could not venture down such a path even to save my life  but care not for me softswan  if you think you can escape go and  he stopped for to his amazement the girl stooped and with apparent ease raised the ponderous mass of rock above referred to as though it had been a slight wooden trapdoor and disclosed a hole large enough for a man to pass through  the preacher observed that the stone was hinged on a strong iron bar which was fixed considerably nearer to one side of it than the other  still this hinge did not account for the ease with which a mere girl lifted a ponderous mass which two or three men could not have moved without the aid of levers  but there was no time to investigate the mystery of the matter for another ringing warwhoop told that the blackfeet having recovered from their consternation had summoned courage to renew the assault  down queek said the girl looking earnestly into her companions face and pointing to the dark hole where the head of a rude ladder dimly visible showed what had to be done  it does not require much faith to trust and obey such a leader thought the preacher as he got upon the ladder and quickly disappeared in the hole  softswan lightly followed  as her head was about to disappear she raised her hand seized hold of a rough projection on the under surface of the mass of rock and drew it gently down so as to effectually close the hole leaving no trace whatever of its existence  while this was going on the blackfeet were advancing up the narrow pathway with superlative though needless caution and no small amount of timidity  each man took advantage of every scrap of cover he could find on the way up but as the owner of the hut had taken care to remove all cover that was removable they did not find much and if the defenders had been there that little would have been found to be painfully insufficient for it consisted only of rugged masses and projections of rock none of which could altogether conceal the figure of a fullgrown man  indeed it seemed inexplicable that these indians should have made this assault in broad day considering that indians in general are noted for their care of number one are particularly unwilling to meet their foes in fair open fight and seldom if ever venture to storm a place of strength except by surprise and under the cover of night  the explanation lay partly in the fact that they were aware of the advance of friends towards the place but much more in this that the party was led by the great chief rushing river a man possessed of that daring bulldog courage and reckless contempt of death which is usually more characteristic of white than of red men  when the band had by galvanic darts and rushes gained the last scrap of cover that lay between them and the little fortress rushing river gave vent to a whoop which was meant to thrill the defenders with consternation to the very centre of their being and made a gallant rush worthy of his name for the breastwork  reaching it in gasping haste he and his braves crouched for one moment at the foot of it presumably to recover wind and allow the first fire of the defenders to pass over their heads  but no first fire came and rushing river rolled his great black eyes upward in astonishment perhaps thinking that his whoop had thrilled the defenders off the face of the earth altogether  suspense they say is less endurable than actual collision with danger probably rushing river thought it so for next moment he raised his black head quickly  finding a hole in the defences he applied one of his black eyes to it and peeped through  seeing nothing he uttered another whoop and vaulted over like a squirrel tomahawk in hand ready to brain anybody or anything  seeing nobody and nothing in particular except an open door he suspected an ambush in that quarter darted round the corner of the hut to get out of the doorway line of fire and peeped back  animated by a similar spirit his men followed suit  when it became evident that no one meant to come out of the hut rushing river resolved to go in and did so with another yell and a flourish of his deadly weapon but again was he doomed to expend his courage and violence on air for he possessed too much of natural dignity to expend his wrath on inanimate furniture  of course one glance sufficed to show that the defenders had flown and it needed not the practised wit of a savage to perceive that they had retreated through the back door  in his eagerness to catch the foe the indian chief sprang after them with such a rush that nothing but a stout willow which he grasped convulsively prevented him from going over the precipice headlongchanging as it were from a river into a falland ending his career appropriately in the torrent below  when the chief had assembled his followers on the limited surface of the ledge they all gazed around them for a few seconds in silence  on one side was a sheer precipice  on another side was if we may so express it a sheerer precipice rising upward  on the third side was the steep and rugged path which looked sufficiently dangerous to arrest all save the mad or the desperate  on the fourth side was the hut  seeing all this at a glance rushing river looked mysterious and said ho  to which his men returned how  hi and hee or some other exclamation indicative of bafflement and surprise  standing on the trapdoor rock as on a sort of pulpit the chief pointed with his finger to the precipitous path and said solemnly  big tim has gone down there  he has net the wings of the hawk but he has the spirit of the squirrel or the legs of the goat  or the brains of the fool suggested a follower with a few drops of white blood in his veins which made him what boys call cheeky  of course continued rushing river still more solemnly and scorning to notice the remark of course rushing river and his braves could follow if they chose  they could do anything  but of what use would it be  as well might we follow the moosedeer when it has got a long start  big tim has got the start as rushing river wisely says remarked the cheeky comrade but he is hampered with his squaw and cannot go fast  many palefaces are hampered by their squaws and cannot go fast retorted the chief by which reply he meant to insinuate that the few drops of white blood in the veins of the cheeky one might yet come through an experience to which a pure indian would scorn to submit but continued the chief after a pause to let the stab take full effect but softswan is well known  she is strong as the mountain sheep and fleet as the mustang  she will not hamper big tim  enough we will let them go and take possession of their goods  whatever the chiefs followers might have thought about the first part of his speech there was evidently no difference of opinion as to the latter part  with a series of assenting hos hows his and hees they returned with him into the hut and began to appropriate the property commencing with a cold haunch of venison which they discovered in the larder and to which they did ample justice sitting in a circle on the floor in the middle of the little room  leaving them there we will return to softswan and her new friend  the place is very dark remarked the preacher groping cautiously about after the trapdoor was closed as above described  stan still i vill strik light said softswan  in a few moments sparks were seen flying from flint and steel and after one or two unsuccessful efforts a piece of tinder was kindled  then the girls pretty little nose and lips were seen of a fiery red colour as she blew some dry grass and chips into a flame and kindled a torch therewith  the light revealed a small natural cavern of rock not much more than six feet high and ten or twelve wide but of irregular shape and extending into obscurity in one direction  the only objects in the cave besides the ladder by which they entered it were a few barrels partially covered with deerskin an unusually small table rudely but strongly made and an enormous mass of rock enclosed in a net of strong rope which hung from an iron hook in the roof  the last object at once revealed the mystery of the trapdoor  it formed a ponderous counterpoise attached to the smaller section of the stone slab and so nearly equalised the weight on the hinge that as we have seen softswans weak arm was sufficient to turn the scale  the instant the torch flared up the girl stuck it into a crevice in the wall and quickly grasping the little table pushed it under the pendent rock  it reached to within half an inch of the mass  picking up two broad wooden wedges that lay on the floor she thrust them between the rock and the table one on either side so as to cause it to rest entirely on the table and thus by removing its weight from the iron hook the slab was rendered nearly immovable  she was anxiously active in these various operations for already the indians had entered the hut and their voices could be distinctly heard overhead  now she whispered with a sigh of relief six mans not abil to move the stone even if he knowed the hole is blow it  it is an ingenious device said the preacher throwing his exhausted form on a heap of pine branches which lay in a corner  who invented ityour husband  no it was leetil tim returned the girl with a low musical laugh big tim says hims fadder be great at ventions  he vent many tings somes good somes bad an somes funny  the preacher could not forbear smiling at this account of his old friend in spite of his anxiety lest the indians who were regaling themselves overhead should discover their retreat  he had begun to put some questions to softswan in a low voice when he was rendered dumb and his blood seemed to curdle as he heard stumbling footsteps approaching from the dark end of the cavern  then was heard the sound of some one panting vehemently  next moment a man leaped into the circle of light and seized the indian girl in his arms  thank god he exclaimed fervently not too late  i had thought the reptiles had been too much for thee soft one  ah me  i fear that some poor paleface has he stopped abruptly for at that moment big tims eye fell upon the wounded man  what he exclaimed hastening to the preachers side you have got here after all  ay young man through the goodness of god i have reached this haven of rest  your words seem to imply that you had half expected to find me though how you came to know of my case at all is to me a mystery  my white father returned big tim referring as much to the preachers age and pure white hair as to his connection with the white men finds mystery where the hunter and the red man see none  i went out apurpose to see that it was not my daddy the blackfoot reptiles had shot and soon came across your tracks which showed me as plain as a book that you was badly wounded  i followed the tracks for a bit expectin to find you lyin dead somewheres when the whoops of the reptiles turned me back but tell me white father are you not the preacher that my daddy and whitewing used to know some twenty years agone  i am and fain would i meet with my former friends once more before i die  you shall meet with them i doubt not replied the young hunter arranging the couch of the wounded man more comfortably  i see that my soft one has bandaged you up and shes better than the best o sawbones at such work  ill be able to make you more comfortable when we drive the reptiles out o  call them not reptiles interrupted the preacher gently  they are the creatures of god like ourselves  it may be so white father nevertheless they are uncommon low mean sneakin savage critters an thats all that ive got to do with  you say truth big tim returned the preacher and that is also all that i have got to do with but you and i take different methods of correcting the evil  every man must walk in the ways to which he was natrally born rejoined the young hunter with a dark frown as the sound of revelry in the hut overhead became at the moment much louder my way wi them may not be the best in the world but you shall see in a few minutes that it is a way which will cause the very marrow of the repof the dear crittersto frizzle in their bones    chapter seven  big tims method with savages  i sincerely hope said the wounded man with a look of anxiety that the plan you speak of does not involve the slaughter of these men  it does not replied big tim though if it did it would be serving them right for they would slaughter you and meay and even softswan thereif they could lay hold of us  is it too much to ask the son of my old friend to let me know what his plans are  a knowledge of them would perhaps remove my anxiety which i feel pressing heavily on me in my present weak condition  besides i may be able to counsel you  although a man of peace my life has been but too frequently mixed up with scenes of war and bloodshed  in truth my mission on earth is to teach those principles which if universally acted on would put an end to bothperhaps i should have said my mission is to point men to that saviour who is an embodiment of the principles of love and peace and goodwill  for a few seconds the young hunter sat on the floor of the cave in silence with his hands clasped round his knees and his eyes cast down as if in meditation  at last a smile played on his features and he looked at his questioner with a humorous twinkle in his eyes  well my white father he said i see no reason why i should not explain the matter to my daddys old friend but ill have to say my say smartly for by the stamping and yells o the repo the blackfeet overhead i perceive that theyve got hold o my casebottle o rum an if i dont stop them theyll pull the old hut down about their ears  well you must know that my daddy left the settlements in his young days continued big tim an took to a rovin life on the prairies an mountains but praps he told you that long ago  no  well he served for some time at a queer sort o tradethe makin o fireworks them rediklous things they call squibs crackers rockets an roman candles with which the foolish folk o the settlements blow their money into smoke for the sake o ticklin their fancies for a few minutes  well when he came here of course he had no use for sitch tomfooleries but once or twice when he wanted to astonish the natives he got hold o some pothicarys stuff an wi gunpowder an charcoal concocted some things that wellnigh drove the red men out o their senses an got daddy to be regarded as a great medicineman  of course he kep it secret how he produced the surprisin firesan to say truth i think from my own experience that if he had tried to explain it to em they could have made neither head nor tail ot  for a long time arter that he did nothin more in that way till one time when the blackfeet came an catched daddy an me nappin in this very hut and we barely got off wi the scalps on our heads by scrambling down the precipice where the reptiles didnt like to follow  when they left the place they took all our odds an ends wi them an set fire to the hut arter they was gone we set to work an built a noo hut  then daddy whos got an amazin turn for inventin thingsset to work to concoct suthin for the reptiles if they should pay us another visit  it was at that time he thought of turnin this cave to account as a place o refuge when hard pressed an hit on the plan for liftin the big stone easy which no doubt youve obsarved  yes softswan has explained it to me  but what about your plan with the indians said the preacher  im comin to that replied the hunter  well daddy set to work an made a lot o fireworksbig squibs an them sort o crackers i forget what you call em that jumps about as if they was not only alive but possessed with evil spirits  i know themzigzag crackers said the preacher somewhat amused  thats them cried big tim with an eager look as if the mere memory of them were exciting  well daddy he fixed up a lot o the big squibs an roman candles round the walls o the hut in such a way that they all pinted from ivery corner above an below to the centre of the hut right in front o the fireplace so that their fire should all meet so to speak in a focus  then he chiselled out a lot o little holes in the stone walls in such a way that they could not be seen and in every hole he put a zigzag cracker an he connected the whole affairsquibs candles and crackerswith an instantaneous fuse the end of which he trained down through a hole cut in the solid rock into this here cave an theres the end of it right opposite to yer nose  he pointed as he spoke to a part of the wall of the cavern where a small piece of what seemed like white tape projected about half an inch from the stone  has it ever been tried asked the preacher who despite his weak and wounded condition could hardly restrain a laugh as the young hunter described his fathers complicated arrangements  no we hant tried it yet cause the reptiles havent bin here since but daddy whos a very thoroughgoin man has given the things a complete overhaul once a month ever sincecept when he was away on long expeditionsso as to make sure the stuff was dry an in workin order  now added the young man rising and lighting a piece of tinder at the torch on the wall its about time that we should putt it to the test  if things dont go wrong youll hear summat koorious overhead before long  he applied a light to the quickmatch as he spoke and awaited the result  in order that the reader may observe that result more clearly we will transport him to the scene of festivity in the little fortress above  as big tim correctly surmised the savages had discovered the hunters store of rum just after eating as much venison as they could comfortably consume  firewater as is well known tells with tremendous effect on the excitable nerves and minds of indians  in a very few minutes it produced as in many white men a tendency to become garrulous  while in this stage the savages began to boast if possible more than usual of their prowess in chase and war and as their potations continued they were guilty of that undignified actso rare among red men and so common among whitesof interrupting and contradicting each other  this condition is the sure precursor of the quarrelsome and fighting stage of drunkenness  they had almost reached it when rushing river rose to his feet for the purpose of making a speech  usually the form of the chief was as firm as the rock on which he stood  at this time however it swayed very slightly to and fro and in his eyeswhich were usually noted for the intensity of their eagle glancethere was just then an owlish blink as they surveyed the circle of his braves  indeed rushing river as he stood there looking down into the upturned faces observedwith what feelings we know notthat these braves sometimes exhibited a few of the same owlish blinks in their earnest eyes  my bbraves said the chief and then evidently forgetting what he intended to say he put on one of those looks of astonishing solemnity which firewater alone is capable of producing  my bbraves he began again looking sternly round the almost breathless and expectant circle when we left our llodges in the mmountains this morning the sun was rising  he paused and this being an emphatic truism was received with an equally emphatic ho of assent  nnow continued the chief with a gentle sway to the right which he corrected with an abrupt jerk to the left nnow the sun is about to descend and wwe are here  feeling that he had made a decided point he drew himself up and blinked while his audience gave vent to another ho in tones which expressed the ideawaiting for more  the comrade however whose veins were fired or chilled with the few drops of white blood ventured to assert his independence by ejaculating hum  bounding bull cried the chief suddenly shifting ground and glaring while he breathed hard and showed his teeth is a coward  his daughter softswan is a chickenhearted squaw and her husband big tim is a skunkso is little tim his father  these remarks being thoroughly in accord with the sentiments of the braves were received with a storm of hos hows his and hees which effectually drowned the cheeky ones hums and greatly encouraged the chief who thereafter broke forth in a flow of language which was more in keeping with his name  after a few boastful references to the deeds of himself and his forefathers he went into an elaborate and exaggerated description of the valorous way in which they had that day stormed the fort of their paleface enemies and driven them out after which losing somehow the thread of his discourse he fell back on an appallingly solemn look blinked and sat down  this was the signal for the recurrence of the approving hos and his the gratifying effect of which however was slightly marred when silence was restored by a subdued hum from the cheeky comrade  directing a fierce glance at that presumptuous brave rushing river was about to give vent to words which might have led on to the fighting stage when he was arrested and with his men almost petrified by a strange fizzing noise which seemed to come from the earth directly below them  incomprehensible sounds are at all times more calculated to alarm than sounds which we recognise  the report of a rifle the yell of a foe could not have produced such an effect on the savages as did that fizzing sound  each man grasped his tomahawk but sat still and turned pale  the fizzing sound was interspersed with one or two cracks which intensified the alarm but did not clear up the mystery  if they had only known what to do they would have done it what danger to face they would have faced it but to sit there inactive with the mysterious sounds increasing was almost intolerable  rushing river of all the band maintained his character for reckless hardihood  he sat there unblenched and apparently unmoved though it was plain that he was intensely watchful and ready  but the foe assailed him where least expected  in a little hole right under the very spot on which he sat lay one of the zigzag crackers  its first crack caused the chief despite his power of will and early training to bound up as if an electric battery had discharged him  the second crack sent the eccentric thing into his face  its third vagary brought it down about his knees  its fourth sent it into the gaping mouth of the cheeky one  at the same instant the squibs and candles burst forth from all points pouring their fires on the naked shoulders of the red men with a hiss that the whole serpent race of america might have failed to equal while the other zigzags went careering about as if the hut were filled with evil spirits  to say that the savages yelled and jumped and stamped and roared were but a tame remark  after a series of wild bursts in sudden and violent confusion which words cannot describe they rushed in a compact body to the door  of course they stuck fast  rushing river went at them like a batteringram and tried to force them through but failed  the cheeky comrade with a better appreciation of the possibilities of the case took a short run and a header right over the struggling mass a la harlequin and came down on his shoulders outside without breaking his neck  guessing the state of things by the nature of the sounds big tim removed the table from under the ponderous weight lifted the readjusted trapdoor and springing up darted into the hut just in time to bestow a parting kick on the last man that struggled through running to the breastwork he beheld his foes tumbling rushing crashing bounding down the track like maniacswhich indeed they were for the time beingand he succeeded in urging them to even greater exertions by giving utterance to a grand resonant british cheer which had been taught him by his father and had indeed been used by him more than once with signal success against his indian foes  returning to the cavern after the indians had vanished into their native woods big tim assisted the preacher up the ladder and taking him into the hut after the smoke of the fireworks had cleared away placed him in his own bed  you resemble your father in face big tim but not in figure said the missionary when he had recovered from the exhaustion caused by his recent efforts and excitement  my white father says truth replied the hunter with slightly humorous glances at his huge limbs  daddy is little but he is stronguncommon strong  he used to be so when i knew him returned the preacher and i dare say the twenty years that have passed since then have not changed him much for he is a good deal younger than i amabout the same age i should suppose as my old friend whitewing  yes thats so said the hunter theyre both about fiveanforty or thereaway though i doubt if either o them is quite sure about his age  an theyre both beginning to be grizzled about the scalplocks  your father although somewhat reckless in his disposition continued the preacher after a pause was a man of earnest mind  thats a fact an no mistake returned big tim examining a pot of soup which his bride had put on the fire to warm up for their visitor i doubt if ever i saw a more arnestminded man than daddy especially when he tackles his victuals or gets on the track of a grizzly bar  the missionary smiled in spite of himself as he explained that the earnestness he referred to was connected rather with the soul and the spiritual world than with this sublunary sphere  well he is arnest about that too returned the hunter  he has often told me that he didnt use to trouble his head about such matters long ago but after that time when he met you on the prairies he had been led to think a deal more about em  hes a queer man is daddy an putts things to ye in a queer way sometimes  timmy says he to me oncehe calls me timmy out o fondness you knowtimmy says he if you comed up to a great thick glass wall not very easy to see through wi a door in it an you was told that some day that door would open an youd have to go through an live on the other side o that glass wall youd be koorious to know the lie o the land on the other side o that wall wouldnt you and what sort o customers youd have to consort wi there eh  yes daddy says i you say right an id be a great fool if i didnt take a good long squint now an again  well timmy says he this world is that glass wall an death is the door through it an the bible that the preacher gave me long ago is the book that helps to clear up the glass an enable us to see through it a little better an a blackfoot bullet or arrow may open the door to you an me any day so id advise you lad to take a good squint now an again  an ive done it too preacher ive done it but theres a deal on it that i dont rightly understand  that i do not wonder at my young friend and i hope that if god spares me i may be able to help you a little in this matter  but what of whitewing  has he never tried to assist you  tried  he just has but the chief is too deep for me most times  he seems to have a wonderful grip o these things himself an many a long palaver he has wi my daddy about em  whitewing does little else in fact but go about among his people far an near tellin them about their lost condition and the saviour of sinners  he has even venturd to visit a tribe o the blackfeet but his great enemy rushin river has sworn to scalp him if he gets hold of him so weve done our best to hold him backdaddy an mefor it would be of no use preachin to such a doubledyed villain as rushin river  that is one of the things returned the preacher that you do not quite understand big tim for it was to such men as he that our saviour came  indeed i have returned to this part of the country for the very purpose of visiting the blackfoot chief in company with whitewing  both you and whitewing will be scalped if you do said the young hunter almost sternly  i trust not returned the preacher and we hope to induce your father to go with us  then daddy will be scalped too said big timan so will i for im bound to keep daddy company  it is to be hoped your gloomy expectations will not be realised returned the preacher  but tell me where is your father just now  out hunting not far off replied the youth with an anxious look to say truth i dont feel quite easy about him for hes bin away longer than usual or than theres any occasion for  if he doesnt return soon ill have to go an sarch for him  as the hunter spoke the hooting of an owl was distinctly heard outside the preacher looked up inquiringly for he was too well acquainted with the ways of indians not to know that the cry was a signal from a biped without wings  he saw that big tim and his bride were both listening intently with expressions of joyful expectation on their faces  again the cry was heard much nearer than before  whitewing exclaimed the hunter leaping up and hastening to the door  softswan did not move but continued silently to stir the soup in the pot on the fire  presently many footsteps were heard outside and the sound of men conversing in low tones  another moment and a handsome middleaged indian stood in the doorway  with an expression of profound sorrow he gazed for one moment at the wounded man then striding forward knelt beside him and grasped his hand  my white father he said  whitewing exclaimed the preacher i little expected that our meeting should be like this  is the preacher badly hurt asked the indian in a low voice  it may be so i cannot tell  my feelings lead me toto doubti was going to say fear but i have nothing to fear  he doeth all things well  if my work on earth is not done i shall live if it is finished i shall die    chapter eight  netting a grizzly bear  as it is at all times unwise as well as disagreeable to involve a reader in needless mystery we may as well explain here that there would have been no mystery at all in little tims prolonged absence from his fortress if it had not been that he was aware of the intended visit of his chum and brotherinlaw whitewing and his old friend the palefaced missionary and that he had promised to return on the evening of the day on which he set off to hunt or on the following morning at latest  moreover little tim was a man of his word having never within the memory of his oldest friend been known to break it  thus it came to pass that when three days had passed away and the sturdy little hunter failed to return big tim and his bride first became surprised and then anxious  the attack on the hut however and the events which we have just related prevented the son from going out in search of the father but now that the blackfeet had been effectually repulsed and the fortress relieved by the arrival of whitewings party it was resolved that they should organise a search for the absentee without an hours delay  leetil tim said whitewing decisively when he was told of his old friends unaccountable absence must be found  so say i returned big tim  i hope the blackfoot reptiles havent got him  mayhap he has cut himself with his hatchet  anyhow we must go at once  you wont mind our leaving you for a bit he added turning to the missionary we will leave enough o redskins to guard you and my soft one will see to it that you are comfortable  think not of me replied the preacher  all will go well i feel assured  still further to guard the reader from supposing that there is any mystery connected with the missionarys name or little tims surname we think it well to state at once that there is absolutely none  in those outlandish regions and among that primitive people the forming of names by the mere combination of unmeaning syllables found small favour they named people according to some striking quality or characteristic hence our missionary had been long known among the red men of the west as the preacher and being quite satisfied with that name he accepted it without making any attempt to bamboozle the children of the woods and prairies with his real name which wasand isa matter of no importance whatever  tim likewise being short of stature though very much the reverse of weak or diminutive had accepted the name of little tim with a good grace and made mention of no other his son naturally becoming big tim when he outgrew his father  a search expedition having been quickly organised it left the little fortress at once and defiled into the thick woods led by whitewing and big tim  in order that the reader may fully understand the cause of little tims absence we will take the liberty of pushing on in advance of the search party and explain a few matters as we go  it has already been shown that our little hunter possessed a natural ingenuity of mind  this quality had indeed been noticeable when he was a boy but it did not develop largely till he became a man  as he grew older his natural ingenuity seemed to become increasingly active until his thirst for improving on mechanical contrivances and devising something new became almost a passion  hence he was perpetually occupied in scheming to improveas he was wont to saythe material condition of the human race as well as the mental  among other things he improved the traps of his indian friends and also their dwellings  he invented new traps and as we have seen new methods of defending dwellings as well as of escaping when defence failed  his name of course became well known in the indian country and as some of his contrivances proved to be eminently useful he was regarded far and near as a great medicineman who could do whatever he set his mind to  without laying claim to such unlimited powers little tim was quite content to leave the question of his capacity to scheme and invent as much a matter of uncertainty in the minds of his red friends as it was in his own mind  one day there came to the indian village in which he dwelt at the time with his still pretty though matronly wife brighteyes one of the agents of a man whose business it was to collect wild animals for the menageries of the united states and elsewhere  probably this man was an ancestor of barnum for he possessed a mind which seemed to be capable of conceiving anything and sticking at nothing  he found a man quite after his own heart when he discovered little tim  i want a grizzly bar he said on being introduced to the hunter  theres plenty of em in these parts said tim who was whittling a piece of wood at the time  but i want a fullgrown old un said the agent  well remarked tim looking up with an inquiring glance for a moment i should say theres some thousands more or less roamin about the rockies in all stages of oldnessfrom experienced mammas to greatgrandmothers to say nothin o the old gentlemen but youll find most of em powerful sly an uncommon hard to kill  but i dont want to kill em i want one of em alive said the agent  at this little tim stopped whittling the bit of stick and looked hard at the man  you wants to catch one alive he repeated  yes thats whats the matter with me exactly  i want it for a show an im prepared to give a good price for a big one  how much asked the hunter  the stranger bent down and whispered in his ear  little tim raised his eyebrows a little and resumed whittling  but said he after a few moments vigorous knifework what if i should try an fail  then you get nothing  wont do returned the little hunter with a slow shake of the head im game to tackle difficulties for love or money but not for nothin  youll have to go to another shop stranger  well what will you try it for asked the agent who was unwilling to lose his man  for quarter o the sum down to be kep whether i succeed or fail the balance to be paid when i hand over the goods  well stranger returned the agent with a grim smile i dont mind if i agree to that  you seem an honest man  sorry i cant return the compliment said little tim holding out his hand  so cash down if you please  the agent laughed but pulled out a huge leathern bag and paid the stipulated sum in good undeniable silver dollars  the hunter at once made preparation for his enterprise  meanwhile the agent took up his abode in the indian village to await the result  after a night of profound meditation in the solitude of his wigwam little tim set to work and cut up several fresh buffalo hides into long and strong lines with which he made a net of enormous mesh and strength he arranged it in such a way with a line run round the circumference that he could draw it together like a purse  with this gigantic affair on his shoulder he set off one morning at daybreak into the mountains he met the agent who was an early riser on the threshold of the village  what goin out alone little tim he said  yes bars dont like company as a rule  dont you think i might help you a bit  no i dont  if you stop where you are ill very likely bring the bar home to ee  if you go with me its more than likely the bar will take you home to her small family  well well have it your own way returned the agent laughing  i always do replied the hunter with a grin  proceeding a days journey into the mountains our adventurous hunter discovered the track of a bear which must he thought be an uncommonly large one  selecting a convenient tree he stuck four slender poles into the ground under one of its largest branches  over these he spread his net arranging the closing ropeor what we may term the pursestringin such a way that he could pass it over the branch of the tree referred to  this done he placed a large junk of buffalomeat directly under the net and pegged it to the ground  thereafter little tim ascended the tree crept out on the large limb until he reached the spot where the line had been thrown over it directly above his net  there seating himself comfortably among the branches he proceeded to sup and enjoy himself despite the unsavoury smell that arose from the halfdecayed buffalomeat below  the limb of the tree was so large and suitable that while a fork of it was wide enough to serve for a table a branch which grew upwards formed a lean to the hunters back and another branch doubling round most conveniently formed a rest for his right elbow  at the same time an abrupt curl in the same branch constituted a rest for his gun  thus he reclined in a natural onearmed rustic chair with his weapons handy and a good supper before him  what could a man wish more he muttered to himself with a contented expression of face as he fixed a square piece of birchbark in the fork of the branch and on this platter arranged his food commenting thereon as he proceeded roast prairie hen  capital grub with a bit o salt pork though rather dry an woodenylike by itself  buffalo rib nothin better hot or cold except marrowbones but then you see marrowbones aint just parfection unless hot an this is bound to be a cold supper  hunk o pemmican  a safe standby at all times  dont need no cookin an a just proportion o fat to lean but doesnt do without appetite to make it go down  let me be thankful ive got that anyhow  at this point little tim thought it expedient to make the line of his net fast to this limb of the tree  after doing so he examined the priming of his gun made a few other needful arrangements and then gave himself up to the enjoyment of the hour smiling benignly to the moon which happened to creep out from behind a mountain peak at the time as if on purpose to irradiate the scene  it has always seemed to me muttered the hunter as well as a large mouthful of the prairie hen would permitfor he was fond of muttering his thoughts when alone it felt more sociable you see than merely thinking themit has always seemed to me that contentment is a grand thing for the human race  pity we hasnt all got it  inserting at this point a mass of the hunk which proved a little too large for muttering purposes he paused until the road was partially cleared and then went onof course i dont mean that lazy sort o contentment that makes a man feel easy an comfortable an quite indifferent to the woes an worries of other men so long as his own breadbasket is stuffed full  no no  i means that sort o contentment that makes a man feel happy though he hasnt got champagne an taters pigeonpie lobscouse plumduff mustard an jam at every blowout that sort o contentment that takes things as they come an enjoys em without grumpin an growlin cause he hasnt got somethin else  another hunk here stopping the way a somewhat longer silence ensued which would probably have been broken as before by the outpouring of some sage reflections but for a slight sound which caused the hunter to become what we may style a human petrifaction with a halfchewed morsel in its open jaws and its eyes glaring  a few seconds more and the sound of breaking twigs gave evidence that a visitor drew near  little tim bolted the unchewed morsel hastily sheathed his huntingknife laid one hand on the end of his line and waited  he had not to wait long for out of the woods there sauntered a grizzly bear of such proportions that the hunter at first thought the moonlight must have deceived him  sartinly its the biggest that ive ever clapped eyes on he thought but he did not speak or move  so anxious was he not to scare the animal that he hardly breathed  bruin seemed to entertain suspicions of some sort for he sniffed the tainted air once or twice and looked inquiringly round  coming to the conclusion apparently that his suspicions were groundless he walked straight up to the lump of buffalomeat and sniffed it  not being particular he tried it with his tongue  good said the bearat least if he did not say so he must have thought so for next moment he grasped it with his teeth  finding it tethered hard and fast he gathered himself together for the purpose of exercising main force  now was little tims opportunity  slipping a cord by which the net was suspended to the four stakes he caused it to descend like a curtain over the bear  it acted most successfully insomuch that the animal was completely enveloped  surprised but obviously not alarmed bruin shook his head sniffed a little and pawed the part of the net in front of him  the hunter wasted no time  seeing that the net was all right he pulled with all his might on the main rope which partly drew the circumference of the net together  finding his feet slightly trammelled the grizzly tried to move off but of course trod on the net tripped and rolled over in so doing he caught sight of the hunter who was now enabled to close the mouth of the netpurse completely  being by that time convinced apparently that he was the victim of foul play the bear lost his temper and tried to rise  he tripped as before came down heavily on his side and hit the back of his head against a stone  this threw him into a violent rage and he began to bounce  at all times bouncing is ineffectual and silly even in a grizzly bear the only result was that he bruised his head and nose tumbled among stones and stumps and strained the rope so powerfully that the limb of the tree to which it was attached was violently shaken and little tim was obliged to hold on to avoid being shaken off  experience teaches bears as well as fools  on discovering that it was useless to bounce he sat down in a disconsolate manner poked as much as he could of his nose through one of the meshes and sniggered at little tim who during these outbursts was naturally in a state of great excitement  then the bear went to work leisurely to gnaw the mesh close to his mouth  the hunter was not prepared for this  he had counted on the creature struggling with its net till it was in a state of complete exhaustion when by means of additional ropes it could be so wound round and entangled in every limb as to be quite incapable of motion  in this condition it might be slung to a long pole and carried by a sufficient number of men to the small but immensely strong cage on wheels which the agent had brought with him  not only was there the danger of the bear breaking loose and escaping or rendering it necessary that he should be shot but there was another risk which little tim had failed at first to note  the scene on which he had decided to play out his little game was on the gentle slope of a hill which terminated in a precipice of considerable height and each time the bear struggled and rolled over in his network purse he naturally gravitated towards the precipice over which he was certain to go if the rope which held him to the tree should snap  the hunter had just become thoroughly alive to this danger when with a tremendous struggle the bear burst two of the meshes in rear and his hindquarters were free  little tim seized his gun feeling that the crisis had come  he was loath to destroy the creature and hesitated  instead of backing out of his prison as he might easily have done the bear made use of his free hind legs to make a magnificent bound forward  he was checked of course by the rope but tim had miscalculated the strength of his materials  a much stronger rope would have broken under the tremendous strain  the line parted like a piece of twine and the bear rolling head over heels down the slope bounded over the precipice and went hurling out into space like a mighty football  there was silence for a few seconds then a simultaneous thud and bursting cry that was eminently suggestive  hm  its all over sighed little tim as he slid down the branch to the ground  and so it was  the bear was effectually killed and the poor hunter had to return to the indian village crestfallen  but hold on stranger he said on meeting the agent dont you give way to despair  i said there was lots of em in these parts  you come with me up to a hut my sons got in the mountains an ill circumvent a bar for you yet  you cant take the cart quite up to the hut but you can git near enough at a place where theres a injin friend o mine asll take care of ye  the agent agreed and thus it came to pass that at the time of which we now write little tim was doing his best to catch a live bear but not liking to be laughed at even by his son in the event of failure he had led him and his bride to suppose that he had merely gone out hunting in the usual way  it was on this expedition that little tim had set forth when whitewing was expected to arrive at tims follyas the little hut or fortress had come to be namedand it was the anxiety of his friends and kindred at his prolonged absence which resulted as we have seen in the formation and departure of a search expedition    chapter nine  a daring exploit  to practised woodsmen like whitewing and big tim it was as easy to follow the track of little tim as if his steps had been taken through newlyfallen snow although very few and slight were the marks left on the green moss and rugged ground over which the hunter had passed  six picked indians accompanied the prairie chief and these marched in single file each treading in the footsteps of the man in front with the utmost care  at first the party maintained absolute silence  their way lay for some distance along the margin of the brawling stream which drained the gorge at the entrance of which tims folly stood  the scenery around them was wild and savage in the extreme for the higher they ascended the narrower became the gorge and the masses of rock which had fallen from the frowning cliffs on either side had strewn the lower ground with shapeless blocks and so impeded the natural flow of the little stream that it became as it were a tormented and foaming cataract  at the head of the gorge the party came to a pass or height of land through which they went with caution for although no footsteps of man had thus far been detected by their keen eyes save those of little tim it was not beyond the bounds of possibility that foes might be lurking on the other side of the pass  no one however was discovered and when they emerged at the other end of the pass it was plain that as big tim remarked the coast was clear for from their commanding position they could see an immeasurable distance in front of them over an unencumbered stretch of land  the view from this point was indeed stupendous  the vision seemed to range not only over an almost limitless world of forests lakes and riversaway to where the haze of the horizon seemed to melt with them into spacebut beyond that to where the great backbone of the new world rose sharp clear and gigantic above the mists of earth until they reached and mingled with the fleecy clouds of heaven  to judge from their glittering eyes even the souls of the not very demonstrative indians were touched by the scene  as for the prairie chief who had risen to the perceptions of the new life in christ he halted and stood for some moments as if lost in contemplation  then turning to the young hunter at his side he said softly  the works of the lord are great  strange returned big tim that you should use the very same words that ive heard my daddy use sometimes when weve come upon a grand view like that  not so strange when i tell you replied whitewing that these are words from the book of manitou and that your father and i learned them together long ago from the preacher who now lies wounded in your hut  ay ay  daddy didnt tell me that  hes not half so given to serious talk as you are whitewing though im free to admit that he does take a fit o that sort now an again and seems raither fond of it  the fact is i dont quite understand daddy  he puzzles me  perhaps leetil tim is too much given to fun when he talks with big tim suggested the red chief gravely but with a slight twinkle in his eyes which told that he was not quite destitute of little tims weaknessor strength as the reader chooses  after a brief halt the party descended the slope which led to the elevated valley they had now reached and having proceeded a few miles again came to a halt because the ground had become so rocky that the trail of the hunter was lost  ordering the young men to spread themselves over the ground whitewing went with big tim to search over the ridge of a neighbouring eminence  it is as i expected he said coming to a sudden stand and pointing to a faint mark on the turf  leetil tim has taken the short cut to the lopstick hill but i cannot guess the reason why  big tim was down on his knees examining the footprints attentively  daddys futt an no mistake he said rising slowly  id know the print of his heel among a thousand  hes got a sort o swagger of his own an puts it down with a crash as if he wanted to leave his mark wherever he goes  ive often tried to cure him o that but hes incurable  i have observed returned the chief with if possible increased gravity that many sons are fond of trying to cure their fathers also that they never succeed  big tim looked quickly at his companion and laughed  well well he said the daddies have a good go at us in youth  its but fair that we should have a turn at them afterwards  a sharp signal from one of the young indians in the distance interrupted further converse and drew them away to see what he had discovered  it was obvious enoughthe trail of the blackfoot indians retiring into the mountains  at first big tims heart sank for this discovery coupled with the prolonged absence of his father suggested the fear that he had been waylaid and murdered  but a further examination led them to thinkat least to hopethat the savages had not observed the hunters trail owing to his having diverged at a point of the track further down where the stony nature of the ground rendered trailfinding as we have seen rather difficult  still there was enough to fill the breasts of both son and friend with anxiety and to induce them to push on thereafter swiftly and in silence  let us once again take flight ahead of them and see what the object of their anxiety is doing  true to his promise to try his best the dauntless little hunter had proceeded alone as before to a part of the mountain region where he knew from past experience that grizzlies were to be easily found  there he made his preparations for a new effort on a different plan  the spot he selected for his enterprise was an open space on a bleak hillside where the trees were scattered and comparatively small  this latter peculiaritythe smallness of the treeswas indeed the only drawback to the place for few of them were large enough to bear his weight and afford him a secure protection from his formidable game  at last however he found onenot indeed quite to his mind but sufficiently large to enable him to get well out of a bears reach for it must be remembered that although some bears climb trees easily the grizzly bear cannot climb at all  there was a branch on the lower part of the tree which seemed quite beyond the reach of the tallest bear even on tiptoe  having made his disposition very much as on the former occasion little tim settled himself on this branch and awaited the result  he did not however sit as comfortably as on the previous occasion for the branch was small and had no fork  neither did he proceed to sup as formerly for it was yet too early in the day to indulge in that meal  his plan this time was not to net but to lasso the bear and for that purpose he had provided four powerful ropes made of strips of raw undressed buffalo hide plaited with a running noose on each  now said little tim with a selfsatisfied smirk as he seated himself on the branch and surveyed the four ropes complacently itll puzzle the biggest bar in all the rocky mountains to break them ropes  any one acquainted with the strength of the material which tim began to uncoil would have at once perceived that the lines in question might have held an elephant or a small steamer  i hope murmured tim struggling with a knot in one of the cords that bound the coils i hope ill be in luck today an wont have to wait long  little tims hope reached fruition sooner than he had expectedsooner even than he desiredfor as he spoke he heard a rustle in the bushes behind him  looking round quickly he beheld the biggest bar out o sight that he had iver seen in all his life  so great was his surprisewe would not for a moment call it alarmthat he let slip the four coils of rope which fell to the ground  grizzly bears it must be known are gifted with insatiable curiosity and they are not troubled much with the fear of man or indeed of anything else  hearing the thud of the coils on the ground this monster grizzly walked up to and smelt them  he was proceeding to taste them when happening to cast his little eyes upwards he beheld little tim sitting within a few feet of his head  to rise on his hind legs and solicit a nearer interview was the work of a moment  to the poor hunters alarm when he stretched his tremendous paws and claws to their utmost he reached to within a foot of the branch  of course little tim knew that he was safe but he was obliged to draw up his legs and lay out on the branch which brought his head and eyes horribly near to the nose and projecting tongue of the monster  to make matters worse tim had left his gun leaning against the stem of the tree  he had his knife and hatchet in his belt but these he knew too well were but feeble weapons against such a foe  besides his object was not to slay but to secure  seeing that there was no possibility of reaching the hunter by means of mere length of limb and not at that time having acquired the art of building a stone pedestal for elevating purposes the bear dropped on its four legs and looked round  perceiving the gun it went leisurely up and examined it  the examination was brief but effective  it gave the gun only one touch with its paw but that touch broke the lock and stock and bent the barrel so as to render the weapon useless  then it returned to the coil of ropes and sitting down began to chew one of them keeping a serious eye however on the branch above  it was a perplexing situation even for a backwoodsman  the branch on which tim lay was comfortable enough having many smaller branches and twigs extending from it on either side so that he did not require to hold on very tightly to maintain his position  but he was fully aware of the endurance and patience of grizzly bears and knew that having nothing else to do this particular bruin could afford to bide his time  and now the ruling characteristic of little tim beset him severely  his head felt like a bombshell of fermenting ingenuity  every device mechanical and otherwise that had ever passed through his brain since childhood seemed to rush back upon him with irresistible violence in his hopeless effort to conceive some plan by which to escape from his present and pressing difficultyhe would not even to himself admit that there was danger  the more hopeless the case appeared to him the less did reason and commonsense preside over the fermentation  when he saw his gun broken his first anxiety began  when he reflected on the persistency of grizzlies in watching their foes his naturally buoyant spirits began to sink and his native recklessness to abate  when he saw the bear begin steadily to devour one of the lines by which he had hoped to capture it his hopes declined still more and when he considered the distance he was from his hut the fact that his provision wallet had been left on the ground along with the gun and that the branch on which he rested was singularly unfit for a restingplace on which to pass many hours he became wildly ingenious and planned to escape not only by pitching his cap to some distance off so as to distract the bears attention and enable him to slip down and run away but by devising methods of effecting his object by clockwork fireworks wings balloonsin short by everything that ever has in the history of design enabled men to achieve their ends  his first and simplest method to fling his cap away was indeed so far successful that it did distract the bears attention for a moment but it did not disturb his huge body for he sat still chewing his buffalo quid leisurely and after a few seconds looked up at his victim as though to ask what dyou mean by that  when after several hours all his attempts had failed poor little tim groaned in spirit and began to regret his having undertaken the job but a sense of the humorous even in that extremity caused him to give vent to a short laugh as he observed that bruin had managed to get several feet of the indigestible rope down his throat and fancied what a surprise it would give him if he were to get hold of the other end of the rope and pull it all out again  at last night descended on the scene making the situation much more unpleasant for the darkness tended to deceive the man as to the motions of the brute and once or twice he almost leaped off the branch under the impression that his foe had somehow grown tall enough to reach him and was on the point of seizing him with his formidable claws  to add to his troubles hunger came upon tim about his usual suppertime and what was far worse because much less endurable sleep put in a powerful claim to attention  indeed this latter difficulty became so great that hunger after a time ceased to trouble him and all his facultieseven the inventivewere engaged in a tremendous battle with this good old friend who had so suddenly been converted into an implacable foe  more than once that night did little tim despite his utmost efforts fall into a momentary sleep from which each time he awoke with a convulsive start and sharp cry to the obvious surprise of bruin who being awakened out of a comfortable nap looked up with a growl inquiringly and then relapsed  when morning broke it found the wretched man still clutching his uneasy couch and blinking like an owl at the bear which still lay comfortably on the ground below him  unable to stand it any longer tim resolved to have a short nap even if it should cost him his life  with this end in view he twined his arms and legs tightly round his branch  the very act reminded him that his worsted waistbelt might be twined round both body and branch for it was full two yards long  wondering that it had not occurred to him before he hastily undid it lashed himself to the branch as well as he could and in a moment was sound asleep  this device would have succeeded admirably had not one of his legs slowly dropped so low down as to attract the notice of the bear when it awoke rising to its full height on its hind legs and protruding its tongue to the utmost it just managed to touch tims toe  the touch acted liked an electric spark awoke him at once and the leg was drawn promptly up  but tim had had a nap and it is wonderful how brief a slumber will suffice to restore the energies of a man in robust health  he unlashed himself  good mornin to ee he said looking down  youre there yet i see  he finished the salutation with a loud yawn and stretched himself so recklessly that he almost fell off the branch into the embrace of his expectant foe  then he looked round and reason having been restored hit upon a plan of escape which seemed to him hopeful  we have said that the space he had selected was rather open but there were scattered over it several large masses of rock about the size of an ordinary cart which had fallen from the neighbouring cliffs  four of these stood in a group at about fifty yards distance from his tree  now old caleb he said ill go in for it neck or nothin  you tasted my toes this mornin  would you like to try em again  he lowered his foot as he spoke as far down as he could reach  the bear accepted the invitation at once rose up protruded his tongue as before and just managed to touch the toe  now it is scarcely needful to say that a strong man leading the life of a hunter in the rocky mountains is an athlete  tim thought no more of swinging himself up into a tree by the muscular power of his arms than you would think of stepping over a narrow ditch  when the bear was standing in its most upright attitude he suddenly swung down held on to the branch with his hands and drove both his feet with such force against the bears chin that it lost its balance and fell over backwards with an angry growl at the same moment tim dropped to the ground and made for the fallen rocks at a quicker rate than he had ever run before  bruin scrambled to his feet with amazing agility looked round saw the fugitive and gave chase  darting past the first rock it turned but little tim of course was not there  he had doubled round the second and taken refuge behind the third mass of rock  waiting a moment till the baffled bear went to look behind another rock he ran straight back again to his tree hastily gathered up his ropes and reascended to his branch where the bear found him again not many minutes later  ha  ha you old rascal he shouted as he fastened the end of a rope firmly to the branch and gathered in the slack so as to have the running noose handy  ive got you now  come come along have another taste of my toe  this invitation was given when the bear stood in his former position under the tree and looked up  once again it accepted the invitation and rose to the hunters toe as a salmon rises to an irresistible fly  thats it  now hold onjust one moment  there  as tim finished the sentence he dropped the noose so deftly over the bears head and paws that it went right down to his waist  this was an unlookedfor piece of good fortune  the utmost the hunter had hoped for was to noose the creature round the neck  moreover it was done so quickly that the monster did not seem to fully appreciate what had occurred but continued to strain and reach up at the toe in an imbecile sort of way  instead therefore of drawing the noose tight little tim dropped a second noose round the monsters neck and drew that tight becoming suddenly alive to its condition the grizzly made a backward plunge which drew both ropes tight and nearly strangled it while the branch on which tim was perched shook so violently that it was all he could do to hold on  for full half an hour that bear struggled fiercely to free itself and often did the shaken hunter fear that he had miscalculated the strength of his ropes but they stood the test well and being elastic acted in some degree like lines of indiarubber  at the end of that time the bear fell prone from exhaustion which to do him justice was more the result of semistrangulation than exertion  this was what little tim had been waiting for and expecting  quietly but quickly he descended to the ground but the bear saw him partially recovered no doubt under an impulse of rage and began to rear and plunge again compelling his foe to run to the fallen rocks for shelter when bruin had exhausted himself a second time tim ran forward and seized the old net with which he had failed to catch the previous bear and threw it over his captive  the act of course revived the lively monster but his struggles now wound him up into such a ravel with the two lines and the net that he was soon unable to get up or jump about though still able to make the very earth around him tremble with his convulsive heaves  it was at once a fine as well as an awful display of the power of brute force and the strength of raw material  little tim would have admired it with philosophic interest if he had not been too busy dancing around the writhing creature in a vain effort to fix his third rope on a hind leg  at last an opportunity offered  a leg burst one of the meshes of the net  tim deftly slipped the noose over it and made the line fast to the tree  now said he wiping the perspiration from his brow youre safe so ill have a meal  and little tim sitting down on a stone at a respectful distance applied himself with zest to the cold breakfast of which he stood so very much in need  he was thus occupied when his son with the prairie chief and his party found him  it would take at least another chapter to describe adequately the joy surprise laughter gratulation and comment which burst from the rescue party on discovering the hunter  we therefore leave it to the readers imagination  one of the young braves was at once sent off to find the agent and fetch him to the spot with his cage on wheels  the feat with much difficulty was accomplished  bruin was forcibly and very unwillingly thrust into the prison  the balance of the stipulated sum was honourably paid on the spot and now that bear isor if it is not ought to bein the zoological gardens of new york london or paris with a printed account of his catching and a portrait of little tim attached to the front of his cage    chapter ten  snakes in the grass  it was a sad but interesting council that was held in the little fortress of tims folly the day following that on which the grizzly bear was captured  the wounded missionary lying in big tims bed presided  beside him with an expression of profound sorrow on his fine face sat whitewing the prairie chief  little tim and his big son sat at his feet  the other indians were ranged in a semicircle before him  in one sense it was a red mans council but there were none of the indian formalities connected with it for the prairie chief and his followers had long ago renounced the superstitions and some of the practices of their kindred  softswan was not banished from the council chamber as if unworthy even to listen to the discussions of the lords of creation and no pipe of peace was smoked as a preliminary but a brief earnest prayer for guidance was put up by the missionary to the lord of hosts and subjects more weighty than are usually broached in the councils of savages were discussed  the preachers voice was weak and his countenance pale but the wonted look of calm confidence was still there  whitewing he said raising himself on one elbow i will speak as god gives me power but i am very feeble and feel that the discussion of our plans must be conducted chiefly by yourself and your friends  he paused and the chief with the usual dignity of the red man remained silent waiting for more  not so little tim  that worthy although gifted with all the powers of courage and endurance which mark the best of the american savages was also endowed with the white mans tendency to assert his right to wag his tongue  cheer up sir he said in a tone of encouragement you mustnt let your spirits go down  a good rest here an good grub wi softswans cookinto say nothin o her nursinwill put ye all right before long  thanks little tim returned the missionary with a smile i do cheer up or rather god cheers me  whether i recover or am called home is in his hands therefore all shall be well  but he added turning to the chief god has given us brains hands materials and opportunities to work with therefore must we labour while we can as if all depended on ourselves  the plans which i had laid out for myself he has seen fit to change and it now remains for me to point out what i aimed at so that we may accommodate ourselves to his will  sure am i that with or without my aid his work shall be done and for the restthough he slay me yet will i trust in him  again he paused and the indians uttered that soft ho of assent with which they were wont to express approval of what was said  when i left the settlements of the white men continued the preacher my object was twofold i wished to see whitewing and little tim and brighteyes and all the other dear friends whom i had known long ago before the snows of lifes winter had settled on my head but my main object was to visit rushing river the blackfoot chief and carry the blessed gospel to his people and thus while seeking the salvation of their souls also bring about a reconciliation between them and their hereditary foe bounding bull  its rushin river as is the enemy cried little tim interrupting for when his feelings were excited he was apt to become regardless of time place and persons and the allusion to his sons wifes father of whom he was very fondhad roused him  boundin bull would have bin reconciled long ago if rushin river would have listened to reason for he is a christian though im bound to say hes somethin of a queer one havin notions of his own which its not easy for other folk to understand  in which respect daddy remarked big tim using the english tongue for the moment and allowing the smallest possible smile to play on his lips bounding bull is not unlike yourself  hold yer tongue boy else ill give you a woppin said the father sternly  dumb daddy dumb replied the son meekly  it was one of the peculiarities of this father and son that they were fond of expressing their regard for each other by indulging now and then in a little very mild chaff and the playful threat to give his son a woppinwhich in earlier years he had sometimes done with much effectwas an invariable proof that little tims spirit had been calmed and his amiability restored  my white fathers intentions are good said whitewing after another pause and his faith is strong  it needs strong faith to believe that the man who has shot the preacher shall ever smoke the pipe of peace with whitewing  with god all things are possible returned the missionary  and you must not allow enmity to rankle in your own breast whitewing because of me  besides it was probably one of rushing rivers braves and not himself who shot me  in any case they could not have known who i was  im not so sure o that said big tim  the blackfoot reptile has a sharp eye an father has told me that you knew him once when you was in these parts twenty years ago  yes i knew him well returned the preacher in a low meditative voice  he was quite a little boy at the timenot more than ten years of age i should think but unusually strong and brave  i met him when travelling alone in the woods and it so happened that i had the good fortune to save his life by shooting a brown bear which he had wounded and which was on the point of killing him  i dwelt with him and his people for a time and pressed him to accept salvation through jesus but he refused  the holy spirit had not opened his eyes yet i felt and still feel assured that that time will come  but it has not come yet if all that i have heard of him be true  you may depend upon it however that he did not shoot me knowingly  both little and big tim by their looks showed that their belief in rushing rivers future reformation was very weak though they said nothing and the indians maintained such imperturbable gravity that their looks gave no indication as to the state of their minds  my white fathers hopes and desires are good said whitewing after another long pause during which the missionary closed his eyes and appeared to be resting and tim and his son looked gravely at each other for that rest seemed to them strongly to resemble death  and now what does my father propose to do  my course is clear answered the wounded man opening his eyes with a bright cheerful look  i cannot move  here god has placed me and here i must remain tilltill i get well  all the action must be on your part whitewing and that of your friends  but i shall not be idle or useless as long as life and breath are left to enable me to pray  there was another decided note of approval from the indians for they had already learned the value of prayer  the first step i would wish you to take however continued the missionary is to go and bring to this hut my sweet friend brighteyes and your own mother whitewing who you tell me is still alive  the loved old one still lives returned the indian  lives interposed little tim with emphasis i should think she does an flourishes too though she has shrivelled up a bit since you saw her last  why shes so old now that weve changed her name to liveforever  she sleeps like a top an feeds like a grampus an does little else but laugh at whats goin on around her  i never did see such a jolly old girl in all my life  twenty years agothat time you remember when whitewing carried her off on horseback when the village was attackedwe all thought she was on her last legs but bless you sir she can still stump about the camp in a tremblin sort o way an her peepers are every bit as black as those of my own brighteyes an they twinkle a deal more  your account of her returned the preacher with a little smile makes me long to see her again  indeed the sight of these two would comfort me greatly whether i live or die  they are not far distant from here you say  not far  my fathers wish shall be gratified said whitewing  after they come we will consult again and my father will be able to decide what course to pursue in winning over the blackfeet  of course the two tims and all the others were quite willing to follow the lead of the prairie chief so it was finally arranged that a party should be sent to the camp of the indians with whom brighteyes and liveforever were sojourning at the timeabout a long days march from the little fortressand bring those women to the hut that they might once again see and gladden the heart of the man whom they had formerly known as the preacher  now it is a wellascertained and undoubtable fact that the passion of love animates the bosoms of red men as well as white  it is also a curious coincidence that this passion frequently leads to modifications of action and unexpected sometimes complicated results and situations among the red as well as among the white men  bearing this in mind the reader will be better able to understand why rushing river in making a raid upon his enemies and while creeping serpentlike through the grass in order to reconnoitre previous to a night attack came to a sudden stop on beholding a young girl playing with a much younger girlindeed a little childon the outskirts of the camp  it was the old story over again  love at first sight  and no wonder for the young girl though only an indian was unusually graceful and pretty being a daughter of little tim and brighteyes  from the former moonlight as she was named inherited the freeandeasy yet modest carriage of the paleface from the latter a pretty little straight nose and a pair of gorgeous black eyes that seemed to sparkle with a private sunshine of their own  rushing river although a goodlooking stalwart man in the prime of life had never been smitten in this way before  he therefore resolved at once to make the girl his wife  red men have a peculiar way of settling such matters sometimes without much regard to the wishes of the ladyespecially if she be as in this case the daughter of a foe in pursuance of his purpose he planned while lying there like a snake in the grass to seize and carry off the fair moonlight by force instead of killing and scalping the whole of the indians in bounding bulls camp with whom she sojourned  it was not any tender consideration for his foes we are sorry to say that induced this change of purpose but the knowledge that in a night attack bullets and arrows are apt to fly indiscriminately on men women and children  he would have carried poor moonlight off then and there if she had not been too near the camp to permit of his doing so without great risk of discovery  the presence of the little child also increased the risk  he might indeed have easily got rid of her but there was a soft spot in that red mans heart which forbade the savage deeda spot which had been created at that time long long ago when the white preacher had discoursed to him of righteousness and temperance and judgment to come  little skipping rabbit as she was called was the youngest child of bounding bull  if rushing river had known this he would probably have hardened his heart and struck at his enemy through the child but fortunately he did not know it  retiring cautiously from the scene the blackfoot chief determined to bide his time until he should find a good opportunity to pounce upon moonlight and carry her off quietly  the opportunity came even sooner than he had anticipated  that night while he was still prowling round the camp whitewing accompanied by little tim and a band of indians arrived  bounding bull received them with an air of dignified satisfaction  he was a grave tall indian whose manner was not at all suggestive of his name but warriors in times of peace do not resemble the same men in times of war  whitewing had been the means of inducing him to accept christianity and although he was by no means as queer a christian as little tim had described him he was at all events queer enough in the eyes of his enemies and his unbelieving friends to prefer peace or arbitration to war on the ground that it is written if possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men  of course he saw that the if possible justified selfdefence and might in some circumstances even warrant aggressive action  such at all events was the opinion he expressed at the solemn palaver which was held after the arrival of his friends  whitewing said he drawing himself up with flashing eyes and extended hand in the course of the debate surely you do not tell me that the book teaches us to allow our enemies to raid in our lands to carry off our women and little ones and to burn our wigwams while we sit still and wait till they are pleased to take our scalps  having put this rather startling question he subsided as promptly as he had burst forth  thats a poser thought the irreverent little tim who sympathised with bounding bull but he said nothing  my brother has been well named replied the uncompromising whitewing he not only bounds upon his foes but lets his mind bound to foolish conclusions  the book teaches peaceif possible  if it be not possible then we cannot avoid war  but how can we know what is possible unless we try  my brother advises that we should go on the warpath at once and drive the blackfeet away  has bounding bull tried his best to bring them to reason has he failed  does he know that peace is impossible  now look here whitewing broke in little tim at this point  its all very well for you to talk about peace an whats possible  im a christian man myself an theres nobody as would be better pleased than me to see all the redskins in the mountains an on the prairies at peace wi one another  but you wont get me to believe that a few soft words are goin to make rushin river all straight  hes the sworn enemy o boundin bull  hates him like pison  he hates me like brimstone an its my opinion that if we dont make away wi him hell make away wi us  whitewingwho was fond of silencing his opponents by quoting scripture many passages of which he had learned by heart long ago from his friend the preacherdid not reply for a few seconds  then looking earnestly at his brother chief he said  with manitou all things are possible  a soft answer turns away wrath  bounding bull pondered the words  little tim gave vent to a doubtful humphnot that he doubted the truth of the word but that he doubted its applicability on the present occasion  it was finally agreed that the question should not be decided until the whole council had returned to tims folly and laid the matter before the wounded missionary  then little tim being freed from the cares of state went to solace himself with domesticity  moonlight was indian enough to know that females might not dare to interrupt the solemn council  she was also white woman enough to scorn the humble gait and ways of her red kindred and to run eagerly to meet her sire as if she had been an outandout white girl  the hunter as we have said rather prided himself in keeping up some of the ways of his own race  among other things he treated his wife and daughter after the manner of white menthat is wellbehaved white men  when moonlight saw him coming towards his wigwam she bounded towards him little tim extended his arms caught her round the slender waist with his big strong hands and lifted her as if she had been a child until her face was opposite his own  hallo little beam of light he exclaimed kissing her on each cheek and then on the point of her tiny nose    eyes of motherheart of sire   fit to set the world on fire  tim had become poetical as he grew older and sometimes tried to throw his flashing thoughts into couplets  he spoke to his daughter in english and like big tim with his wife required her to converse with him in that language  is mother at home  yes dear fasser mossers at home  an hows your little doll skippin rabbit  oh she well as could be an amost as wild too as rabbits  runs away from me so i kin hardly kitch her sometime  moonlight accompanied this remark with a merry laugh as she thought of some of the eccentricities of her little companion  entering the wigwam little tim found brighteyes engaged with an iron pot from which arose savoury odours  she had been as lithe and active as moonlight once and was still handsome and matronly  the eyes however from which she derived her name still shone with undiminished lustre and benignity  bless you old woman said the hunter giving his wife a hearty kiss youre as fond o victuals as ever i see  at least my husband is so i keep the pot boiling retorted brighteyes with a smile that proved her teeth to be as white as in days of yore  right old girl right  your husband is about as good at emptying the pot as he is at filling it  come lets have some while i tell you of a journey thats in store for you  a long one asked the wife  no only a days journey on horseback  youre goin to meet an old friend  from this point her husband went on to tell about the arrival and wounding of the preacher and how he had expressed an earnest desire to see her  while they were thus engaged the prairie chief was similarly employed enlightening his own mother  that kindhearted bundle of shrivelledup antiquity was seated on the floor on the one side of a small fire  her son sat on the opposite side gazing at her through the smoke with for an indian an unwonted look of deep affection  the snows of too many winters are on my head to go on journeys now she said in a feeble quavering voice  is it far that my son wants me to go  only one days ride towards the setting sun thou dear old one  thus tenderly had christianity coupled with a naturally affectionate disposition taught the prairie chief to address his mother  well my son i will go  wherever whitewing leads i will follow for he is led by manitou  i would go a long way to meet that good man the paleface preacher  then tomorrow at sunrise the old one will be ready and her son will come for her  so saying the chief rose and stalked solemnly out of the wigwam    chapter eleven  the snakes make a dart and secure their victims  while the things described in the last chapter were going on in the indian camp rushing river was prowling around it alternately engaged in observation and meditation for he was involved in complicated difficulties  he had come to that region with a large band of followers for the express purpose of scalping his great enemy bounding bull and all his kindred including any visitors who might chance to be with him at the time  after attacking tims folly and being driven therefrom by its owners ingenious fireworks as already related the chief had sent away his followers to a distance to hunt having run short of fresh meat  he retained with himself a dozen of his best warriors men who could glide with noiseless facility like snakes or fight with the noisy ferocity of fiends  with these he meant to reconnoitre his enemys camp and make arrangements for the final assault when his braves should return with meatfor savages not less than other men are dependent very much on full stomachs for fighting capacity  but now a change had come over the spirit of his dream  he had suddenly fallen in love and that too with one of his enemys women  his love did not however extend to the rest of her kindred  firm as was his resolve to carry off the girl not less firm was his determination to scalp her family root and branch  as we have said he hesitated to attack the camp for fear that mischief might befall the girl on whom he had set his heart  besides he would require all his men to enable him to make the attack successfully and these would not he knew return to him until the following day  the arrival of whitewing and little tim with their party still further perplexed him  he knew by the council that was immediately called and the preparations that followed that news of some importance had been brought by the prairie chief and that action of some sort was immediately to follow but of course what it all portended he could not divine and in his uncertainty he feared that moonlightwhose name of course he did not at that time knowmight be spirited away and he should never see her again  really for a red indian he became quite sentimental on the point and half resolved to collect his dozen warriors make a neckornothing rush at bounding bull and carry off his scalp and the girl at the same fell swoop  cooler reflection however told him that the feat was beyond even his powers for he knew well the courage and strength of his foe and was besides well acquainted with the person and reputation of the prairie chief and little tim both of whom had foiled his plans on former occasions  greatly perplexed therefore and undetermined as to his course of procedure rushing river bade his followers remain in their retreat in a dark part of a tangled thicket while he should advance with one man still further in the direction of the camp to reconnoitre  having reached an elevated spot as near to the enemy as he dared venture without running the risk of being seen by the sentinels he flung himself down and crawled towards a tree whence he could partially observe what went on below  his companion a youth named eaglenose silently followed his example  this youth was a finelooking young savage out on his first warpath and burning to distinguish himself active as a kitten and modest as a girl he was also quickwitted and knew when to follow the example of his chief and when to remain inactivethe latter piece of knowledge a comparatively rare gift to the ambitious  after a prolonged gaze with the result of nothing gained rushing river was about to retire from the spot as wise as he went when his companion uttered the slightest possible hiss  he had heard a sound  next instant the chief heard it and smiled grimly  we may remark here in passing that the blackfoot chief was eccentric in many ways  he prided himself on his contempt for the red mans love for paint and feathers and invariably went on the warpath unpainted and unadorned  in civilised life he would certainly have been a radical  how far his objection to paint was influenced by the possession of a manly handsome countenance of course we cannot tell  to clear up the mystery of the sound which had thrilled on the sharp ear of eaglenose we will return to the indian camp where after the council a sumptuous feast of venison steaks and marrowbones was spread in bounding bulls wigwam  moonlight not being one of the party and having already supped said to her mother that she was going to find skipping rabbit and have a run with her  you see moonlight although full seventeen years of age was still so much of a child as to delight in a scamper with her little friend the youngest child of bounding bull  be careful my child said brighteyes  keep within the sentinels you know that the great blackfoot is on the warpath  mother said moonlight with the spirit of her little father stirring in her breast i dont fear rushing river more than i do the sighing of the wind among the pinetops  is not my father here and whitewing and does not bounding bull guard our wigwams  brighteyes said no more  she was pleased with the thorough confidence her daughter had in her natural protectors and quietly went on with the moccasin which she was embroidering with the dyed quills of the porcupine for little tim  we have said that moonlight was rather selfwilled  she would not indeed absolutely disobey the express commands of her father or mother but when she had made no promise she was apt to take her own way not perceiving that to neglect or to run counter to a parents known wishes is disobedience  as the night was fine and the moon bright our selfwilled heroine with her skipping playmate rambled about the camp until they got so far in the outskirts as to come upon one of the sentinels  the darkskinned warrior gravely told her to go back  had she been any other indian girl she would have meekly obeyed at once but being little tims daughter she was prone to assert the independence of her white blood and to say truth the young braves stood somewhat in awe of her  the blackfoot does not make war against women said moonlight with a touch of lofty scorn in her tone  is the young warrior afraid that rushing river will kill and eat us  the young warrior fears nothing answered the sentinel with a dark frown but his chiefs orders are that no one is to leave or enter the camp so moonlight must go home  moonlight will do as she pleases returned the girl loftily  at the same time knowing that the man would certainly do his duty and prevent her from passing the lines she turned sharply round and walked away as if about to return to the camp  on getting out of the sentinels sight however she stopped  now skipping rabbit she said you and i will teach that fellow something of the art of war  will you follow me  will the little buffalo follow its mother returned the child  come then said moonlight with a slight laugh we will go beyond the lines  do as i do  you are well able to copy the snake  the girl spoke truly  both she and skipping rabbit had amused themselves so often in imitating the actions of the indian braves that they could equal if not beat them at least in those accomplishments which required activity and litheness of motion  throwing herself on her hands and knees moonlight crept forward until she came again in sight of the sentinel  skipping rabbit followed her trail like a little shadow  keeping as far from the man as possible without coming under the observation of the next sentinel they sank into the long grass and slowly wormed their way forward so noiselessly that they were soon past the lines and able to rise and look about with caution  the girl had no thought of doing more than getting well out of the camp and then turning about and walking boldly past the young sentinel just to show that she had defeated him but at skipping rabbits suggestion she led the way to a neighbouring knoll just to have one look round before going home  it was on this very knoll that rushing river and eaglenose lay like snakes in the grass  as the girls drew near chatting in low soft musical tones the two men lay as motionless as fallen trees  when they were within several yards of them the young indian glanced at his chief and pointed with his conveniently prominent feature to skipping rabbit  a slight nod was the reply  on came the unconscious pair until they almost trod on the prostrate men  then before they could imagine what had occurred each found herself on the ground with a strong hand over her mouth  it was done so suddenly and effectually that there was no time to utter even the shortest cry  without removing their hands for an instant from their mouths the indians gathered the girls in their left arms as if they had been a couple of sacks or bundles and carried them swiftly into the forest the chief leading and eaglenose stepping carefully in his footsteps it was not a romantic or loverlike way of carrying off a bride but red indian notions of chivalry may be supposed to differ from those of the palefaces  after traversing the woods for several miles they came to the spot where rushing river had left his men  they were unusually excited by the unexpected capture and from their animated gestures and glances during the council of war which was immediately held it was evident to poor moonlight that her fate would soon be decided  she and skipping rabbit sat cowering together at the foot of the tree where they had been set down  for one moment moonlight thought of her own lithe and active frame her powers of running and endurance and meditated a sudden dash into the woods but one glance at the agile young brave who had been set to watch her would have induced her to abandon the idea even if the thought of leaving skipping rabbit behind had not weighed with her  in a few minutes rushing river left his men and approached the tree at the foot of which the captives were seated  the moon shone full upon his tall figure and revealed distinctly every feature of his grave handsome countenance as he approached  the white spirit of her father stirred within the maiden  discarding her fears she rose to meet him with a proud glance such as was not often seen among indian girls  instead of being addressed however in the stern voice of command with which a red warrior is apt to speak to an obstreperous squaw he spoke in a low soft respectful tone which seemed to harmonise well with the gravity of his countenance and thrilled to the heart of moonlight  she was what is familiarly expressed in the words done for  once more we have to record a case of love at first sight  true the inexperienced girl was not aware of her condition  indeed if taxed with it she would probably have scorned to admit the possibility of her entertaining even mild affectionmuch less lovefor any man of the blackfoot race  still she had an uneasy suspicion that something was wrong and allowed an undercurrent of feeling to run within her which if reduced to language would have perhaps assumed the form well but he is so gentle so respectful so very unlike all the braves i have ever seen but i hate him for all that  is he not the enemy of my tribe  moonlight would not have been a daughter of little tim had she given in at once  indeed if she had known that the man who spoke to her so pleasantly was the renowned rushing riverthe bitter foe of her father and of bounding bullit is almost certain that the indignant tone and manner which she now assumed would have become genuine  but she did not know this she only knew from his dress and appearance that the man before her was a blackfoot and the knowledge raised the whole blackfoot race very much in her estimation  is the fairfaced maiden said rushing river referring to the girls comparatively light complexion willing to share the wigwam of a blackfoot chief  moonlight received this very decided and unusually civil proposal of marriage with becoming hauteur for she was still ruffled by the undignified manner in which she had been carried off  does the fawn mate with the wolf she demanded  does the chief suppose that the daughter of little tim can willingly enter the lodge of a blackfoot  a gleam of surprise and satisfaction for a moment lighted up the grave countenance of the chief  i knew not he replied that the maiden who has fallen into my hands is a child of the brave little paleface whose deeds of courage are known all over the mountains and prairies  this complimentary reference to her father went far to soften the maidens heart but her sense of outraged dignity required that she should be loyal to herself as well as to her tribe therefore she sniffed haughtily but did not reply  who is the little one asked the chief pointing to skipping rabbit who in a state of considerable alarm had taken refuge behind her friend and only peeped at her captor  moonlight paused for a few seconds before answering uncertain whether it would be wiser to say who she was or merely to describe her as a child of the tribe  deciding on the former course in the hope of impressing the blackfoot with a sense of his danger she said  skipping rabbit is the daughter of bounding bull  then observing another gleam of surprise and triumph on the chiefs face she added quickly and the blackfoot knows that bounding bull and his tribe are very strong very courageous and very revengeful  if moonlight and skipping rabbit are not sent home at once there will be war on the mountains and the plains for whitewing the great chief of the prairies is just now in the camp of bounding bull with his men  little tim as you know is terrible when his wrath is roused  if war is carried into the huntinggrounds of the blackfeet many scalps will be drying in our lodges before the snows of winter begin to descend  if evil befalls skipping rabbit or moonlight before another moon is passed rushing river himself the chickenhearted chief of the blackfeet will be in the dust with his fathers and his scalp will fringe the leggings of little tim  we have given but a feeble translation of this speech which in the indian tongue was much more powerful but we cannot give an adequate idea of the tone and graceful gesticulation of the girl as with flashing orbs and heightened colour she delivered it  yet it seemed to have no effect whatever on the man to whom it was spoken  without replying to it he gently almost courteously took the maidens hand and led her to a spot where his men were stationed  they were all on horseback ready for an immediate start  two horses without riders stood in the midst of the group  leading moonlight to one of these rushing river lifted her by the waist as if she had been a feather and placed her thereon  skipping rabbit he placed in front of eaglenose  then vaulting on to his own steed he galloped away through the forest followed closely by the whole band  now it so happened that about the same hour another band of horsemen started from the camp of bounding bull  under the persuasive eloquence of little tim the chief had made up his mind to set out for the fortress without waiting for daylight  you see tim had said we cant tell whether the preacher is goin to live or die an it would be a pity to risk lettin him miss seein the old woman and my wife if he is goin to die an if he isnt goin under this time why theres no harm in hurryin a bitwi the moon too shinin like the bottom of a new tin kettle in the sky  the chief had no objections to make  there were plenty of men to guard the camp even when a few were withdrawn for the trip  as whitewing was also willing the order to mount and ride was given at once  the absence of moonlight and skipping rabbit had not at the time been sufficiently prolonged to attract notice  if they had been thought of at all it is probable they were supposed to be in one or other of the wigwams  as the moon could not be counted on beyond a certain time haste was necessary and thus it came to pass that the party set forth without any knowledge of the disappearance of the girls  the dear old one was fain to journey like the rest on horseback but she was so well accustomed to that mode of locomotion that she suffered much less than might have been expected  besides her son had taken care to secure for her the quietest meekest and most easygoing horse belonging to the tribea creature whose natural spirit had been reduced by hardship and age to absolute quiescence and whose gait had been trained down to something like a hobbyhorse amble  seated astride of this animal in gentleman fashion the mother of whitewing swayed gently to and fro like a partially revived mummy of an amiable type with her devoted son on one side and little tim on the other to guard against accidents  it chanced that the two parties of horsemen journeyed in nearly opposite directions so that every hour of the night separated them from each other more and more  it was not until whitewings party had proceeded far on their way to tims folly that suspicion began to be aroused and inquiry to be made in the camp  then as the two girls were nowhere to be found the alarm spread the warriors sallied out and the trail of the blackfeet was discovered  it was not however until daylight came to their aid that the indians became fully aware of their loss and sent out a strong band in pursuit of their enemies while a messenger was despatched in hot haste to inform little tim and bounding bull that moonlight and skipping rabbit had been spirited away    chapter twelve  the pursuit failure despair  ever dreaming of the thunderbolt that was about to be launched whitewing little tim bounding bull and the rest of the party arrived at the little fortress in the gorge  they found big tim on the qui vive and brighteyes with whitewings mother was soon introduced to the wounded preacher  the meeting of the three was impressive for not only had they been much attached at the time of the preachers former visit but the women were deeply affected by the sad circumstances in which they found their old friend  not much changed i see brighteyes he said as the two women sat down on the floor beside his couch  only a little stouter just what might have been expected  god has been kind to youbut indeed god is kind to all only some do not see or believe in the kindness  it is equally kindness in him whether he sends joy or sorrow adversity or prosperity  if we only saw the end from the beginning none of us would quarrel with the way  love has induced him to lay me low at present you have another child i am told besides big tim  yes a daughtermoonlight we call her said brighteyes with a pleased look  is she here with you  no we left her in the camp  and my good old friend he said turning on his couch and grasping the withered hand of whitewings mother how has she prospered in all these years  the old one who was as we have said as deaf as a post wrinkled her visage up into the most indescribable expression of worldembracing benignity expanded her old lips displayed her toothless gums and chuckled  the dear old one said her son bears the snows of many winters on her head  her brain could not now be touched by the thunders of niagara  but the eyes are still bright inlets to her soul  bright indeed exclaimed the preacher as he gazed with deep interest at the old face wonderful considering her great age  i trust that these portals may remain unclosed to her latest day on earth  he was still talking to whitewing about her when a peculiar whistle was heard outside as of some waterbird  instantly dead silence fell upon all present and from the fixed gaze and motionless attitude of each it was evident that they anxiously expected a repetition of the sound  it was not repeated but a moment later voices were heard outside then a hurried step and next instant big tim sprang into the room  a messenger from the camp he cried  moonlight and skipping rabbit have been carried off by blackfeet  it could easily be seen at that moment how bounding bull had acquired his name  from a sitting posture he sprang to his feet at one bound darted through the doorway of the hut cleared the low parapet like a deer and went down the zigzag path in a succession of leaps that might have shamed a kangaroo  little tim followed suit almost as vigorously accompanying his action with a leonine roar  big tim was close on his heels  guard the fort my son gasped little tim as he cut the thong that secured his horse at the bottom of the track your mothers life is precious and softswans  if you can quit safely follow up  leaping into the saddle he was next instant on the track of the indian chief who had already disappeared  hurrying back to the hut big tim proceeded to make hasty preparation for the defence of the place so that he might be able to join his father  he found the prairie chief standing with closed eyes beside the couch of the preacher who with folded hands and feeble voice was praying to god for help  is whitewing indifferent to the misfortunes of his friends he said somewhat sharply that he stands idly by while the blackfoot robbers carry off our little ones  my son be not hasty returned the chief  prayer is quite as needful as action  besides i know all the land round herethe direction which this youth tells me the enemy have taken and a short cut over the hills which will enable you and me to cross the path your father must take and join him so that we have plenty of time to make arrangements and talk before we go on the warpath  the cool calm way in which the chief spoke and especially the decided manner in which he referred to a short cut and going on the warpath tended to quiet big tim  but what am i to do he said with a look of perplexity  there are men enough here no doubt to hold the place agin a legion o blackfeet but they have no dependable leader  here is a leader on whom you can depend i know him well said whitewing pointing to the warrior who had brought the news from the camp  he is a stranger to you but has been long in my band and was left by me in the camp to help to guard it in our absence  with him there i should have thought the stealing of two girls impossible but he has explained that mystery by telling me that moonlight crept out of the camp like a serpent unknown to all for they found her trail  with wolf in command and the preacher to give counsel and pray the women have no cause for fear  somewhat reassured though he still felt uneasy at the thought of leaving softswan behind him big tim went about his preparations for the defence of the fortress and the rescue of his sister  such preparations never take much time in the backwoods  in half an hour wolf and his braves were ready for any amount of odds and big tim was following the prairie chief through the intricacies of the mountains  these two made such good use of their time that they were successful in intercepting and joining the warparty which bounding bull with his friend and ally little tim were leading by forced marches on the trail of the blackfeet  rushing river was well aware however that such a party would soon be following him  he therefore had advanced likewise by forced marches because his object was not so much to meet his enemy as to secure his bride  only let him place her in the safe keeping of his mother with the main body of his tribe and he would then return on his steps with pleasure and give battle to his foe  in this object he was successful  after several days march he handed over moonlight and skipping rabbit to the care of an old woman whose countenance was suggestive of wrinkled leather and whose expression was not compatible with sweetness  it was evident to the captives that rushing river owed his manly bearing and his comparatively gentle manners not to his mother but to the father whose scalp alas hung drying in the smoke of a foemans wigwam  during the forced march the blackfoot chief had not once opened his lips to the girl he loved  he simply rode by her side partly perhaps to prevent any sudden attempt at flight and certainly to offer assistance when difficulties presented themselves on their pathless journey through the great wilderness  and on all such occasions he offered his aid with such grave and dignified gentleness that poor moonlight became more and more impressed though to do her justice she fought bravely against her tendency to fall in love with her tribal foe  on reaching home rushing river instead of leading his captive to his own wigwam conducted her as we have said to that of his mother then for the first time since the day of the capture he addressed her with a look of tenderness which she had never before received except from little tim and in a minor degree from her brother  moonlight he said till my return you will be well cared for here by my motherthe mother of rushing river  having said this he lifted the leathern door of the lodge and went out instantly  moonlight had received a terrible shock  turning quickly to the old woman she said  was that rushing river  that replied the old woman with a look of magnificent pride is my son rushing riverthe brave whose name is known far and wide in the mountains and on the plains whose enemies tremble and grow pale when they hear of him and who when they see him become deador run away  here then was a discovery that was almost too much for the unfortunate captive for this man was the deadly foe of her father and of her brothers fatherinlaw bounding bull  he was also the sworn enemy of her tribe and it now became her stern duty as a true child of the western wilderness to hate with all her soul the man whom she loved  under the impulse of her powerful feelings she sat down covered her face with her little hands andno she did not burst into tears  had she been a civilised beauty perhaps she might have done so but she struggled for a considerable time with spartanlike resolution to crush down the true feelings of her heart  old umqua was quite pleased with the effect of her information ascribing it as she did to a wrong cause and felt disposed to be friendly with the captive in consequence  my son has carried you off from the camp of some enemy i doubt not she said in kindly tones  moonlight who had by that time recovered her composure replied that he hadfrom the camp of bounding bull whose little daughter he had captured at the same time and added that she herself was a daughter of little tim  it was now umquas turn to be surprised  what is that you tell me she exclaimed  are you the child of the little paleface whose name extends from the regions of snow to the lands of the hot sun  i am replied moonlight with a look of pride quite equal to and rather more lovely than that of the old woman  ha exclaimed umqua you are a lucky girl  i see by my sons look and manner that he intends to take you for his wife  i suppose he has gone away just now for i saw he was in haste to scalp your father and your brother and bounding bull and all his tribe  after that he will come home and take you to his wigwam  rushing river is very brave and very kind to women  the men laugh at him behind his backthey dare not laugh before his faceand say he is too kind to them but we women dont agree with that  we know better and we are fondest of the kind men for we see that they are not less brave than the others  yes you are a lucky girl  moonlight was not as deeply impressed with her luck as the old lady expected and was on the point of bursting out after the manner of savages into a torrent of abuse of the blackfoot race in general and of rushing river in particular when the thought that she was a captive and at the mercy of the blackfeet fortunately restrained her  instead of answering she cast her eyes on the ground and remained stolidly silent by which conduct she got credit for undeserved modesty  where is the little one of that serpent bounding bull asked umqua after a brief silence  i know not replied moonlight with a look of anxiety  when we arrived here skipping rabbit was separated from me  she journeyed under the care of a youth  they called him i think eaglenose  is skipping rabbit the childs name  then skipping rabbit will skip more than ever for eaglenose is a funny man when not on the warpath and his mother is a good woman  she does not talk behind your back like other women  you have nothing to fear for skipping rabbit  come with me we will visit the mother of eaglenose  as the two moved through the indian camp moonlight noticed that the men were collecting and bridling their horses cleaning and sharpening their weapons and making preparations generally for an expedition on a large scale  for a moment a feeling of fear filled her heart as she recalled umquas remarks about scalping her kindred but when she reflected how well able her sturdy little father and big brother and bounding bull were to take care of themselves she smiled internally and dismissed her fears  long before they reached eaglenoses mothers wigwam moonlight was surprised to hear the well known voice of skipping rabbit shouting in unrestrained peals of merry laughter  on entering the cause thereof was at once apparent for there sat eaglenose beside his mother whose nose by the way was similar to his own amusing the child with a homemade jumpingjack  having seen a toy of this kind during one of his visits to the settlements of the palefaces the blackfoot youth had made mental notes of it and on his return home had constructed a jumpingjack which rendered him more popular in his tribeespecially with the youngstersthan if he had been a powerful medicineman or a noted warrior  when moonlight entered skipping rabbit was standing in front of eaglenose with clasped hands and glittering eyes shrieking with delight as the absurd creature of wood threw up its legs and arms kicked its own head and all but dislocated its own limbs  catching sight of her friend however she gave vent to another shriek with deeper delight in it and bounding towards her sprang into her arms  regarding this open display of affection with some surprise and rightly ascribing it to the influence of white blood in bounding bulls camp umqua asked eaglenoses mother if the men were getting ready to go on the warpath  i know not  perhaps my son knows  thus directly referred to eaglenose who was but a young warrior just emancipated from boyhood and who had yet to win his spurs rose and becoming so grave and owlish that his naturally prominent feature seemed to increase in size said sententiously  it is not for squaws to inquire into the plans of men but as there is no secret in what we are going to do i may tell you mother that women and children have not yet learned to live on grass or air  we go just now to procure fresh meat  so saying the stripling pitched the jumpingjack into the lap of skipping rabbit and strode out of the lodge with the pomposity of seven chiefs  that night when the captives were lying side by side in umquas wigwam gazing at the stars through the hole which was left in the top for the egress of the smoke moonlight said to her little friend  does the skipping one know that it is rushing river who has caught us and carried us away  the skipping one said that she had not known but now that she did know she hated him with all her heart  so do i said moonlight firmly  but moonlight was wrong for she hated the man with only a very small portion of her heart and loved him with all the rest  it was probably some faint recognition of this fact that induced her to add with the intense energy of one who is resolved to walk in the path of dutyi hate all the blackfeet  so do i returned the child and then pausing slowly added exceptand paused again  well who does the skipping one except  eaglenose replied the skipper promptly  i cant hate him he is such a very funny brave  after a prolonged silence moonlight whispered  does skipping rabbit sleep  no  is there not something in the great medicinebook that father speaks so much about which teaches that we should love our enemies  i dont know replied the little one  bounding bull never taught that to me  again there was silence during which moonlight hoped in a confused sort of way that the teaching might be true  before she could come to a conclusion on the perplexing point both she and her little friend were in that mysterious region where the human body usually ceases to be troubled by the human mind  when bounding bull and little tim found that the blackfoot chief had escaped them they experienced what is often termed among christians a great trial of faith  they did not indeed express their thoughts in language but they could not quite prevent their looks from betraying their feelings while in their thoughts they felt sorely tempted to charge god with indifference to their feelings and even with something like cruelty in thus permitting the guilty to triumph and the innocent to suffer  the state of mind is not indeed unfamiliar to people who are supposed to enjoy higher culture than the inhabitants of the wilderness  even whitewings spirit was depressed for a time and he could offer no consolation to the bereaved fathers or find much comfort to himself yet in the midst of all the mental darkness by which he was at that time surrounded two sentences which the paleface missionary had impressed on him gleamed forth now and then like two flickering stars in a very black sky  the one was shall not the judge of all the earth do right the other he doeth all things well  but he did not at that time try to point out the light to his companions  burning with rage mingled somewhat with despair the white hunter and the red chief returned home in hot haste bent on collecting a force of men so strong that they would be enabled to go forth with the absolute certainty of rescuing their children or of avenging them by sweeping the entire blackfoot nation root and branch off the face of the earth and adorning the garments of their braves with their scalplocks for ages to come  it may be easily believed that they did not waste time on the way desperate men cannot rest  to halt for a brief space in order to take food and sleep just sufficient to sustain them was all the relaxation they allowed themselves  this was of course simply a process of wearing out their strength but they were very strong men long inured to hardships and did not easily wear out  one night they sat round the camp fire very weary and in silence  the fire was low and exceedingly small  indeed they did not dare to venture on a large one while near the enemys country and usually contented themselves with a supper of cold uncooked pemmican  on this night however they were more fatigued than usualperhaps depression of spirit had much to do with itso they had kindled a fire and warmed their supper  what are the thoughts of bounding bull said little tim at length breaking silence with something like a groan  despair replied the chief with a dark frown and he added with a touch of hesitation revenge  your thoughts are not much different from mine returned the hunter  my brothers are not wise said whitewing after another silence  all that manitou does to his children is good  i have hope  i wish my brother could give me some of his hope  what does he rest his hope on asked little tim  long ago answered the chief when rushing river was a boy the white preacher spoke to him about his soul and the saviour  the boys heart was touched  i saw it i knew it  the seed has lain long in the ground but it is sure to grow for it must have been the spirit of manitou that touched him and will he not finish the work that he begins  that is my hope  the chiefs eyes glittered in the firelight while he spoke  his two companions listened with grave attention but said no word in reply yet it was evident as they lay down for a few hours rest that the scowl of revenge and the writing of despair had alike in some measure departed from the brow of each    chapter thirteen  the powerful influence of bad weapons and of love  while the bereaved parents were thus hastening by forced marches to their own camp a band of blackfeet was riding in another direction in quest of buffalo for their last supply of fresh meat had been nearly consumed  along with them they took several women to dry the meat and otherwise prepare it  among these were poor moonlight and her friend skipping rabbit also their guardian umqua  ever since their arrival in camp rushing river had not only refrained from speaking to his captives but had carefully avoided them moonlight was pleased at first but at last she began to wonder why he was so shy and having utterly failed in her efforts to hate him she naturally began to feel a little hurt by his apparent indifference  very different was the conduct of eaglenose who also accompanied the hunting expedition  that vivacious youth breaking through all the customs and peculiarities of red indian etiquette frequently during the journey came and talked with moonlight and seemed to take special pleasure in amusing skipping rabbit  has the skipping one he said on one occasion brought with her the little man that jumps by which expression he referred to the jumpingjack  yes he is with the packhorses  does eaglenose want to play with him  oh she was a sly and precocious little rabbit who had used well her opportunities of association with little tim to pick up the ways and manners of the palefacesto the surprise and occasional amusement of her red relations whom she frequently scandalised not a little  well did she know how sensitive a young indian brave is as to his dignity how he scorns to be thought childish and how he fancies that he looks like a splendid man when he struts with superhuman gravity just as a white boy does when he puts a cigar between his unfledged lips  she thought she had given a tremendous stab to the dignity of eaglenose and so she had yet it happened that the dignity of eaglenose escaped because it was shielded by a buckler of fun so thick that it could not easily be pierced by shafts of ridicule  yes i want to play with him answered the youth with perfect gravity but a twinkle of the eyes that did not escape skipping rabbit im fond of playing with him because he is your little husband and i want to make friends with the husband of the skipping one he is so active and kicks about his arms and legs so well  does he ever kick his little squaw  i hope not  oh yes sometimes returned the child  he kicked me last night because i said he was so like eaglenose  the little husband did well  a wooden chief so grand did not like to be compared to a poor young brave who has only begun to go on the warpath and has taken no scalps yet  the mention of warpath and scalps had the effect of quieting the poor childs tendency to repartee  she thought of her father and little tim and became suddenly grave  perceiving and regretting this the young indian hastily changed the subject of conversation  the blackfeet he said have heard much about the great palefaced chief called leetil tim  does the skipping one know leetil tim  the skipping one whose good humour was quite restored at the mere mention of her friends name said that she not only knew him but loved him and had been taught many things by him  i suppose he taught you to speak and act like the palefaced squaws said eaglenose  i suppose he did returned the child with a laugh and moonlight helped him  but perhaps it is also because i have white blood in me my mother was a paleface  that accounts for skipping rabbit being so ready to laugh and so fond of fun said the youth  was the father of eaglenose a paleface asked the child  no why  because eaglenose is as ready to laugh and as fond of fun as skipping rabbit  if his father was not a paleface he could not i think have been very red  what reply the youth would have made to this we cannot tell for at that moment scouts came in with the news that buffalo had been seen grazing on the plain below  instantly the bustle of preparation for the chase began  the women were ordered to encamp and get ready to receive the meat  scouts were sent out in various directions and the hunters advanced at a gallop  the region through which they were passing at the time was marked by that lovely undulating parklike scenery which lies in some parts between the rugged slopes of the mountain range and the level expanse of the great prairies  its surface was diversified by both kinds of landscapegroups of trees little knolls stretches of forest and occasional cliffs being mingled with wide stretches of grassy plain with rivulets here and there to add to the wild beauty of the scene  after a short ride over the level ground the blackfeet came to a fringe of woodland on the other side of which they were told by the scouts a herd of buffalo had been seen browsing on a vast sweep of open plain  riding cautiously through the wood they came to the edge of it and dismounted while rushing river and eaglenose advanced alone and on foot to reconnoitre  coming soon to that outer fringe of bushes beyond which there was no cover they dropped on hands and knees and went forward in that manner until they reached a spot whence a good view of the buffalo could be obtained  the black eyes of the two indians glittered and the red of their bronzed faces deepened with emotion as they gazed  and truly it was a sight well calculated to stir to the very centre men whose chief business of life was the chase and whose principal duty was to procure food for their women and children for the whole plain away to the horizon was dotted with groups of those monarchs of the western prairies  they were grazing quietly as though such things as the rattle of guns the whiz of arrows the thunder of horsehoofs and the yells of savages had never sounded in their ears  the chief and the young brave exchanged impressive glances and retired in serpentine fashion from the scene  a few minutes later and the entire band of horsemensome with bows and a few with gunsstood at the outmost edge of the bushes that fringed the forest land  beyond this there was no cover to enable them to approach nearer to the game without being seen so preparation was made for a sudden dash  the huge rugged creatures on the plain continued to browse peacefully giving an occasional toss to their enormous manes raising a head now and then as if to make sure that all was safe and then continuing to feed or giving vent to a soft low of satisfaction  it seemed cruel to disturb so much enjoyment and serenity with the hideous sounds of war but mans necessities must be met  until edens days return there is no deliverance for the lower animals  vegetarians may reduce their theories to practice in the cities and among cultivated fields but vegetarians among the red men of the far west or the squat men of the arctic zone would either have to violate their principles or die  as rushing river had no principles on the subject and was not prepared for voluntary death he gave a signal to his men and in an instant every horse was elongated with ears flat nostrils distended and eyes flashing while the riders bent low and mingled their black locks with the flying manes  for a few seconds no sound was heard save the muffled thunder of the hoofs at which the nearest buffaloes looked up with startled inquiry in their gaze  another moment and the danger was appreciated  the mighty host went off with piglike clumsinesstails up and manes tossing quickly the pace changed to desperate agility as the pursuing savages unable to restrain themselves relieved their feelings with terrific yells  as group after group of astonished animals became aware of the attack and joined in the mad flight the thunder on the plains swelled louder and louder until it became one continuous roarlike the sound of a rushing cataracta bovine niagara  at first the buffaloes and the horses seemed well matched but by degrees the superiority of the latter became obvious as the savages drew nearer and nearer to the flying mass  soon a puff or two of smoke a whistling bullet and a whizzing arrow told that the action had begun  here and there a black spot struggling on the plain gave stronger evidence  then the hunters and hunted became mixed up the shots and whizzing were more frequent the yells more terrible and the slaughter tremendous  no fear now that moonlight and skipping rabbit and umqua and all the rest of them big and little would not have plenty of juicy steaks and marrowbones for many days to come  but all this was not accomplished without some damage to the hunters here and there a horse having put his foot into a badgerhole was seen to continue his career for a short space like a wheel or a shot hare while his rider went ahead independently like a bird and alighted anyhow  such accidents however seldom resulted in much damage red skin being probably tougher than white and savage bones less brittle than civilised  at all events nothing very serious occurred until the plain was pretty well strewn with wounded animals  then it was that eaglenose in his wild ambition to become the best hunter of the tribe as well as the best warrior singled out an old bull and gave chase to him  this was wanton as well as foolish for bulls are dangerous and their meat is tough  what cared eaglenose for that  the spirit of his fathers was awakened in him a bad spirit doubtless and his blood was up  besides rushing river was close alongside of him and several emulous braves were close behind  eaglenose carried a bow  urging his steed to the uttermost he got close up to the bull  fury was in the creatures little eyes and madness in its tail  when a buffalo bull cocks its tail with a little bend in the middle thereof it is time to look out for squalls  does eaglenose desire to hunt with his fathers in the happy huntinggrounds muttered rushing river  eaglenose knows not fear returned the youth boastfully  as he spoke he bent his bow and discharged an arrow  he lacked the precision of robin hood  the shaft only grazed the bulls shoulder but that was enough  a vesuvian explosion seemed to heave in his capacious bosom and found vent in a furious roar  round he went like an operadancer on one leg and lowered his shaggy head  the horses chest went slap against it as might an oceanbillow against a black rock and the rider describing a curve with a high trajectory came heavily down upon his eagle nose  it was an awful crash and after it the poor youth lay prone for a few minutes with his injured member in the dustliterally for he had ploughed completely through the superincumbent turf  fortunately for poor eaglenose rushing river carried a gun with which he shot the bull through the heart and galloped on  so did the other indians  they were not going to miss the sport for the sake of helping a fallen comrade to rise  when at last the unfortunate youth raised his head he presented an appearance which would have justified the change of his name to turkeycocknose so severe was the effect of his fall  getting into a sitting posture the poor fellow at first looked dazed then observing something between his eyes that was considerably larger than even he had been accustomed to he gently raised his hand to his face and touched it  the touch was painful so he desisted  then he arose remounted his steed which stood close to him looking stupid after the concussion and followed the hunt which by that time was on the horizon  but something worse was in store for another member of the band that day  after killing the buffalo bull as before described the chief rushing river proceeded to reload his gun  now it must be known that in the days we write of the firearms supplied to the norwest indians were of very inferior quality  they were single flintlock guns with bluestained barrels of a dangerously brittle character and redpainted brassmounted stocks that gave them the appearance of huge toys  it was a piece of this description which rushing river carried and which he proceeded to reload in the usual mannerthat is holding the gun under his left arm he poured some powder from a horn into his left palm this he poured from his palm into the gun and without wadding or ramming dropped after the powder a bullet from his mouth in which magazine he carried several bullets so as to be ready  then driving the butt of the gun violently against the pommel of the saddle so as to send the whole charge home and cause the weapon to prime itself he aimed at the buffalo and fired  charges thus loosely managed do not always go quite home  in this case the ball had stuck halfway down and when the charge exploded the gun burst and carried away the little finger of the chiefs left hand but it did more  a piece of the barrel struck the chief on the head and he fell from his horse as if he had been shot  this catastrophe brought the hunt to a speedy close  the indians assembled round their fallen chief with faces graver if possible than usual  they bound up his wounds as well as they could and made a roughandready stretcher out of two poles and a blanket in which they carried him into camp  during the greater part of the short journey he was nearly if not quite unconscious  when they at length laid him down in his tent his mother although obviously anxious maintained a stern composure peculiar to her race  not so the captive moonlight  when she saw the apparently dead form of rushing river carried into his tent covered with blood and dust her partially white spirit was not to be restrained  she uttered a sharp cry which slightly roused the chief and springing to his side went down on her knees and seized his hand  the action was involuntary and almost momentary  she recovered herself at once and rose quickly as grave and apparently as unmoved as the reddest of squaws  but rushing river had noted the fact and divined the cause  the girl loved him  a new sensation of almost stern joy filled his heart  he turned over on his side without a look or word to any one and calmly went to sleep  we have already said or hinted that rushing river was a peculiar savage  he was one of those menperhaps not so uncommon as we think who hold the opinion that women are not made to be mere beasts of burden makers of moccasins and coats and menders of leggings cookers of food and generally the slaves of men  one consequence was that he could not bear the subdued looks and almost cringing gait of the blackfoot belles and had remained a bachelor up to the date of our story  he preferred to live with his mother who by the way was also an exception to the ordinary class of squaws  she was rudely intellectual and violently selfassertive though kindhearted withal  that night when his mother chanced to be alone in the tent he held some important conversation with her  moonlight happened to be absent at a jumpingjack entertainment with skipping rabbit in the tent of eaglenose the youth himself being the performer in spite of his nose most of the other women in the camp were at the place where the buffalo were being cut up and dried and converted into pemmican  mother said rushing river who in reality had been more stunned than injuredexcepting of course the little finger which was indeed gone past recovery  my son said umqua looking attentively in the chiefs eyes  the eagle has been brought down at last  rushing river will be the same man no more  he has been hit in his heart  i think not my son returned umqua looking somewhat anxious  a piece of the bad gun struck the head of rushing river but his breast is sound  perhaps he is yet stunned and had better sleep again  i want not sleep mother replied the chief in figurative language it is not the bursting gun that has wounded me but a spear of lighta moonbeam  moonlight exclaimed umqua with sudden intelligence  even so mother rushing river has at last found a mate in moonlight  my son is wise said umqua  i will carry the girl to the camp of mine enemy continued the chief and deliver her to her father  my son is a fool said umqua  wise and a fool  can that be possible mother returned the chief with a slight smile  yes quite possible said the woman promptly  man can be wise at one time foolish at anotherwise in one act foolish in another  to take moonlight to your tent is wise  i love her  she has brains  she is not like the young blackfoot squaws who wag their tongues without ceasing when they have nothing to say and never thinkbrainless ones fools  their talk is only about each other behindbacks and of feeding  the old one is hard upon the young ones said the chief gravely not long ago i heard the name of umqua issue from a wigwam  the voice that spoke was that of the mother of eaglenose  rushing river listens not to squaws tales but he cannot stop his ears  the words floated to him with the smoke of their fire  they were umqua has been very kind to me  i heard no more  the mother of eaglenose is not such a fool as the rest of them said umqua in a slightly softer tone but why does my son talk foolishness about going to the tents of his enemy and giving up a girl who it is easy to see is good and wise and true and a hard worker and not a fool  listen mother  it is because moonlight is all that you say and much more that i shall send her home  besides i have come to know that the paleface who was shot by one of our braves is the preacher whose words went to my heart when i was a boy  i must see him  but bounding bull and leetil tim will certainly kill you  leetil tim is not like the red men returned the chief he does not love revenge  my enemy bounding bull hunts with him much and has taken some of his spirit  i am a red man  i love revenge because my fathers loved it but there is something within me that is not satisfied with revenge  i will go alone and unarmed  if they kill me they shall not be able to say that rushing river was a coward  my son is weak his fall has injured him  your son is strong mother  his love for moonlight has changed him  if you go you will surely die my son  i fear not death mother  i feel that within me which is stronger than death    chapter fourteen  in which plans prospects love dangers and perplexities are dealt with  three days after the conversation related in the last chapter a party on horseback numbering five persons left the blackfoot camp and entering one of the patches of forest with which the eastern slopes of the mountains were clothed trotted smartly away in the direction of the rising sun  the party consisted of rushing river and his mother moonlight skipping rabbit and eaglenose  the latter although still afflicted with a nose the swelled condition of which rendered it out of all proportion to his face and interfered somewhat with his vision was sufficiently recovered to travel and also to indulge his bantering talk with the skipping one as he called his little friend  the chief was likewise restored excepting the stump of the little finger which was still bandaged  umqua had been prevailed on to accompany her son and it is only just to the poor woman to add that she believed herself to be riding to a martyrs doom  the chief however did not think so else he would not have asked her to accompany him  each of the party was mounted on a strong horse except skipping rabbit who bestrode an active pony more suited to her size  we say bestrode because it must ever be borne in remembrance that red india ladies ride like gentlemenvery much no doubt to their own comfort  although rushing river had resolved to place himself unarmed in the power of his enemy he had no intention of travelling in that helpless condition in a country where he was liable to meet with foes not only among men but among beasts  besides as he carried but a small supply of provisions he was dependent on gun and bow for food  himself therefore carried the former weapon eaglenose the latter and both were fully armed with hatchet tomahawk and scalpingknife  the pathif such it may be calledwhich they followed was one which had been naturally formed by wild animals and wandering indians taking the direction that was least encumbered with obstructions  it was only wide enough for one to pass at a time but after the first belt of woodland had been traversed it diverged into a more open country and finally disappeared the trees and shrubs admitting of free passage in all directions  while in the narrow track the chief had headed the little band  then came moonlight followed by umqua and by skipping rabbit on her pony eaglenose bringing up the rear  on emerging however into the open ground rushing river drew rein until moonlight came up alongside of him  eaglenose who was quick to profit by exampleespecially when he liked itrode up alongside of the skipping one who welcomed him with a decidedly paleface smile which showed that she had two rows of bright little teeth behind her laughing lips  is moonlight glad said the chief to the girl after riding beside her for some time in silence is moonlight glad to return to the camp of bounding bull  yes i am glad replied the girl choosing rather to answer in the matteroffact manner of the palefaces than in the somewhat imaginative style of the indians  she could adopt either according to inclination  there was a long pause during which no sound was heard save the regular patter of the hoofs on the lawnlike turf as they swept easily out and in among the trees over the undulations and down into the hollows or across the level plains  why is moonlight glad asked the chief  because father and mother are there and i love them both  again there was silence for moonlight had replied some what brusquely the truth is that although rejoicing in the prospect of again seeing her father and mother the poor girl had a lurking suspicion that a return to them meant final separation from rushing river andalthough she was too proud to admit even to herself that such a thought affected her in any wayshe felt very unhappy in the midst of her rejoicing and knew not what to make of it  this condition of mind as the reader knows is apt to make any one lower than an angel somewhat testy  on coming to a rising ground up which they had to advance at a walking pace the chief once more broke silence in a low soft voice  is not moonlight sorry to quit the blackfoot camp  the girl was taken by surprise for she had never before heard an indianmuch less a chiefaddress a squaw in such a tone or condescend to such a question  a feeling of selfreproach induced her to reply with some warmth  yes rushing river moonlight is sorry to quit the lodges of her blackfoot friends  the snow on the mountaintops is warmed by the sunshine until it melts and flows down to the flowering plains  the heart of moonlight was cold and hard when it entered the blackfoot camp but the sunshine of kindness has melted it and now that it flows towards the grassy plains of home moonlight thinks with tenderness of the past and will never forget  rushing river said no more  perhaps he thought the reply coupled with the look and tone was sufficiently satisfactory  at all events he continued thereafter to ride in profound silence and checking his steed almost imperceptibly allowed his mother to range up on the other side of him  meanwhile eaglenose and skipping rabbit being influenced by no considerations of delicacy or anything else kept up a lively conversation in rear  for eaglenose like his chief had freed himself from some of the trammels of savage etiquette  it would take up too much valuable space to record all the nonsense that these two talked to each other but a few passages are worthy of notice  skipping one said the youth after a brief pause what are your thoughts doing  swellednosed one replied the child with a laugh at her own inventive genius i was thinking what a big hole you must have made in the ground when you got that fall  it was not shallow returned the youth with assumed gravity  it was big enough to have buried a rabbit in even a skipping one  would there have been room for a jumpingjack too asked the child with equal gravity then without waiting for an answer she burst into a merry laugh and asked where they were travelling to  has not moonlight told you  no when i asked her about it yesterday she said she was not quite sure it would be better not to speak till she knew  moonlight is very wisealmost as wise as a man  yes wiser even than some men with swelled noses  it was now the youths turn to laugh which he did quite heartily for an indian though with a strong effort to restrain himself  we are going i believe he said after a few moments thought to visit your father bounding bull  at least the speech of rushing river led eaglenose to think so but our chief does not say all that is in his mind  he is not a squawat least not a skipping one  instead of retorting the child looked with sudden anxiety into the countenance of her companion  does rushing river she asked with earnest simplicity want to have his tongue slit his eyes poked in his liver pulled out and his scalp cut off  i think not replied eaglenose with equal simplicity for although such a speech from such innocent lips may call forth surprise in a civilised reader it referred in those regions and times to possibilities which were only too probable  after a few minutes thought the child said with an earnest look in her large and lustrous eyes skipping rabbit will be gladvery gladto see her father but she will be sorryvery sorryto lose her friends  having now made it plain that the feelings of both captives had been touched by the kindness of their captors we will transport them and the reader at once to the neighbourhood of bounding bulls camp  under the same tree on the outskirts which had been the scene of the girls capture rushing river and eaglenose stood once more with their companions conversing in whispers  the horses had been concealed a long way in rear to prevent restiveness or an incidental neigh betraying them  the night was intensely dark and still  the former condition favoured their enterprise but the latter was unfavourable as it rendered the risk of detection from any accidental sound much greater  after a few minutes talk with his male companion the chief approached the tree where the females stood silently wondering what their captors meant to do and earnestly hoping that no evil might befall any one  the time has come he said when moonlight may help to make peace between those who are at war  she knows well how to creep like the serpent in the grass and how to speak with her tongue in such a way that the heart of the listener will be softened while his ear is charmed  let moonlight creep into the camp and tell bounding bull that his enemy is subdued that the daughter of leetil tim has conquered him that he wishes for friendship and is ready to visit his wigwam and smoke the pipe of peace  but tell not that rushing river is so near say only that moonlight has been set free that manitou of the palefaces has been whispering in the heart of rushing river and he no longer delights in revenge or wishes for the scalp of bounding bull  go secretly for i would not have the warriors know of your return till you have found out the thoughts of the chief  if the ear of the chief is open and his answer is favourable let moonlight sound the chirping of a bird and rushing river will enter the camp without weapons and trust himself to the man who was once his foe  if the answer is unfavourable let her hoot like the owl three times and rushing river will go back to the home of his fathers and see the pleasant face of moonlight no more  to say that moonlight was touched by this speech would give but a feeble description of her feelings  the unusual delicacy of it for an indian the straightforward declaration implied in it and the pathetic conclusion would have greatly flattered her selfesteem even if it had not touched her heart  yet no sign did she betray of emotion save the somewhat rapid heaving of her bosom as she stood with bowed head awaiting further orders  moonlight will find skipping rabbit waiting for her here beside this tree  whether bounding bull is for peace or war rushing river returns to him his little one  go and may the hand of manitou guide thee  he turned at once and rejoined eaglenose who was standing on guard like a statue at no great distance  moonlight went immediately and softly into the bushes without pausing to utter a single word to her female companions and disappeared  thereupon the chief and his young brave lay down and resting there in profound silence awaited the result with deep but unexpressed anxiety  well did our heroine know every bush and rock of the country around her with easy soundless motion she glided along like a flitting shadow until she gained the line of sentries who guarded the camp  here as on a former occasion she sank into the grass and advanced with extreme caution  if she had not possessed more than the average capacity of savages for stalking it would have been quite impossible for her to have eluded the vigilance of the young warriors  as it was she narrowly escaped discovery for just as she was crossing what may he termed the guarded line one of the sentinels took it into his head to move in her direction  of course she stopped and lay perfectly flat and still but so near did the warrior come in passing that his foot absolutely grazed her head  but for the intense darkness of the night she would have inevitably been caught  creeping swiftly out of the sentinels way before he returned she gained the centre of the camp and in a few minutes was close to her fathers wigwam  finding a little hole in the buffaloskins of which it was chiefly composed she peeped in  to her great disappointment little tim was not there but brighteyes was and a youth whom she knew well as one who was about to join the ranks of the men and go out on his first warpath on the first occasion that offered  although trained to observe the gravity and reticence of the indian this youth was gifted by nature with powers of loquacity which he found it difficult to suppress  knowing this moonlight felt that she dared not trust him with her secret and was much perplexed how to attract her mothers attention without disturbing him  at last she crept round to the side of the tent where her mother was seated opposite to the youth putting her lips to another small hole which she found there she whispered mother so softly that brighteyes did not hear but went calmly on with her needlework while the aspirant for indian honours sent clouds of tobacco from his mouth and nose and dreamed of awful deeds of daring which were probably destined to end also in smoke  mother whispered moonlight again  the whisper though very slightly increased was evidently heard for the woman became suddenly motionless and turned slightly pale while her lustrous eyes gazed at the spot whence the sound had come  what does brighteyes see asked the indian youth expelling a cloud from his lips and also gazing  i thought i heardmy moonlightwhisper  a look of grave contempt settled on the youths visage as he replied  when love is strong the eyes are blind and the ears too open brighteyes hears voices in the night air  having given utterance to this sage opinion with the sententious solemnity of an oracle or the portentous gravity of an assas modern slang might put itthe youth resumed his pipe and continued the stupefaction of his brain  the woman was not sorry that her visitor took the matter thus for she had felt the imprudence of having betrayed any symptom of surprise whatever the sound might be  when therefore another whisper of mother was heard instead of looking intelligent she bestowed some increased attention on her work yawned sleepily once or twice and then said  is there not a council being held tonight  there is  the warriors are speaking now  does not the young brave aspire to raising his voice in council  he does replied the youth puffing with a look of almost superhuman dignity but he may not raise his voice in council till he has been on the warpath  i should have thought returned brighteyes with the slightest possible raising of her eyebrows that a brave who aims so high would find it more pleasant to be near the council tent talking with the other young braves than to sit smoking beside a squaw  the youth took the hint rather indignantly rose and strode out of the tent in majestic silence  no sooner was he gone than moonlight darted in and fell into her mothers arms  there was certainly more of the paleface than of the red mans spirit in the embrace that followed but the spirit of the red man soon reasserted itself  mother she said eagerly and impressively rushing river is going to be my husband  child exclaimed the matron while her countenance fell can the dove mate with the raven the rabbit with the wolf  they can for all i care or know to the contrary said moonlight impelled no doubt by the spirit of little tim  but she continued quickly i bear a message to bounding bull  where is he  not in the camp my daughter  he has gone to the blockhouse to see the preacher  and father  is he here  no he has gone with bounding bull  there is no chief in the camp just nowonly the young braves to guard it  how well they guard itwhen i am here said the girl with a laugh then becoming intensely earnest she told her mother in as few words as possible the object of her visit concluding with the very pertinent question now what is to be done  you dare not allow rushing river to enter the camp just now said brighteyes  the young men would certainly kill him  but i must not send him away returned the perplexed moonlight  if i do ii shall neverhe will never more return  could you not creep out of camp as you crept in and warn him  i could as far as the sentinels are concerned for they are little better than owls but it is growing lighter now and the moon will be up sooni dare not risk it  if i were caught would not the braves suspect something and scour the country round  i know not what to do yet something must be done at once  for some minutes the mother and daughter were silent each striving to devise some method of escaping from their difficulty  at last brighteyes spoke  i see a way my child she said with more than her wonted solemnity even when discussing grave matters  it is full of danger yet you must take it for i see that love has taken possession of my moonlights heart andthere is no withstanding love  she paused thoughtfully for a few moments and then resumed  one of your fathers horses is hobbled down in the willow swamp  he put it there because the feeding is good and has left no one to guard it because the place is not easily found as you know and thieves are not likely to think of it as a likely place  what you must do is to go as near our lines as you dare and give the signal of the owl  rushing river will understand it and go away at once  he will not travel fast for his heart will be heavy and revenge to him is no longer sweet that will give you time to cross the camp creep past the sentinels run down to the swamp mount the horse and go by the short cuts that you know of until you get in front of the party or overtake them  after that you must lead them to the blockhouse brighteyes never would consent to call it tims folly after she understood the meaning of the name and let the chief manage the rest  go  you have not a moment to lose  she gave her daughter a final embrace pushed her out of the tent and then sat down with the stoicism of a red indian to continue her work and listen intently either for the savage yells which would soon indicate the failure of the enterprise or the continued silence which would gradually prove its success    chapter fifteen  plot and counterplot  moonlight sauntered through the camp carelessly at first with a blanket over her head after the manner of indian women but on approaching the outskirts nearest to the spot where rushing river was concealed she discarded the blanket sank into the grass like a genuine apparition and disappeared  after creeping a short way she ventured to give the three hoots of the owl  an indian brave whose eyes were directed sentimentally to the stars as though he were thinking of his ladyloveor buffalo steaks and marrowbonescocked his ears and lowered his gaze to earth but as nothing more was to be seen or heard he raised his eyes and thoughts again to loveor marrowbones  very different as may be supposed was the effect of those three hoots upon rushing river as he lay on the grass in perfect silence listening intently  on hearing the sounds he sprang up as though an arrow had pierced him and for a few moments the furious glare of a baffled savage gleamed in his dark eyes as he laid a hand on his tomahawk but the action was momentary and in a short time the look passed away  it was succeeded by a calm aspect and demeanour which seemed to indicate a man devoid of all feelinggood or bad  skipping rabbit he said taking the hand of the child in his and patting her head you are soon to be with your fatherand with moonlight  rushing river goes back to his people  but the skipping one must not move from this tree till some of her people come to fetch her there is danger in movingperfect safety in sitting still  he moved as if about to go but suddenly turned back and kissed the child  then he muttered something in a low tone to his companions and strode into the dark forest  umqua then advanced and gave the little one a tremendous hug  she was evidently struggling to suppress her feelings for she could hardly speak as she said  ii must go dear child  rushing river commands  umqua has no choice but to obey  she could say no more but after another prolonged hug ran rapidly away  hitherto eaglenose had stood motionless looking on with his arms folded  poor boy he was engaged in the hardest fight that he had yet experienced in his young life for had he not for the first time found a congenial playmateif we may venture to put it soand was she not being torn from him just as he was beginning to understand her value he had been trained however in a school where contempt of pain and suffering was inculcated more sternly even than among the spartans of old  skipping one he said in a low stern voice eaglenose must leave you for his chief commands but he will laugh and sing no more  even through her tears the skipping one could scarce forbear smiling at the tone in which this was uttered  fortunately her face could not be seen  o yes you will laugh and sing again she said when your nose is better  no that cannot be returned the youth who sawindeed the child intendednothing humorous in the remark  no i will never more laugh or pull the string of the jumpingjack but he added with sudden animation as a thought struck him eaglenose will bring the jumpingjack to the camp of bounding bull and put it in the hands of the skipping one though his scalp should swing for it in the smoke of her fathers wigwam  he stooped took the little face between his hands and kissed it on both cheeks  dontdont leave me said the child beginning to whimper  the chief commands and eaglenose must obey said the youth  he gently unclasped the little hands and silently glided into the forest  meanwhile moonlight utterly forgetting amid her anxieties the arrangement about skipping rabbit sauntered back again through the camp till she reached the opposite extremity which lay nearest to the willow swamp  the lines here were not guarded so carefully because the nature of the ground rendered that precaution less needful  she therefore managed to pass the sentinels without much difficulty and found as she had been told that one of her fathers horses was feeding near the willow swamp  its two forelegs were fastened together to prevent it straying so that she caught it easily  having provided herself with a strong supple twig she cut the hobbles vaulted lightly on the horses back and went off at a smart gallop  moonlight did not quite agree with her mother as to the effect of disappointment on her lover  although heaviness of heart might possibly induce him to ride slowly she thought it much more likely that exasperation of spirit would urge him to ride with reckless fury therefore she plied her switch vigorously and the light increasing as she came to more open ground she was able to speed swiftly over a wide stretch of country with which she had been familiar from childhood in the hope of intercepting the blackfoot chief  after a couple of hours hard riding she came to a narrow pass through which she knew her lover must needs go if he wished to return home by the same path that had led him to the camp of his enemy  jumping quickly from her steed she went down on her knees and examined the track  a sigh of relief escaped her for it was evident that no one had passed there that day towards the west  there was just a bare possibility however that the chief had taken another route homeward but moonlight tried hard to shut her eyes to that fact and being sanguine of temperament she succeeded  retiring into a thicket she tied her horse to a tree and then returned to watch the track  while seated there on a fallen tree thinking with much satisfaction of some of her recent adventures she suddenly conceived a little plot which was more consistent with the character of skipping rabbit than herself and rose at once to put it into execution  with a knife which she carried in her girdle she cut and broke down the underwood at the side of the track and tramped about so as to make a great many footmarks  then between that point and the thicket where her steed was concealed she walked to and fro several times cutting and breaking the branches as she went so as to make a wide trail and suggest the idea of a handtohand conflict having taken place there  she was enabled to make these arrangements all the more easily that the moon was by that time shining brightly and revealing objects almost as clearly as if it had been noonday  returning to the pass she took off the kerchief with which she usually bound up her luxuriant brown hair and placed it in the middle of the track with her knife lying beside it  having laid this wicked little trap to her satisfaction she retired to a knoll close at hand from which she could see her kerchief and knife on the one hand and her horse on the other  then she concealed herself behind the trunk of a tree  now it chanced at that very time that four of the young braves of bounding bulls camp who had been sent out to hunt were returning home laden with venison and they happened to cross the trail of moonlight at a considerable distance from the pass just mentioned  few things escape the notice of the red men of the west  on seeing the trail they flung down their loads examined the prints of the hoofs rose up glared at each other and then ejaculated hough  ho  hi  hee respectively  after giving vent to these humorous observations they fixed the fresh meat in the forks of a tree and bending forward followed up the trail like bloodhounds  thus it happened that at the very time when moonlight was preparing her practical joke or surprise for rushing river these four young braves were looking on with inexpressible astonishment and preparing something which would indeed be a surprise but certainly no joke to herself and to all who might chance to appear upon the scene  with mouths open and eyes stretched to the utmost these bounding bullersif we may so call themlay concealed behind a neighbouring mound and watched the watcher  their patience was not put to a severe test  ere long a distant sound was heard  as it drew near it became distinctly like the pattering sound of galloping steeds  the heart of moonlight beat high as she drew closer into the shelter of the tree and clasped her hands  so did the hearts of the bounding bullers as they drew closer under the brow of the mound and fitted arrows to their bows  moonlight was right in her estimate of the effect of disappointment on her lover  he was evidently letting off superfluous steam through the safetyvalve of a furious pace  presently the cavalcade came sweeping into the pass and went crashing through itrushing river of course in advance  no cannon ball was ever stopped more effectually by mountain or precipice than was our indian chiefs career by moonlights kerchief and knife  he reined in with such force as to throw his steed on its haunches like the equestrian statue of peter the great but unlike the statuesque animal rushing rivers horse came back to the position of allfours and stood transfixed and trembling  vaulting off the chief ran to the kerchief and picked it up  then he and eaglenose examined it and the knife carefully after which they turned to the track through the bushes  but here caution became necessary  there might be an ambuscade  with tomahawk in one hand and scalpingknife in the other the chief advanced slowly step by step gazing with quick intensity right and left as he went  eaglenose followed similarly armed and even more intensely watchful  umqua brought up the rear unarmed it is true but with her ten fingers curved and clawlike as if in readiness for the visage of any possible assailant for the old woman was strong and pugnacious as well as kindly and intellectual  all this was what some people call nuts to moonlight  it was equally so to the bounding bullers who although mightily taken by surprise were fully alive to the fact that here were two men and two women of their hated blackfoot foes completely at their mercy  they had only to twang their bowstrings and the deathyells of the men would instantly resound in the forest  but burning curiosity as to what it could all mean and an intense desire to see the play out restrained them  soon rushing river came upon the tiedup horse and of course astonishment became intensified for in all his varied experience of savage warfare he had never seen the evidence of a deadly skirmish terminate in a peacefully tiedup horse  while he and his companions were still bending cautiously forward and peering around the hoot of an owl was heard in the air  eaglenose looked up with inquiring gaze but his chiefs more practised ear at once understood it  he stood erect stuck his weapons into his belt and with a look of great satisfaction repeated the cry  moonlight responded and at once ran down to him with a merry laugh  of course there was a good deal of greeting and gratulation for even indians become demonstrative at times and moonlight had much of importance to tell  but now an unforeseen difficulty came in the way of the bloodyminded bullers  in the group which had been formed by the friendly evolutions of their foes the women chanced to have placed themselves exactly between them and the men thus rendering it difficult to shoot the latter without great risk of injury if not death to the former for none of them felt sufficiently expert to emulate william tell  in these circumstances it occurred to them being courageous braves that four men were more than a match for two and that therefore it would be safer and equally effective to make a united rush and brain their enemies as they stood  no sooner conceived than acted on  dispensing with the usual yell on this occasion they drew their knives and tomahawks and made a tremendous rush  but they had reckoned too confidently and suffered the inevitable disgrace of bafflement that awaits those who underrate the powers of women  so sudden was the onset that rushing river had not time to draw and properly use his weapons but old umqua with the speed of light flung herself on hands and knees in front of the leading buller who plunged over her and drove his head against a tree with such force that he remained there prone and motionless  thus the chief was so far ready with his tomahawk that a hastilydelivered blow sent the flat of it down on the skull of the succeeding savage and in sporting language dropped him  thus only two opponents were left of whom eaglenose choked one and his chief felled the other  in ordinary circumstances the victors would first have stabbed and then scalped their foes but we have pointed out that the spirit of our chief had been changed  he warned eaglenose not to kill  with his assistance and that of the women he bound the conquered braves and laid them in the middle of the track so that no one could pass that way without seeing them  then addressing the one who seemed to be least stunned he said  rushing river is no longer at war with bounding bull  he will not slay and scalp his young men but the young men have been hasty and must suffer for it  when your friends find you and set you free tell them that it was rushing river who brought skipping rabbit to her father and left her near the camp  if rushing river is no longer at war with bounding bull returned the fallen savage sulkily how comes it that we have crossed the trail of a warparty of blackfeet on their way to the blockhouse of the paleface  this question roused both surprise and concern in the blackfoot chief but his features betrayed no emotion of any kind and the only reply he condescended to make was a recommendation to the youth to remember what he had been told  when however he had left them and got out of hearing he halted and said  moonlight has travelled in the region of her fathers fort since she was a little child  will she guide me to it by the shortest road she knows  the girl of course readily agreed and in a few minutes diverging from the pass went off in another direction where the ground permitted of their advancing at a swift gallop  we must turn now to another part of those western wilds not far from the little hut or fortress named  in a secluded dell between two spurs of the great mountain range a council of war was held on the day of which we write by a party of blackfoot indians  this particular band had been absent on the warpath for a considerable time and having suffered defeat were returning home rather crestfallen and without scalps  in passing near the fortress of little tim it occurred to them that they might yet retrieve their character by assaulting that stronghold and carrying off the booty that was there with any scalps that chance might throw in their way  that night the prairie chief little and big tim bounding bull and softswan were sitting in a very disconsolate frame of mind beside their friend the paleface preacher whose sunken eye and hollow cheek told of his rapidly approaching end  besides the prospect of the death of one whom they had known and loved so long they were almost overwhelmed by despair at the loss of moonlight and skipping rabbit and their failure to overtake and rescue them while the difficulty of raising a sufficient number of men at the time to render an attempt upon the blackfoot stronghold possible with the faintest hope of success still further increased their despair  even the dying missionary was scarcely able to give them hope or encouragement for by that time his voice was so weak that he could only utter a word or two at long intervals with difficulty  the clouds are very dark my father said whitewing  very dark responded his friend but on the other side the sun is shining brightly  sometimes i find it rather hard to believe it muttered little tim  bounding bull did not speak but the stern look of his brow showed that he shared the feelings of the little hunter  big tim was also silent but he glanced at softswan and she as if in reply to his thoughts said he doeth all things well  ha exclaimed the missionary with a quick glance of pleased surprise at the girl you have learned a good lesson soft one  treasure it he doeth all things well  we may think some of them dark some even wrong butshall not the judge of all the earth do right  silence again ensued for they were indeed very low yet they had by no means reached the lowest point of human misery  while they were sitting there the blackfoot band under cover of the night was softly creeping up the zigzag path  great events often turn on small points  rome was saved by the cackling of geese and tims folly was lost by the slumbering of a goose  the goose in question was a youth who was so inflated with the miraculous nature of the deeds which he intended to do that he did not give his mind sufficiently to those which at that time had to be done  he was placed as sentinel at the point of the little rampart furthest from the hut and nearest the forest  instead of standing at his post and gazing steadily at the latter he sat down and stared dreamily at the future  as might have been expected the first blackfoot that raised his head cautiously above the parapet saw the dreamer tapped his cranium and rendered him unconscious  next moment a swarm of black creatures leaped over the wall burst open the door of the hut and before the men assembled there could grasp their weapons overpowered them by sheer weight of numbers  all were immediately bound except the woman and the dying man  thus it happened that when rushing river arrived he found the place already in possession of his own men  i will go up alone he said to see what they are doing  if they have got the firewater of the palefaces they might shoot and kill moonlight in their mad haste  if rushing river wishes to see his men unseen by them moonlight can guide him by a secret way that is known only to her father and her fathers friends said the girl  the chief paused as if uncertain for a moment how to act  then he said briefly let moonlight lead rushing river will follow  without saying a word the girl conducted her companion round by the rivers bed and up by the secret path into the cavern at the rear of the little fortress  here eaglenose and umqua were bidden to remain while the girl raised the stone which covered the upper opening of the cave and led the chief to the back of the hut whence issued the sound of voices as if raised in anger and mutual recrimination  placing his eye to a chink in the back door the blackfoot chief witnessed a scene which filled him with concern and surprise    chapter sixteen  the last  the sight witnessed by rushing river was one which might indeed have stirred the spirit of a mere stranger much more that of one who was well acquainted with and more or less interested in all the actors in the scene  seated on the floor in a row with their backs against the wall of the hut and bound hand and foot were his old enemies bounding bull little tim and his big son and whitewing the prairie chief  in a corner lay a man with closed eyes clasped hands and a face the ashy paleness of which indicated the near approach of death if not its actual presence in him he at once recognised the preacher who years ago had directed his youthful mind to jesus the saviour of mankind  in front of these stood one of the warriors of his own nation brandishing a tomahawk and apparently threatening instant destruction to little tim who to do him justice met the scowls and threats of the savage with an unflinching gaze  there was however no touch of pride or defiance in tims look but in the frowns of bounding bull and big tim we feel constrained to say that there were both pride and defiance several blackfoot indians stood beside the prisoners with knives in their hands ready at a moments notice to execute their leaders commands  rushing river knew that leader to be one of the fiercest and most cruel of his tribe  softswan was seated at the feet of the missionary with her face bowed upon her knees  she was not bound but a savage stood near to watch her  whitewings old mother sat or rather crouched close to her  what had already passed rushing river of course could only guess  of what followed his ears and eyes took note  you look very brave just now said the blackfoot leader but i will make you change your looks before i take your scalps to dry in the blackfoot wigwams  you had better take our lives at once said big tim fiercely else we will begin to think that we have had the mischance to fall into the hands of cowardly squaws  wah exclaimed bounding bull with a nod of assent as he directed a look of scorn at his adversary  tush tush boy said little tim to his son reprovingly in an undertone  it ill becomes a man with white blood in his veins an who calls hisself a christian to go boastin like an ornary savage  i thowt i had thrashed that out of ee when ye was a small boy  daddy remonstrated big tim is not softswan sittin there at his marcy  no lad no  we are at the marcy of the lord an his marcies are everlastin  a faint smile flickered on the lips of the missionary at that moment and opening his eyes he said solemnly  my son hope thou in god for thou shalt yet praise him who is the health of thy countenance and thy god  the savage leader was for the moment startled by the words uttered in his own language by one whom he had thought to be dead but recovering himself quickly he said  your trust will be vain for you are now in my power and i only spare you long enough to tell you that a blackfoot brave has just met us who brings us the good news of what our great blackfoot chief did when he crept into the camp of bounding bull and carried away his little daughter from under his very nose and also the daughter of leetil tim wah  did i not say that i would make you change your looks  the savage was so far right that this reference to their great loss was a terrible stab and produced considerable change of expression on the faces of the captives but with a great effort bounding bull resumed his look of contempt and said that what was news to the blackfoot leader was no news to him and that not many days would pass before his warriors would pay a visit to the blackfoot nation  that may be so retorted the savage but they shall not be led by bounding bull for his last hour has come  so saying the blackfoot raised his tomahawk and advanced to the chief who drew himself up and returned his glare of hate with a smile of contempt  softswan sprang up with a shriek and would have flung herself between them but was held back by the savage who guarded her at that moment the back door of the hut flew open and rushing river stood in the midst of them  one word from him sent all the savages crestfallen out of the hut  he followed them  returning alone a few seconds later he passed the astonished captives and kneeling down by the couch of the missionary said in tones that were too low to be heard by the others  does my white father remember rushing river  the missionary opened his eyes with a puzzled look of inquiry and gazed at the indians face  rushing river was but a boy continued the chief when the paleface preacher came to the camp of the blackfeet  a gleam of intelligence seemed to shoot from the eyes of the dying man  yes yes he said faintly i remember  my father continued the chief spoke to rushing river about his sinsabout the great manitou about jesus the saviour of all men and about the great spirit  rushing river did not believe thenhe could notbut the great spirit must have been whispering to him since for he believes now  a look of quiet joy settled on the preachers face while the chief spoke  rousing himself with an effort he said as he turned a glance towards the captives  if you truly love jesus let these go free  the chief had to bend down to catch the feeblyspoken words  rising instantly he drew his knife went to little tim and cut the thongs that bound him  then he cut those of big tim and whitewing and lastly those of bounding bull  he had scarcely completed the latter act when his old enemy suddenly snatched the knife out of his hand caught him by the right arm with a vicelike grasp and pointed the weapon at his heart  bounding bull he said fiercely knows not the meaning of all this but he knows that his child is in the blackfoot camp and that rushing river is at his mercy  no effort did rushing river make to avert the impending blow but stood perfectly still and with a look of simple gravity said  skipping rabbit is not in the blackfoot camp  she is now in the camp of her kindred and moonlight he added turning a glance on little tim is safe  your face looks truthful and your tone sounds honest rushing river said little tim but the blackfeet are clever at deceiving and the chief is our bitter foe  what surety have we that he is not telling lies  rushing river knows well he has only to give a signal and his red reptiles will swarm in on us all unarmed as we are and take our scalps  my young men are beyond hearing returned the chief  i have sent them away  my breast is open to the knife in the hand of bounding bull i am no longer an enemy but a follower of jesus and the preacher has told us that he is the prince of peace  at this the prairie chief stepped forward  friends he said my heart is glad this day for i am sure that you may trust the word of rushing river  something of his change of mind i have heard of in the course of my wanderings but i had not been sure that there was truth in the report till now  still bounding bull maintained his grasp on his old foe and held the knife in readiness so that if there should be any sudden attempt at rescue he at least should not escape  the two tims little and big although moved by whitewings remarks were clearly not quite convinced  they seemed uncertain how to view the matter and were still hesitating when rushing river again spoke  the palefaces he said do not seem to be so trustful as the red men  i have put myself in your power yet you do not believe me  why then does not bounding bull strike his ancient enemy  his great opportunity has come  his squaws are waiting in his wigwam fur the scalp of rushing river  for the first time in his life bounding bull was rendered incapable of action  in all his extensive experience of indian warfare he had never been placed in such a predicament  if he had been an outandout heathen he would have known what to do and would have done it at oncehe would have gratified revenge  had rushing river been an outandout heathen he never would have given him the chance he now possessed of wreaking his vengeance  then the thought of skipping rabbit filled his heart with tender anxiety and confused his judgment still more  it was very perplexing  but rushing river brought the perplexity to an end by saying  if you wish for further proof that rushing river tells no lies moonlight will give it  let her come forward  little tim was beginning to think that the blackfoot chief was as he expressed it somewhat off his head when moonlight ran into the room and seized him with her wonted energy round the neck  yes father its all true  i am safe as you see and happy  an skippin rabbit said little tim  is in her own wigwam by this time  as she spoke in the indian tongue bounding bull understood her  he at once let go his hold of his old foe  returning the knife to him he grasped his right hand after the manner of the palefaces and said  my brother  by this time eaglenose and umqua had appeared upon the scene and added their testimony to that of their chief  while they were still engaged in explanation a low wail from softswan turned their attention to the corner where the preacher lay  the prairie chief glided to the side of his old friend and kneeled by the couch  the others clustered round in solemn silence  they guessed too surely what had drawn forth the girls wail  the old man lay with his thin white locks scattered on the pillow his hands clasped as if in prayer and with eyes nearly closed but the lips moved not  his days of prayer and striving on this earth were over and his eternity of praise and glory had begun  we might here appropriately enough close our record of the prairie chief and the preacher but we feel loath to leave them without a few parting words for the good work which the preacher had begun was carried on not only by whitewing but as far as example wentand that was a long wayby little and big tim and their respective wives and bounding bull as well as by many of their kindred  after the preachers remains had been laid in the grave at the foot of a pinetree in that far western wilderness little tim with his son and indian friends followed bounding bull to his camp where one of the very first persons they saw was skipping rabbit engaged in violently agitating the limbs of her jumpingjack to the ineffable delight of eaglenose  soon after diplomatic negotiations were entered into between the tribe of bounding bull and the blackfeet resulting in a treaty of peace which bid fair to be a lasting treaty at least as lasting as most other human treaties ever are  the pipe of peace was solemnly smoked the warhatchet was not less solemnly buried and a feast on a gigantic scale was much more solemnly held  another result was that rushing river and moonlight were marriednot after the simple indian fashion but with the assistance of a real palefaced missionary who was brought from a distance of nearly three hundred miles from a paleface pioneer settlement for the express purpose of tying that knot along with several other knots of the same kind and doing what in him lay to establish and strengthen the good work which the old preacher had begun  years passed away and a furtrading establishment was sent into those western regions which gradually attracted round it a group of indians who not only bartered skins with the traders but kept them constantly supplied with meat  among the most active hunters of this group were our friends little and big tim bounding bull rushing river and eaglenose  sometimes these hunted singly sometimes in couples not unfrequently all together for they were a very sociable band  whitewing was not one of them for he devoted himself exclusively to wandering about the mountains and prairies telling men and women and children of the saviour of sinners of righteousness and judgment to comea selfappointed red indian missionary deriving his authority from the word of god  but the prairie chief did not forsake his old and welltried friends he left a hostage in the little community a sort of living lodestone which was sure to bring him back again and again however far his wanderings might extend  this was a wrinkled specimen of female humanity which seemed to be absolutely incapable of extinction because of the superhuman warmth of its heart and the intrinsic hilarity of its feelings  whoever chanced to inquire for whitewing whether in summer or in winter in autumn or in spring was sure to receive some such answer as the following nobody knows where he is  he wanders here and there and everywhere but hell not be absent long for he always turns up sooner or later to see his old mother  yes that mummified old mother that dear old one was a sort of planet round which brighteyes and softswan and moonlight and skipping rabbit and others with a host of little brighteyes and little softswans revolved forming a grand constellation which the men of the settlement gazed at and followed as the mariners of old followed the pole star  the mention of skipping rabbit reminds us that we have something more to say about her  it so happened that the fur trader who had been sent to establish a post in that region was a good man and strange to say entertained a strong belief that the soul of man was of far greater importance than his body on the strength of this opinion he gathered the indians of the neighbourhood around him and told them that as he wished to read to them out of the word of the great manitou he would hold a class twice a week in the furstore and further that if any of them wished to learn english and read the bible of the palefaces for themselves he was quite willing to teach them  well the very first pupil that came to the english class was skipping rabbit and curiously enough the very second was eaglenose  now it must be remembered that we have said that years had passed away skipping rabbit was no longer a spoiled little laughing child but a tall graceful modest girl just bursting into womanhood  she was still as fond as ever of the jumpingjack but she slily worked its galvanic limbs for the benefit of little children not for her owno dear no  eaglenose had also grown during these years into a stalwart man and his chin and lower jaws having developed considerably his nose was relatively much reduced in appearance  about the same time brighteyes and softswan naturally desiring to become more interesting to their husbands also joined this class and they were speedily followed by moonlight and bounding bull  rushing river also looked in now and then in a patronising sort of way but whitewing resolutely refused to be troubled with anything when in camp save his mother and his mothertongue  it will not therefore surprise the reader to be told that eaglenose and the skipping one being thus engaged in a common pursuit were naturally we may even say unavoidably thrown a good deal together and as their philological acquirements extended they were wont at times to air their english on each other  the lone woods formed a convenient scene for their intercourse  kom vis me said eaglenose to skipping rabbit one day after school  var you goes asked the girl shylyyet we might almost say twinklingly  don know  nowhars  everywhars  anywhars  kim long den  skipping one said eaglenoseof course in his own tongue though he continued the sentence in englishde lunguish of de palefass am diffikilt  yesmost too diffikilt for larn  bot softswan larn him easy  bot softswan have one palefass hubsind replied the girl breaking into one of her old merry laughs at the trouble they both experienced in communicating through such a lunguish  would the skipping one said eaglenose with a sharp look like to have a hubsind  the skipping one looked at her companion with a startled air blushed cast down her eyes and said nothing  come sit down here said the indian suddenly reverting to his native tongue as he pointed to the trunk of a fallen tree  the girl suffered herself to be led to the tree and sat down beside the youth who retained one of her hands  does not the skipping one know he said earnestly that for many moons she has been as the sun in the sky to eaglenose  when she was a little one and played with the jumpingjack her eyes seemed to eaglenose like the stars and her voice sounded like the rippling water after it has reached the flowering prairie  when the skipping one laughed did not the heart of eaglenose jump and when she let drops fall from her stars was not his heart heavy  afterwards when she began to think and talk of the great manitou did not the indians ears tingle and his heart burn  it is true continued the youth with a touch of pathos in his tone which went straight to the girls heart it is true that eaglenose dwells far below the skipping one  he creeps like the beetle on the ground  she flies like the wild swan among the clouds  eaglenose is not worthy of her but love is a strong horse that scorns to stop at difficulties  skipping rabbit and eaglenose have the same thoughts the same god the same hopes and desires  they have one heartwhy should they not have one wigwam  reader we do not ask you to accept the above declaration as a specimen of indian lovemaking  you are probably aware that the red men have a very different and much more prosaic manner of doing things than this but we have already said that eaglenose was an eccentric youth moreover he was a christian and we do not feel bound to account for the conduct or sentiments of people who act under the combined influence of christianity and eccentricity  when skipping rabbit heard the above declaration she did indeed blush a little  she could not help that we suppose but she did not look awkward or wait for the gentleman to say more but quietly putting her arm round his neck she raised her little head and kissed that part of his manly face which lay immediately underneath his eagle nose  of course he was not shabby enough to retain the kiss  he understood it to be a loan and returned it immediately with interestbutsurely we have said enough for an intelligent reader  not many days after that these two were married in the furstore of the traders  a grand feast and a great dance followed as a matter of course  it is noteworthy that there was no drink stronger than tea at that merrymaking yet the revellers were wonderfully uproarious and very happy and it was universally admitted that exclusive of course of the bride and bridegroom the happiest couple there were a wrinkled old woman of fabulous age and her amiable sonthe prairie chief  the end
