i shall be very glad indeed that i wrote it  but perhaps i shall get some more of those very welcome letters from my readers telling me just how they like ozma of oz  i hope so anyway   l frank baum  macatawa 1907     1  the girl in the chicken coop   the wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean sending ripples across its surface  then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples until they became waves and shoved the waves around until they became billows  the billows rolled dreadfully high higher even than the tops of houses  some of them indeed rolled as high as the tops of tall trees and seemed like mountains and the gulfs between the great billows were like deep valleys  all this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever resulted in a terrible storm and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many queer pranks and do a lot of damage  at the time the wind began to blow a ship was sailing far out upon the waters  when the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and bigger the ship rolled up and down and tipped sidewisefirst one way and then the otherand was jostled around so roughly that even the sailormen had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves from being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea  and the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldnt get through them so that the day grew dark as night which added to the terrors of the storm  the captain of the ship was not afraid because he had seen storms before and had sailed his ship through them in safety but he knew that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck so he put them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until after the storm was over and to keep brave hearts and not be scared and all would be well with them  now among these passengers was a little kansas girl named dorothy gale who was going with her uncle henry to australia to visit some relatives they had never before seen  uncle henry you must know was not very well because he had been working so hard on his kansas farm that his health had given way and left him weak and nervous  so he left aunt em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of the farm while he traveled far away to australia to visit his cousins and have a good rest  dorothy was eager to go with him on this journey and uncle henry thought she would be good company and help cheer him up so he decided to take her along  the little girl was quite an experienced traveller for she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the marvelous land of oz and she had met with a good many adventures in that strange country before she managed to get back to kansas again so she wasnt easily frightened whatever happened and when the wind began to howl and whistle and the waves began to tumble and toss our little girl didnt mind the uproar the least bit  of course well have to stay in the cabin she said to uncle henry and the other passengers and keep as quiet as possible until the storm is over  for the captain says if we go on deck we may be blown overboard  no one wanted to risk such an accident as that you may be sure so all the passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin listening to the shrieking of the storm and the creaking of the masts and rigging and trying to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped sidewise  dorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to find that uncle henry was missing  she couldnt imagine where he had gone and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him and to fear he might have been careless enough to go on deck  in that case he would be in great danger unless he instantly came down again  the fact was that uncle henry had gone to lie down in his little sleepingberth but dorothy did not know that  she only remembered that aunt em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle so at once she decided to go on deck and find him in spite of the fact that the tempest was now worse than ever and the ship was plunging in a really dreadful manner  indeed the little girl found it was as much as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck and as soon as she got there the wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the skirts of her dress  yet dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the storm and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through the gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast not far away from her  this might be her uncle so she called as loudly as she could  uncle henry  uncle henry  but the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her own voice and the man certainly failed to hear her for he did not move  dorothy decided she must go to him so she made a dash forward during a lull in the storm to where a big square chickencoop had been lashed to the deck with ropes  she reached this place in safety but no sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the chickens were kept than the wind as if enraged because the little girl dared to resist its power suddenly redoubled its fury  with a scream like that of an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted it high into the air with dorothy still clinging to the slats  around and over it whirled this way and that and a few moments later the chickencoop dropped far away into the sea where the big waves caught it and slid it uphill to a foaming crest and then downhill into a deep valley as if it were nothing more than a plaything to keep them amused  dorothy had a good ducking you may be sure but she didnt lose her presence of mind even for a second  she kept tight hold of the stout slats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes she saw that the wind had ripped the cover from the coop and the poor chickens were fluttering away in every direction being blown by the wind until they looked like feather dusters without handles  the bottom of the coop was made of thick boards so dorothy found she was clinging to a sort of raft with sides of slats which readily bore up her weight after coughing the water out of her throat and getting her breath again she managed to climb over the slats and stand upon the firm wooden bottom of the coop which supported her easily enough  why ive got a ship of my own she thought more amused than frightened at her sudden change of condition and then as the coop climbed up to the top of a big wave she looked eagerly around for the ship from which she had been blown  it was far far away by this time  perhaps no one on board had yet missed her or knew of her strange adventure  down into a valley between the waves the coop swept her and when she climbed another crest the ship looked like a toy boat it was such a long way off soon it had entirely disappeared in the gloom and then dorothy gave a sigh of regret at parting with uncle henry and began to wonder what was going to happen to her next  just now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean with nothing to keep her afloat but a miserable wooden hencoop that had a plank bottom and slatted sides through which the water constantly splashed and wetted her through to the skin  and there was nothing to eat when she became hungryas she was sure to do before longand no fresh water to drink and no dry clothes to put on  well i declare she exclaimed with a laugh  youre in a pretty fix dorothy gale i can tell you and i havent the least idea how youre going to get out of it  as if to add to her troubles the night was now creeping on and the gray clouds overhead changed to inky blackness  but the wind as if satisfied at last with its mischievous pranks stopped blowing this ocean and hurried away to another part of the world to blow something else so that the waves not being joggled any more began to quiet down and behave themselves  it was lucky for dorothy i think that the storm subsided otherwise brave though she was i fear she might have perished  many children in her place would have wept and given way to despair but because dorothy had encountered so many adventures and come safely through them it did not occur to her at this time to be especially afraid  she was wet and uncomfortable it is true but after sighing that one sigh i told you of she managed to recall some of her customary cheerfulness and decided to patiently await whatever her fate might be  by and by the black clouds rolled away and showed a blue sky overhead with a silver moon shining sweetly in the middle of it and little stars winking merrily at dorothy when she looked their way  the coop did not toss around any more but rode the waves more gentlyalmost like a cradle rockingso that the floor upon which dorothy stood was no longer swept by water coming through the slats  seeing this and being quite exhausted by the excitement of the past few hours the little girl decided that sleep would be the best thing to restore her strength and the easiest way in which she could pass the time  the floor was damp and she was herself wringing wet but fortunately this was a warm climate and she did not feel at all cold  so she sat down in a corner of the coop leaned her back against the slats nodded at the friendly stars before she closed her eyes and was asleep in half a minute     2  the yellow hen   a strange noise awoke dorothy who opened her eyes to find that day had dawned and the sun was shining brightly in a clear sky  she had been dreaming that she was back in kansas again and playing in the old barnyard with the calves and pigs and chickens all around her and at first as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes she really imagined she was there  kutkutkut kadawkut  kutkutkut kadawkut  ah here again was the strange noise that had awakened her  surely it was a hen cackling  but her wideopen eyes first saw through the slats of the coop the blue waves of the ocean now calm and placid and her thoughts flew back to the past night so full of danger and discomfort  also she began to remember that she was a waif of the storm adrift upon a treacherous and unknown sea  kutkutkut kadawwwkut  whats that cried dorothy starting to her feet  why ive just laid an egg thats all replied a small but sharp and distinct voice and looking around her the little girl discovered a yellow hen squatting in the opposite corner of the coop  dear me she exclaimed in surprise have you been here all night too  of course answered the hen fluttering her wings and yawning  when the coop blew away from the ship i clung fast to this corner with claws and beak for i knew if i fell into the water id surely be drowned  indeed i nearly drowned as it was with all that water washing over me  i never was so wet before in my life  yes agreed dorothy it was pretty wet for a time i know  but do you feel comforble now  not very  the sun has helped to dry my feathers as it has your dress and i feel better since i laid my morning egg  but whats to become of us i should like to know afloat on this big pond  id like to know that too said dorothy  but tell me how does it happen that you are able to talk  i thought hens could only cluck and cackle  why as for that answered the yellow hen thoughtfully ive clucked and cackled all my life and never spoken a word before this morning that i can remember  but when you asked a question a minute ago it seemed the most natural thing in the world to answer you  so i spoke and i seem to keep on speaking just as you and other human beings do strange isnt it  very replied dorothy  if we were in the land of oz i wouldnt think it so queer because many of the animals can talk in that fairy country  but out here in the ocean must be a good long way from oz  how is my grammar asked the yellow hen anxiously  do i speak quite properly in your judgment  yes said dorothy you do very well for a beginner  im glad to know that continued the yellow hen in a confidential tone because if one is going to talk its best to talk correctly the red rooster has often said that my cluck and my cackle were quite perfect and now its a comfort to know i am talking properly  im beginning to get hungry remarked dorothy  its breakfast time but theres no breakfast  you may have my egg said the yellow hen  i dont care for it you know  dont you want to hatch it asked the little girl in surprise  no indeed i never care to hatch eggs unless ive a nice snug nest in some quiet place with a bakers dozen of eggs under me  thats thirteen you know and its a lucky number for hens  so you may as well eat this egg  oh i couldnt possbly eat it unless it was cooked exclaimed dorothy  but im much obliged for your kindness just the same  dont mention it my dear answered the hen calmly and began preening her feathers  for a moment dorothy stood looking out over the wide sea  she was still thinking of the egg though so presently she asked  why do you lay eggs when you dont expect to hatch them  its a habit i have replied the yellow hen  it has always been my pride to lay a fresh egg every morning except when im moulting  i never feel like having my morning cackle till the egg is properly laid and without the chance to cackle i would not be happy  its strange said the girl reflectively but as im not a hen i cant be spected to understand that  certainly not my dear  then dorothy fell silent again  the yellow hen was some company and a bit of comfort too but it was dreadfully lonely out on the big ocean nevertheless  after a time the hen flew up and perched upon the topmost slat of the coop which was a little above dorothys head when she was sitting upon the bottom as she had been doing for some moments past  why we are not far from land exclaimed the hen  where  where is it cried dorothy jumping up in great excitement  over there a little way answered the hen nodding her head in a certain direction  we seem to be drifting toward it so that before noon we ought to find ourselves upon dry land again  i shall like that said dorothy with a little sigh for her feet and legs were still wetted now and then by the seawater that came through the open slats  so shall i answered her companion  there is nothing in the world so miserable as a wet hen  the land which they seemed to be rapidly approaching since it grew more distinct every minute was quite beautiful as viewed by the little girl in the floating hencoop  next to the water was a broad beach of white sand and gravel and farther back were several rocky hills while beyond these appeared a strip of green trees that marked the edge of a forest  but there were no houses to be seen nor any sign of people who might inhabit this unknown land  i hope we shall find something to eat said dorothy looking eagerly at the pretty beach toward which they drifted  its long past breakfast time now  im a trifle hungry myself declared the yellow hen  why dont you eat the egg asked the child  you dont need to have your food cooked as i do  do you take me for a cannibal cried the hen indignantly  i do not know what i have said or done that leads you to insult me  i beg your pardon im sure mrsmrsby the way may i inquire your name maam asked the little girl  my name is bill said the yellow hen somewhat gruffly  bill  why thats a boys name  what difference does that make  youre a lady hen arent you  of course  but when i was first hatched out no one could tell whether i was going to be a hen or a rooster so the little boy at the farm where i was born called me bill and made a pet of me because i was the only yellow chicken in the whole brood  when i grew up and he found that i didnt crow and fight as all the roosters do he did not think to change my name and every creature in the barnyard as well as the people in the house knew me as bill  so bill ive always been called and bill is my name  but its all wrong you know declared dorothy earnestly and if you dont mind i shall call you billina  putting the eena on the end makes it a girls name you see  oh i dont mind it in the least returned the yellow hen  it doesnt matter at all what you call me so long as i know the name means me  very well billina  my name is dorothy galejust dorothy to my friends and miss gale to strangers  you may call me dorothy if you like  were getting very near the shore  do you suppose it is too deep for me to wade the rest of the way  wait a few minutes longer  the sunshine is warm and pleasant and we are in no hurry  but my feet are all wet and soggy said the girl  my dress is dry enough but i wont feel real comforble till i get my feet dried  she waited however as the hen advised and before long the big wooden coop grated gently on the sandy beach and the dangerous voyage was over  it did not take the castaways long to reach the shore you may be sure the yellow hen flew to the sands at once but dorothy had to climb over the high slats  still for a country girl that was not much of a feat and as soon as she was safe ashore dorothy drew off her wet shoes and stockings and spread them upon the sunwarmed beach to dry  then she sat down and watched billina who was pickpecking away with her sharp bill in the sand and gravel which she scratched up and turned over with her strong claws  what are you doing asked dorothy  getting my breakfast of course murmured the hen busily pecking away  what do you find inquired the girl curiously  oh some fat red ants and some sandbugs and once in a while a tiny crab  they are very sweet and nice i assure you  how dreadful exclaimed dorothy in a shocked voice  what is dreadful asked the hen lifting her head to gaze with one bright eye at her companion  why eating live things and horrid bugs and crawly ants  you ought to be shamed of yourself  goodness me returned the hen in a puzzled tone how queer you are dorothy  live things are much fresher and more wholesome than dead ones and you humans eat all sorts of dead creatures  we dont said dorothy  you do indeed answered billina  you eat lambs and sheep and cows and pigs and even chickens  but we cook em said dorothy triumphantly  what difference does that make  a good deal said the girl in a graver tone  i cant just splain the diffrence but its there  and anyhow we never eat such dreadful things as bugs  but you eat the chickens that eat the bugs retorted the yellow hen with an odd cackle  so you are just as bad as we chickens are  this made dorothy thoughtful  what billina said was true enough and it almost took away her appetite for breakfast  as for the yellow hen she continued to peck away at the sand busily and seemed quite contented with her billoffare  finally down near the waters edge billina stuck her bill deep into the sand and then drew back and shivered  ow she cried  i struck metal that time and it nearly broke my beak  it probbly was a rock said dorothy carelessly  nonsense  i know a rock from metal i guess said the hen  theres a different feel to it  but there couldnt be any metal on this wild deserted seashore persisted the girl  wheres the place  ill dig it up and prove to you im right  billina showed her the place where she had stubbed her bill as she expressed it and dorothy dug away the sand until she felt something hard  then thrusting in her hand she pulled the thing out and discovered it to be a large sized golden keyrather old but still bright and of perfect shape  what did i tell you cried the hen with a cackle of triumph  can i tell metal when i bump into it or is the thing a rock  its metal sure enough answered the child gazing thoughtfully at the curious thing she had found  i think it is pure gold and it must have lain hidden in the sand for a long time  how do you suppose it came there billina  and what do you suppose this mysterious key unlocks  i cant say replied the hen  you ought to know more about locks and keys than i do  dorothy glanced around  there was no sign of any house in that part of the country and she reasoned that every key must fit a lock and every lock must have a purpose  perhaps the key had been lost by somebody who lived far away but had wandered on this very shore  musing on these things the girl put the key in the pocket of her dress and then slowly drew on her shoes and stockings which the sun had fully dried  i blieve billina she said ill have a look round and see if i can find some breakfast     3  letters in the sand   walking a little way back from the waters edge toward the grove of trees dorothy came to a flat stretch of white sand that seemed to have queer signs marked upon its surface just as one would write upon sand with a stick  what does it say she asked the yellow hen who trotted along beside her in a rather dignified fashion  how should i know returned the hen  i cannot read  oh  cant you  certainly not ive never been to school you know  well i have admitted dorothy but the letters are big and far apart and its hard to spell out the words  but she looked at each letter carefully and finally discovered that these words were written in the sand  beware the wheelers   thats rather strange declared the hen when dorothy had read aloud the words  what do you suppose the wheelers are  folks that wheel i guess  they must have wheelbarrows or babycabs or handcarts said dorothy  perhaps theyre automobiles suggested the yellow hen  there is no need to beware of babycabs and wheelbarrows but automobiles are dangerous things  several of my friends have been run over by them  it cant be autobiles replied the girl for this is a new wild country without even trolleycars or telphones  the people here havent been discovered yet im sure that is if there are any people  so i dont blieve there can be any autobiles billina  perhaps not admitted the yellow hen  where are you going now  over to those trees to see if i can find some fruit or nuts answered dorothy  she tramped across the sand skirting the foot of one of the little rocky hills that stood near and soon reached the edge of the forest  at first she was greatly disappointed because the nearer trees were all punita or cottonwood or eucalyptus and bore no fruit or nuts at all  but bye and bye when she was almost in despair the little girl came upon two trees that promised to furnish her with plenty of food  one was quite full of square paper boxes which grew in clusters on all the limbs and upon the biggest and ripest boxes the word lunch could be read in neat raised letters  this tree seemed to bear all the year around for there were lunchbox blossoms on some of the branches and on others tiny little lunchboxes that were as yet quite green and evidently not fit to eat until they had grown bigger  the leaves of this tree were all paper napkins and it presented a very pleasing appearance to the hungry little girl  but the tree next to the lunchbox tree was even more wonderful for it bore quantities of tin dinnerpails which were so full and heavy that the stout branches bent underneath their weight  some were small and darkbrown in color those larger were of a dull tin color but the really ripe ones were pails of bright tin that shone and glistened beautifully in the rays of sunshine that touched them  dorothy was delighted and even the yellow hen acknowledged that she was surprised  the little girl stood on tiptoe and picked one of the nicest and biggest lunchboxes and then she sat down upon the ground and eagerly opened it  inside she found nicely wrapped in white papers a ham sandwich a piece of spongecake a pickle a slice of new cheese and an apple  each thing had a separate stem and so had to be picked off the side of the box but dorothy found them all to be delicious and she ate every bit of luncheon in the box before she had finished  a lunch isnt zactly breakfast she said to billina who sat beside her curiously watching  but when one is hungry one can eat even supper in the morning and not complain  i hope your lunchbox was perfectly ripe observed the yellow hen in a anxious tone  so much sickness is caused by eating green things  oh im sure it was ripe declared dorothy all that is cept the pickle and a pickle just has to be green billina  but everything tasted perfectly splendid and id rather have it than a church picnic and now i think ill pick a dinnerpail to have when i get hungry again and then well start out and splore the country and see where we are  havent you any idea what country this is inquired billina  none at all  but listen im quite sure its a fairy country or such things as lunchboxes and dinnerpails wouldnt be growing upon trees besides billina being a hen you wouldnt be able to talk in any civlized country like kansas where no fairies live at all  perhaps were in the land of oz said the hen thoughtfully  no that cant be answered the little girl because ive been to the land of oz and its all surrounded by a horrid desert that no one can cross  then how did you get away from there again asked billina  i had a pair of silver shoes that carried me through the air but i lost them said dorothy  ah indeed remarked the yellow hen in a tone of unbelief  anyhow resumed the girl there is no seashore near the land of oz so this must surely be some other fairy country  while she was speaking she selected a bright and pretty dinnerpail that seemed to have a stout handle and picked it from its branch then accompanied by the yellow hen she walked out of the shadow of the trees toward the seashore  they were part way across the sands when billina suddenly cried in a voice of terror  whats that  dorothy turned quickly around and saw coming out of a path that led from between the trees the most peculiar person her eyes had ever beheld  it had the form of a man except that it walked or rather rolled upon all fours and its legs were the same length as its arms giving them the appearance of the four legs of a beast  yet it was no beast that dorothy had discovered for the person was clothed most gorgeously in embroidered garments of many colors and wore a straw hat perched jauntily upon the side of its head  but it differed from human beings in this respect that instead of hands and feet there grew at the end of its arms and legs round wheels and by means of these wheels it rolled very swiftly over the level ground  afterward dorothy found that these odd wheels were of the same hard substance that our fingernails and toenails are composed of and she also learned that creatures of this strange race were born in this queer fashion  but when our little girl first caught sight of the first individual of a race that was destined to cause her a lot of trouble she had an idea that the brilliantlyclothed personage was on rollerskates which were attached to his hands as well as to his feet  run screamed the yellow hen fluttering away in great fright  its a wheeler  a wheeler exclaimed dorothy  what can that be  dont you remember the warning in the sand beware the wheelers run i tell yourun  so dorothy ran and the wheeler gave a sharp wild cry and came after her in full chase  looking over her shoulder as she ran the girl now saw a great procession of wheelers emerging from the forestdozens and dozens of themall clad in splendid tightfitting garments and all rolling swiftly toward her and uttering their wild strange cries  theyre sure to catch us panted the girl who was still carrying the heavy dinnerpail she had picked  i cant run much farther billina  climb up this hillquick said the hen and dorothy found she was very near to the heap of loose and jagged rocks they had passed on their way to the forest  the yellow hen was even now fluttering among the rocks and dorothy followed as best she could half climbing and half tumbling up the rough and rugged steep  she was none too soon for the foremost wheeler reached the hill a moment after her but while the girl scrambled up the rocks the creature stopped short with howls of rage and disappointment  dorothy now heard the yellow hen laughing in her cackling henny way  dont hurry my dear cried billina  they cant follow us among these rocks so were safe enough now  dorothy stopped at once and sat down upon a broad boulder for she was all out of breath  the rest of the wheelers had now reached the foot of the hill but it was evident that their wheels would not roll upon the rough and jagged rocks and therefore they were helpless to follow dorothy and the hen to where they had taken refuge  but they circled all around the little hill so the child and billina were fast prisoners and could not come down without being captured  then the creatures shook their front wheels at dorothy in a threatening manner and it seemed they were able to speak as well as to make their dreadful outcries for several of them shouted  well get you in time never fear  and when we do get you well tear you into little bits  why are you so cruel to me asked dorothy  im a stranger in your country and have done you no harm  no harm cried one who seemed to be their leader  did you not pick our lunchboxes and dinnerpails  have you not a stolen dinnerpail still in your hand  i only picked one of each she answered  i was hungry and i didnt know the trees were yours  that is no excuse retorted the leader who was clothed in a most gorgeous suit  it is the law here that whoever picks a dinnerpail without our permission must die immediately  dont you believe him said billina  im sure the trees do not belong to these awful creatures  they are fit for any mischief and its my opinion they would try to kill us just the same if you hadnt picked a dinnerpail  i think so too agreed dorothy  but what shall we do now  stay where we are advised the yellow hen  we are safe from the wheelers until we starve to death anyhow and before that time comes a good many things can happen     4  tiktok the machine man   after an hour or so most of the band of wheelers rolled back into the forest leaving only three of their number to guard the hill  these curled themselves up like big dogs and pretended to go to sleep on the sands but neither dorothy nor billina were fooled by this trick so they remained in security among the rocks and paid no attention to their cunning enemies  finally the hen fluttering over the mound exclaimed why heres a path  so dorothy at once clambered to where billina sat and there sure enough was a smooth path cut between the rocks  it seemed to wind around the mound from top to bottom like a corkscrew twisting here and there between the rough boulders but always remaining level and easy to walk upon  indeed dorothy wondered at first why the wheelers did not roll up this path but when she followed it to the foot of the mound she found that several big pieces of rock had been placed directly across the end of the way thus preventing any one outside from seeing it and also preventing the wheelers from using it to climb up the mound  then dorothy walked back up the path and followed it until she came to the very top of the hill where a solitary round rock stood that was bigger than any of the others surrounding it  the path came to an end just beside this great rock and for a moment it puzzled the girl to know why the path had been made at all  but the hen who had been gravely following her around and was now perched upon a point of rock behind dorothy suddenly remarked  it looks something like a door doesnt it  what looks like a door enquired the child  why that crack in the rock just facing you replied billina whose little round eyes were very sharp and seemed to see everything  it runs up one side and down the other and across the top and the bottom  what does  why the crack  so i think it must be a door of rock although i do not see any hinges  oh yes said dorothy now observing for the first time the crack in the rock  and isnt this a keyhole billina pointing to a round deep hole at one side of the door  of course  if we only had the key now we could unlock it and see what is there replied the yellow hen  may be its a treasure chamber full of diamonds and rubies or heaps of shining gold or  that reminds me said dorothy of the golden key i picked up on the shore  do you think that it would fit this keyhole billina  try it and see suggested the hen  so dorothy searched in the pocket of her dress and found the golden key  and when she had put it into the hole of the rock and turned it a sudden sharp snap was heard then with a solemn creak that made the shivers run down the childs back the face of the rock fell outward like a door on hinges and revealed a small dark chamber just inside  good gracious cried dorothy shrinking back as far as the narrow path would let her  for standing within the narrow chamber of rock was the form of a manor at least it seemed like a man in the dim light  he was only about as tall as dorothy herself and his body was round as a ball and made out of burnished copper  also his head and limbs were copper and these were jointed or hinged to his body in a peculiar way with metal caps over the joints like the armor worn by knights in days of old he stood perfectly still and where the light struck upon his form it glittered as if made of pure gold  dont be frightened called billina from her perch  it isnt alive  i see it isnt replied the girl drawing a long breath  it is only made out of copper like the old kettle in the barnyard at home continued the hen turning her head first to one side and then to the other so that both her little round eyes could examine the object  once said dorothy i knew a man made out of tin who was a woodman named nick chopper  but he was as alive as we are cause he was born a real man and got his tin body a little at a timefirst a leg and then a finger and then an earfor the reason that he had so many accidents with his axe and cut himself up in a very careless manner  oh said the hen with a sniff as if she did not believe the story  but this copper man continued dorothy looking at it with big eyes is not alive at all and i wonder what it was made for and why it was locked up in this queer place  that is a mystery remarked the hen twisting her head to arrange her wingfeathers with her bill  dorothy stepped inside the little room to get a back view of the copper man and in this way discovered a printed card that hung between his shoulders it being suspended from a small copper peg at the back of his neck  she unfastened this card and returned to the path where the light was better and sat herself down upon a slab of rock to read the printing  what does it say asked the hen curiously  dorothy read the card aloud spelling out the big words with some difficulty and this is what she read

                                    how queer said the yellow hen  do you think that is all true my dear  i dont know answered dorothy who had more to read  listen to this billina                                                                       directions for using                      for thinkingwind the clockwork man under his           left arm marked no 1                      for

the copper man can do half of these things he is a very wonderful machine  but i suppose it is all humbug like so many other patented articles  we might wind him up suggested dorothy and see what hell do  where is the key to the clockwork asked billina  hanging on the peg where i found the card  then said the hen let us try him and find out if he will go  he is warranted for a thousand years it seems but we do not know how long he has been standing inside this rock  dorothy had already taken the clock key from the peg  which shall i wind up first she asked looking again at the directions on the card  number one i should think returned billina  that makes him think doesnt it  yes said dorothy and wound up number one under the left arm  he doesnt seem any different remarked the hen critically  why of course not he is only thinking now said dorothy  i wonder what he is thinking about  ill wind up his talk and then perhaps he can tell us said the girl  so she wound up number two and immediately the clockwork man said without moving any part of his body except his lips  good morning little girl  good morning mrs hen  the words sounded a little hoarse and creaky and they were uttered all in the same tone without any change of expression whatever but both dorothy and billina understood them perfectly  good morning sir they answered politely  thank you for rescuing me continued the machine in the same monotonous voice which seemed to be worked by a bellows inside of him like the little toy lambs and cats the children squeeze so that they will make a noise  dont mention it answered dorothy  and then being very curious she asked how did you come to be locked up in this place  it is a long story replied the copper man but i will tell it to you briefly  i was purchased from smith  tinker my manufacturers by a cruel king of ev named evoldo who used to beat all his servants until they died  however he was not able to kill me because i was not alive and one must first live in order to die  so that all his beating did me no harm and merely kept my copper body well polished  this cruel king had a lovely wife and ten beautiful childrenfive boys and five girlsbut in a fit of anger he sold them all to the nome king who by means of his magic arts changed them all into other forms and put them in his underground palace to ornament the rooms  afterward the king of ev regretted his wicked action and tried to get his wife and children away from the nome king but without avail  so in despair he locked me up in this rock threw the key into the ocean and then jumped in after it and was drowned  how very dreadful exclaimed dorothy  it is indeed said the machine  when i found myself imprisoned i shouted for help until my voice ran down and then i walked back and forth in this little room until my action ran down and then i stood still and thought until my thoughts ran down  after that i remember nothing until you wound me up again  its a very wonderful story said dorothy and proves that the land of ev is really a fairy land as i thought it was  of course it is answered the copper man  i do not suppose such a perfect machine as i am could be made in any place but a fairy land  ive never seen one in kansas said dorothy  but where did you get the key to unlock this door asked the clockwork voice  i found it on the shore where it was probly washed up by the waves she answered  and now sir if you dont mind ill wind up your action  that will please me very much said the machine  so she wound up number three and at once the copper man in a somewhat stiff and jerky fashion walked out of the rocky cavern took off his copper hat and bowed politely and then kneeled before dorothy  said he  from this time forth i am your obedient servant  whatever you command that i will do willinglyif you keep me wound up  what is your name she asked  tiktok he replied  my former master gave me that name because my clockwork always ticks when it is wound up  i can hear it now said the yellow hen  so can i said dorothy  and then she added with some anxiety you dont strike do you  no answered tiktok and there is no alarm connected with my machinery  i can tell the time though by speaking and as i never sleep i can waken you at any hour you wish to get up in the morning  thats nice said the little girl only i never wish to get up in the morning  you can sleep until i lay my egg said the yellow hen  then when i cackle tiktok will know it is time to waken you  do you lay your egg very early asked dorothy  about eight oclock said billina  and everybody ought to be up by that time im sure     5  dorothy opens the dinner pail   now tiktok said dorothy the first thing to be done is to find a way for us to escape from these rocks  the wheelers are down below you know and threaten to kill us  there is no reason to be afraid of the wheelers said tiktok the words coming more slowly than before  why not she asked  because they are aggggrgrrr  he gave a sort of gurgle and stopped short waving his hands frantically until suddenly he became motionless with one arm in the air and the other held stiffly before him with all the copper fingers of the hand spread out like a fan  dear me said dorothy in a frightened tone  what can the matter be  hes run down i suppose said the hen calmly  you couldnt have wound him up very tight  i didnt know how much to wind him replied the girl but ill try to do better next time  she ran around the copper man to take the key from the peg at the back of his neck but it was not there  its gone cried dorothy in dismay  whats gone asked billina  the key  it probably fell off when he made that low bow to you returned the hen  look around and see if you cannot find it again  dorothy looked and the hen helped her and by and by the girl discovered the clockkey which had fallen into a crack of the rock  at once she wound up tiktoks voice taking care to give the key as many turns as it would go around  she found this quite a task as you may imagine if you have ever tried to wind a clock but the machine mans first words were to assure dorothy that he would now run for at least twentyfour hours  you did not wind me much at first he calmly said and i told you that long story about king evoldo so it is no wonder that i ran down  she next rewound the action clockwork and then billina advised her to carry the key to tiktok in her pocket so it would not get lost again  and now said dorothy when all this was accomplished tell me what you were going to say about the wheelers  why they are nothing to be frightend at said the machine  they try to make folks believe that they are very terrible but as a matter of fact the wheelers are harmless enough to any one that dares to fight them  they might try to hurt a little girl like you perhaps because they are very mischievous  but if i had a club they would run away as soon as they saw me  havent you a club asked dorothy  no said tiktok  and you wont find such a thing among these rocks either declared the yellow hen  then what shall we do asked the girl  wind up my thinkworks tightly and i will try to think of some other plan said tiktok  so dorothy rewound his thought machinery and while he was thinking she decided to eat her dinner  billina was already pecking away at the cracks in the rocks to find something to eat so dorothy sat down and opened her tin dinnerpail  in the cover she found a small tank that was full of very nice lemonade  it was covered by a cup which might also when removed be used to drink the lemonade from  within the pail were three slices of turkey two slices of cold tongue some lobster salad four slices of bread and butter a small custard pie an orange and nine large strawberries and some nuts and raisins  singularly enough the nuts in this dinnerpail grew already cracked so that dorothy had no trouble in picking out their meats to eat  she spread the feast upon the rock beside her and began her dinner first offering some of it to tiktok who declined because as he said he was merely a machine  afterward she offered to share with billina but the hen murmured something about dead things and said she preferred her bugs and ants  do the lunchbox trees and the dinnerpail trees belong to the wheelers the child asked tiktok while engaged in eating her meal  of course not he answered  they belong to the royal family of ev only of course there is no royal family just now because king evoldo jumped into the sea and his wife and ten children have been transformed by the nome king  so there is no one to rule the land of ev that i can think of  perhaps it is for this reason that the wheelers claim the trees for their own and pick the luncheons and dinners to eat themselves  but they belong to the king and you will find the royal e stamped upon the bottom of every dinner pail  dorothy turned the pail over and at once discovered the royal mark upon it as tiktok had said  are the wheelers the only folks living in the land of ev enquired the girl  no they only inhabit a small portion of it just back of the woods replied the machine  but they have always been mischievous and impertinent and my old master king evoldo used to carry a whip with him when he walked out to keep the creatures in order when i was first made the wheelers tried to run over me and butt me with their heads but they soon found i was built of too solid a material for them to injure  you seem very durable said dorothy  who made you  the firm of smith  tinker in the town of evna where the royal palace stands answered tiktok  did they make many of you asked the child  no i am the only automatic mechanical man they ever completed he replied  they were very wonderful inventors were my makers and quite artistic in all they did  i am sure of that said dorothy  do they live in the town of evna now  they are both gone replied the machine  mr smith was an artist as well as an inventor and he painted a picture of a river which was so natural that as he was reaching across it to paint some flowers on the opposite bank he fell into the water and was drowned  oh im sorry for that exclaimed the little girl  mister tinker continued tiktok made a ladder so tall that he could rest the end of it against the moon while he stood on the highest rung and picked the little stars to set in the points of the kings crown  but when he got to the moon mister tinker found it such a lovely place that he decided to live there so he pulled up the ladder after him and we have never seen him since  he must have been a great loss to this country said dorothy who was by this time eating her custard pie  he was acknowledged tiktok  also he is a great loss to me  for if i should get out of order i do not know of any one able to repair me because i am so complicated  you have no idea how full of machinery i am  i can imagine it said dorothy readily  and now continued the machine i must stop talking and begin thinking again of a way to escape from this rock  so he turned half way around in order to think without being disturbed  the best thinker i ever knew said dorothy to the yellow hen was a scarecrow  nonsense snapped billina  it is true declared dorothy  i met him in the land of oz and he traveled with me to the city of the great wizard of oz so as to get some brains for his head was only stuffed with straw  but it seemed to me that he thought just as well before he got his brains as he did afterward  do you expect me to believe all that rubbish about the land of oz enquired billina who seemed a little crossperhaps because bugs were scarce  what rubbish asked the child who was now finishing her nuts and raisins  why your impossible stories about animals that can talk and a tin woodman who is alive and a scarecrow who can think  they are all there said dorothy for i have seen them  i dont believe it cried the hen with a toss of her head  thats cause youre so ignrant replied the girl who was a little offended at her friend billinas speech  in the land of oz remarked tiktok turning toward them anything is possible  for it is a wonderful fairy country  there billina what did i say cried dorothy  and then she turned to the machine and asked in an eager tone do you know the land of oz tiktok  no but i have heard about it said the copper man  for it is only separated from this land of ev by a broad desert  dorothy clapped her hands together delightedly  im glad of that she exclaimed  it makes me quite happy to be so near my old friends  the scarecrow i told you of billina is the king of the land of oz  pardon me  he is not the king now said tiktok  he was when i left there declared dorothy  i know said tiktok but there was a revolution in the land of oz and the scarecrow was deposed by a soldier woman named general jinjur  and then jinjur was deposed by a little girl named ozma who was the rightful heir to the throne and now rules the land under the title of ozma of oz  that is news to me said dorothy thoughtfully  but i spose lots of things have happened since i left the land of oz  i wonder what has become of the scarecrow and of the tin woodman and the cowardly lion and i wonder who this girl ozma is for i never heard of her before  but tiktok did not reply to this  he had turned around again to resume his thinking  dorothy packed the rest of the food back into the pail so as not to be wasteful of good things and the yellow hen forgot her dignity far enough to pick up all of the scattered crumbs which she ate rather greedily although she had so lately pretended to despise the things that dorothy preferred as food  by this time tiktok approached them with his stiff bow  be kind enough to follow me he said and i will lead you away from here to the town of evna where you will be more comfortable and also i will protect you from the wheelers  all right answered dorothy promptly  im ready     6  the heads of langwidere   they walked slowly down the path between the rocks tiktok going first dorothy following him and the yellow hen trotting along last of all  at the foot of the path the copper man leaned down and tossed aside with ease the rocks that encumbered the way  then he turned to dorothy and said  let me carry your dinnerpail  she placed it in his right hand at once and the copper fingers closed firmly over the stout handle  then the little procession marched out upon the level sands  as soon as the three wheelers who were guarding the mound saw them they began to shout their wild cries and rolled swiftly toward the little group as if to capture them or bar their way  but when the foremost had approached near enough tiktok swung the tin dinnerpail and struck the wheeler a sharp blow over its head with the queer weapon  perhaps it did not hurt very much but it made a great noise and the wheeler uttered a howl and tumbled over upon its side  the next minute it scrambled to its wheels and rolled away as fast as it could go screeching with fear at the same time  i told you they were harmless began tiktok but before he could say more another wheeler was upon them  crack went the dinnerpail against its head knocking its straw hat a dozen feet away and that was enough for this wheeler also  it rolled away after the first one and the third did not wait to be pounded with the pail but joined its fellows as quickly as its wheels would whirl  the yellow hen gave a cackle of delight and flying to a perch upon tiktoks shoulder she said  bravely done my copper friend and wisely thought of too  now we are free from those ugly creatures  but just then a large band of wheelers rolled from the forest and relying upon their numbers to conquer they advanced fiercely upon tiktok  dorothy grabbed billina in her arms and held her tight and the machine embraced the form of the little girl with his left arm the better to protect her  then the wheelers were upon them  rattlety bang bang went the dinnerpail in every direction and it made so much clatter bumping against the heads of the wheelers that they were much more frightened than hurt and fled in a great panic all that is except their leader  this wheeler had stumbled against another and fallen flat upon his back and before he could get his wheels under him to rise again tiktok had fastened his copper fingers into the neck of the gorgeous jacket of his foe and held him fast  tell your people to go away commanded the machine  the leader of the wheelers hesitated to give this order so tiktok shook him as a terrier dog does a rat until the wheelers teeth rattled together with a noise like hailstones on a window pane  then as soon as the creature could get its breath it shouted to the others to roll away which they immediately did  now said tiktok you shall come with us and tell me what i want to know  youll be sorry for treating me in this way whined the wheeler im a terribly fierce person  as for that answered tiktok i am only a machine and cannot feel sorrow or joy no matter what happens  but you are wrong to think yourself terrible or fierce  why so asked the wheeler  because no one else thinks as you do  your wheels make you helpless to injure any one  for you have no fists and can not scratch or even pull hair  nor have you any feet to kick with  all you can do is to yell and shout and that does not hurt any one at all  the wheeler burst into a flood of tears to dorothys great surprise  now i and my people are ruined forever he sobbed for you have discovered our secret  being so helpless our only hope is to make people afraid of us by pretending we are very fierce and terrible and writing in the sand warnings to beware the wheelers  until now we have frightened everyone but since you have discovered our weakness our enemies will fall upon us and make us very miserable and unhappy  oh no exclaimed dorothy who was sorry to see this beautifully dressed wheeler so miserable tiktok will keep your secret and so will billina and i  only you must promise not to try to frighten children any more if they come near to you  i wontindeed i wont promised the wheeler ceasing to cry and becoming more cheerful  im not really bad you know but we have to pretend to be terrible in order to prevent others from attacking us  that is not exactly true said tiktok starting to walk toward the path through the forest and still holding fast to his prisoner who rolled slowly along beside him  you and your people are full of mischief and like to bother those who fear you  and you are often impudent and disagreeable too  but if you will try to cure those faults i will not tell anyone how helpless you are  ill try of course replied the wheeler eagerly  and thank you mr tiktok for your kindness  i am only a machine said tiktok  i can not be kind any more than i can be sorry or glad  i can only do what i am wound up to do  are you wound up to keep my secret asked the wheeler anxiously  yes if you behave yourself  but tell me who rules the land of ev now asked the machine  there is no ruler was the answer because every member of the royal family is imprisoned by the nome king  but the princess langwidere who is a niece of our late king evoldo lives in a part of the royal palace and takes as much money out of the royal treasury as she can spend  the princess langwidere is not exactly a ruler you see because she doesnt rule but she is the nearest approach to a ruler we have at present  i do not remember her said tiktok  what does she look like  that i cannot say replied the wheeler although i have seen her twenty times  for the princess langwidere is a different person every time i see her and the only way her subjects can recognize her at all is by means of a beautiful ruby key which she always wears on a chain attached to her left wrist  when we see the key we know we are beholding the princess  that is strange said dorothy in astonishment  do you mean to say that so many different princesses are one and the same person  not exactly answered the wheeler  there is of course but one princess but she appears to us in many forms which are all more or less beautiful  she must be a witch exclaimed the girl  i do not think so declared the wheeler  but there is some mystery connected with her nevertheless  she is a very vain creature and lives mostly in a room surrounded by mirrors so that she can admire herself whichever way she looks  no one answered this speech because they had just passed out of the forest and their attention was fixed upon the scene before thema beautiful vale in which were many fruit trees and green fields with pretty farmhouses scattered here and there and broad smooth roads that led in every direction  in the center of this lovely vale about a mile from where our friends were standing rose the tall spires of the royal palace which glittered brightly against their background of blue sky  the palace was surrounded by charming grounds full of flowers and shrubbery several tinkling fountains could be seen and there were pleasant walks bordered by rows of white marble statuary  all these details dorothy was of course unable to notice or admire until they had advanced along the road to a position quite near to the palace and she was still looking at the pretty sights when her little party entered the grounds and approached the big front door of the kings own apartments  to their disappointment they found the door tightly closed  a sign was tacked to the panel which read as follows                                             owner absent                                           please knock at the third      door in the left wing                                          now said tiktok to the captive wheeler you must show us the way to the left wing  very well agreed the prisoner it is around here at the right  how can the left wing be at the right demanded dorothy who feared the wheeler was fooling them  because there used to be three wings and two were torn down so the one on the right is the only one left  it is a trick of the princess langwidere to prevent visitors from annoying her  then the captive led them around to the wing after which the machine man having no further use for the wheeler permitted him to depart and rejoin his fellows  he immediately rolled away at a great pace and was soon lost to sight  tiktok now counted the doors in the wing and knocked loudly upon the third one  it was opened by a little maid in a cap trimmed with gay ribbons who bowed respectfully and asked  what do you wish good people  are you the princess langwidere asked dorothy  no miss i am her servant replied the maid  may i see the princess please  i will tell her you are here miss and ask her to grant you an audience said the maid  step in please and take a seat in the drawingroom  so dorothy walked in followed closely by the machine  but as the yellow hen tried to enter after them the little maid cried shoo and flapped her apron in billinas face  shoo yourself retorted the hen drawing back in anger and ruffling up her feathers  havent you any better manners than that  oh do you talk enquired the maid evidently surprised  cant you hear me snapped billina  drop that apron and get out of the doorway so that i may enter with my friends  the princess wont like it said the maid hesitating  i dont care whether she likes it or not replied billina and fluttering her wings with a loud noise she flew straight at the maids face  the little servant at once ducked her head and the hen reached dorothys side in safety  very well sighed the maid if you are all ruined because of this obstinate hen dont blame me for it  it isnt safe to annoy the princess langwidere  tell her we are waiting if you please dorothy requested with dignity  billina is my friend and must go wherever i go  without more words the maid led them to a richly furnished drawingroom lighted with subdued rainbow tints that came in through beautiful stainedglass windows  remain here she said  what names shall i give the princess  i am dorothy gale of kansas replied the child and this gentleman is a machine named tiktok and the yellow hen is my friend billina  the little servant bowed and withdrew going through several passages and mounting two marble stairways before she came to the apartments occupied by her mistress  princess langwideres sittingroom was paneled with great mirrors which reached from the ceiling to the floor also the ceiling was composed of mirrors and the floor was of polished silver that reflected every object upon it  so when langwidere sat in her easy chair and played soft melodies upon her mandolin her form was mirrored hundreds of times in walls and ceiling and floor and whichever way the lady turned her head she could see and admire her own features this she loved to do and just as the maid entered she was saying to herself  this head with the auburn hair and hazel eyes is quite attractive  i must wear it more often than i have done of late although it may not be the best of my collection  you have company your highness announced the maid bowing low  who is it asked langwidere yawning  dorothy gale of kansas mr tiktok and billina answered the maid  what a queer lot of names murmured the princess beginning to be a little interested  what are they like  is dorothy gale of kansas pretty  she might be called so the maid replied  and is mr tiktok attractive continued the princess  that i cannot say your highness  but he seems very bright  will your gracious highness see them  oh i may as well nanda  but i am tired admiring this head and if my visitor has any claim to beauty i must take care that she does not surpass me  so i will go to my cabinet and change to no 17 which i think is my best appearance  dont you  your no 17 is exceedingly beautiful answered nanda with another bow  again the princess yawned  then she said  help me to rise  so the maid assisted her to gain her feet although langwidere was the stronger of the two and then the princess slowly walked across the silver floor to her cabinet leaning heavily at every step upon nandas arm  now i must explain to you that the princess langwidere had thirty headsas many as there are days in the month  but of course she could only wear one of them at a time because she had but one neck  these heads were kept in what she called her cabinet which was a beautiful dressingroom that lay just between langwideres sleepingchamber and the mirrored sittingroom  each head was in a separate cupboard lined with velvet  the cupboards ran all around the sides of the dressingroom and had elaborately carved doors with gold numbers on the outside and jeweledframed mirrors on the inside of them  when the princess got out of her crystal bed in the morning she went to her cabinet opened one of the velvetlined cupboards and took the head it contained from its golden shelf  then by the aid of the mirror inside the open door she put on the headas neat and straight as could beand afterward called her maids to robe her for the day she always wore a simple white costume that suited all the heads for being able to change her face whenever she liked the princess had no interest in wearing a variety of gowns as have other ladies who are compelled to wear the same face constantly  of course the thirty heads were in great variety no two formed alike but all being of exceeding loveliness  there were heads with golden hair brown hair rich auburn hair and black hair but none with gray hair  the heads had eyes of blue of gray of hazel of brown and of black but there were no red eyes among them and all were bright and handsome  the noses were grecian roman retrousse and oriental representing all types of beauty and the mouths were of assorted sizes and shapes displaying pearly teeth when the heads smiled  as for dimples they appeared in cheeks and chins wherever they might be most charming and one or two heads had freckles upon the faces to contrast the better with the brilliancy of their complexions  one key unlocked all the velvet cupboards containing these treasuresa curious key carved from a single bloodred rubyand this was fastened to a strong but slender chain which the princess wore around her left wrist  when nanda had supported langwidere to a position in front of cupboard no 17 the princess unlocked the door with her ruby key and after handing head no 9 which she had been wearing to the maid she took no 17 from its shelf and fitted it to her neck  it had black hair and dark eyes and a lovely pearlandwhite complexion and when langwidere wore it she knew she was remarkably beautiful in appearance  there was only one trouble with no 17 the temper that went with it and which was hidden somewhere under the glossy black hair was fiery harsh and haughty in the extreme and it often led the princess to do unpleasant things which she regretted when she came to wear her other heads  but she did not remember this today and went to meet her guests in the drawingroom with a feeling of certainty that she would surprise them with her beauty  however she was greatly disappointed to find that her visitors were merely a small girl in a gingham dress a copper man that would only go when wound up and a yellow hen that was sitting contentedly in langwideres best workbasket where there was a china egg used for darning stockings  it may surprise you to learn that a princess ever does such a common thing as darn stockings  but if you will stop to think you will realize that a princess is sure to wear holes in her stockings the same as other people only it isnt considered quite polite to mention the matter  oh said langwidere slightly lifting the nose of no 17  i thought some one of importance had called  then you were right declared dorothy  im a good deal of portance myself and when billina lays an egg she has the proudest cackle you ever heard  as for tiktok hes the  stopstop commanded the princess with an angry flash of her splendid eyes  how dare you annoy me with your senseless chatter  why you horrid thing said dorothy who was not accustomed to being treated so rudely  the princess looked at her more closely  tell me she resumed are you of royal blood  better than that maam said dorothy  i came from kansas  huh cried the princess scornfully  you are a foolish child and i cannot allow you to annoy me  run away you little goose and bother some one else  dorothy was so indignant that for a moment she could find no words to reply  but she rose from her chair and was about to leave the room when the princess who had been scanning the girls face stopped her by saying more gently  come nearer to me  dorothy obeyed without a thought of fear and stood before the princess while langwidere examined her face with careful attention  you are rather attractive said the lady presently  not at all beautiful you understand but you have a certain style of prettiness that is different from that of any of my thirty heads  so i believe ill take your head and give you no 26 for it  well i blieve you wont exclaimed dorothy  it will do you no good to refuse continued the princess for i need your head for my collection and in the land of ev my will is law  i never have cared much for no 26 and you will find that it is very little worn  besides it will do you just as well as the one youre wearing for all practical purposes  i dont know anything about your no 26 and i dont want to said dorothy firmly  im not used to taking castoff things so ill just keep my own head  you refuse cried the princess with a frown  of course i do was the reply  then said langwidere i shall lock you up in a tower until you decide to obey me  nanda turning to her maid call my army  nanda rang a silver bell and at once a big fat colonel in a bright red uniform entered the room followed by ten lean soldiers who all looked sad and discouraged and saluted the princess in a very melancholy fashion  carry that girl to the north tower and lock her up cried the princess pointing to dorothy  to hear is to obey answered the big red colonel and caught the child by her arm  but at that moment tiktok raised his dinnerpail and pounded it so forcibly against the colonels head that the big officer sat down upon the floor with a sudden bump looking both dazed and very much astonished  help he shouted and the ten lean soldiers sprang to assist their leader  there was great excitement for the next few moments and tiktok had knocked down seven of the army who were sprawling in every direction upon the carpet when suddenly the machine paused with the dinnerpail raised for another blow and remained perfectly motionless  my action has run down he called to dorothy  wind me up quick  she tried to obey but the big colonel had by this time managed to get upon his feet again so he grabbed fast hold of the girl and she was helpless to escape  this is too bad said the machine  i ought to have run six hours longer at least but i suppose my long walk and my fight with the wheelers made me run down faster than usual  well it cant be helped said dorothy with a sigh  will you exchange heads with me demanded the princess  no indeed cried dorothy  then lock her up said langwidere to her soldiers and they led dorothy to a high tower at the north of the palace and locked her securely within  the soldiers afterward tried to lift tiktok but they found the machine so solid and heavy that they could not stir it  so they left him standing in the center of the drawingroom  people will think i have a new statue said langwidere so it wont matter in the least and nanda can keep him well polished  what shall we do with the hen asked the colonel who had just discovered billina in the workbasket  put her in the chickenhouse answered the princess  someday ill have her fried for breakfast  she looks rather tough your highness said nanda doubtfully  that is a base slander cried billina struggling frantically in the colonels arms  but the breed of chickens i come from is said to be poison to all princesses  then remarked langwidere i will not fry the hen but keep her to lay eggs and if she doesnt do her duty ill have her drowned in the horse trough     7  ozma of oz to the rescue   nanda brought dorothy bread and water for her supper and she slept upon a hard stone couch with a single pillow and a silken coverlet  in the morning she leaned out of the window of her prison in the tower to see if there was any way to escape  the room was not so very high up when compared with our modern buildings but it was far enough above the trees and farm houses to give her a good view of the surrounding country  to the east she saw the forest with the sands beyond it and the ocean beyond that  there was even a dark speck upon the shore that she thought might be the chickencoop in which she had arrived at this singular country  then she looked to the north and saw a deep but narrow valley lying between two rocky mountains and a third mountain that shut off the valley at the further end  westward the fertile land of ev suddenly ended a little way from the palace and the girl could see miles and miles of sandy desert that stretched further than her eyes could reach  it was this desert she thought with much interest that alone separated her from the wonderful land of oz and she remembered sorrowfully that she had been told no one had ever been able to cross this dangerous waste but herself  once a cyclone had carried her across it and a magical pair of silver shoes had carried her back again  but now she had neither a cyclone nor silver shoes to assist her and her condition was sad indeed  for she had become the prisoner of a disagreeable princess who insisted that she must exchange her head for another one that she was not used to and which might not fit her at all  really there seemed no hope of help for her from her old friends in the land of oz  thoughtfully she gazed from her narrow window  on all the desert not a living thing was stirring  wait though  something surely was stirring on the desertsomething her eyes had not observed at first  now it seemed like a cloud now it seemed like a spot of silver now it seemed to be a mass of rainbow colors that moved swiftly toward her  what could it be she wondered  then gradually but in a brief space of time nevertheless the vision drew near enough to dorothy to make out what it was  a broad green carpet was unrolling itself upon the desert while advancing across the carpet was a wonderful procession that made the girl open her eyes in amazement as she gazed  first came a magnificent golden chariot drawn by a great lion and an immense tiger who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted along as gracefully as a wellmatched team of thoroughbred horses  and standing upright within the chariot was a beautiful girl clothed in flowing robes of silver gauze and wearing a jeweled diadem upon her dainty head  she held in one hand the satin ribbons that guided her astonishing team and in the other an ivory wand that separated at the top into two prongs the prongs being tipped by the letters o and z made of glistening diamonds set closely together  the girl seemed neither older nor larger than dorothy herself and at once the prisoner in the tower guessed that the lovely driver of the chariot must be that ozma of oz of whom she had so lately heard from tiktok  following close behind the chariot dorothy saw her old friend the scarecrow riding calmly astride a wooden sawhorse which pranced and trotted as naturally as any meat horse could have done  and then came nick chopper the tin woodman with his funnelshaped cap tipped carelessly over his left ear his gleaming axe over his right shoulder and his whole body sparkling as brightly as it had ever done in the old days when first she knew him  the tin woodman was on foot marching at the head of a company of twentyseven soldiers of whom some were lean and some fat some short and some tall but all the twentyseven were dressed in handsome uniforms of various designs and colors no two being alike in any respect  behind the soldiers the green carpet rolled itself up again so that there was always just enough of it for the procession to walk upon in order that their feet might not come in contact with the deadly lifedestroying sands of the desert  dorothy knew at once it was a magic carpet she beheld and her heart beat high with hope and joy as she realized she was soon to be rescued and allowed to greet her dearly beloved friends of ozthe scarecrow the tin woodman and the cowardly lion  indeed the girl felt herself as good as rescued as soon as she recognized those in the procession for she well knew the courage and loyalty of her old comrades and also believed that any others who came from their marvelous country would prove to be pleasant and reliable acquaintances  as soon as the last bit of desert was passed and all the procession from the beautiful and dainty ozma to the last soldier had reached the grassy meadows of the land of ev the magic carpet rolled itself together and entirely disappeared  then the chariot driver turned her lion and tiger into a broad roadway leading up to the palace and the others followed while dorothy still gazed from her tower window in eager excitement  they came quite close to the front door of the palace and then halted the scarecrow dismounting from his sawhorse to approach the sign fastened to the door that he might read what it said  dorothy just above him could keep silent no longer  here i am she shouted as loudly as she could  heres dorothy  dorothy who asked the scarecrow tipping his head to look upward until he nearly lost his balance and tumbled over backward  dorothy gale of course  your friend from kansas she answered  why hello dorothy said the scarecrow  what in the world are you doing up there  nothing she called down because theres nothing to do  save me my friendsave me  you seem to be quite safe now replied the scarecrow  but im a prisoner  im locked in so that i cant get out she pleaded  thats all right said the scarecrow  you might be worse off little dorothy  just consider the matter  you cant get drowned or be run over by a wheeler or fall out of an appletree  some folks would think they were lucky to be up there  well i dont declared the girl and i want to get down immeditly and see you and the tin woodman and the cowardly lion  very well said the scarecrow nodding  it shall be just as you say little friend  who locked you up  the princess langwidere who is a horrid creature she answered  at this ozma who had been listening carefully to the conversation called to dorothy from her chariot asking  why did the princess lock you up my dear  because exclaimed dorothy i wouldnt let her have my head for her collection and take an old castoff head in exchange for it  i do not blame you exclaimed ozma promptly  i will see the princess at once and oblige her to liberate you  oh thank you very very much cried dorothy who as soon as she heard the sweet voice of the girlish ruler of oz knew that she would soon learn to love her dearly  ozma now drove her chariot around to the third door of the wing upon which the tin woodman boldly proceeded to knock  as soon as the maid opened the door ozma bearing in her hand her ivory wand stepped into the hall and made her way at once to the drawingroom followed by all her company except the lion and the tiger  and the twentyseven soldiers made such a noise and a clatter that the little maid nanda ran away screaming to her mistress whereupon the princess langwidere roused to great anger by this rude invasion of her palace came running into the drawingroom without any assistance whatever  there she stood before the slight and delicate form of the little girl from oz and cried out  how dare you enter my palace unbidden  leave this room at once or i will bind you and all your people in chains and throw you into my darkest dungeons  what a dangerous lady murmured the scarecrow in a soft voice  she seems a little nervous replied the tin woodman  but ozma only smiled at the angry princess  sit down please she said quietly  i have traveled a long way to see you and you must listen to what i have to say  must screamed the princess her black eyes flashing with furyfor she still wore her no 17 head  must to me  to be sure said ozma  i am ruler of the land of oz and i am powerful enough to destroy all your kingdom if i so wish  yet i did not come here to do harm but rather to free the royal family of ev from the thrall of the nome king the news having reached me that he is holding the queen and her children prisoners  hearing these words langwidere suddenly became quiet  i wish you could indeed free my aunt and her ten royal children said she eagerly  for if they were restored to their proper forms and station they could rule the kingdom of ev themselves and that would save me a lot of worry and trouble  at present there are at least ten minutes every day that i must devote to affairs of state and i would like to be able to spend my whole time in admiring my beautiful heads  then we will presently discuss this matter said ozma and try to find a way to liberate your aunt and cousins  but first you must liberate another prisonerthe little girl you have locked up in your tower  of course said langwidere readily  i had forgotten all about her that was yesterday you know and a princess cannot be expected to remember today what she did yesterday  come with me and i will release the prisoner at once  so ozma followed her and they passed up the stairs that led to the room in the tower  while they were gone ozmas followers remained in the drawingroom and the scarecrow was leaning against a form that he had mistaken for a copper statue when a harsh metallic voice said suddenly in his ear  get off my foot please  you are scratching my polish  oh excuse me he replied hastily drawing back  are you alive  no said tiktok i am only a machine  but i can think and speak and act when i am properly wound up  just now my action is run down and dorothy has the key to it  thats all right replied the scarecrow  dorothy will soon be free and then shell attend to your works  but it must be a great misfortune not to be alive  im sorry for you  why asked tiktok  because you have no brains as i have said the scarecrow  oh yes i have returned tiktok  i am fitted with smith  tinkers improved combination steel brains  they are what make me think  what sort of brains are you fitted with  i dont know admitted the scarecrow  they were given to me by the great wizard of oz and i didnt get a chance to examine them before he put them in  but they work splendidly and my conscience is very active  have you a conscience  no said tiktok  and no heart i suppose added the tin woodman who had been listening with interest to this conversation  no said tiktok  then continued the tin woodman i regret to say that you are greatly inferior to my friend the scarecrow and to myself  for we are both alive and he has brains which do not need to be wound up while i have an excellent heart that is continually beating in my bosom  i congratulate you replied tiktok  i cannot help being your inferior for i am a mere machine  when i am wound up i do my duty by going just as my machinery is made to go  you have no idea how full of machinery i am  i can guess said the scarecrow looking at the machine man curiously  some day id like to take you apart and see just how you are made  do not do that i beg of you said tiktok for you could not put me together again and my usefulness would be destroyed  oh are you useful asked the scarecrow surprised  very said tiktok  in that case the scarecrow kindly promised i wont fool with your interior at all  for i am a poor mechanic and might mix you up  thank you said tiktok  just then ozma reentered the room leading dorothy by the hand and followed closely by the princess langwidere     8  the hungry tiger   the first thing dorothy did was to rush into the embrace of the scarecrow whose painted face beamed with delight as he pressed her form to his strawpadded bosom  then the tin woodman embraced hervery gently for he knew his tin arms might hurt her if he squeezed too roughly  these greetings having been exchanged dorothy took the key to tiktok from her pocket and wound up the machine mans action so that he could bow properly when introduced to the rest of the company  while doing this she told them how useful tiktok had been to her and both the scarecrow and the tin woodman shook hands with the machine once more and thanked him for protecting their friend  then dorothy asked where is billina  i dont know said the scarecrow  who is billina  shes a yellow hen who is another friend of mine answered the girl anxiously  i wonder what has become of her  she is in the chicken house in the back yard said the princess my drawingroom is no place for hens  without waiting to hear more dorothy ran to get billina and just outside the door she came upon the cowardly lion still hitched to the chariot beside the great tiger  the cowardly lion had a big bow of blue ribbon fastened to the long hair between his ears and the tiger wore a bow of red ribbon on his tail just in front of the bushy end  in an instant dorothy was hugging the huge lion joyfully  im so glad to see you again she cried  i am also glad to see you dorothy said the lion  weve had some fine adventures together havent we  yes indeed she replied  how are you  as cowardly as ever the beast answered in a meek voice  every little thing scares me and makes my heart beat fast  but let me introduce to you a new friend of mine the hungry tiger  oh  are you hungry she asked turning to the other beast who was just then yawning so widely that he displayed two rows of terrible teeth and a mouth big enough to startle anyone  dreadfully hungry answered the tiger snapping his jaws together with a fierce click  then why dont you eat something she asked  its no use said the tiger sadly  ive tried that but i always get hungry again  why it is the same with me said dorothy  yet i keep on eating  but you eat harmless things so it doesnt matter replied the tiger for my part im a savage beast and have an appetite for all sorts of poor little living creatures from a chipmunk to fat babies  how dreadful said dorothy  isnt it though returned the hungry tiger licking his lips with his long red tongue  fat babies  dont they sound delicious  but ive never eaten any because my conscience tells me it is wrong  if i had no conscience i would probably eat the babies and then get hungry again which would mean that i had sacrificed the poor babies for nothing  no hungry i was born and hungry i shall die  but ill not have any cruel deeds on my conscience to be sorry for  i think you are a very good tiger said dorothy patting the huge head of the beast  in that you are mistaken was the reply  i am a good beast perhaps but a disgracefully bad tiger  for it is the nature of tigers to be cruel and ferocious and in refusing to eat harmless living creatures i am acting as no good tiger has ever before acted  that is why i left the forest and joined my friend the cowardly lion  but the lion is not really cowardly said dorothy  i have seen him act as bravely as can be  all a mistake my dear protested the lion gravely  to others i may have seemed brave at times but i have never been in any danger that i was not afraid  nor i said dorothy truthfully but i must go and set free billina and then i will see you again  she ran around to the back yard of the palace and soon found the chicken house being guided to it by a loud cackling and crowing and a distracting hubbub of sounds such as chickens make when they are excited  something seemed to be wrong in the chicken house and when dorothy looked through the slats in the door she saw a group of hens and roosters huddled in one corner and watching what appeared to be a whirling ball of feathers  it bounded here and there about the chicken house and at first dorothy could not tell what it was while the screeching of the chickens nearly deafened her  but suddenly the bunch of feathers stopped whirling and then to her amazement the girl saw billina crouching upon the prostrate form of a speckled rooster  for an instant they both remained motionless and then the yellow hen shook her wings to settle the feathers and walked toward the door with a strut of proud defiance and a cluck of victory while the speckled rooster limped away to the group of other chickens trailing his crumpled plumage in the dust as he went  why billina cried dorothy in a shocked voice have you been fighting  i really think i have retorted billina  do you think id let that speckled villain of a rooster lord it over me and claim to run this chicken house as long as im able to peck and scratch  not if my name is bill  it isnt bill its billina and youre talking slang which is very undignfied said dorothy reprovingly  come here billina and ill let you out for ozma of oz is here and has set us free  so the yellow hen came to the door which dorothy unlatched for her to pass through and the other chickens silently watched them from their corner without offering to approach nearer  the girl lifted her friend in her arms and exclaimed  oh billina how dreadful you look  youve lost a lot of feathers and one of your eyes is nearly pecked out and your comb is bleeding  thats nothing said billina  just look at the speckled rooster didnt i do him up brown  dorothy shook her head  i dont prove of this at all she said carrying billina away toward the palace  it isnt a good thing for you to sociate with those common chickens  they would soon spoil your good manners and you wouldnt be respecable any more  i didnt ask to associate with them replied billina  it is that cross old princess who is to blame  but i was raised in the united states and i wont allow any onehorse chicken of the land of ev to run over me and put on airs as long as i can lift a claw in selfdefense  very well billina said dorothy  we wont talk about it any more  soon they came to the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger to whom the girl introduced the yellow hen  glad to meet any friend of dorothys said the lion politely  to judge by your present appearance you are not a coward as i am  your present appearance makes my mouth water said the tiger looking at billina greedily  my my how good you would taste if i could only crunch you between my jaws  but dont worry  you would only appease my appetite for a moment so it isnt worth while to eat you  thank you said the hen nestling closer in dorothys arms  besides it wouldnt be right continued the tiger looking steadily at billina and clicking his jaws together  of course not cried dorothy hastily  billina is my friend and you mustnt ever eat her under any circmstances  ill try to remember that said the tiger but im a little absentminded at times  then dorothy carried her pet into the drawingroom of the palace where tiktok being invited to do so by ozma had seated himself between the scarecrow and the tin woodman  opposite to them sat ozma herself and the princess langwidere and beside them there was a vacant chair for dorothy  around this important group was ranged the army of oz and as dorothy looked at the handsome uniforms of the twentyseven she said  why they seem to be all officers  they are all except one answered the tin woodman  i have in my army eight generals six colonels seven majors and five captains besides one private for them to command  id like to promote the private for i believe no private should ever be in public life and ive also noticed that officers usually fight better and are more reliable than common soldiers  besides the officers are more important looking and lend dignity to our army  no doubt you are right said dorothy seating herself beside ozma  and now announced the girlish ruler of oz we will hold a solemn conference to decide the best manner of liberating the royal family of this fair land of ev from their long imprisonment     9  the royal family of ev   the tin woodman was the first to address the meeting  to begin with said he word came to our noble and illustrious ruler ozma of oz that the wife and ten childrenfive boys and five girlsof the former king of ev by name evoldo have been enslaved by the nome king and are held prisoners in his underground palace  also that there was no one in ev powerful enough to release them  naturally our ozma wished to undertake the adventure of liberating the poor prisoners but for a long time she could find no way to cross the great desert between the two countries  finally she went to a friendly sorceress of our land named glinda the good who heard the story and at once presented ozma a magic carpet which would continually unroll beneath our feet and so make a comfortable path for us to cross the desert  as soon as she had received the carpet our gracious ruler ordered me to assemble our army which i did  you behold in these bold warriors the pick of all the finest soldiers of oz and if we are obliged to fight the nome king every officer as well as the private will battle fiercely unto death  then tiktok spoke  why should you fight the nome king he asked  he has done no wrong  no wrong cried dorothy  isnt it wrong to imprison a queen mother and her ten children  they were sold to the nome king by king evoldo replied tiktok it was the king of ev who did wrong and when he realized what he had done he jumped into the sea and drowned himself  this is news to me said ozma thoughtfully  i had supposed the nome king was all to blame in the matter  but in any case he must be made to liberate the prisoners  my uncle evoldo was a very wicked man declared the princess langwidere  if he had drowned himself before he sold his family no one would have cared  but he sold them to the powerful nome king in exchange for a long life and afterward destroyed the life by jumping into the sea  then said ozma he did not get the long life and the nome king must give up the prisoners  where are they confined  no one knows exactly replied the princess  for the king whose name is roquat of the rocks owns a splendid palace underneath the great mountain which is at the north end of this kingdom and he has transformed the queen and her children into ornaments and bricabrac with which to decorate his rooms  id like to know said dorothy who this nome king is  i will tell you replied ozma  he is said to be the ruler of the underground world and commands the rocks and all that the rocks contain  under his rule are many thousands of the nomes who are queerly shaped but powerful sprites that labor at the furnaces and forges of their king making gold and silver and other metals which they conceal in the crevices of the rocks so that those living upon the earths surface can only find them with great difficulty  also they make diamonds and rubies and emeralds which they hide in the ground so that the kingdom of the nomes is wonderfully rich and all we have of precious stones and silver and gold is what we take from the earth and rocks where the nome king has hidden them  i understand said dorothy nodding her little head wisely  for the reason that we often steal his treasures continued ozma the ruler of the underground world is not fond of those who live upon the earths surface and never appears among us  if we wish to see king roquat of the rocks we must visit his own country where he is all powerful and therefore it will be a dangerous undertaking  but for the sake of the poor prisoners said dorothy we ought to do it  we shall do it replied the scarecrow although it requires a lot of courage for me to go near to the furnaces of the nome king  for i am only stuffed with straw and a single spark of fire might destroy me entirely  the furnaces may also melt my tin said the tin woodman but i am going  i cant bear heat remarked the princess langwidere yawning lazily so i shall stay at home  but i wish you may have success in your undertaking for i am heartily tired of ruling this stupid kingdom and i need more leisure in which to admire my beautiful heads  we do not need you said ozma  for if with the aid of my brave followers i cannot accomplish my purpose then it would be useless for you to undertake the journey  quite true sighed the princess  so if youll excuse me i will now retire to my cabinet  ive worn this head quite awhile and i want to change it for another  when she had left them and you may be sure no one was sorry to see her go ozma said to tiktok  will you join our party  i am the slave of the girl dorothy who rescued me from prison replied the machine  where she goes i will go  oh i am going with my friends of course said dorothy quickly  i wouldnt miss the fun for anything  will you go too billina  to be sure said billina in a careless tone  she was smoothing down the feathers of her back and not paying much attention  heat is just in her line remarked the scarecrow  if she is nicely roasted she will be better than ever  then said ozma we will arrange to start for the kingdom of the nomes at daybreak tomorrow  and in the meantime we will rest and prepare ourselves for the journey  although princess langwidere did not again appear to her guests the palace servants waited upon the strangers from oz and did everything in their power to make the party comfortable  there were many vacant rooms at their disposal and the brave army of twentyseven was easily provided for and liberally feasted  the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger were unharnessed from the chariot and allowed to roam at will throughout the palace where they nearly frightened the servants into fits although they did no harm at all  at one time dorothy found the little maid nanda crouching in terror in a corner with the hungry tiger standing before her  you certainly look delicious the beast was saying  will you kindly give me permission to eat you  no no no cried the maid in reply  then said the tiger yawning frightfully please to get me about thirty pounds of tenderloin steak cooked rare with a peck of boiled potatoes on the side and five gallons of icecream for dessert  iill do the best i can said nanda and she ran away as fast as she could go  are you so very hungry asked dorothy in wonder  you can hardly imagine the size of my appetite replied the tiger sadly  it seems to fill my whole body from the end of my throat to the tip of my tail  i am very sure the appetite doesnt fit me and is too large for the size of my body  some day when i meet a dentist with a pair of forceps im going to have it pulled  what your tooth asked dorothy  no my appetite said the hungry tiger  the little girl spent most of the afternoon talking with the scarecrow and the tin woodman who related to her all that had taken place in the land of oz since dorothy had left it  she was much interested in the story of ozma who had been when a baby stolen by a wicked old witch and transformed into a boy  she did not know that she had ever been a girl until she was restored to her natural form by a kind sorceress then it was found that she was the only child of the former ruler of oz and was entitled to rule in his place  ozma had many adventures however before she regained her fathers throne and in these she was accompanied by a pumpkinheaded man a highly magnified and thoroughly educated wogglebug and a wonderful sawhorse that had been brought to life by means of a magic powder  the scarecrow and the tin woodman had also assisted her but the cowardly lion who ruled the great forest as the king of beasts knew nothing of ozma until after she became the reigning princess of oz  then he journeyed to the emerald city to see her and on hearing she was about to visit the land of ev to set free the royal family of that country the cowardly lion begged to go with her and brought along his friend the hungry tiger as well  having heard this story dorothy related to them her own adventures and then went out with her friends to find the sawhorse which ozma had caused to be shod with plates of gold so that its legs would not wear out  they came upon the sawhorse standing motionless beside the garden gate but when dorothy was introduced to him he bowed politely and blinked his eyes which were knots of wood and wagged his tail which was only the branch of a tree  what a remarkable thing to be alive exclaimed dorothy  i quite agree with you replied the sawhorse in a rough but not unpleasant voice  a creature like me has no business to live as we all know  but it was the magic powder that did it so i cannot justly be blamed  of course not said dorothy  and you seem to be of some use cause i noticed the scarecrow riding upon your back  oh yes im of use returned the sawhorse and i never tire never have to be fed or cared for in any way  are you intelgent asked the girl  not very said the creature  it would be foolish to waste intelligence on a common sawhorse when so many professors need it but i know enough to obey my masters and to giddup or whoa when im told to  so im pretty well satisfied  that night dorothy slept in a pleasant little bedchamber next to that occupied by ozma of oz and billina perched upon the foot of the bed and tucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly in that position as did dorothy upon her soft cushions  but before daybreak every one was awake and stirring and soon the adventurers were eating a hasty breakfast in the great diningroom of the palace  ozma sat at the head of a long table on a raised platform with dorothy on her right hand and the scarecrow on her left the scarecrow did not eat of course but ozma placed him near her so that she might ask his advice about the journey while she ate  lower down the table were the twentyseven warriors of oz and at the end of the room the lion and the tiger were eating out of a kettle that had been placed upon the floor while billina fluttered around to pick up any scraps that might be scattered  it did not take long to finish the meal and then the lion and the tiger were harnessed to the chariot and the party was ready to start for the nome kings palace  first rode ozma with dorothy beside her in the golden chariot and holding billina fast in her arms  then came the scarecrow on the sawhorse with the tin woodman and tiktok marching side by side just behind him  after these tramped the army looking brave and handsome in their splendid uniforms  the generals commanded the colonels and the colonels commanded the majors and the majors commanded the captains and the captains commanded the private who marched with an air of proud importance because it required so many officers to give him his orders  and so the magnificent procession left the palace and started along the road just as day was breaking and by the time the sun came out they had made good progress toward the valley that led to the nome kings domain     10  the giant with the hammer   the road led for a time through a pretty farm country and then past a picnic grove that was very inviting  but the procession continued to steadily advance until billina cried in an abrupt and commanding manner  waitwait  ozma stopped her chariot so suddenly that the scarecrows sawhorse nearly ran into it and the ranks of the army tumbled over one another before they could come to a halt  immediately the yellow hen struggled from dorothys arms and flew into a clump of bushes by the roadside  whats the matter called the tin woodman anxiously  why billina wants to lay her egg thats all said dorothy  lay her egg repeated the tin woodman in astonishment  yes she lays one every morning about this time and its quite fresh said the girl  but does your foolish old hen suppose that this entire cavalcade which is bound on an important adventure is going to stand still while she lays her egg enquired the tin woodman earnestly  what else can we do asked the girl  its a habit of billinas and she cant break herself of it  then she must hurry up said the tin woodman impatiently  no no exclaimed the scarecrow  if she hurries she may lay scrambled eggs  thats nonsense said dorothy  but billina wont be long im sure  so they stood and waited although all were restless and anxious to proceed  and by and by the yellow hen came from the bushes saying  kutkut kut kadawkutt  kut kut kutkadawkut  what is she doingsinging her lay asked the scarecrow  forwardmarch shouted the tin woodman waving his axe and the procession started just as dorothy had once more grabbed billina in her arms  isnt anyone going to get my egg cried the hen in great excitement  ill get it said the scarecrow and at his command the sawhorse pranced into the bushes  the straw man soon found the egg which he placed in his jacket pocket  the cavalcade having moved rapidly on was even then far in advance but it did not take the sawhorse long to catch up with it and presently the scarecrow was riding in his accustomed place behind ozmas chariot  what shall i do with the egg he asked dorothy  i do not know the girl answered  perhaps the hungry tiger would like it  it would not be enough to fill one of my back teeth remarked the tiger  a bushel of them hard boiled might take a little of the edge off my appetite but one egg isnt good for anything at all that i know of  no it wouldnt even make a sponge cake said the scarecrow thoughtfully  the tin woodman might carry it with his axe and hatch it but after all i may as well keep it myself for a souvenir  so he left it in his pocket  they had now reached that part of the valley that lay between the two high mountains which dorothy had seen from her tower window  at the far end was the third great mountain which blocked the valley and was the northern edge of the land of ev  it was underneath this mountain that the nome kings palace was said to be but it would be some time before they reached that place  the path was becoming rocky and difficult for the wheels of the chariot to pass over and presently a deep gulf appeared at their feet which was too wide for them to leap  so ozma took a small square of green cloth from her pocket and threw it upon the ground  at once it became the magic carpet and unrolled itself far enough for all the cavalcade to walk upon  the chariot now advanced and the green carpet unrolled before it crossing the gulf on a level with its banks so that all passed over in safety  thats easy enough said the scarecrow  i wonder what will happen next  he was not long in making the discovery for the sides of the mountain came closer together until finally there was but a narrow path between them along which ozma and her party were forced to pass in single file  they now heard a low and deep thumpthumpthump which echoed throughout the valley and seemed to grow louder as they advanced then turning a corner of rock they saw before them a huge form which towered above the path for more than a hundred feet  the form was that of a gigantic man built out of plates of cast iron and it stood with one foot on either side of the narrow road and swung over its right shoulder an immense iron mallet with which it constantly pounded the earth  these resounding blows explained the thumping sounds they had heard for the mallet was much bigger than a barrel and where it struck the path between the rocky sides of the mountain it filled all the space through which our travelers would be obliged to pass  of course they at once halted a safe distance away from the terrible iron mallet  the magic carpet would do them no good in this case for it was only meant to protect them from any dangers upon the ground beneath their feet and not from dangers that appeared in the air above them  wow said the cowardly lion with a shudder  it makes me dreadfully nervous to see that big hammer pounding so near my head  one blow would crush me into a doormat  the iron giant is a fine fellow said tiktok and works as steadily as a clock  he was made for the nome king by smith  tinker who made me and his duty is to keep folks from finding the underground palace  is he not a great work of art  can he think and speak as you do asked ozma regarding the giant with wondering eyes  no replied the machine he is only made to pound the road and has no thinking or speaking attachment  but he pounds very well i think  too well observed the scarecrow  he is keeping us from going farther  is there no way to stop his machinery  only the nome king who has the key can do that answered tiktok  then said dorothy anxiously what shall we do  excuse me for a few minutes said the scarecrow and i will think it over  he retired then to a position in the rear where he turned his painted face to the rocks and began to think  meantime the giant continued to raise his iron mallet high in the air and to strike the path terrific blows that echoed through the mountains like the roar of a cannon  each time the mallet lifted however there was a moment when the path beneath the monster was free and perhaps the scarecrow had noticed this for when he came back to the others he said  the matter is a very simple one after all  we have but to run under the hammer one at a time when it is lifted and pass to the other side before it falls again  it will require quick work if we escape the blow said the tin woodman with a shake of his head  but it really seems the only thing to be done  who will make the first attempt  they looked at one another hesitatingly for a moment  then the cowardly lion who was trembling like a leaf in the wind said to them  i suppose the head of the procession must go firstand thats me but im terribly afraid of the big hammer  what will become of me asked ozma  you might rush under the hammer yourself but the chariot would surely be crushed  we must leave the chariot said the scarecrow  but you two girls can ride upon the backs of the lion and the tiger  so this was decided upon and ozma as soon as the lion was unfastened from the chariot at once mounted the beasts back and said she was ready  cling fast to his mane advised dorothy  i used to ride him myself and thats the way i held on  so ozma clung fast to the mane and the lion crouched in the path and eyed the swinging mallet carefully until he knew just the instant it would begin to rise in the air  then before anyone thought he was ready he made a sudden leap straight between the iron giants legs and before the mallet struck the ground again the lion and ozma were safe on the other side  the tiger went next  dorothy sat upon his back and locked her arms around his striped neck for he had no mane to cling to  he made the leap straight and true as an arrow from a bow and ere dorothy realized it she was out of danger and standing by ozmas side  now came the scarecrow on the sawhorse and while they made the dash in safety they were within a hairs breadth of being caught by the descending hammer  tiktok walked up to the very edge of the spot the hammer struck and as it was raised for the next blow he calmly stepped forward and escaped its descent  that was an idea for the tin woodman to follow and he also crossed in safety while the great hammer was in the air  but when it came to the twentysix officers and the private their knees were so weak that they could not walk a step  in battle we are wonderfully courageous said one of the generals and our foes find us very terrible to face  but war is one thing and this is another  when it comes to being pounded upon the head by an iron hammer and smashed into pancakes we naturally object  make a run for it urged the scarecrow  our knees shake so that we cannot run answered a captain  if we should try it we would all certainly be pounded to a jelly  well well sighed the cowardly lion i see friend tiger that we must place ourselves in great danger to rescue this bold army  come with me and we will do the best we can  so ozma and dorothy having already dismounted from their backs the lion and the tiger leaped back again under the awful hammer and returned with two generals clinging to their necks  they repeated this daring passage twelve times when all the officers had been carried beneath the giants legs and landed safely on the further side  by that time the beasts were very tired and panted so hard that their tongues hung out of their great mouths  but what is to become of the private asked ozma  oh leave him there to guard the chariot said the lion  im tired out and wont pass under that mallet again  the officers at once protested that they must have the private with them else there would be no one for them to command  but neither the lion or the tiger would go after him and so the scarecrow sent the sawhorse  either the wooden horse was careless or it failed to properly time the descent of the hammer for the mighty weapon caught it squarely upon its head and thumped it against the ground so powerfully that the private flew off its back high into the air and landed upon one of the giants castiron arms  here he clung desperately while the arm rose and fell with each one of the rapid strokes  the scarecrow dashed in to rescue his sawhorse and had his left foot smashed by the hammer before he could pull the creature out of danger they then found that the sawhorse had been badly dazed by the blow for while the hard wooden knot of which his head was formed could not be crushed by the hammer both his ears were broken off and he would be unable to hear a sound until some new ones were made for him  also his left knee was cracked and had to be bound up with a string  billina having fluttered under the hammer it now remained only to rescue the private who was riding upon the iron giants arm high in the air  the scarecrow lay flat upon the ground and called to the man to jump down upon his body which was soft because it was stuffed with straw this the private managed to do waiting until a time when he was nearest the ground and then letting himself drop upon the scarecrow he accomplished the feat without breaking any bones and the scarecrow declared he was not injured in the least  therefore the tin woodman having by this time fitted new ears to the sawhorse the entire party proceeded upon its way leaving the giant to pound the path behind them     11  the nome king   by and by when they drew near to the mountain that blocked their path and which was the furthermost edge of the kingdom of ev the way grew dark and gloomy for the reason that the high peaks on either side shut out the sunshine  and it was very silent too as there were no birds to sing or squirrels to chatter the trees being left far behind them and only the bare rocks remaining  ozma and dorothy were a little awed by the silence and all the others were quiet and grave except the sawhorse which as it trotted along with the scarecrow upon his back hummed a queer song of which this was the chorus    would a wooden horse in a woodland go     aye aye  i sigh he would although   had he not had a wooden head     hed mount the mountain top instead   but no one paid any attention to this because they were now close to the nome kings dominions and his splendid underground palace could not be very far away  suddenly they heard a shout of jeering laughter and stopped short they would have to stop in a minute anyway for the huge mountain barred their further progress and the path ran close up to a wall of rock and ended  who was that laughing asked ozma  there was no reply but in the gloom they could see strange forms flit across the face of the rock  whatever the creations might be they seemed very like the rock itself for they were the color of rocks and their shapes were as rough and rugged as if they had been broken away from the side of the mountain  they kept close to the steep cliff facing our friends and glided up and down and this way and that with a lack of regularity that was quite confusing  and they seemed not to need places to rest their feet but clung to the surface of the rock as a fly does to a windowpane and were never still for a moment  do not mind them said tiktok as dorothy shrank back  they are only the nomes  and what are nomes asked the girl half frightened  they are rock fairies and serve the nome king replied the machine but they will do us no harm  you must call for the king because without him you can never find the entrance to the palace  you call said dorothy to ozma  just then the nomes laughed again and the sound was so weird and disheartening that the twentysix officers commanded the private to rightaboutface and they all started to run as fast as they could  the tin woodman at once pursued his army and cried halt and when they had stopped their flight he asked where are you going  ii find ive forgotten the brush for my whiskers said a general trembling with fear  ssso we are ggoing back after it  that is impossible replied the tin woodman  for the giant with the hammer would kill you all if you tried to pass him  oh id forgotten the giant said the general turning pale  you seem to forget a good many things remarked the tin woodman  i hope you wont forget that you are brave men  never cried the general slapping his goldembroidered chest  never cried all the other officers indignantly slapping their chests  for my part said the private meekly i must obey my officers so when i am told to run i run and when i am told to fight i fight  that is right agreed the tin woodman  and now you must all come back to ozma and obey her orders  and if you try to run away again i will have her reduce all the twentysix officers to privates and make the private your general  this terrible threat so frightened them that they at once returned to where ozma was standing beside the cowardly lion  then ozma cried out in a loud voice  i demand that the nome king appear to us  there was no reply except that the shifting nomes upon the mountain laughed in derision  you must not command the nome king said tiktok for you do not rule him as you do your own people  so ozma called again saying  i request the nome king to appear to us  only the mocking laughter replied to her and the shadowy nomes continued to flit here and there upon the rocky cliff  try entreaty said tiktok to ozma  if he will not come at your request then the nome king may listen to your pleading  ozma looked around her proudly  do you wish your ruler to plead with this wicked nome king she asked  shall ozma of oz humble herself to a creature who lives in an underground kingdom  no they all shouted with big voices and the scarecrow added  if he will not come we will dig him out of his hole like a fox and conquer his stubbornness  but our sweet little ruler must always maintain her dignity just as i maintain mine  im not afraid to plead with him said dorothy  im only a little girl from kansas and weve got more dignity at home than we know what to do with  ill call the nome king  do said the hungry tiger and if he makes hash of you ill willingly eat you for breakfast tomorrow morning  so dorothy stepped forward and said  please mr nome king come here and see us  the nomes started to laugh again but a low growl came from the mountain and in a flash they had all vanished from sight and were silent  then a door in the rock opened and a voice cried  enter  isnt it a trick asked the tin woodman  never mind replied ozma  we came here to rescue the poor queen of ev and her ten children and we must run some risks to do so  the nome king is honest and good natured said tiktok  you can trust him to do what is right  so ozma led the way hand in hand with dorothy and they passed through the arched doorway of rock and entered a long passage which was lighted by jewels set in the walls and having lamps behind them  there was no one to escort them or to show them the way but all the party pressed through the passage until they came to a round domed cavern that was grandly furnished  in the center of this room was a throne carved out of a solid boulder of rock rude and rugged in shape but glittering with great rubies and diamonds and emeralds on every part of its surface  and upon the throne sat the nome king  this important monarch of the underground world was a little fat man clothed in graybrown garments that were the exact color of the rock throne in which he was seated  his bushy hair and flowing beard were also colored like the rocks and so was his face  he wore no crown of any sort and his only ornament was a broad jewelstudded belt that encircled his fat little body  as for his features they seemed kindly and good humored and his eyes were turned merrily upon his visitors as ozma and dorothy stood before him with their followers ranged in close order behind them  why he looks just like santa clausonly he isnt the same color whispered dorothy to her friend but the nome king heard the speech and it made him laugh aloud    he had a red face and a round little belly     that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly   quoth the monarch in a pleasant voice and they could all see that he really did shake like jelly when he laughed  both ozma and dorothy were much relieved to find the nome king so jolly and a minute later he waved his right hand and the girls each found a cushioned stool at her side  sit down my dears said the king and tell me why you have come all this way to see me and what i can do to make you happy  while they seated themselves the nome king picked up a pipe and taking a glowing red coal out of his pocket he placed it in the bowl of the pipe and began puffing out clouds of smoke that curled in rings above his head  dorothy thought this made the little monarch look more like santa claus than ever but ozma now began speaking and every one listened intently to her words  your majesty said she i am the ruler of the land of oz and i have come here to ask you to release the good queen of ev and her ten children whom you have enchanted and hold as your prisoners  oh no you are mistaken about that replied the king  they are not my prisoners but my slaves whom i purchased from the king of ev  but that was wrong said ozma  according to the laws of ev the king can do no wrong answered the monarch eying a ring of smoke he had just blown from his mouth so that he had a perfect right to sell his family to me in exchange for a long life  you cheated him though declared dorothy for the king of ev did not have a long life  he jumped into the sea and was drowned  that was not my fault said the nome king crossing his legs and smiling contentedly  i gave him the long life all right but he destroyed it  then how could it be a long life asked dorothy  easily enough was the reply  now suppose my dear that i gave you a pretty doll in exchange for a lock of your hair and that after you had received the doll you smashed it into pieces and destroyed it could you say that i had not given you a pretty doll  no answered dorothy  and could you in fairness ask me to return to you the lock of hair just because you had smashed the doll  no said dorothy again  of course not the nome king returned  nor will i give up the queen and her children because the king of ev destroyed his long life by jumping into the sea  they belong to me and i shall keep them  but you are treating them cruelly said ozma who was much distressed by the kings refusal  in what way he asked  by making them your slaves said she  cruelty remarked the monarch puffing out wreathes of smoke and watching them float into the air is a thing i cant abide  so as slaves must work hard and the queen of ev and her children were delicate and tender i transformed them all into articles of ornament and bricabrac and scattered them around the various rooms of my palace  instead of being obliged to labor they merely decorate my apartments and i really think i have treated them with great kindness  but what a dreadful fate is theirs exclaimed ozma earnestly  and the kingdom of ev is in great need of its royal family to govern it if you will liberate them and restore them to their proper forms i will give you ten ornaments to replace each one you lose  the nome king looked grave  suppose i refuse he asked  then said ozma firmly i am here with my friends and my army to conquer your kingdom and oblige you to obey my wishes  the nome king laughed until he choked and he choked until he coughed and he coughed until his face turned from grayishbrown to bright red and then he wiped his eyes with a rockcolored handkerchief and grew grave again  you are as brave as you are pretty my dear he said to ozma  but you have little idea of the extent of the task you have undertaken come with me for a moment  he arose and took ozmas hand leading her to a little door at one side of the room  this he opened and they stepped out upon a balcony from whence they obtained a wonderful view of the underground world  a vast cave extended for miles and miles under the mountain and in every direction were furnaces and forges glowing brightly and nomes hammering upon precious metals or polishing gleaming jewels  all around the walls of the cave were thousands of doors of silver and gold built into the solid rock and these extended in rows far away into the distance as far as ozmas eyes could follow them  while the little maid from oz gazed wonderingly upon this scene the nome king uttered a shrill whistle and at once all the silver and gold doors flew open and solid ranks of nome soldiers marched out from every one  so great were their numbers that they quickly filled the immense underground cavern and forced the busy workmen to abandon their tasks  although this tremendous army consisted of rockcolored nomes all squat and fat they were clothed in glittering armor of polished steel inlaid with beautiful gems  upon his brow each wore a brilliant electric light and they bore sharp spears and swords and battleaxes of solid bronze  it was evident they were perfectly trained for they stood in straight rows rank after rank with their weapons held erect and true as if awaiting but the word of command to level them upon their foes  this said the nome king is but a small part of my army  no ruler upon earth has ever dared to fight me and no ruler ever will for i am too powerful to oppose  he whistled again and at once the martial array filed through the silver and gold doorways and disappeared after which the workmen again resumed their labors at the furnaces  then sad and discouraged ozma of oz turned to her friends and the nome king calmly reseated himself on his rock throne  it would be foolish for us to fight the girl said to the tin woodman  for our brave twentyseven would be quickly destroyed  im sure i do not know how to act in this emergency  ask the king where his kitchen is suggested the tiger  im hungry as a bear  i might pounce upon the king and tear him in pieces remarked the cowardly lion  try it said the monarch lighting his pipe with another hot coal which he took from his pocket  the lion crouched low and tried to spring upon the nome king but he hopped only a little way into the air and came down again in the same place not being able to approach the throne by even an inch  it seems to me said the scarecrow thoughtfully that our best plan is to wheedle his majesty into giving up his slaves since he is too great a magician to oppose  this is the most sensible thing any of you have suggested declared the nome king  it is folly to threaten me but im so kindhearted that i cannot stand coaxing or wheedling  if you really wish to accomplish anything by your journey my dear ozma you must coax me  very well said ozma more cheerfully  let us be friends and talk this over in a friendly manner  to be sure agreed the king his eyes twinkling merrily  i am very anxious she continued to liberate the queen of ev and her children who are now ornaments and bricabrac in your majestys palace and to restore them to their people  tell me sir how this may be accomplished  the king remained thoughtful for a moment after which he asked  are you willing to take a few chances and risks yourself in order to set free the people of ev  yes indeed answered ozma eagerly  then said the nome king i will make you this offer you shall go alone and unattended into my palace and examine carefully all that the rooms contain  then you shall have permission to touch eleven different objects pronouncing at the time the word ev and if any one of them or more than one proves to be the transformation of the queen of ev or any of her ten children then they will instantly be restored to their true forms and may leave my palace and my kingdom in your company without any objection whatever  it is possible for you in this way to free the entire eleven but if you do not guess all the objects correctly and some of the slaves remain transformed then each one of your friends and followers may in turn enter the palace and have the same privileges i grant you  oh thank you thank you for this kind offer said ozma eagerly  i make but one condition added the nome king his eyes twinkling  what is it she enquired  if none of the eleven objects you touch proves to be the transformation of any of the royal family of ev then instead of freeing them you will yourself become enchanted and transformed into an article of bricabrac or an ornament  this is only fair and just and is the risk you declared you were willing to take     12  the eleven guesses   hearing this condition imposed by the nome king ozma became silent and thoughtful and all her friends looked at her uneasily  dont you do it exclaimed dorothy  if you guess wrong you will be enslaved yourself  but i shall have eleven guesses answered ozma  surely i ought to guess one object in eleven correctly and if i do i shall rescue one of the royal family and be safe myself  then the rest of you may attempt it and soon we shall free all those who are enslaved  what if we fail enquired the scarecrow  id look nice as a piece of bricabrac wouldnt i  we must not fail cried ozma courageously  having come all this distance to free these poor people it would be weak and cowardly in us to abandon the adventure  therefore i will accept the nome kings offer and go at once into the royal palace  come along then my dear said the king climbing down from his throne with some difficulty because he was so fat ill show you the way  he approached a wall of the cave and waved his hand  instantly an opening appeared through which ozma after a smiling farewell to her friends boldly passed  she found herself in a splendid hall that was more beautiful and grand than anything she had ever beheld  the ceilings were composed of great arches that rose far above her head and all the walls and floors were of polished marble exquisitely tinted in many colors  thick velvet carpets were on the floor and heavy silken draperies covered the arches leading to the various rooms of the palace  the furniture was made of rare old woods richly carved and covered with delicate satins and the entire palace was lighted by a mysterious rosy glow that seemed to come from no particular place but flooded each apartment with its soft and pleasing radiance  ozma passed from one room to another greatly delighted by all she saw the lovely palace had no other occupant for the nome king had left her at the entrance which closed behind her and in all the magnificent rooms there appeared to be no other person  upon the mantels and on many shelves and brackets and tables were clustered ornaments of every description seemingly made out of all sorts of metals glass china stones and marbles  there were vases and figures of men and animals and graven platters and bowls and mosaics of precious gems and many other things  pictures too were on the walls and the underground palace was quite a museum of rare and curious and costly objects  after her first hasty examination of the rooms ozma began to wonder which of all the numerous ornaments they contained were the transformations of the royal family of ev  there was nothing to guide her for everything seemed without a spark of life  so she must guess blindly and for the first time the girl came to realize how dangerous was her task and how likely she was to lose her own freedom in striving to free others from the bondage of the nome king  no wonder the cunning monarch laughed good naturedly with his visitors when he knew how easily they might be entrapped  but ozma having undertaken the venture would not abandon it  she looked at a silver candelabra that had ten branches and thought this may be the queen of ev and her ten children so she touched it and uttered aloud the word ev as the nome king had instructed her to do when she guessed  but the candelabra remained as it was before  then she wandered into another room and touched a china lamb thinking it might be one of the children she sought  but again she was unsuccessful  three guesses four guesses five six seven eight nine and ten she made and still not one of them was right  the girl shivered a little and grew pale even under the rosy light for now but one guess remained and her own fate depended upon the result  she resolved not to be hasty and strolled through all the rooms once more gazing earnestly upon the various ornaments and trying to decide which she would touch  finally in despair she decided to leave it entirely to chance  she faced the doorway of a room shut her eyes tightly and then thrusting aside the heavy draperies she advanced blindly with her right arm outstretched before her  slowly softly she crept forward until her hand came in contact with an object upon a small round table  she did not know what it was but in a low voice she pronounced the word ev  the rooms were quite empty of life after that  the nome king had gained a new ornament  for upon the edge of the table rested a pretty grasshopper that seemed to have been formed from a single emerald  it was all that remained of ozma of oz  in the throne room just beyond the palace the nome king suddenly looked up and smiled  next he said in his pleasant voice  dorothy the scarecrow and the tin woodman who had been sitting in anxious silence each gave a start of dismay and stared into one anothers eyes  has she failed asked tiktok  so it seems answered the little monarch cheerfully  but that is no reason one of you should not succeed  the next may have twelve guesses instead of eleven for there are now twelve persons transformed into ornaments  well well  which of you goes next  ill go said dorothy  not so replied the tin woodman  as commander of ozmas army it is my privilege to follow her and attempt her rescue  away you go then said the scarecrow  but be careful old friend  i will promised the tin woodman and then he followed the nome king to the entrance to the palace and the rock closed behind him     13  the nome king laughs   in a moment the king returned to his throne and relighted his pipe and the rest of the little band of adventurers settled themselves for another long wait  they were greatly disheartened by the failure of their girl ruler and the knowledge that she was now an ornament in the nome kings palacea dreadful creepy place in spite of all its magnificence  without their little leader they did not know what to do next and each one down to the trembling private of the army began to fear he would soon be more ornamental than useful  suddenly the nome king began laughing  ha ha ha  he he he  ho ho ho  whats happened asked the scarecrow  why your friend the tin woodman has become the funniest thing you can imagine replied the king wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes  no one would ever believe he could make such an amusing ornament  next  they gazed at each other with sinking hearts  one of the generals began to weep dolefully  what are you crying for asked the scarecrow indignant at such a display of weakness  he owed me six weeks back pay said the general and i hate to lose him  then you shall go and find him declared the scarecrow  me cried the general greatly alarmed  certainly  it is your duty to follow your commander  march  i wont said the general  id like to of course but i just simply wont  the scarecrow looked enquiringly at the nome king  never mind said the jolly monarch  if he doesnt care to enter the palace and make his guesses ill throw him into one of my fiery furnaces  ill goof course im going yelled the general as quick as scat where is the entrancewhere is it  let me go at once  so the nome king escorted him into the palace and again returned to await the result  what the general did no one can tell but it was not long before the king called for the next victim and a colonel was forced to try his fortune  thus one after another all of the twentysix officers filed into the palace and made their guessesand became ornaments  meantime the king ordered refreshments to be served to those waiting and at his command a rudely shaped nome entered bearing a tray  this nome was not unlike the others that dorothy had seen but he wore a heavy gold chain around his neck to show that he was the chief steward of the nome king and he assumed an air of much importance and even told his majesty not to eat too much cake late at night or he would be ill  dorothy however was hungry and she was not afraid of being ill so she ate several cakes and found them good and also she drank a cup of excellent coffee made of a richly flavored clay browned in the furnaces and then ground fine and found it most refreshing and not at all muddy  of all the party which had started upon this adventure the little kansas girl was now left alone with the scarecrow tiktok and the private for counsellors and companions  of course the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger were still there but they having also eaten some of the cakes had gone to sleep at one side of the cave while upon the other side stood the sawhorse motionless and silent as became a mere thing of wood  billina had quietly walked around and picked up the crumbs of cake which had been scattered and now as it was long after bedtime she tried to find some dark place in which to go to sleep  presently the hen espied a hollow underneath the kings rocky throne and crept into it unnoticed  she could still hear the chattering of those around her but it was almost dark underneath the throne so that soon she had fallen fast asleep  next called the king and the private whose turn it was to enter the fatal palace shook hands with dorothy and the scarecrow and bade them a sorrowful goodbye and passed through the rocky portal  they waited a long time for the private was in no hurry to become an ornament and made his guesses very slowly  the nome king who seemed to know by some magical power all that took place in his beautiful rooms of his palace grew impatient finally and declared he would sit up no longer  i love ornaments said he but i can wait until tomorrow to get more of them so as soon as that stupid private is transformed we will all go to bed and leave the job to be finished in the morning  is it so very late asked dorothy  why it is after midnight said the king and that strikes me as being late enough  there is neither night nor day in my kingdom because it is under the earths surface where the sun does not shine but we have to sleep just the same as the upstairs people do and for my part im going to bed in a few minutes  indeed it was not long after this that the private made his last guess  of course he guessed wrongly and of course he at once became an ornament  so the king was greatly pleased and clapped his hands to summon his chief steward  show these guests to some of the sleeping apartments he commanded and be quick about it too for im dreadfully sleepy myself  youve no business to sit up so late replied the steward gruffly youll be as cross as a griffin tomorrow morning  his majesty made no answer to this remark and the chief steward led dorothy through another doorway into a long hall from which several plain but comfortable sleeping rooms opened  the little girl was given the first room and the scarecrow and tiktok the nextalthough they never sleptand the lion and the tiger the third  the sawhorse hobbled after the steward into a fourth room to stand stiffly in the center of it until morning  each night was rather a bore to the scarecrow tiktok and the sawhorse but they had learned from experience to pass the time patiently and quietly since all their friends who were made of flesh had to sleep and did not like to be disturbed  when the chief steward had left them alone the scarecrow remarked sadly  i am in great sorrow over the loss of my old comrade the tin woodman we have had many dangerous adventures together and escaped them all and now it grieves me to know he has become an ornament and is lost to me forever  he was always an ornament to society said tiktok  true but now the nome king laughs at him and calls him the funniest ornament in all the palace  it will hurt my poor friends pride to be laughed at continued the scarecrow sadly  we will make rather absurd ornaments ourselves tomorrow observed the machine in his monotonous voice  just then dorothy ran into their room in a state of great anxiety crying  wheres billina  have you seen billina  is she here  no answered the scarecrow  then what has become of her asked the girl  why i thought she was with you said the scarecrow  yet i do not remember seeing the yellow hen since she picked up the crumbs of cake  we must have left her in the room where the kings throne is decided dorothy and at once she turned and ran down the hall to the door through which they had entered  but it was fast closed and locked on the other side and the heavy slab of rock proved to be so thick that no sound could pass through it  so dorothy was forced to return to her chamber  the cowardly lion stuck his head into her room to try to console the girl for the loss of her feathered friend  the yellow hen is well able to take care of herself said he so dont worry about her but try to get all the sleep you can  it has been a long and weary day and you need rest  ill probly get lots of rest tomorrow when i become an ornment said dorothy sleepily  but she lay down upon her couch nevertheless and in spite of all her worries was soon in the land of dreams     14  dorothy tries to be brave   meantime the chief steward had returned to the throne room where he said to the king  you are a fool to waste so much time upon these people  what cried his majesty in so enraged a voice that it awoke billina who was asleep under his throne  how dare you call me a fool  because i like to speak the truth said the steward  why didnt you enchant them all at once instead of allowing them to go one by one into the palace and guess which ornaments are the queen of ev and her children  why you stupid rascal it is more fun this way returned the king and it serves to keep me amused for a long time  but suppose some of them happen to guess aright persisted the steward then you would lose your old ornaments and these new ones too  there is no chance of their guessing aright replied the monarch with a laugh  how could they know that the queen of ev and her family are all ornaments of a royal purple color  but there are no other purple ornaments in the palace said the steward  there are many other colors however and the purple ones are scattered throughout the rooms and are of many different shapes and sizes  take my word for it steward they will never think of choosing the purple ornaments  billina squatting under the throne had listened carefully to all this talk and now chuckled softly to herself as she heard the king disclose his secret  still you are acting foolishly by running the chance continued the steward roughly and it is still more foolish of you to transform all those people from oz into green ornaments  i did that because they came from the emerald city replied the king and i had no green ornaments in my collection until now  i think they will look quite pretty mixed with the others  dont you  the steward gave an angry grunt  have your own way since you are the king he growled  but if you come to grief through your carelessness remember that i told you so if i wore the magic belt which enables you to work all your transformations and gives you so much other power i am sure i would make a much wiser and better king than you are  oh cease your tiresome chatter commanded the king getting angry again  because you are my chief steward you have an idea you can scold me as much as you please  but the very next time you become impudent i will send you to work in the furnaces and get another nome to fill your place  now follow me to my chamber for i am going to bed  and see that i am wakened early tomorrow morning  i want to enjoy the fun of transforming the rest of these people into ornaments  what color will you make the kansas girl asked the steward  gray i think said his majesty  and the scarecrow and the machine man  oh they shall be of solid gold because they are so ugly in real life  then the voices died away and billina knew that the king and his steward had left the room  she fixed up some of her tail feathers that were not straight and then tucked her head under her wing again and went to sleep  in the morning dorothy and the lion and tiger were given their breakfast in their rooms and afterward joined the king in his throne room  the tiger complained bitterly that he was half starved and begged to go into the palace and become an ornament so that he would no longer suffer the pangs of hunger  havent you had your breakfast asked the nome king  oh i had just a bite replied the beast  but what good is a bite to a hungry tiger  he ate seventeen bowls of porridge a platter full of fried sausages eleven loaves of bread and twentyone mince pies said the steward  what more do you want demanded the king  a fat baby  i want a fat baby said the hungry tiger  a nice plump juicy tender fat baby  but of course if i had one my conscience would not allow me to eat it  so ill have to be an ornament and forget my hunger  impossible exclaimed the king  ill have no clumsy beasts enter my palace to overturn and break all my pretty nicknacks  when the rest of your friends are transformed you can return to the upper world and go about your business  as for that we have no business when our friends are gone said the lion  so we do not care much what becomes of us  dorothy begged to be allowed to go first into the palace but tiktok firmly maintained that the slave should face danger before the mistress  the scarecrow agreed with him in that so the nome king opened the door for the machine man who tramped into the palace to meet his fate  then his majesty returned to his throne and puffed his pipe so contentedly that a small cloud of smoke formed above his head  bye and bye he said  im sorry there are so few of you left  very soon now my fun will be over and then for amusement i shall have nothing to do but admire my new ornaments  it seems to me said dorothy that you are not so honest as you pretend to be  hows that asked the king  why you made us think it would be easy to guess what ornaments the people of ev were changed into  it is easy declared the monarch if one is a good guesser  but it appears that the members of your party are all poor guessers  what is tiktok doing now asked the girl uneasily  nothing replied the king with a frown  he is standing perfectly still in the middle of a room  oh i expect hes run down said dorothy  i forgot to wind him up this morning  how many guesses has he made  all that he is allowed except one answered the king  suppose you go in and wind him up and then you can stay there and make your own guesses  all right said dorothy  it is my turn next declared the scarecrow  why you dont want to go away and leave me all alone do you asked the girl  besides if i go now i can wind up tiktok so that he can make his last guess  very well then said the scarecrow with a sigh  run along little dorothy and may good luck go with you  so dorothy trying to be brave in spite of her fears passed through the doorway into the gorgeous rooms of the palace  the stillness of the place awed her at first and the child drew short breaths and pressed her hand to her heart and looked all around with wondering eyes  yes it was a beautiful place but enchantments lurked in every nook and corner and she had not yet grown accustomed to the wizardries of these fairy countries so different from the quiet and sensible commonplaces of her own native land  slowly she passed through several rooms until she came upon tiktok standing motionless  it really seemed then that she had found a friend in this mysterious palace so she hastened to wind up the machine mans action and speech and thoughts  thank you dorothy were his first words  i have now one more guess to make  oh be very careful tiktok wont you cried the girl  yes  but the nome king has us in his power and he has set a trap for us  i fear we are all lost he answered  i fear so too said dorothy sadly  if smith  tinker had given me a guessing clockwork attachment continued tiktok i might have defied the nome king  but my thoughts are plain and simple and are not of much use in this case  do the best you can said dorothy encouragingly and if you fail i will watch and see what shape you are changed into  so tiktok touched a yellow glass vase that had daisies painted on one side and he spoke at the same time the word ev  in a flash the machine man had disappeared and although the girl looked quickly in every direction she could not tell which of the many ornaments the room contained had a moment before been her faithful friend and servant  so all she could do was to accept the hopeless task set her and make her guesses and abide by the result  it cant hurt very much she thought for i havent heard any of them scream or cry outnot even the poor officers  dear me  i wonder if uncle henry or aunt em will ever know i have become an ornment in the nome kings palace and must stand forever and ever in one place and look prettycept when im moved to be dusted  it isnt the way i thought id turn out at all but i spose it cant be helped  she walked through all the rooms once more and examined with care all the objects they contained but there were so many they bewildered her and she decided after all as ozma had done that it could be only guess work at the best and that the chances were much against her guessing aright  timidly she touched an alabaster bowl and said ev  thats one failure anyhow she thought  but how am i to know which thing is enchanted and which is not  next she touched the image of a purple kitten that stood on the corner of a mantel and as she pronounced the word ev the kitten disappeared and a pretty fairhaired boy stood beside her  at the same time a bell rang somewhere in the distance and as dorothy started back partly in surprise and partly in joy the little one exclaimed  where am i  and who are you  and what has happened to me  well i declare said dorothy  ive really done it  done what asked the boy  saved myself from being an ornament replied the girl with a laugh and saved you from being forever a purple kitten  a purple kitten he repeated  there is no such thing  i know she answered  but there was a minute ago  dont you remember standing on a corner of the mantel  of course not  i am a prince of ev and my name is evring the little one announced proudly  but my father the king sold my mother and all her children to the cruel ruler of the nomes and after that i remember nothing at all  a purple kitten cant be spected to remember evring said dorothy but now you are yourself again and im going to try to save some of your brothers and sisters and perhaps your mother as well  so come with me  she seized the childs hand and eagerly hurried here and there trying to decide which object to choose next  the third guess was another failure and so was the fourth and the fifth  little evring could not imagine what she was doing but he trotted along beside her very willingly for he liked the new companion he had found  dorothys further quest proved unsuccessful but after her first disappointment was over the little girl was filled with joy and thankfulness to think that after all she had been able to save one member of the royal family of ev and could restore the little prince to his sorrowing country  now she might return to the terrible nome king in safety carrying with her the prize she had won in the person of the fairhaired boy  so she retraced her steps until she found the entrance to the palace and as she approached the massive doors of rock opened of their own accord allowing both dorothy and evring to pass the portals and enter the throne room     15  billina frightens the nome king   now when dorothy had entered the palace to make her guesses and the scarecrow was left with the nome king the two sat in moody silence for several minutes  then the monarch exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction  very good  who is very good asked the scarecrow  the machine man  he wont need to be wound up any more for he has now become a very neat ornament  very neat indeed  how about dorothy the scarecrow enquired  oh she will begin to guess pretty soon said the king cheerfully and then she will join my collection and it will be your turn  the good scarecrow was much distressed by the thought that his little friend was about to suffer the fate of ozma and the rest of their party but while he sat in gloomy reverie a shrill voice suddenly cried  kut kut kutkadawkutt  kut kut kutkadawkutt  the nome king nearly jumped off his seat he was so startled  good gracious  whats that he yelled  why its billina said the scarecrow  what do you mean by making a noise like that shouted the king angrily as the yellow hen came from under the throne and strutted proudly about the room  ive got a right to cackle i guess replied billina  ive just laid my egg  what  laid an egg  in my throne room  how dare you do such a thing asked the king in a voice of fury  i lay eggs wherever i happen to be said the hen ruffling her feathers and then shaking them into place  butthunderation  dont you know that eggs are poison roared the king while his rockcolored eyes stuck out in great terror  poison well i declare said billina indignantly  ill have you know all my eggs are warranted strictly fresh and up to date  poison indeed  you dont understand retorted the little monarch nervously  eggs belong only to the outside worldto the world on the earths surface where you came from  here in my underground kingdom they are rank poison as i said and we nomes cant bear them around  well youll have to bear this one around declared billina for ive laid it  where asked the king  under your throne said the hen  the king jumped three feet into the air so anxious was he to get away from the throne  take it away  take it away at once he shouted  i cant said billina  i havent any hands  ill take the egg said the scarecrow  im making a collection of billinas eggs  theres one in my pocket now that she laid yesterday  hearing this the monarch hastened to put a good distance between himself and the scarecrow who was about to reach under the throne for the egg when the hen suddenly cried  stop  whats wrong asked the scarecrow  dont take the egg unless the king will allow me to enter the palace and guess as the others have done said billina  pshaw returned the king  youre only a hen  how could you guess my enchantments  i can try i suppose said billina  and if i fail you will have another ornament  a pretty ornament youd make wouldnt you growled the king  but you shall have your way  it will properly punish you for daring to lay an egg in my presence  after the scarecrow is enchanted you shall follow him into the palace  but how will you touch the objects  with my claws said the hen and i can speak the word ev as plainly as anyone  also i must have the right to guess the enchantments of my friends and to release them if i succeed  very well said the king  you have my promise  then said billina to the scarecrow you may get the egg  he knelt down and reached underneath the throne and found the egg which he placed in another pocket of his jacket fearing that if both eggs were in one pocket they would knock together and get broken  just then a bell above the throne rang briskly and the king gave another nervous jump  well well said he with a rueful face the girl has actually done it  done what asked the scarecrow  she has made one guess that is right and broken one of my neatest enchantments  by ricketty its too bad  i never thought she would do it  do i understand that she will now return to us in safety enquired the scarecrow joyfully wrinkling his painted face into a broad smile  of course said the king fretfully pacing up and down the room  i always keep my promises no matter how foolish they are  but i shall make an ornament of the yellow hen to replace the one i have just lost  perhaps you will and perhaps you wont murmured billina calmly i may surprise you by guessing right  guessing right snapped the king  how could you guess right where your betters have failed you stupid fowl  billina did not care to answer this question and a moment later the doors flew open and dorothy entered leading the little prince evring by the hand  the scarecrow welcomed the girl with a close embrace and he would have embraced evring too in his delight  but the little prince was shy and shrank away from the painted scarecrow because he did not yet know his many excellent qualities  but there was little time for the friends to talk because the scarecrow must now enter the palace  dorothys success had greatly encouraged him and they both hoped he would manage to make at least one correct guess  however he proved as unfortunate as the others except dorothy and although he took a good deal of time to select his objects not one did the poor scarecrow guess aright  so he became a solid gold cardreceiver and the beautiful but terrible palace awaited its next visitor  its all over remarked the king with a sigh of satisfaction and it has been a very amusing performance except for the one good guess the kansas girl made  i am richer by a great many pretty ornaments  it is my turn now said billina briskly  oh id forgotten you said the king  but you neednt go if you dont wish to  i will be generous and let you off  no you wont replied the hen  i insist upon having my guesses as you promised  then go ahead you absurd feathered fool grumbled the king and he caused the opening that led to the palace to appear once more  dont go billina said dorothy earnestly  it isnt easy to guess those ornments and only luck saved me from being one myself  stay with me and well go back to the land of ev together  im sure this little prince will give us a home  indeed i will said evring with much dignity  dont worry my dear cried billina with a cluck that was meant for a laugh  i may not be human but im no fool if i am a chicken  oh billina said dorothy you havent been a chicken in a long time  not since youyouve beengrown up  perhaps thats true answered billina thoughtfully  but if a kansas farmer sold me to some one what would he call mea hen or a chicken  you are not a kansas farmer billina replied the girl and you said  never mind that dorothy  im going  i wont say goodbye because im coming back  keep up your courage for ill see you a little later  then billina gave several loud cluckclucks that seemed to make the fat little king more nervous than ever and marched through the entrance into the enchanted palace  i hope ive seen the last of that bird declared the monarch seating himself again in his throne and mopping the perspiration from his forehead with his rockcolored handkerchief  hens are bothersome enough at their best but when they can talk theyre simply dreadful  billinas my friend said dorothy quietly  she may not always be zactly polite but she means well im sure     16  purple green and gold   the yellow hen stepping high and with an air of vast importance walked slowly over the rich velvet carpets of the splendid palace examining everything she met with her sharp little eyes  billina had a right to feel important for she alone shared the nome kings secret and knew how to tell the objects that were transformations from those that had never been alive  she was very sure that her guesses would be correct but before she began to make them she was curious to behold all the magnificence of this underground palace which was perhaps one of the most splendid and beautiful places in any fairyland  as she went through the rooms she counted the purple ornaments and although some were small and hidden in queer places billina spied them all and found the entire ten scattered about the various rooms  the green ornaments she did not bother to count for she thought she could find them all when the time came  finally having made a survey of the entire palace and enjoyed its splendor the yellow hen returned to one of the rooms where she had noticed a large purple footstool  she placed a claw upon this and said ev and at once the footstool vanished and a lovely lady tall and slender and most beautifully robed stood before her  the ladys eyes were round with astonishment for a moment for she could not remember her transformation nor imagine what had restored her to life  good morning maam said billina in her sharp voice  youre looking quite well considering your age  who speaks demanded the queen of ev drawing herself up proudly  why my names bill by rights answered the hen who was now perched upon the back of a chair although dorothy has put scollops on it and made it billina  but the name doesnt matter  ive saved you from the nome king and you are a slave no longer  then i thank you for the gracious favor said the queen with a graceful courtesy  but my childrentell me i beg of youwhere are my children and she clasped her hands in anxious entreaty  dont worry advised billina pecking at a tiny bug that was crawling over the chair back  just at present they are out of mischief and perfectly safe for they cant even wiggle  what mean you o kindly stranger asked the queen striving to repress her anxiety  theyre enchanted said billina just as you have beenall that is except the little fellow dorothy picked out  and the chances are that they have been good boys and girls for some time because they couldnt help it  oh my poor darlings cried the queen with a sob of anguish  not at all returned the hen  dont let their condition make you unhappy maam because ill soon have them crowding round to bother and worry you as naturally as ever  come with me if you please and ill show you how pretty they look  she flew down from her perch and walked into the next room the queen following  as she passed a low table a small green grasshopper caught her eye and instantly billina pounced upon it and snapped it up in her sharp bill  for grasshoppers are a favorite food with hens and they usually must be caught quickly before they can hop away  it might easily have been the end of ozma of oz had she been a real grasshopper instead of an emerald one  but billina found the grasshopper hard and lifeless and suspecting it was not good to eat she quickly dropped it instead of letting it slide down her throat  i might have known better she muttered to herself for where there is no grass there can be no live grasshoppers  this is probably one of the kings transformations  a moment later she approached one of the purple ornaments and while the queen watched her curiously the hen broke the nome kings enchantment and a sweetfaced girl whose golden hair fell in a cloud over her shoulders stood beside them  evanna cried the queen my own evanna and she clasped the girl to her bosom and covered her face with kisses  thats all right said billina contentedly  am i a good guesser mr nome king  well i guess  then she disenchanted another girl whom the queen addressed as evrose and afterwards a boy named evardo who was older than his brother evring  indeed the yellow hen kept the good queen exclaiming and embracing for some time until five princesses and four princes all looking very much alike except for the difference in size stood in a row beside their happy mother  the princesses were named evanna evrose evella evirene and evedna while the princes were evrob evington evardo and evroland  of these evardo was the eldest and would inherit his fathers throne and be crowned king of ev when he returned to his own country  he was a grave and quiet youth and would doubtless rule his people wisely and with justice  billina having restored all of the royal family of ev to their proper forms now began to select the green ornaments which were the transformations of the people of oz  she had little trouble in finding these and before long all the twentysix officers as well as the private were gathered around the yellow hen joyfully congratulating her upon their release  the thirtyseven people who were now alive in the rooms of the palace knew very well that they owed their freedom to the cleverness of the yellow hen and they were earnest in thanking her for saving them from the magic of the nome king  now said billina i must find ozma  she is sure to be here somewhere and of course she is green being from oz  so look around you stupid soldiers and help me in my search  for a while however they could discover nothing more that was green but the queen who had kissed all her nine children once more and could now find time to take an interest in what was going on said to the hen  mayhap my gentle friend it is the grasshopper whom you seek  of course its the grasshopper exclaimed billina  i declare im nearly as stupid as these brave soldiers  wait here for me and ill go back and get it  so she went into the room where she had seen the grasshopper and presently ozma of oz as lovely and dainty as ever entered and approached the queen of ev greeting her as one high born princess greets another  but where are my friends the scarecrow and the tin woodman asked the girl ruler when these courtesies had been exchanged  ill hunt them up replied billina  the scarecrow is solid gold and so is tiktok but i dont exactly know what the tin woodman is because the nome king said he had been transformed into something funny  ozma eagerly assisted the hen in her quest and soon the scarecrow and the machine man being ornaments of shining gold were discovered and restored to their accustomed forms  but search as they might in no place could they find a funny ornament that might be the transformation of the tin woodman  only one thing can be done said ozma at last and that is to return to the nome king and oblige him to tell us what has become of our friend  perhaps he wont suggested billina  he must returned ozma firmly  the king has not treated us honestly for under the mask of fairness and good nature he entrapped us all and we would have been forever enchanted had not our wise and clever friend the yellow hen found a way to save us  the king is a villain declared the scarecrow  his laugh is worse than another mans frown said the private with a shudder  i thought he was honest but i was mistaken remarked tiktok  my thoughts are usually correct but it is smith  tinkers fault if they sometimes go wrong or do not work properly  smith  tinker made a very good job of you said ozma kindly  i do not think they should be blamed if you are not quite perfect  thank you replied tiktok  then said billina in her brisk little voice let us all go back to the nome king and see what he has to say for himself  so they started for the entrance ozma going first with the queen and her train of little princes and princesses following  then came tiktok and the scarecrow with billina perched upon his strawstuffed shoulder  the twentyseven officers and the private brought up the rear  as they reached the hall the doors flew open before them but then they all stopped and stared into the domed cavern with faces of astonishment and dismay  for the room was filled with the mailclad warriors of the nome king rank after rank standing in orderly array  the electric lights upon their brows gleamed brightly their battleaxes were poised as if to strike down their foes yet they remained motionless as statues awaiting the word of command  and in the center of this terrible army sat the little king upon his throne of rock  but he neither smiled nor laughed  instead his face was distorted with rage and most dreadful to behold     17  the scarecrow wins the fight   after billina had entered the palace dorothy and evring sat down to await the success or failure of her mission and the nome king occupied his throne and smoked his long pipe for a while in a cheerful and contented mood  then the bell above the throne which sounded whenever an enchantment was broken began to ring and the king gave a start of annoyance and exclaimed rockettyricketts  when the bell rang a second time the king shouted angrily smudge and blazes and at a third ring he screamed in a fury hippikaloric which must be a dreadful word because we dont know what it means  after that the bell went on ringing time after time but the king was now so violently enraged that he could not utter a word but hopped out of his throne and all around the room in a mad frenzy so that he reminded dorothy of a jumpingjack  the girl was for her part filled with joy at every peal of the bell for it announced the fact that billina had transformed one more ornament into a living person  dorothy was also amazed at billinas success for she could not imagine how the yellow hen was able to guess correctly from all the bewildering number of articles clustered in the rooms of the palace  but after she had counted ten and the bell continued to ring she knew that not only the royal family of ev but ozma and her followers also were being restored to their natural forms and she was so delighted that the antics of the angry king only made her laugh merrily  perhaps the little monarch could not be more furious than he was before but the girls laughter nearly drove him frantic and he roared at her like a savage beast  then as he found that all his enchantments were likely to be dispelled and his victims every one set free he suddenly ran to the little door that opened upon the balcony and gave the shrill whistle that summoned his warriors  at once the army filed out of the gold and silver doors in great numbers and marched up a winding stairs and into the throne room led by a stern featured nome who was their captain  when they had nearly filled the throne room they formed ranks in the big underground cavern below and then stood still until they were told what to do next  dorothy had pressed back to one side of the cavern when the warriors entered and now she stood holding little prince evrings hand while the great lion crouched upon one side and the enormous tiger crouched on the other side  seize that girl shouted the king to his captain and a group of warriors sprang forward to obey  but both the lion and tiger snarled so fiercely and bared their strong sharp teeth so threateningly that the men drew back in alarm  dont mind them cried the nome king they cannot leap beyond the places where they now stand  but they can bite those who attempt to touch the girl said the captain  ill fix that answered the king  ill enchant them again so that they cant open their jaws  he stepped out of the throne to do this but just then the sawhorse ran up behind him and gave the fat monarch a powerful kick with both his wooden hind legs  ow  murder  treason yelled the king who had been hurled against several of his warriors and was considerably bruised  who did that  i did growled the sawhorse viciously  you let dorothy alone or ill kick you again  well see about that replied the king and at once he waved his hand toward the sawhorse and muttered a magical word  aha he continued now let us see you move you wooden mule  but in spite of the magic the sawhorse moved and he moved so quickly toward the king that the fat little man could not get out of his way thumpbang came the wooden heels right against his round body and the king flew into the air and fell upon the head of his captain who let him drop flat upon the ground  well well said the king sitting up and looking surprised  why didnt my magic belt work i wonder  the creature is made of wood replied the captain  your magic will not work on wood you know  ah id forgotten that said the king getting up and limping to his throne  very well let the girl alone  she cant escape us anyway  the warriors who had been rather confused by these incidents now formed their ranks again and the sawhorse pranced across the room to dorothy and took a position beside the hungry tiger  at that moment the doors that led to the palace flew open and the people of ev and the people of oz were disclosed to view  they paused astonished at sight of the warriors and the angry nome king seated in their midst  surrender cried the king in a loud voice  you are my prisoners  go long answered billina from the scarecrows shoulder  you promised me that if i guessed correctly my friends and i might depart in safety  and you always keep your promises  i said you might leave the palace in safety retorted the king and so you may but you cannot leave my dominions  you are my prisoners and i will hurl you all into my underground dungeons where the volcanic fires glow and the molten lava flows in every direction and the air is hotter than blue blazes  that will be the end of me all right said the scarecrow sorrowfully  one small blaze blue or green is enough to reduce me to an ashheap  do you surrender demanded the king  billina whispered something in the scarecrows ear that made him smile and put his hands in his jacket pockets  no returned ozma boldly answering the king  then she said to her army  forward my brave soldiers and fight for your ruler and yourselves unto death  pardon me most royal ozma replied one of her generals but i find that i and my brother officers all suffer from heart disease and the slightest excitement might kill us  if we fight we may get excited would it not be well for us to avoid this grave danger  soldiers should not have heart disease said ozma  private soldiers are not i believe afflicted that way declared another general twirling his moustache thoughtfully  if your royal highness desires we will order our private to attack yonder warriors  do so replied ozma  forwardmarch cried all the generals with one voice forwardmarch yelled the colonels  forwardmarch shouted the majors  forwardmarch commanded the captains  and at that the private leveled his spear and dashed furiously upon the foe  the captain of the nomes was so surprised by this sudden onslaught that he forgot to command his warriors to fight so that the ten men in the first row who stood in front of the privates spear fell over like so many toy soldiers  the spear could not go through their steel armor however so the warriors scrambled to their feet again and by that time the private had knocked over another row of them  then the captain brought down his battleaxe with such a strong blow that the privates spear was shattered and knocked from his grasp and he was helpless to fight any longer  the nome king had left his throne and pressed through his warriors to the front ranks so he could see what was going on but as he faced ozma and her friends the scarecrow as if aroused to action by the valor of the private drew one of billinas eggs from his right jacket pocket and hurled it straight at the little monarchs head  it struck him squarely in his left eye where the egg smashed and scattered as eggs will and covered his face and hair and beard with its sticky contents  help help screamed the king clawing with his fingers at the egg in a struggle to remove it  an egg an egg  run for your lives shouted the captain of the nomes in a voice of horror  and how they did run  the warriors fairly tumbled over one another in their efforts to escape the fatal poison of that awful egg and those who could not rush down the winding stair fell off the balcony into the great cavern beneath knocking over those who stood below them  even while the king was still yelling for help his throne room became emptied of every one of his warriors and before the monarch had managed to clear the egg away from his left eye the scarecrow threw the second egg against his right eye where it smashed and blinded him entirely  the king was unable to flee because he could not see which way to run so he stood still and howled and shouted and screamed in abject fear  while this was going on billina flew over to dorothy and perching herself upon the lions back the hen whispered eagerly to the girl  get his belt  get the nome kings jeweled belt  it unbuckles in the back  quick dorothyquick     18  the fate of the tin woodman   dorothy obeyed  she ran at once behind the nome king who was still trying to free his eyes from the egg and in a twinkling she had unbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with her to her place beside the tiger and lion where because she did not know what else to do with it she fastened it around her own slim waist  just then the chief steward rushed in with a sponge and a bowl of water and began mopping away the broken eggs from his masters face in a few minutes and while all the party stood looking on the king regained the use of his eyes and the first thing he did was to glare wickedly upon the scarecrow and exclaim  ill make you suffer for this you haystuffed dummy  dont you know eggs are poison to nomes  really said the scarecrow they dont seem to agree with you although i wonder why  they were strictly fresh and above suspicion said billina  you ought to be glad to get them  ill transform you all into scorpions cried the king angrily and began waving his arms and muttering magic words  but none of the people became scorpions so the king stopped and looked at them in surprise  whats wrong he asked  why you are not wearing your magic belt replied the chief steward after looking the king over carefully  where is it  what have you done with it  the nome king clapped his hand to his waist and his rock colored face turned white as chalk  its gone he cried helplessly  its gone and i am ruined  dorothy now stepped forward and said  royal ozma and you queen of ev i welcome you and your people back to the land of the living  billina has saved you from your troubles and now we will leave this dreaful place and return to ev as soon as possble  while the child spoke they could all see that she wore the magic belt and a great cheer went up from all her friends which was led by the voices of the scarecrow and the private  but the nome king did not join them  he crept back onto his throne like a whipped dog and lay there bitterly bemoaning his defeat  but we have not yet found my faithful follower the tin woodman said ozma to dorothy and without him i do not wish to go away  nor i replied dorothy quickly  wasnt he in the palace  he must be there said billina but i had no clue to guide me in guessing the tin woodman so i must have missed him  we will go back into the rooms said dorothy  this magic belt i am sure will help us to find our dear old friend  so she reentered the palace the doors of which still stood open and everyone followed her except the nome king the queen of ev and prince evring  the mother had taken the little prince in her lap and was fondling and kissing him lovingly for he was her youngest born  but the others went with dorothy and when she came to the middle of the first room the girl waved her hand as she had seen the king do and commanded the tin woodman whatever form he might then have to resume his proper shape  no result followed this attempt so dorothy went into another room and repeated it and so through all the rooms of the palace  yet the tin woodman did not appear to them nor could they imagine which among the thousands of ornaments was their transformed friend  sadly they returned to the throne room where the king seeing that they had met with failure jeered at dorothy saying  you do not know how to use my belt so it is of no use to you  give it back to me and i will let you go freeyou and all the people who came with you  as for the royal family of ev they are my slaves and shall remain here  i shall keep the belt said dorothy  but how can you escape without my consent  asked the king  easily enough answered the girl  all we need to do is to walk out the way that we came in  oh thats all is it sneered the king  well where is the passage through which you entered this room  they all looked around but could not discover the place for it had long since been closed  dorothy however would not be dismayed  she waved her hand toward the seemingly solid wall of the cavern and said  i command the passage to open  instantly the order was obeyed the opening appeared and the passage lay plainly before them  the king was amazed and all the others overjoyed  why then if the belt obeys you were we unable to discover the tin woodman asked ozma  i cant imagine said dorothy  see here girl proposed the king eagerly give me the belt and i will tell you what shape the tin woodman was changed into and then you can easily find him  dorothy hesitated but billina cried out  dont you do it  if the nome king gets the belt again he will make every one of us prisoners for we will be in his power  only by keeping the belt dorothy will you ever be able to leave this place in safety  i think that is true said the scarecrow  but i have another idea due to my excellent brains  let dorothy transform the king into a gooseegg unless he agrees to go into the palace and bring out to us the ornament which is our friend nick chopper the tin woodman  a gooseegg echoed the horrified king  how dreadful  well a gooseegg you will be unless you go and fetch us the ornament we want declared billina with a joyful chuckle  you can see for yourself that dorothy is able to use the magic belt all right added the scarecrow  the nome king thought it over and finally consented for he did not want to be a gooseegg  so he went into the palace to get the ornament which was the transformation of the tin woodman and they all awaited his return with considerable impatience for they were anxious to leave this underground cavern and see the sunshine once more  but when the nome king came back he brought nothing with him except a puzzled and anxious expression upon his face  hes gone he said  the tin woodman is nowhere in the palace  are you sure asked ozma sternly  im very sure answered the king trembling for i know just what i transformed him into and exactly where he stood  but he is not there and please dont change me into a gooseegg because ive done the best i could  they were all silent for a time and then dorothy said  there is no use punishing the nome king any more and im fraid well have to go away without our friend  if he is not here we cannot rescue him agreed the scarecrow sadly poor nick  i wonder what has become of him  and he owed me six weeks back pay said one of the generals wiping the tears from his eyes with his goldlaced coat sleeve  very sorrowfully they determined to return to the upper world without their former companion and so ozma gave the order to begin the march through the passage  the army went first and then the royal family of ev and afterward came dorothy ozma billina the scarecrow and tiktok  they left the nome king scowling at them from his throne and had no thought of danger until ozma chanced to look back and saw a large number of the warriors following them in full chase with their swords and spears and axes raised to strike down the fugitives as soon as they drew near enough  evidently the nome king had made this last attempt to prevent their escaping him but it did him no good for when dorothy saw the danger they were in she stopped and waved her hand and whispered a command to the magic belt  instantly the foremost warriors became eggs which rolled upon the floor of the cavern in such numbers that those behind could not advance without stepping upon them  but when they saw the eggs all desire to advance departed from the warriors and they turned and fled madly into the cavern and refused to go back again  our friends had no further trouble in reaching the end of the passage and soon were standing in the outer air upon the gloomy path between the two high mountains  but the way to ev lay plainly before them and they fervently hoped that they had seen the last of the nome king and of his dreadful palace  the cavalcade was led by ozma mounted on the cowardly lion and the queen of ev who rode upon the back of the tiger  the children of the queen walked behind her hand in hand  dorothy rode the sawhorse while the scarecrow walked and commanded the army in the absence of the tin woodman  presently the way began to lighten and more of the sunshine to come in between the two mountains  and before long they heard the thump thump thump of the giants hammer upon the road  how may we pass the monstrous man of iron asked the queen anxious for the safety of her children  but dorothy solved the problem by a word to the magic belt  the giant paused with his hammer held motionless in the air thus allowing the entire party to pass between his castiron legs in safety     19  the king of ev   if there were any shifting rockcolored nomes on the mountain side now they were silent and respectful for our adventurers were not annoyed as before by their impudent laughter  really the nomes had nothing to laugh at since the defeat of their king  on the other side they found ozmas golden chariot standing as they had left it  soon the lion and the tiger were harnessed to the beautiful chariot in which was enough room for ozma and the queen and six of the royal children  little evring preferred to ride with dorothy upon the sawhorse which had a long back  the prince had recovered from his shyness and had become very fond of the girl who had rescued him so they were fast friends and chatted pleasantly together as they rode along  billina was also perched upon the head of the wooden steed which seemed not to mind the added weight in the least and the boy was full of wonder that a hen could talk and say such sensible things  when they came to the gulf ozmas magic carpet carried them all over in safety and now they began to pass the trees in which birds were singing and the breeze that was wafted to them from the farms of ev was spicy with flowers and newmown hay and the sunshine fell full upon them to warm them and drive away from their bodies the chill and dampness of the underground kingdom of the nomes  i would be quite content said the scarecrow to tiktok were only the tin woodman with us  but it breaks my heart to leave him behind  he was a fine fellow replied tiktok although his material was not very durable  oh tin is an excellent material the scarecrow hastened to say and if anything ever happened to poor nick chopper he was always easily soldered  besides he did not have to be wound up and was not liable to get out of order  i sometimes wish said tiktok that i was stuffed with straw as you are  it is hard to be made of copper  i have no reason to complain of my lot replied the scarecrow  a little fresh straw now and then makes me as good as new  but i can never be the polished gentleman that my poor departed friend the tin woodman was  you may be sure the royal children of ev and their queen mother were delighted at seeing again their beloved country and when the towers of the palace of ev came into view they could not forbear cheering at the sight  little evring riding in front of dorothy was so overjoyed that he took a curious tin whistle from his pocket and blew a shrill blast that made the sawhorse leap and prance in sudden alarm  what is that asked billina who had been obliged to flutter her wings in order to keep her seat upon the head of the frightened sawhorse  thats my whistle said prince evring holding it out upon his hand  it was in the shape of a little fat pig made of tin and painted green the whistle was in the tail of the pig  where did you get it asked the yellow hen closely examining the toy with her bright eyes  why i picked it up in the nome kings palace while dorothy was making her guesses and i put it in my pocket answered the little prince  billina laughed or at least she made the peculiar cackle that served her for a laugh  no wonder i couldnt find the tin woodman she said and no wonder the magic belt didnt make him appear or the king couldnt find him either  what do you mean questioned dorothy  why the prince had him in his pocket cried billina cackling again  i did not protested little evring  i only took the whistle  well then watch me returned the hen and reaching out a claw she touched the whistle and said ev  swish  good afternoon said the tin woodman taking off his funnel cap and bowing to dorothy and the prince  i think i must have been asleep for the first time since i was made of tin for i do not remember our leaving the nome king  you have been enchanted answered the girl throwing an arm around her old friend and hugging him tight in her joy  but its all right now  i want my whistle said the little prince beginning to cry  hush cautioned billina  the whistle is lost but you may have another when you get home  the scarecrow had fairly thrown himself upon the bosom of his old comrade so surprised and delighted was he to see him again and tiktok squeezed the tin woodmans hand so earnestly that he dented some of his fingers  then they had to make way for ozma to welcome the tin man and the army caught sight of him and set up a cheer and everybody was delighted and happy  for the tin woodman was a great favorite with all who knew him and his sudden recovery after they had thought he was lost to them forever was indeed a pleasant surprise  before long the cavalcade arrived at the royal palace where a great crowd of people had gathered to welcome their queen and her ten children  there was much shouting and cheering and the people threw flowers in their path and every face wore a happy smile  they found the princess langwidere in her mirrored chamber where she was admiring one of her handsomest headsone with rich chestnut hair dreamy walnut eyes and a shapely hickorynut nose  she was very glad to be relieved of her duties to the people of ev and the queen graciously permitted her to retain her rooms and her cabinet of heads as long as she lived  then the queen took her eldest son out upon a balcony that overlooked the crowd of subjects gathered below and said to them  here is your future ruler king evardo fifteenth  he is fifteen years of age has fifteen silver buckles on his jacket and is the fifteenth evardo to rule the land of ev  the people shouted their approval fifteen times and even the wheelers some of whom were present loudly promised to obey the new king  so the queen placed a big crown of gold set with rubies upon evardos head and threw an ermine robe over his shoulders and proclaimed him king and he bowed gratefully to all his subjects and then went away to see if he could find any cake in the royal pantry  ozma of oz and her people as well as dorothy tiktok and billina were splendidly entertained by the queen mother who owed all her happiness to their kind offices and that evening the yellow hen was publicly presented with a beautiful necklace of pearls and sapphires as a token of esteem from the new king     20  the emerald city   dorothy decided to accept ozmas invitation to return with her to the land of oz  there was no greater chance of her getting home from ev than from oz and the little girl was anxious to see once more the country where she had encountered such wonderful adventures  by this time uncle henry would have reached australia in his ship and had probably given her up for lost so he couldnt worry any more than he did if she stayed away from him a while longer  so she would go to oz  they bade goodbye to the people of ev and the king promised ozma that he would ever be grateful to her and render the land of oz any service that might lie within his power  and then they approached the edge of the dangerous desert and ozma threw down the magic carpet which at once unrolled far enough for all of them to walk upon it without being crowded  tiktok claiming to be dorothys faithful follower because he belonged to her had been permitted to join the party and before they started the girl wound up his machinery as far as possible and the copper man stepped off as briskly as any one of them  ozma also invited billina to visit the land of oz and the yellow hen was glad enough to go where new sights and scenes awaited her  they began the trip across the desert early in the morning and as they stopped only long enough for billina to lay her daily egg before sunset they espied the green slopes and wooded hills of the beautiful land of oz  they entered it in the munchkin territory and the king of the munchkins met them at the border and welcomed ozma with great respect being very pleased by her safe return  for ozma of oz ruled the king of the munchkins the king of the winkies the king of the quadlings and the king of the gillikins just as those kings ruled their own people and this supreme ruler of the land of oz lived in a great town of her own called the emerald city which was in the exact center of the four kingdoms of the land of oz  the munchkin king entertained them at his palace that night and in the morning they set out for the emerald city travelling over a road of yellow brick that led straight to the jewelstudded gates  everywhere the people turned out to greet their beloved ozma and to hail joyfully the scarecrow the tin woodman and the cowardly lion who were popular favorites  dorothy too remembered some of the people who had befriended her on the occasion of her first visit to oz and they were well pleased to see the little kansas girl again and showered her with compliments and good wishes  at one place where they stopped to refresh themselves ozma accepted a bowl of milk from the hands of a pretty dairymaid  then she looked at the girl more closely and exclaimed  why its jinjurisnt it  yes your highness was the reply as jinjur dropped a low curtsy and dorothy looked wonderingly at this lively appearing person who had once assembled an army of women and driven the scarecrow from the throne of the emerald city and even fought a battle with the powerful army of glinda the sorceress  ive married a man who owns nine cows said jinjur to ozma and now i am happy and contented and willing to lead a quiet life and mind my own business  where is your husband asked ozma  he is in the house nursing a black eye replied jinjur calmly the foolish man would insist upon milking the red cow when i wanted him to milk the white one but he will know better next time i am sure  then the party moved on again and after crossing a broad river on a ferry and passing many fine farm houses that were dome shaped and painted a pretty green color they came in sight of a large building that was covered with flags and bunting  i dont remember that building said dorothy  what is it  that is the college of art and athletic perfection replied ozma  i had it built quite recently and the wogglebug is its president  it keeps him busy and the young men who attend the college are no worse off than they were before  you see in this country are a number of youths who do not like to work and the college is an excellent place for them  and now they came in sight of the emerald city and the people flocked out to greet their lovely ruler  there were several bands and many officers and officials of the realm and a crowd of citizens in their holiday attire  thus the beautiful ozma was escorted by a brilliant procession to her royal city and so great was the cheering that she was obliged to constantly bow to the right and left to acknowledge the greetings of her subjects  that evening there was a grand reception in the royal palace attended by the most important persons of oz and jack pumpkinhead who was a little overripe but still active read an address congratulating ozma of oz upon the success of her generous mission to rescue the royal family of a neighboring kingdom  then magnificent gold medals set with precious stones were presented to each of the twentysix officers and the tin woodman was given a new axe studded with diamonds and the scarecrow received a silver jar of complexion powder  dorothy was presented with a pretty coronet and made a princess of oz and tiktok received two bracelets set with eight rows of very clear and sparkling emeralds  afterward they sat down to a splendid feast and ozma put dorothy at her right and billina at her left where the hen sat upon a golden roost and ate from a jeweled platter  then were placed the scarecrow the tin woodman and tiktok with baskets of lovely flowers before them because they did not require food  the twentysix officers were at the lower end of the table and the lion and the tiger also had seats and were served on golden platters that held a half a bushel at one time  the wealthiest and most important citizens of the emerald city were proud to wait upon these famous adventurers and they were assisted by a sprightly little maid named jellia jamb whom the scarecrow pinched upon her rosy cheeks and seemed to know very well  during the feast ozma grew thoughtful and suddenly she asked  where is the private  oh he is sweeping out the barracks replied one of the generals who was busy eating a leg of a turkey  but i have ordered him a dish of bread and molasses to eat when his work is done  let him be sent for said the girl ruler  while they waited for this command to be obeyed she enquired  have we any other privates in the armies  oh yes replied the tin woodman i believe there are three altogether  the private now entered saluting his officers and the royal ozma very respectfully  what is your name my man asked the girl  omby amby answered the private  then omby amby said she i promote you to be captain general of all the armies of my kingdom and especially to be commander of my body guard at the royal palace  it is very expensive to hold so many offices said the private hesitating  i have no money with which to buy uniforms  you shall be supplied from the royal treasury said ozma  then the private was given a seat at the table where the other officers welcomed him cordially and the feasting and merriment were resumed  suddenly jellia jamb exclaimed  there is nothing more to eat  the hungry tiger has consumed everything  but that is not the worst of it declared the tiger mournfully somewhere or somehow ive actually lost my appetite     21  dorothys magic belt   dorothy passed several very happy weeks in the land of oz as the guest of the royal ozma who delighted to please and interest the little kansas girl  many new acquaintances were formed and many old ones renewed and wherever she went dorothy found herself among friends  one day however as she sat in ozmas private room she noticed hanging upon the wall a picture which constantly changed in appearance at one time showing a meadow and at another time a forest a lake or a village  how curious she exclaimed after watching the shifting scenes for a few moments  yes said ozma that is really a wonderful invention in magic  if i wish to see any part of the world or any person living i need only express the wish and it is shown in the picture  may i use it asked dorothy eagerly  of course my dear  then id like to see the old kansas farm and aunt em said the girl  instantly the well remembered farmhouse appeared in the picture and aunt em could be seen quite plainly  she was engaged in washing dishes by the kitchen window and seemed quite well and contented  the hired men and the teams were in the harvest fields behind the house and the corn and wheat seemed to the child to be in prime condition  on the side porch dorothys pet dog toto was lying fast asleep in the sun and to her surprise old speckles was running around with a brood of twelve new chickens trailing after her  everything seems all right at home said dorothy with a sigh of relief  now i wonder what uncle henry is doing  the scene in the picture at once shifted to australia where in a pleasant room in sydney uncle henry was seated in an easy chair solemnly smoking his briar pipe  he looked sad and lonely and his hair was now quite white and his hands and face thin and wasted  oh cried dorothy in an anxious voice im sure uncle henry isnt getting any better and its because he is worried about me  ozma dear i must go to him at once  how can you asked ozma  i dont know replied dorothy but let us go to glinda the good im sure she will help me and advise me how to get to uncle henry  ozma readily agreed to this plan and caused the sawhorse to be harnessed to a pretty green and pink phaeton and the two girls rode away to visit the famous sorceress  glinda received them graciously and listened to dorothys story with attention  i have the magic belt you know said the little girl  if i buckled it around my waist and commanded it to take me to uncle henry wouldnt it do it  i think so replied glinda with a smile  and then continued dorothy if i ever wanted to come back here again the belt would bring me  in that you are wrong said the sorceress  the belt has magical powers only while it is in some fairy country such as the land of oz or the land of ev  indeed my little friend were you to wear it and wish yourself in australia with your uncle the wish would doubtless be fulfilled because it was made in fairyland  but you would not find the magic belt around you when you arrived at your destination  what would become of it asked the girl  it would be lost as were your silver shoes when you visited oz before and no one would ever see it again  it seems too bad to destroy the use of the magic belt in that way doesnt it  then said dorothy after a moments thought i will give the magic belt to ozma for she can use it in her own country  and she can wish me transported to uncle henry without losing the belt  that is a wise plan replied glinda  so they rode back to the emerald city and on the way it was arranged that every saturday morning ozma would look at dorothy in her magic picture wherever the little girl might chance to be  and if she saw dorothy make a certain signal then ozma would know that the little kansas girl wanted to revisit the land of oz and by means of the nome kings magic belt would wish that she might instantly return  this having been agreed upon dorothy bade goodbye to all her friends tiktok wanted to go to australia too but dorothy knew that the machine man would never do for a servant in a civilized country and the chances were that his machinery wouldnt work at all  so she left him in ozmas care  billina on the contrary preferred the land of oz to any other country and refused to accompany dorothy  the bugs and ants that i find here are the finest flavored in the world declared the yellow hen and there are plenty of them  so here i shall end my days and i must say dorothy my dear that you are very foolish to go back into that stupid humdrum world again  uncle henry needs me said dorothy simply and every one except billina thought it was right that she should go  all dorothys friends of the land of ozboth old and newgathered in a group in front of the palace to bid her a sorrowful goodbye and to wish her long life and happiness  after much hand shaking dorothy kissed ozma once more and then handed her the nome kings magic belt saying  now dear princess when i wave my handkerchief please wish me with uncle henry  im awfly sorry to leave youand the scarecrowand the tin woodmanand the cowardly lionand tiktokandand everybodybut i do want my uncle henry  so goodbye all of you  then the little girl stood on one of the big emeralds which decorated the courtyard and after looking once again at each of her friends waved her handkerchief   no said dorothy i wasnt drowned at all  and ive come to nurse you and take care of you uncle henry and you must promise to get well as soon as possble  uncle henry smiled and cuddled his little niece close in his lap  im better already my darling said he
