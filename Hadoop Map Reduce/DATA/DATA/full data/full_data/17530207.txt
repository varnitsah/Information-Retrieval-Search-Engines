17530207	zane grey    the desert  of  wheat  1919      chapter i  late in june the vast northwestern desert of wheat began to take on a tinge of gold lending an austere beauty to that endless rolling smooth world of treeless hills where miles of fallow ground and miles of waving grain sloped up to the farseparated homes of the heroic men who had conquered over sage and sand  these simple homes of farmers seemed lost on an immensity of soft gray and golden billows of land insignificant dots here and there on distant hills so far apart that nature only seemed accountable for those broad squares of alternate gold and brown extending on and on to the waving horizonline a lonely hard heroic country where flowers and fruit were not nor birds and brooks nor green pastures whirling strings of dust looped up over fallow ground the short dry wheat lay back from the wind the haze in the distance was drab and smoky heavy with substance  a thousand hills lay bare to the sky and half of every hill was wheat and half was fallow ground and all of them with the shallow valleys between seemed big and strange and isolated the beauty of them was austere as if the hand of man had been held back from making green his home site as if the immensity of the task had left no time for youth and freshness years long years were there in the roundhilled manyfurrowed gray old earth and the wheat looked a century old here and there a straight dusty road stretched from hill to hill becoming a thin white line to disappear in the distance the sun shone hot the wind blew hard and over the boundless undulating expanse hovered a shadow that was neither hood of dust nor hue of gold it was not physical but lonely waiting prophetic and weird no wild desert of wastelands once the home of other races of man and now gone to decay and death could have shown so barren an acreage half of this wandering patchwork of squares was earth brown and gray curried and disked and rolled and combed and harrowed with not a tiny leaf of green in all the miles the other half had only a faint golden promise of mellow harvest and at long distance it seemed to shimmer and retreat under the hot sun a singularly beautiful effect of harmony lay in the long slowly rising slopes in the rounded hills in the endless curving lines on all sides the scene was heroic because of the labor of horny hands it was sublime because not a hundred harvests nor three generations of toiling men could ever rob nature of its limitless space and scorching sun and sweeping dust of its resistless agelong creep back toward the desert that it had been                                       here was grown the most bounteous the richest and finest wheat in all the world strange and unfathomable that so much of the bread of man the staff of life the hope of civilization in this tragic year 1917 should come from a vast treeless waterless dreary desert  this wonderful place was an immense valley of considerable altitude called the columbia basin surrounded by the cascade mountains on the west the coeur dalene and bitter root mountains on the east the okanozan range to the north and the blue mountains to the south the valley floor was basalt from the lava flow of volcanoes in ages past the rainfall was slight except in the foothills of the mountains the columbia river making a prodigious and meandering curve bordered on three sides what was known as the bend country south of this vast area across the range began the fertile manywatered region that extended on down into verdant oregon among the desert hills of this bend country near the center of the basin where the best wheat was raised lay widely separated little towns the names of which gave evidence of the mixed population it was of course an exceedingly prosperous country a fact manifest in the substantial little towns if not in the crude and unpretentious homes of the farmers the acreage of farms ran from a section six hundred and forty acres up into the thousands                                       upon a morning in early july exactly three months after the united states had declared war upon germany a sturdy young farmer strode with darkly troubled face from the presence of his father at the end of a stormy scene he had promised his father that he would abandon his desire to enlist in the army  kurt dorn walked away from the gray old clapboard house out to the fence where he leaned on the gate he could see for miles in every direction and to the southward away on a long yellow slope rose a stream of dust from a motorcar  must be andersoncoming to dun father muttered young dorn  this was the day he remembered when the wealthy rancher of ruxton was to look over old chris dorns wheatfields dorn owed thirtythousand dollars and interest for years mostly to anderson kurt hated the debt and resented the visit but he could not help acknowledging that the rancher had been lenient and kind long since kurt had sorrowfully realized that his father was illiterate hard grasping and growing worse with the burden of years  if we had rain nowor soonthat section of bluestem would square father soliloquized young dorn as with keen eyes he surveyed a vast field of wheat short smooth yellowing in the sun but the cloudless sky the haze of heat rather betokened a continued drought  there were reasons indeed for dorn to wear a dark and troubled face as he watched the motorcar speed along ahead of its stream of dust pass out of sight under the hill and soon reappear to turn off the main road and come toward the house it was a big closed car covered with dust the driver stopped it at the gate and got out  is this chris dorns farm he asked  yes replied kurt  whereupon the door of the car opened and out stepped a short broad man in a long linen coat  come out lenore an shake off the dust he said and he assisted a young woman to step out she also wore a long linen coat and a veil besides the man removed his coat and threw it into the car then he took off his sombrero to beat the dust off of that  phew the golden valley never seen dust like this in a million years im chokin for water an listen to the car shes boilin  then as he stepped toward kurt the rancher showed himself to be a wellpreserved man of perhaps fiftyfive of powerful form beginning to sag in the broad shoulders his face bronzed by long exposure to wind and sun he had keen gray eyes and their look was that of a man used to dealing with his kind and well disposed toward them  hello are you young dorn he asked  yes sir replied kurt stepping out  im anderson from ruxton come to see your dad this is my girl lenore  kurt acknowledged the slight bow from the veiled young woman and then hesitating he added wont you come in  no not yet im chokin for air an water bring us a drink replied anderson  kurt hurried away to get a bucket and tin cup as he drew water from the well he was thinking rather vaguely that it was somehow embarrassingthe fact of mr anderson being accompanied by his daughter kurt was afraid of his father but then what did it matter when he returned to the yard he found the rancher sitting in the shade of one of the few appletrees and the young lady was standing near in the act of removing bonnet and veil she had thrown the linen coat over the seat of an old wagonbed that lay near  good water is scarce here but im glad we have some said kurt then as he set down the bucket and offered a brimming cupful to the girl he saw her face and his eyes met hers he dropped the cup and stared then hurriedly with flushing face he bent over to recover and refill it  exexcuse me imclumsy he managed to say and as he handed the cup to her he averted his gaze for more than a year the memory of this very girl had haunted him he had seen her twicethe first time at the close of his one year of college at the university of california and the second time on the street in spokane in a glance he had recognized the strong lithe figure the sunny hair the rare golden tint of her complexion the blue eyes warm and direct and he had sustained a shock which momentarily confused him  good water hey dissented anderson after drinking a second cup boy thats wet but it aint water to drink come down in the foothills an ill show you my ranch s called many waters an you cant keep your feet dry  i wish we had some of it here replied kurt wistfully and he waved a hand at the broad swelling slopes the warm breath that blew in from the wheatlands felt dry and smelled dry  youre in for a dry spell inquired anderson with interest that was keen and kindly as well  father says so and i fear it toofor he never makes a mistake in weather or crops  a hot dry spell this summer hum boy do you know that wheat is the most important thing in the world today  you mean on account of the war replied kurt yes i know but father doesnt see that all he sees isif we have rain well have bumper crops that big field there would be a recordat war prices and he wouldnt be ruined  ruined oh he means id close on him hum say what do you see in a big wheat yieldif it rains  mr anderson id like to see our debt paid but im thinking most of wheat for starving peoples iive studied this wheat question its the biggest question in this war  kurt had forgotten the girl and was unaware of her eyes bent steadily upon him anderson had roused to the interest of wheat and to a deeper study of the young man  say dorn how old are you he asked  twentyfour and kurts my first name was the reply  will this farm fall to you  yes if my father does not lose it  hum old dorn wont lose it never fear he raises the best wheat in this section  but father never owned the land we have had three bad years if the wheat fails this summerwe lose the land thats all  are you anamerican queried anderson slowly as if treading on dangerous ground  i am snapped kurt my mother was american shes dead father is german hes old hes rabid since the president declared war hell never change  thats hell what re you goin to do if your country calls you  go replied kurt with flashing eyes i wanted to enlist father and i quarreled over that until i had to give in hes hardhes impossible ill wait for the draft and hope im called  boy its that spirit germanys roused an the best i can say is god help her have you a brother  no im all father has  well it makes a tough place for him an you too humor him hes old an when youre calledgo an fight youll come back  if i only knew thatit wouldnt be so hard  hard it sure is hard but itll be the makin of a great country itll weed out the riffraff see here kurt im goin to give you a hunch have you had any dealins with the iww  yes last harvest we had trouble but nothing serious when i was in spokane last month i heard a good deal strangers have approached us here toomostly aliens i have no use for them but they always get fathers ear and now to tell the truth im worried  boy you need to be replied anderson earnestly were all worried im goin to let you read over the laws of that iww organization youre to keep mum now mind you i belong to the chamber of commerce in spokane somebody got hold of these bylaws of this socalled labor union weve had copies made an every honest farmer in the northwest is goin to read them but carryin one around is dangerous i reckon these days here  anderson hesitated a moment peered cautiously around and then slipping folded sheets of paper from his inside coat pocket he evidently made ready to hand them to kurt  lenore wheres the driver he asked  hes under the car replied the girl  kurt thrilled at the soft sound of her voice it was something to have been haunted by a girls face for a year and then suddenly hear her voice  hes new to methat driveran i aint trustin any new men these days went on anderson here now dorn read that an if you dont get redheaded  without finishing his last muttered remark he opened the sheets of manuscript and spread them out to the young man  curiously and with a little rush of excitement kurt began to read the very first rule of the iww aimed to abolish capital kurt read on with slowly growing amaze consternation and anger when he had finished his look without speech was a question anderson hastened to answer  its straight goods he declared thems the sureenough rules of that gang we made certain before we acted now how do they strike you  why thats no labor union replied kurt hotly theyre outlaws thieves blackmailers pirates ii dont know what  dorn were up against a bad outfit an the northwest will see hell this summer theres trouble in montana and idaho strangers are driftin into washington from all over we must organize to meet themto prevent them gettin a hold out here its a labor union mostly aliens with dishonest an unscrupulous leaders some of them americans they aim to take advantage of the war situation in the newspapers they rave about shorter hours more pay acknowledgment of the union but any fool would see if he read them laws i showed you that this iww is not straight  mr anderson what steps have you taken down in your country queried kurt  so far all ive done was to hire my hands for a year give them high wages an caution them when strangers come round to feed them an be civil an send them on  but we cant do that up here in the bend said dorn seriously we need say a hundred thousand men in harvesttime and not ten thousand all the rest of the year  sure you cant but youll have to organize somethin up here in this desert you could have a heap of trouble if that outfit got here strong enough youd better tell every farmer you can trust about this iww  ive only one american neighbor and he lives six miles from here replied dorn olsen over there is a swede and not a naturalized citizen but i believe hes for the us and theres  dad interrupted the girl i believe our driver is listening to your very uninteresting conversation  she spoke demurely with laughter in her low voice it made dorn dare to look at her and he met a blue blaze that was instantly averted  anderson growled evidently some very hard names under his breath his look just then was full of characteristic western spirit then he got up  lenore i reckon your talk ll be more interesting than mine he said dryly ill go see dorn an get this business over  id rather go with you hurriedly replied kurt and then as though realizing a seeming discourtesy in his words his face flamed and he stammered ii dont mean that but father is in bad mood we just quarreledi told youabout the war andmr andersonimim a little afraid hell  well son im not afraid interrupted the rancher ill beard the old lion in his den you talk to lenore  please dont speak of the war said kurt appealingly  not a word unless he starts roarin at uncle sam declared anderson with a twinkle in his eyes and turned toward the house  hell roar all right said kurt almost with a groan he knew what an ordeal awaited the rancher and he hated the fact that it could not be avoided then kurt was confused astounded infuriated with himself over a situation he had not brought about and could scarcely realize he became conscious of pride and shame and something as black and hopeless as despair  havent i seen youbefore asked the girl  the query surprised and thrilled kurt out of his selfcentered thought  i dont know have you where he answered facing her it was a relief to find that she still averted her face  at berkeley in california the first time and the second at spokane in front of the davenport she replied  firstandsecond youyou remembered both times he burst out incredulously  yes i dont see how i could have helped remembering her laugh was low musical a little hurried yet cool  dorn was not familiar with girls he had worked hard all his life there among those desert hills and during the few years his father had allowed him for education he knew wheat but nothing of the eternal feminine so it was impossible for him to grasp that this girl was not wholly at her ease her words and the cool little laugh suddenly brought home to kurt the immeasurable distance between him and a daughter of one of the richest ranchers in washington  you mean ii was impertinent he began struggling between shame and pride ii stared at you oh i must have been rude but miss anderson ii didnt mean to be i didnt think you saw meat all i dont know what made me do that it never happened before i beg your pardon  a subtle indefinable change perceptible to dorn even in his confused state came over the girl  i did not say you were impertinent she returned i remembered seeing younotice me that is all  selfpossessed aloof and kind miss anderson now became an impenetrable mystery to dorn but that only accentuated the distance she had intimated lay between them her kindness stung him to recover his composure he wished she had not been kind what a singular chance that had brought her here to his homethe daughter of a man who came to demand a longunpaid debt what a dispelling of the vague thing that had been only a dream dorn gazed away across the yellowing hills to the dim blue of the mountains where rolled the oregon despite the color it was graylike his future  i heard you tell father you had studied wheat said the girl presently evidently trying to make conversation  yes all my life replied kurt my study has mostly been under my father look at my hands he held out big strong hands scarred and knotted with horny palms uppermost and he laughed i can be proud of them miss anderson but i had a splendid year in california at the university and i graduated from the washington state agricultural college  you love wheatthe raising of it i mean she inquired  it must be that i do though i never had such a thought wheat is so wonderful no one can guess who does not know it the clean plump grain the sowing on fallow ground the long wait the first tender green and the change day by day to the deep waving fields of goldthen the harvest hot noisy smoky full of dust and chaff and the great combineharvesters with thirtyfour horses oh i guess i do love it all i worked in a spokane flourmill too just to learn how flour is made there is nothing in the world so white so clean so pure as flour made from the wheat of these hills  next youll be telling me that you can bake bread she rejoined and her laugh was low and sweet her eyes shone with soft blue gleams  indeed i can i bake all the bread we use he said stoutly and i flatter myself i can beat any girl you know  you can beat mine im sure before i went to college i did pretty well but i learned too much there now my mother and sisters and brother jim all the family except dad make fun of my bread  you have a brother how old is he  one brotherjim we call him hehe is just past twentyone she faltered the last few words  kurt felt on common ground with her then the sudden break in her voice the change in her face the shadowing of the blue eyesthese were eloquent  oh its horriblethis need of war she exclaimed  yes he replied simply but maybe your brother will not be called  called why he refused to wait for the draft he went and enlisted dad patted him on the back if anything happens to him itll kill my mother jim is her idol itd break my heart oh i hate the very name of germans  my father is german said kurt hes been fifty years in americaeighteen years here on this farm he always hated england now hes bitter against america i can see a side you cant see but i dont blame youfor what you said  forgive me i cant conceive of meaning that against any one whos lived here so long oh it must be hard for you  ill let my father think im forced to join the army but im going to fight against his people we are a house divided against itself  oh what a pity the girl sighed and her eyes were dark with brooding sorrow  a step sounded behind them mr anderson appeared sombrero off mopping a very red face his eyes gleamed with angry glints his mouth and chin were working he flopped down with a great explosive breath  kurt your old man is aason of a gun he exclaimed vociferously manifestly liberation of speech was a relief  the young man nodded seriously and knowingly i hope sirhehe  he didyou just bet your life he called me a lot in german but i know cuss words when i hear them i tried to reason with himtold him i wanted my moneywas here to help him get that money off the farm some way or other an he swore i was a capitalistan enemy to labor an the northwestthat i an my kind had caused the war  kurt gazed gravely into the disturbed face of the rancher miss anderson had wideopen eyes of wonder  sure i could have stood all that went on anderson fuming but he ordered me out of the house i got mad an wouldnt go thenby george he pulled my nose an called me a bloody englishman  kurt groaned in the disgrace of the moment but amazingly miss anderson burst into a silvery peal of laughter  oh dad thatsjust toogood foranything you met yourmatch at last you know you alwaysboasted of your drop of english blood and youre sensitiveabout your big nose  he must be over seventy growled anderson as if seeking for some excuse to palliate his restraint im madbut it was funny the working of his face finally set in the huge wrinkles of a laugh  young dorn struggled to repress his own mirth but unguardedly he happened to meet the dancing blue eyes of the girl merry provocative full of youth and fun and that was too much for him he laughed with them  the jokes on me said anderson an i can take one now young man i think i gathered from your amiable dad that if the crop of wheat was full id get my money otherwise i could take over the land for my part id never do that but the others interested might do it even for the little money involved i tried to buy them out so id have the whole mortgage they would not sell  mr anderson youre a square man and ill do declared kurt  come out an show me the wheat interrupted anderson lenore do you want to go with us  i do replied the daughter and she took up her hat to put it on  kurt led them through the yard out past the old barn to the edge of the open slope where the wheat stretched away down and up as far as the eye could see     chapter ii  weve got over sixteen hundred acres in fallow ground a halfsection in rye another half in wheatturkey redand this section you see six hundred and forty acres in bluestem said kurt  andersons keen eyes swept from near at hand to far away down the gentle billowy slope and up the far hillside the wheat was two feet high beginning to be thick and heavy at the heads as if struggling to burst a fragrant dry wheaty smell mingled with dust came on the soft summer breeze and a faint silken rustle the greenish almost blue color near at hand gradually in the distance grew lighter and then yellow and finally took on a tinge of gold there was a living spirit in that vast wheatfield  dorn its the finest wheat ive seen exclaimed anderson with the admiration of the farmer who aspired high in fact its the only fine field of wheat ive seen since we left the foothills how is that  late spring and dry weather replied dorn most of the farmers reports are poor if we get rain over the bend country well have only an average yield this year if we dont get rainthen flat failure  miss anderson evinced an interest in the subject and she wanted to know why this particular field identical with all the others for miles around should have a promise of a magnificent crop when the others had no promise at all  this section lay fallow a long time replied dorn snow lasted here on this north slope quite a while my father used a method of soil cultivation intended to conserve moisture the seed wheat was especially selected and if we have rain during the next ten days this section of bluestem will yield fifty bushels to the acre  fifty bushels ejaculated anderson  bluestem why do you call it that when its green and yellow queried the girl  its a name there are many varieties of wheat bluestem is best here in this desert country because it resists drought it produces large yield it does not break and the flourmills rate it very high bluestem is not good in wet soils  anderson tramped along the edge of the field peering down here and there pulling a shaft of wheat and examining it the girl gazed with dreamy eyes across the undulating sea and dorn watched her  we have a ranchthousands of acresbut not like this she said  whats the difference asked dorn  she appeared pensive and in doubt  i hardly know what would you call thisthis scene  why i call it the desert of wheat but no one else does he replied  i named fathers ranch many waters i think those names tell the difference  isnt my desert beautiful  no it has a samenessa monotony that would drive me mad it looks as if the whole world had gone to wheat it makes me thinkoppresses me all this means that we live by wheat alone these bare hills theyre too open to wind and sun and snow they look like the toil of ages  miss anderson there is such a thing as love for the earththe bare brown earth you know we came from dust and to dust we return these fields are human to my father and they have come to speak to mea language i dont understand yet but i meanw hat you seethe growing wheat here the field of clods over there the wind and dust and glare and heat the eternal sameness of the open spacethese are the things around which my life has centered and when i go away from them i am not content  anderson came back to the young couple carrying some heads of wheat in his hand  smut he exclaimed showing both diseased and healthy specimens of wheat had to hunt hard to find that smut is the bane of all wheatgrowers i never saw so little of it as there is here in fact we know scarcely nothin about smut an its cure if there is any you farmers who raise only grain have got the work down to a science this bluestem is not bearded wheat like turkey red has that beard anythin to do with smut  i think not the parasite or fungus lives inside the wheat  never heard that before no wonder smut is the worst trouble for wheatraisers in the northwest ive fields literally full of smut an we never are rid of it one farmer has one idea an some one else another what could be of greater importance to a farmer were at war the men who claim to know say that wheat will win the war an we lose millions of bushels from this smut thats to say its a terrible fact to face id like to get your ideas  dorn happening to glance again at miss anderson an act that seemed to be growing habitual read curiosity and interest and something more in her direct blue eyes the circumstance embarrassed him though it tugged at the floodgates of his knowledge he could talk about wheat and he did like to yet here was a girl who might be supposed to be bored still she did not appear to be that warm glance was not politeness  yes id like to hear every word you can say about wheat she said with an encouraging little nod  sure she would added anderson with an affectionate hand on her shoulder shes a farmers daughter shell be a farmers wife  he laughed at this last sally the girl blushed dorn smiled and shook his head doubtfully  i imagine that good fortune will never befall a farmer he said  well if it should she replied archly just consider how i might surprise him with my knowledge of wheat indeed mr dorn i am interested ive never been in the bend beforein your desert of wheat i never before felt the greatness of loving the soilor caring for itof growing things from seed yet the bible teaches that and i read my bible please tell us the more you say the more ill like it  dorn was not proof against this eloquence and he quoted two of his authorities heald and woolman of the state agricultural experiment station where he had studied for two years  bunt or stinking smut is caused by two different species of microscopic fungi which live as parasites in the wheat plant both are essentially similar in their effects and their lifehistory tilletia tritici or the roughspored variety is the common stinking smut of the pacific regions while tilletia foetans or the smoothspored species is the one generally found in the eastern united states  the smut berries or balls from an infected head contain millions of minute bodies the spores or seeds of the smut fungus these reproduce the smut in somewhat the same way that a true seed develops into a new plant a single smut ball of average size contains a sufficient number of spores to give one for each grain of wheat in five or six bushels it takes eight smut spores to equal the diameter of a human hair normal wheat grains from an infected field may have so many spores lodged on their surface as to give them a dark color but other grains which show no difference in color to the naked eye may still contain a sufficient number of spores to produce a smutty crop if seed treatment is not practised  when living smut spores are introduced into the soil with the seed wheat or exist in the soil in which smutfree wheat is sown a certain percentage of the wheat plants are likely to become infected the smut spore germinates and produces first a stage of the smut plant in the soil this first stage never infects a young seedling direct but gives rise to secondary spores or sporida from which infection threads may arise and penetrate the shoot of a young seedling and reach the growing point here the fungus threads keep pace with the growth of the plant and reach maturity at or slightly before harvesttime  since this disease is caused by an internal parasite it is natural to expect certain responses to its presence it should be noted first that the smut fungus is living at the expense of its host plant the wheat and its effect on the host may be summarized as follows the consumption of food the destruction of food in the sporulating process and the stimulating or retarding effect on normal physiological processes  badly smutted plants remain in many cases undersize and produce fewer and smaller heads in the fife and bluestem varieties the infected heads previous to maturity exhibit a darker green color and remain green longer than the normal heads in some varieties the infected heads stand erect when normal ones begin to droop as a result of the increasing weight of the ripening grain  a crop may become infected with smut in a number of different ways smut was originally introduced with the seed and many farmers are still planting it every season with their seed wheat wheat taken from a smutty crop will have countless numbers of loose spores adhering to the grains also a certain number of unbroken smut balls these are always a source of danger even when the seed is treated with fungicides before sowing  there are also chances for the infection of a crop if absolutely smutfree seed is employed first soil infection from a previous smutty crop second soil infection from windblown spores experiments have shown that separated spores from crushed smut balls lose their effective power in from two to three months provided the soil is moist and loose and in no case do they survive a winter  it does not seem probable that wheat smut will be controlled by any single practice but rather by the combined use of various methods crop rotation the use of clean seed seed treatment with fungicides cultural practices and breeding and selection of varieties  failure to practise crop rotation is undoubtedly one of the main explanations for the general prevalence of smut in the wheatfields of eastern washington even with an intervening summer fallow the smut from a previous crop may be a source of infection experience shows that a fall stubble crop is less liable to smut infection than a crop following summer fallow the apparent explanation for this condition is the fact that the summer fallow becomes infected with windblown spores while in a stubble crop the windblown spores as well as those originating from the previous crop are buried in plowing  if clean seed or properly treated seed had been used by all farmers we should never have had a smut problem high per cents of smut indicate either soil infection or imperfect treatment the principle of the chemical treatment is to use a poison which will kill the superficial spores of the smut and not materially injure the germinating power of the seed the hotwater treatment is only recommended when one of the chemical steeps is not effective  certain cultural practices are beneficial in reducing the amount of smut in all cases while the value of others depends to some extent upon the source of the smut spores the factors which always influence the amount of smut are the temperature of the soil during the germinating period the amount of soil moisture and the depth of seeding where seedborne spores are the only sources of infection attention to the three factors mentioned will give the only cultural practices for reducing the amount of smut  early seeding has been practised by various farmers and they report a marked reduction in smut  the replowing of the summer fallow after the first fall rains is generally effective in reducing the amount of smut  very late plantingthat is four or five weeks after the first good fall rainsis also an effective practice fall tillage of summer fallow other than plowing seems to be beneficial  no smutimmune varieties of wheat are known but the standard varieties show varying degrees of resistance spring wheats generally suffer less from smut than winter varieties this is not due to any superior resistance but rather to the fact that they escape infection if only spring wheats were grown our smut problem would largely disappear but a return to this practice is not suggested since the winter wheats are much more desirable it seems probable that the conditions which prevail during the growing season may have considerable influence on the per cent of smut in any given variety                                       when dorn finished his discourse to receive the thanks of his listeners they walked back through the yard toward the road mr anderson who led the way halted rather abruptly  hum whore those men talkin to my driver he queried  dorn then saw a couple of strangers standing near the motorcar engaged in apparently close conversation with the chauffeur upon the moment they glanced up to see mr anderson approaching and they rather hurriedly departed dorn had noted a good many strangers latelymen whose garb was not that of farmers whose faces seemed foreign whose actions were suspicious  ill bet a hundred theyre iwws declared anderson take my hunch dorn  the strangers passed on down the road without looking back  wonder where theyll sleep tonight muttered dorn  anderson rather sharply asked his driver what the two men wanted and the reply he got was that they were inquiring about work  did they speak english went on the rancher  well enough to make themselves understood replied the driver  dorn did not get a good impression from the shifty eyes and air of taciturnity of mr andersons man and it was evident that the blunt rancher restrained himself he helped his daughter into the car and then put on his long coat next he shook hands with dorn  young man ive enjoyed meetin you an have sure profited from same he said which makes up for your dad ill run over here again to see youaround harvesttime an ill be wishin for that rain  thank you if it does rain ill be happy to see you replied dorn with a smile  well if it doesnt rain i wont come ill put it off another year an cuss them other fellers into holdin off too  youre very kind i dont know how idwed ever repay you in that case  dont mention it say how far did you say it was to palmer well have lunch there  its fifteen milesthat way answered dorn if it wasnt forfor father id like you to stayand break some of my bread  dorn was looking at the girl as he spoke her steady gaze had been on him ever since she entered the car and in the shade of her hat and the veil she was adjusting her eyes seemed very dark and sweet and thoughtful she brightly nodded her thanks as she held the veil aside with both hands  i wish you luck goodby she said and closed the veil  still dorn could see her eyes through it and now they were sweeter more mysterious more provocative of haunting thoughts it flashed over him with dread certainty that he had fallen in love with her the shock struck him mute he had no reply for the ranchers hearty farewell then the car lurched away and dust rose in a cloud     chapter iii  with a strange knocking of his heart high up toward his throat kurt dorn stood stockstill watching the moving cloud of dust until it disappeared over the hill  no doubt entered his mind the truth the fact was a year olda longfamiliar and dreamy statebut its meaning had not been revealed to him until just a moment past everything had changed when she looked out with that sweet steady gaze through the parted veil and then slowly closed it she had changed there was something intangible about her that last moment baffling haunting he leaned against a crooked old gatepost that as a boy he had climbed and the thought came to him that this spot would all his life be vivid and poignant in his memory the first sight of a blueeyed sunnyhaired girl a year and more before had struck deep into his unconscious heart a second sight had made her an unforgettable reality and a third had been the realization of love  it was sad regrettable incomprehensible and yet somehow his inner being swelled and throbbed her name was lenore anderson her father was one of the richest men in the state of washington she had one brother jim who would not wait for the army draft kurt trembled and a hot rush of tears dimmed his eyes all at once his lot seemed unbearable an immeasurable barrier had arisen between him and his old fathera hideous thing of blood of years of ineradicable difference the broad acres of wheatland so dear to him were to be taken from him love had overcome him with headlong rush a love that could never be returned and cruelest of all there was the war calling him to give up his home his father his future and to go out to kill and to be killed  it came to him while he leaned there that remembering the light of lenore andersons eyes he could not give up to bitterness and hatred whatever his misfortunes and his fate she would never be anything to him but he and her brother jim and many other young americans must be incalculable all to her that thought saved kurt dorn there were other things besides his own career his happiness and the way he was placed however unfortunate from a selfish point of view must not breed a morbid selfpity  the moment of his resolution brought a flash a revelation of what he owed himself the work and the thought and the feeling of his last few weeks there at home must be intensified he must do much and live greatly in little time this was the moment of his renunciation and he imagined that many a young man who had decided to go to war had experienced a strange spiritual division of self he wondered also if that moment was not for many of them a letdown a throwing up of ideals a helpless retrograding and surrender to the brutalizing spirit of war but it could never be so for him it might have been had not that girl come into his life  the bell for the midday meal roused kurt from his profound reverie and he plodded back to the house down through the barnyard gate he saw the hired men coming and a second glance discovered to him that two unknown men were with them watching for a moment kurt recognized the two strangers that had been talking to mr andersons driver they seemed to be talking earnestly now kurt saw jerry a trusty and longtried employee rather unceremoniously break away from these strangers but they followed him headed him off and with vehement nods and gesticulations appeared to be arguing with him the other hired men pushed closer evidently listening finally jerry impatiently broke away and tramped toward the house these strangers sent sharp words after himwords that kurt could not distinguish though he caught the tone of scorn then the two individuals addressed themselves to the other men and in close contact the whole party passed out of sight behind the barn  thoughtfully kurt went into the house he meant to speak to jerry about the strangers but he wanted to consider the matter first he had misgivings his father was not in the sittingroom nor in the kitchen dinner was ready on the table and the one servant an old woman who had served the dorns for years appeared impatient at the lack of promptness in the men both father and son except on sundays always ate with the hired help kurt stepped outside to find jerry washing at the bench  jerry whats keeping the men queried kurt  wal theyre palaverin out there with two iww fellers replied jerry  kurt reached for the rope of the farmbell and rang it rather sharply then he went in to take his place at the table and jerry soon followed old man dorn did not appear which fact was not unusual the other hired men did not enter until jerry and kurt were half done with the meal they seemed excited and somewhat boisterous kurt thought but once they settled down to eating after the manner of hungry laborers they had little to say kurt soon finishing his dinner went outdoors to wait for jerry that individual appeared to be long in coming and loud voices in the kitchen attested to further argument at last however he lounged out and began to fill a pipe  jerry i want to talk to you said kurt lets get away from the house  the hired man was a big lumbering fellow gnarled like an old oaktree he had a goodnatured face and honest eyes  i reckon you want to hear about them iww fellers he asked as they walked away  yes replied kurt  theres been a regular procession of them fellers the last week or so walkin through the country replied jerry todays the first time any of them got to me but ive heerd talk sunday when i was in palmer the air was full of rumors  rumors of what queried kurt  all kinds answered jerry nonchalantly scratching his stubby beard theres an army of iwws comin in from eastward idaho an montana are gittin a dose now short hours double wages join the union sabotage whatever thet is capital an labor fight threats if you dont fall in line an lord knows what all  what did those two fellows want of you  wanted us to join the iww replied the laborer  did they want a job  not as i heerd why one of them had a wad of bills thet would choke a cow he did most of the talkin the little feller with the beady eyes an the pockmarks he didnt say much hes austrian an not long in this country the big stiffglidden he called himselfmust be some shucks in thet iww he looked an talked oily at firstvery persuadin but when i says i wasnt goin to join no union he got sassy an bossy they made me sore so i told him to go to hell then he said the iww would run the whole northwest this summerwheatfields lumberin fruitharvestin railroadinthe whole kaboodle an thet any workman who wouldnt join would git his all right  well jerry what do you think about this organization queried kurt anxiously  not much it aint a square deal i aint got no belief in them what i heerd of their threatenin methods is like the way this glidden talks if i owned a farm id drive such fellers off with a whip theres goin to be bad doins if they come driftin strong into the bend  jerry are you satisfied with your job  sure i wont join the iww an ill talk agin it i reckon a few of us will hev to do all the harvestin an considerin thet ill take a dollar a day more on my wages  if father does not agree to that i will said kurt now how about the other men  wal they all air leanin toward promises of little work an lots of pay answered jerry with a laugh morgans on the fence about joinin but andrew agreed hes dutch an pigheaded jansens only too glad to make trouble fer his boss theyre goin to lay off the rest of today an talk with glidden they all agreed to meet down by the culvert an thets what they was arguin with me ferwanted me to come  wheres this man glidden demanded kurt ill give him a piece of my mind  i reckon hes hangin round the farmout of sight somewhere  all right jerry now you go back to work youll never lose anything by sticking to us i promise you that keep your eyes and ears open  kurt strode back to the house and his entrance to the kitchen evidently interrupted a colloquy of some kind the hired men were still at table they looked down at their plates and said nothing kurt left the sittingroom door open and turning he asked martha if his father had been to dinner  no an whats more when i called he takes to roarin like a mad bull replied the woman  kurt crossed the sittingroom to knock upon his fathers door the reply forthcoming did justify the old womans comparison it certainly caused the hired men to evacuate the kitchen with alacrity old chris dorns roar at his son was a german roar which did not soothe the young mans rising temper of late the father had taken altogether to speaking german he had never spoken english well and kurt was rapidly approaching the point where he would not speak german a deadlock was in sight and kurt grimly prepared to meet it he pounded on the locked door  the men are going to lay off he called  who runs this farm was the thundered reply  the iww is going to run it if you sulk indoors as you have done lately yelled kurt he thought that would fetch his father stamping out but he had reckoned falsely there was no further sound leaving the room in high dudgeon kurt hurried out to catch the hired men near at hand and to order them back to work they trudged off surlily toward the barn  then kurt went on to search for the iww men and after looking up and down the road and all around he at length found them behind an old strawstack they were comfortably sitting down backs to the straw eating a substantial lunch kurt was angry and did not care his appearance however did not faze the strangers one of them an american was a man of about thirty years cleanshaven squarejawed with light steely secretive gray eyes and a look of intelligence and assurance that did not harmonize with his motley garb his companion was a foreigner small of stature with eyes like a ferret and deep pits in his sallow face  do you know youre trespassing demanded kurt  you grudge us a little shade eh even to eat a bite said the american he wrapped a paper round his lunch and leisurely rose to fasten penetrating eyes upon the young man thats what i heard about you rich farmers of the bend  what business have you coming here queried kurt with sharp heat you sneak out of sight of the farmers you trespass to get at our men and with a lot of lies and guff you make them discontented with their jobs ill fire these men just for listening to you  mister dorn we want you to fire them thats my business out here replied the american  who are you anyway  thats my business too  kurt passed from hot to cold he could not miss the antagonism of this man a bold and menacing attitude  my foreman says your names glidden went on kurt cooler this time and that youre talking iww as if you were one of its leaders that you dont want a job that youve got a wad of money that you coax then threaten that youve intimidated three of our hands  your jerrys a marked man said glidden shortly  you impudent scoundrel exclaimed kurt now you listen to this youre the first iww man ive met you look and talk like an american but if you are american youre a traitor weve a war to fight war with a powerful country germany and you come spreading discontent in the wheatfields when wheat means life get out of here before i  well mark you too mister dorn and your wheatfields snapped glidden  with one swift lunge kurt knocked the man flat and then leaped to stand over him watching for a move to draw a weapon the little foreigner slunk back out of reach  ill start a little marking myself grimly said kurt get up  slowly glidden moved from elbow to knees and then to his feet his cheek was puffing out and his nose was bleeding the lightgray eyes were lurid  thats for your iww declared kurt the first rule of your iww is to abolish capital hey  kurt had not intended to say that it slipped out in his fury but the effect was striking glidden gave a violent start and his face turned white abruptly he hurried away his companion shuffled after him kurt stared at them thinking the while that if he had needed any proof of the crookedness of the iww he had seen it in gliddens guilty face the man had been suddenly frightened and surprise too had been prominent in his countenance then kurt remembered how anderson had intimated that the secrets of the iww had been long hidden kurt keen and quick in his sensibilities divined that there was something powerful back of this gliddens cunning and assurance could it be only the power of a new labor organization that might well be great but the idea did not convince kurt during a hurried and tremendous preparation by the government for war any disorder such as menaced the country would be little short of a calamity it might turn out a fatality this socalled labor union intended to take advantage of a crisis to further its own ends yet even so that fact did not wholly explain glidden and his subtlety some nameless force loomed dark and sinister back of gliddens meaning and it was not peril to the wheatlands of the northwest alone  like a huge dog kurt shook himself and launched into action there were sense and pleasure in muscular activity and it lessened the habit of worry soon he ascertained that only morgan had returned to work in the fields andrew and jansen were nowhere to be seen jansen had left four horses hitched to a harrow kurt went out to take up the work thus abandoned  it was a long field and if he had earned a dollar for every time he had traversed its length during the last ten years he would have been a rich man he could have walked it blindfolded it was fallow ground already plowed disked rolled and now the last stage was to harrow it loosening the soil conserving the moisture  morgan far to the other side of this section had the better of the job for his harrow was a new machine and he could ride while driving the horses but kurt using an old harrow had to walk the four big horses plodded at a gait that made kurt step out to keep up with them to keep up to drive a straight line to hold back on the reins was labor for a man it spoke well for kurt that he had followed that old harrow hundreds of miles that he could stand the strain that he loved both the physical sense and the spiritual meaning of the toil  driving west he faced a wind laden with dust as dry as powder at every sheeted cloud whipping back from the hoofs of the horses and the steel spikes of the harrow he had to bat his eyes to keep from being blinded the smell of dust clogged his nostrils as soon as he began to sweat under the hot sun the dust caked on his face itching stinging burning there was dust between his teeth  driving back east was a relief the wind whipped the dust away from him and he could catch the fragrance of the newly turned soil how brown and clean and earthy it looked where the harrow had cut and ridged the soil did not look thirsty and parched but that which was unharrowed cried out for rain no cloud in the hot sky except the yellow clouds of dust  on that trip east across the field which faced the road dorn saw pedestrians in twos and threes passing by once he was hailed but made no answer he would not have been surprised to see a crowd yet travelers were scarce in that region the sight of these men some of them carrying bags and satchels was disturbing to the young farmer where were they going all appeared outward bound toward the river they came of course from the little towns the railroads the cities at this season with harvesttime near at hand it had been in former years no unusual sight to see strings of laborers passing by but this year they came earlier and in greater numbers  with the wind in his face however dorn saw nothing but the horses and the brown line ahead and half the time they were wholly obscured in yellow dust he began thinking about lenore anderson just pondering that strange steady look of a girls eyes and then he did not mind the dust or heat or distance never could he be cheated of his thoughts and those of her even the painful ones gave birth to a comfort that he knew must abide with him henceforth on lonely labors such as this perhaps in the lonelier watches of a soldiers duty she had been curious aloof then sympathetic she had studied his face she had been an eloquenteyed listener to his discourse on wheat but she had not guessed his secret not until her last lookstrange deep potenthad he guessed that secret himself  so with mind both busy and absent kurt dorn harrowed the fallow ground abandoned by his men and when the day was done with the sun setting hot and coppery beyond the dim dark ranges he guided the tired horses homeward and plodded back of them weary and spent  he was to learn from morgan at the stables that the old man had discharged both andrew and jansen and jansen liberating some newly assimilated poison had threatened revenge he would see that any hired men would learn a thing or two so that they would not sign up with chris dorn in a fury the old man had driven jansen out into the road  sober and moody kurt put the horses away and washing the dust grime from sunburnt face and hands he went to his little attic room where he changed his damp and sweaty clothes then he went down to supper with mind made up to be lenient and silent with his old and sorely tried father  chris dorn sat in the light of the kitchen lamps he was a huge man with a great round bulletshaped head and a shock of gray hair and bristling grizzled beard his face was broad heavy and seemed sodden with dark brooding thought his eyes under bushy brows were pale gleams of fire he looked immovable as to both bulk and will  never before had kurt dorn so acutely felt the fixed contrary ruthless nature of his parent never had the distance between them seemed so great kurt shivered and sighed at once then being hungry he fell to eating in silence presently the old man shoved his plate back and wiping his face he growled in german  i discharged andrew and jansen  yes i know replied kurt it wasnt good judgment whatll we do for hands  ill hire more men are coming for the harvest  but they all belong to the iww protested kurt  and whats that  in scarcely subdued wrath kurt described in detail and to the best of his knowledge what the iww was and he ended by declaring the organization treacherous to the united states  hows that asked old dorn gruffly  kurt was actually afraid to tell his father who never read newspapers who knew little of what was going on that if the allies were to win the war it was wheat that would be the greatest factor instead of that he said if the iww inaugurated strikes and disorder in the northwest it would embarrass the government  then ill hire iww men said old dorn  kurt battled against a rising temper this blind old man was his father  but ill not have iww men on the farm retorted kurt i just punched one iww solicitor  ill run this farm if you dont like my way you can leave darkly asserted the father  kurt fell back in his chair and stared at the turgid bulging forehead and hard eyes before him what could be behind them had the war brought out a twist in his fathers brain why were germans so impossible  my heavens father would you turn me out of my home because we disagree he asked desperately  in my country sons obey their fathers or they go out for themselves  ive not been a disobedient son declared kurt and here in america sons have more freedommore say  america has no sense of family lifeno honest government i hate the country  a ball of fire seemed to burst in kurt  that kind of talk infuriates me he blazed i dont care if you are my father why in the hell did you come to america why did you stay why did you marry my motheran american woman thats rotjust spiteful rot ive heard you tell what life was in europe when you were a boy you ran off you stayed in this country because it was a better country than yours fifty years youve been in americamany years on this farm and you love this land my god father cant you and men like you see the truth  aye i can gloomily replied the old man the truth is well lose the land that greedy anderson will drive me off  he will not hes finegenerous asserted kurt earnestly all he wanted was to see the prospects of the harvest and perhaps to help you anderson has not had interest on his money for three years ill bet hes paid interest demanded by the other stockholders in that bank you borrowed from why hes our friend  aye and i see more boomed the father he fetched his lass up here to make eyes at my son i saw herthe sly wench boy youll not marry her  kurt choked back his mounting rage  certainly i never will he said bitterly but i would if shed have me  what thundered dorn his white locks standing up and shaking like the mane of a lion that wheat bankers daughter never i forbid it you shall not marry any american girl  father this is idle foolish rant cried kurt with a high warning note in his voice ive no idea of marrying but if i had onewhom else could i marry except an american girl  ill sell the wheatthe land well go back to germany  that was maddening to kurt he sprang up sending dishes to the floor with a crash he bent over to pound the table with a fist violent speech choked him and he felt a cold tight blanching of his face  listen he rang out if i go to germany itll be as a soldierto kill germans im doneim through with the very name listen to the last words ill ever speak to you in germanthe last to hell with germany  then kurt plunged blind in his passion out of the door into the night and as he went he heard his father cry out brokenly  my son oh my son  the night was dark and cool a faint wind blew across the hills and it was dry redolent sweet the sky seemed an endless curving canopy of dark blue blazing with myriads of stars  kurt staggered out of the yard down along the edge of a wheatfield to one of the strawstacks and there he flung himself down in an agony  oh im ruinedruined he moaned the breakhas come poor old dad  he leaned there against the straw shaking and throbbing with a cold perspiration bathing face and body even the palms of his hands were wet a terrible fit of anger was beginning to loose its hold upon him his breathing was labored in gasps and sobs unutterable stupidity of his fatherhorrible cruelty of his position what had he ever done in all his life to suffer under such a curse yet almost he clung to his wrath for it had been righteous that thing that infernal twist in the brain that was what was wrong with his father his father who had been fifty years in the united states how simple then to understand what was wrong with germany  by god i amamerican he panted and it was as if he called to the grave of his mother over there on the dark windy hill  that tremendous uprising of his passion had been a vortex an end a decision and he realized that even to that hour there had been a drag in his blood it was over now the hell was done with his soul was free this weak quaking body of his housed his tainted blood and the emotions of his heart but it could not control his mind his will beat by beat the helpless fury in him subsided and then he fell back and lay still for a long time eyes shut relaxed and still  a hound bayed mournfully the insects chirped low incessantly the night wind rustled the silken heads of wheat  after a while the young man sat up and looked at the heavens at the twinkling white stars and then away across the shadows of round hills in the dusk how lonely sad intelligible and yet mystic the night and the scene  what came to him then was revealing upliftinga source of strength to go on he was not to blame for what had happened he could not change the future he had a choice between playing the part of a man or that of a coward and he had to choose the former there seemed to be a spirit beside himthe spirit of his mother or of some one who loved him and who would have him be true to an ideal and if needful die for it no night in all his life before had been like this one the dreaming hills with their precious rustling wheat meant more than even a spirit could tell where had the wheat come from that had seeded these fields whence the first and original seeds and where were the sowers back in the ages the stars the night the dark blue of heaven hid the secret in their impenetrableness beyond them surely was the answer and perhaps peace  material thingslife successsuch as had inspired kurt dorn on this calm night lost their significance and were seen clearly they could not last but the wheat there the hills the starsthey would go on with their task passion was the dominant side of a man declaring itself and that was a matter of inheritance but selfsacrifice with its mercy its succor its seed like the wheat was as infinite as the stars he had long made up his mind yet that had not given him absolute restraint the world was full of little men but he refused to stay little this war that had come between him and his father had been bred of the fumes of selfcentered minds turned with an infantile fatality to greedy desires his poor old blinded father could be excused and forgiven there were other old men sick crippled idle who must suffer pain but whose pain could be lightened there were babies children women who must suffer for the sins of men but that suffering need no longer be if men became honest and true  his sudden upflashing love had a few hours back seemed a calamity but out there beside the whispering wheat under the passionless stars in the dreaming night it had turned into a blessing he asked nothing but to serve to serve her his country his future all at once he who had always yearned for something unattainable had greatness thrust upon him his tragical situation had evoked a spirit from the gods  to kiss that blueeyed girls sweet lips would be a sum of joy earthly allsatisfying precious the man in him trembled all over at the daring thought he might revel in such dreams and surrender to them since she would never know but the divinity he sensed there in the presence of those stars did not dwell on a womans lips kisses were for the present the all too fleeting present and he had to concern himself with what he might do for one girls future it was exquisitely sad and sweet to put it that way though kurt knew that if he had never seen lenore anderson he would have gone to war just the same he was not making an abstract sacrifice  the wheatfields rolling before him every clod of which had been pressed by his bare feet as a boy the father whose changeless blood had sickened at the son of his loins the life of hope freedom of action of achievement of wonderful possibilitythese seemed lost to kurt dorn a necessary renunciation when he yielded to the call of war  but no loss no sting of bullet or bayonet no torturing victory of approaching death could balance in the scale against the thought of a picture of one american girlblueeyed redlipped goldenhairedas she stepped somewhere in the future down a summer lane or through a blossoming orchard on soil that was free     chapter iv  toward the end of july eastern washington sweltered under the most torrid spell of heat on record it was a dry high country noted for an equable climate with cool summers and mild winters and this unprecedented wave would have been unbearable had not the atmosphere been free from humidity  the haze of heat seemed like a pall of thin smoke from distant forest fires the sun rose a great palered ball hot at sunrise and it soared blazingwhite at noon to burn slowly westward through a cloudless coppery sky at last to set sullen and crimson over the ranges  spokane being the only center of iron steel brick and masonry in this area resembled a city of furnaces business was slack the asphalt of the streets left clean imprints of a pedestrians feet bits of newspaper stuck fast to the hot tar down by the gorge where the great green river made its magnificent plunges over the falls people congregated tarried and were loath to leave for here the blowing mist and the air set into motion by the falling water created a temperature that was relief  citizens talked of the protracted hot spell of the blasted crops of an almost sure disaster to the wheatfields and of the activities of the iww even the war for the time being gave place to the nearer calamities impending  montana had taken drastic measures against the invading iww the governor of idaho had sent word to the camps of the organization that they had five days to leave that state spokane was awakening to the menace of hordes of strange idle men who came in on the westbound freighttrains the railroads had been unable to handle the situation they were being hard put to it to run trains at all the train crews that refused to join the iww had been threatened beaten shot at and otherwise intimidated  the chamber of commerce sent an imperative appeal to representative wheatraisers ranchers lumbermen farmers and bade them come to spokane to discuss the situation they met at the hotel davenport where luncheon was served in one of the magnificently appointed dininghalls of that most splendid hotel in the west  the lion of this group of spokane capitalists was riesinberg a man of german forebears but all american in his sympathies with a son already in the army riesinberg was president of a city bank and of the chamber of commerce his first words to the large assembly of cleancut squarejawed intenteyed westerners were gentlemen we are here to discuss the most threatening and unfortunate situation the northwest was ever called upon to meet his address was not long but it was stirring the chamber of commerce could provide unlimited means could influence and control the state government but it was from the visitors invited to this meeting the men of the outlying districts which were threatened that objective proofs must come and the best methods of procedure  the first facts to come out were that many crops were ruined already but owing to the increased acreage that year a fair yield was expected that wheat in the bend would be a failure though some farmers here and there would harvest well that the lumber districts were not operating on account of the iww  then it was that the organization of men who called themselves the industrial workers of the world drew the absorbed attention of the meeting depredations already committed stunned the members of the chamber of commerce  president riesinberg called upon beardsley a prominent and intelligent rancher of the southern wheatbelt beardsley said      it is difficult to speak with any moderation of the outrageous     eruption of the iww it is nothing less than rebellion and the     most effective means of suppressing rebellion is to apply a little     of that direct action which is the favorite diversion of the     iwws      the iww do not intend to accomplish their treacherous aims by     anything so feeble as speech they scorn the ballotbox they are     against the war and their method of making known their protest is     by burning our grain destroying our lumber and blowing up     freighttrains they seek to make converts not by argument but by     threats and intimidation      we read that western towns are seeking to deport these rebels in     the old days we can imagine more drastic measures would have been     taken the westerners were handy with the rope and the gun in those     days we are not counseling lynch law but we think deportation is     too mild a punishment      we are too civilized to apply the old roman law spare the     conquered and extirpate the rebels but at least we could intern     them the british have found it practicable to put german prisoners     to work at useful employment why couldnt we do the same with our     rebel iwws  jones a farmer from the yakima valley told that business men housewives professional men and highschool boys and girls would help to save the crop of washington to the nation in case of labor trouble steps already had been taken to mobilize workers in stores offices and homes for work in the orchards and grainfields should the iww situation seriously threaten harvests  pledges to go into the hay or grain fields or the orchards with a statement of the number of days they were willing to work had been signed by virtually all the men in north yakima  helmar lumberman from the blue mountains spoke feelingly he said      my company is the owner of a considerable amount of timbered lands     and timber purchased from the state and from individuals we have     been engaged in logging that land until our operations have been     stopped and our business paralyzed by an organization which calls     itself the industrial workers of the world and by members of that     organization and other lawless persons acting in sympathy with     them      our employees have been threatened with physical violence and     death      our works are picketed by individuals who camp out in the forests     and who intimidate and threaten our employees      open threats have been made that our works our logs and our     timber will all be burned      sabotage is publicly preached in the meetings and in the     literature of the organization it is advised and upheld      the open boast is made that the lumbering industry with all other     industry will be paralyzed by this organization by the destruction     of property used in industry and by the intimidation of laborers who     are willing to work      a real and present danger to the property of my company exists     unless protection is given to us it will probably be burned and     destroyed our lawful operations cannot be conducted because     laborers who are willing to work are fearful of their lives and are     subject to abuse threats and violence our camps when in     operation are visited by individuals belonging to the said     organization and the men peaceably engaged in them threatened with     death if they do not cease work all sorts of injury to property by     the driving of spikes in logs the destruction of logs and other     similar acts are encouraged and recommended      as i pointed out to the sheriff of our county the season is a very     dry one and the woods are and will be unless rain comes in danger     of disastrous fires the organization and its members have openly     and repeatedly asserted that they will burn the logs in the woods     and burn the forests of this company and other timberholders before     they will permit logging operations to continue      many individuals belonging to the organization are camped in the     open in the timbered country and their very presence is a fire     menace they are engaged in no business except to interfere with the     industry and to interfere with the logging of this company and     others who engaged in the logging business      we have done what we could in a lawful manner to continue our     operations and to protect our employees we are now helpless and     place the responsibility for the protection of our property and the     protection of our employees upon the board of county commissioners     and upon the officers of the county  next president riesinberg called upon a young reporter to read paragraphs of an iww speech he had heard made to a crowd of three hundred workmen it was significant that several members of the chamber of commerce called for a certain paragraph to be reread it was this      if you workingmen could only stand together you could do in this     country what has been done in russia declared the iww orator     you know what the workingmen did there to the slimy curs the     gunmen and the stoolpigeons of the capitalistic class they bumped     them off they sent them up to say good morning jesus  after a moment of muttering and another silence the president again addressed the meeting      gentlemen we have anderson of golden valley with us today if     there are any of you present who do not know him you surely have     heard of him his people were pioneers he was born in washington     he is a type of the men who have made the northwest he fought the     indians in early days and packed a gun for the outlawsand today     gentlemen he owns a farm as big as spokane county we want to hear     from him  when anderson rose to reply it was seen that he was pale and somber slowly he gazed at the assembly of waiting men bowed then he began impressively      gentlemen an friends i wish i didnt have to throw a bomb into     this here campfire talk but ive got to youre all talkin iww     facts have been told showin a strange an sudden growth of this     here fourflush labor union weve had dealins with them for     several years but this year its different all at once theyve     multiplied and strengthened theres somethin behind them a big     unseen hand is stackin the deck an countrymen that     tremendous power is german gold  andersons deep voice rang like a bell his hearers sat perfectly silent no surprise showed but faces grew set and hard after a pause of suspense in which his denunciation had time to sink in anderson resumed      a few weeks ago a young man a stranger came to me an asked for a     job he could do anythin he said an i hired him to drive my car     but he wasnt much of a driver we went up in the bend country one     day an on that trip i got suspicious of him i caught him talkin     to what i reckoned was iww men an then back home again i     watched him an kept my ears open it didnt take long for me to     find discontent among my farmhands i hire about a hundred hands on     my ranches durin the long off season an when harvest comes round     a good many more all i can get in fact well i found my hands     quittin me which was sure onusual an i laid it to that driver      one day not long ago i run across him hobnobbin with the strange     man id seen talkin with him on the bend trip but my drivernash     he calls himselfdidnt see me that night i put a cowboy to watch     him an what this cowboy heard put together two an two was that     nash was assistant to an iww leader named glidden he had sent     for glidden to come to look over my ranch both these iww men had     more money than they could well carrylots of it gold the way they     talked of this money proved that they did not know the source but     the supply was unlimited      next day glidden could not be found but my cowboy had learned     enough to show his methods if these proselyters could not coax or     scare trusted men to join the iww they tried to corrupt them     with money an in most cases theyre successful ive not yet     sprung anythin on my driver nash but he cant get away an     meanwhile ill learn much by watchin him maybe through nash i can     catch glidden an so gentlemen here we have a plain case an the     menace is enough to chill the heart of every loyal citizen any way     you put it if harvests cant be harvested if wheatfields an     lumber forests are burned if the state militia has to be called     outany way you put it our government will be hampered our     supplies kept from our alliesan so the cause of germany will be     helped      the iww have back of them an organized power with a definite     purpose there can hardly be any doubt that that power is germany     the agitators an leaders throughout the country are well paid     probably they as individuals do not know who pays them     undoubtedly a little gang of men makes the deals handles the money     we read that every us attorney is investigating the iww the     government has determined to close down on them but lawyers an law     are slow to act meanwhile the danger to us is at hand      gentlemen to finish let me say that down in my country were goin     to rustle the iww in the good old western way     chapter v  golden valley was the garden of eden of the northwest the southern slope rose to the blue mountains whence flowed down the innumerable brooks that uniting to form streams and rivers abundantly watered the valley  the black reaches of timber extended down to the grazinguplands and these bordered on the sloping golden wheatfields which in turn contrasted so vividly with the lower green alfalfapastures then came the orchards with their ruddy mellow fruit and lastly the bottomlands where the vegetablegardens attested to the wonderful richness of the soil from the mountainside the valley seemed a series of colored benches stepping down black to gray and gray to gold and gold to green with purple tinge and on to the perfectly ordered manyhued floor with its innumerable winding treebordered streams glinting in the sunlight  the extremes of heat and cold never visited golden valley spokane and the bend country just now sweltering in a torrid zone might as well have been in the sahara for all the effect it had on this garden spot of all the inland empire it was hot in the valley but not unpleasant in fact the greatest charm in this secluded vale was its pleasant climate all the year round no summer cyclones no winter blizzards no cloudbursts or bad thunderstorms it was a country that once lived in could never be left  there were no poor inhabitants in that great area of twentyfive hundred miles and there were many who were rich prosperous little towns dotted the valley floor and the many smooth dusty muchused roads all led to ruxton a wealthy and fine city                                       anderson the rancher had driven his car to spokane upon his return he had with him a detective whom he expected to use in the iww investigations and a neighbor rancher they had left spokane early and had endured almost insupportable dust and heat a welcome change began as they slid down from the bare desert into the valley and once across the copper river anderson began to breathe freer and to feel he was nearing home  gods country he said as he struck the first low swell of rising land where a cool wind from off the wooded and watered hills greeted his face dust there still was but it seemed a different kind and smelled of appleorchards and alfalfafields here were hard smooth roads and anderson sped his car miles and miles through a country that was a verdant fragrant bower and across bright shady streams and by white little hamlets  at huntington he dropped his neighbor rancher and also the detective hall who was to go disguised into the districts overrun by the iww a further run of forty miles put him on his own property  anderson owned a string of farms and ranches extending from the bottomlands to the timberline of the mountains they represented his life of hard work and fair dealing many of these orchard and vegetable lands he had tenant farmers work on shares the uplands or wheat and grass he operated himself as he had accumulated property he had changed his place of residence from time to time at last to build a beautiful and permanent home farther up on the valley slope than any of the others  it was a modern house white with a red roof situated upon a high level bench with the waving gold fields sloping up from it and the green squares of alfalfa and orchards below it appeared a landmark from all around and could be plainly seen from vale the nearest little town five miles away  anderson had always loved the open and he wanted a place where he could see the sun rise over the distant valley gateway and watch it set beyond the bold black range in the west he could sit on his front porch wide and shady and look down over two thousand acres of his own land but from the back porch no eye could have encompassed the limit of his broad swelling slopes of grain and grass  from the main road he drove up to the right of the house where under a dip of wooded slope clustered barns sheds corrals granaries engine and machinery houses a store and the homes of hired mena little village in itself  the sounds he heard were a welcome homethe rush of swift water not twenty yards from where he stopped the car in the big courtyard the pound of hoofs on the barn floor the shrill whistle of a stallion that saw and recognized him the drawling laugh of his cowboys and the clink of their spurs as they became aware of his return  nash the suspected driver was among those who hurried to meet the car  andersons keen covert glance made note of the drivers worried and anxious face  nash shell need a lookin over he said as he uncovered bundles in the back seat and lifted them out  all right sir replied nash eagerly a note of ended strain was significant in his voice  here you jake cheerily called anderson to a rawboned gauntfaced fellow who wore the garb of a cowboy  boss im powerful glad to see you home replied jake as he received bundle after bundle until he was loaded down then he grinned mebbe you want a packboss  youre hoss enough for me come on he said and waving the other men aside he turned toward the green shady hill above which the red and white of the house just showed  a bridge crossed the rushing stream here jake dropped some of the bundles and anderson recovered them as he straightened up he looked searchingly at the cowboy jakes yellowgray eyes returned the gaze and that exchange showed these two of the same breed and sure of each other  nawthin come off boss he drawled but im glad youre home  did nash leave the place queried anderson  twice at night an he was gone long i didnt foller him because i seen he didnt take no luggage an thet boy has some sporty clothes he was sure comin back  any sign of his pardthat glidden  nope but theres been moren one new feller snookin round  have you heard from any of the boys with the cattle  yep bill weeks rode down he said a bunch of iwws were campin above blue spring thet means theyve moved on down to the edge of the timber an oncomfortable near our wheat bill says theyre killin our stock fer meat  hum how many in the gang inquired anderson darkly his early dealings with outlaw rustlers had not left him favorably inclined toward losing a single steer  wal i reckon we cant say mebbe five hundred countin all along the valley on this side then we hear theres more on the other boss if they git ugly were goin to lose stock wheat an mebbe some blood  so many as that ejaculated the rancher in amaze  they come an go an lately theyre most comin replied jake  when do we begin cuttin grain  i

swore they wasnt iwws but adams says an so do i thet some of them are men who first claimed to our old hands thet they did belong to the iww  an so weve got to take a chance if were goin to harvest two thousand acres of wheat  i reckon boss  any reports from ruxton way  wal yes but i reckon youd better git your supper fore i tell you boss  jake you said nothin had come off  wal nawthin has around here come on now boss miss lenore says i was to keep my mouth shut  jake whos your boss me or lenore  wal you air but i aint disobeyin miss lenore  anderson walked the rest of the way up the shady path to the house without saying any more to jake the beautiful white house stood clear of the grove bright in the rays of the setting sun a barking of dogs greeted anderson and then the pattering of feet his daughters appeared on the porch kathleen who was ten made a dive for him and rose who was fourteen came flying after her both girls were screaming joyously their sunny hair danced lenore waited for him at the step and as he mounted the porch burdened by the three girls his anxious sadly smiling wife came out to make perfect the welcome home nonot perfect for andersons joy held a bitter drop the absence of his only son  oh dad whatall did you fetch me cried kathleen and she deserted her father for the bundleladen jake  and me echoed rose  even lenore in the happiness of her fathers return was not proof against the wonder and promise of those many bundles  they all went within through a hall to a great cozy livingroom mrs andersons very first words after her welcoming smile were a halffaltered  anynews ofjim  whyyes replied anderson hesitatingly  suddenly the three sisters were silent how closely they resembled one another thenlenore a budding woman rose a budding girl and kathleen a rosy radiant child lenore lost a little of her bloom  what news father she asked  havent you heard from him returned anderson  not for a whole week he wrote the day he reached spokane but then he hardly knew anything except that hed enlisted  im sure glad jim didnt wait for the draft replied the father well mother an girls jim was gone when i got to spokane all i heard was that he was well when he left for frisco an strong for the aviation corps  then he means toto be an aviator said lenore with quivering lips  sure if he can get in an hes wise jim knows engines he has a knack for machinery an nerve no boy ever had more hell make a crack flier  butthe danger whispered the boys mother with a shudder  i reckon therell be a little danger mother replied anderson cheerfully weve got to take our chance on jim theres one sure bet if he had stayed home hed been fightin iwws  that trying moment passed mrs anderson said that she would see to supper being put on the table at once the younger girls began untying the bundles lenore studied her fathers face a moment  jake you run along she said to the waiting cowboy wait till after supper before you worry father  ill do thet miss lenore drawled jake an if he wants worryin hell hev to look me up  lass im only tired not worried replied anderson as jake shuffled out with jingling spurs  did anything serious happen in spokane she asked anxiously  no but spokane men are alive to serious trouble ahead replied her father i spoke to the chamber of commercesure exploded a bomb in that camp then i had conferences with a good many different men fact is they ran me pretty hard couldnt have slept much anyhow in that heat lass this is the place to live id rather die here than live in spokane in summer  did you see the governor  yes an he wasnt as anxious about the golden valley as the bend country hes right too were old westerners here we can handle trouble but theyre not americans up there in the bend  father we met one american said lenore dreamily  by george we did an that reminds me there was a government official from washington come out to spokane to investigate conditions i forget his name he asked to meet me an he was curious about the bendits loyalty to the us i told him all i knew an what i thought an then he said he was goin to motor through that wheatbelt an talk to what americans he could find an impress upon them that they could do as much as soldiers to win the war wheatbreadthats our great gun in this war lenore i knew this but i was made pretty blamed sober by that government man i told him by all means to go to palmer an to have a talk with young dorn i sure gave that boy a good word poor lad hes true blue an to think of him with that old german devil old dorn has always had a hard name an this war has brought out the german cussedness  father im glad you spoke well of the young man said lenore still dreamily  hum you never told me what you thought replied her father with a quick glance of inquiry at her lenore was gazing out of the window away across the wheatfields and the range anderson watched her a moment and then resumed if i can get away im goin to drive up to see dorn again pretty soon do you want to go  lenore gave a little start as if the question had surprised her  ii hardly think so she replied  its just as well he said thatll be a hard ride guess ill clean up a little for supper  anderson left the room and while kathleen and rose gleefully squabbled over the bundles lenore continued to gaze dreamily out of the window                                       that night lenore went early to her room despite the presence of some young people from a neighboring village she locked her door and sat in the dark beside her open window  an early moon silvered the long slopes of wheat and made the alfalfa squares seem black a cool faint sweet breeze fanned her cheek she could smell the fragrance of apples of newmown hay and she could hear the low murmur of running water a hound bayed off somewhere in the fields there was no other sound it was a quiet beautiful pastoral scene but somehow it did not comfort lenore  she seemed to doubt the sincerity of what she saw there and loved so well moonblanched and serene lonely and silent beautiful and promising the wide acres of many waters and the silver slopes and dark mountains beyond did not tell the truth way over the dark ranges a hideous war had stretched out a red hand to her country her only brother had left his home to fight and there was no telling if he would ever come back evil forces were at work out there in the moonlight there had come a time for her to be thoughtful  her fathers asking her to ride to the bend country had caused some strange little shock of surprise lenore had dreamed without thinking here in the darkness and silence watching the crescent moon slowly sink she did think and it was to learn that she remembered singularly well the first time she had seen young dorn and still more vividly the second time but the third time seemed both clear and vague enough young men had been smitten with lenore to enable her to gauge the symptoms of these easycome easygo attractions in fact they rather repelled her but she had found dorns manner striking confusing and unforgettable and why that should be so interested her intelligence  it was confusing to discover that she could not lay it to the sympathy she had felt for an american boy in a difficult position because she had often thought of him long before she had any idea who he was or where he lived  in the very first place he had been unforgettable for two reasonsbecause he had been so struck at sight of her that he had gazed unconsciously with a glow on his face and a radiance in his eye as of a young poet spellbound at an inspiration and because he seemed the physical type of young man she had idealizeda strong lithelimbed blond giant with a handsome frank face clearcut and smooth ruddycheeked and blueeyed  only after meeting him out there in the desert of wheat had she felt sympathy for him and now with intelligence and a womans intuition barring the old insidious dreamy mood lenore went over in retrospect all she could remember of that meeting and the truth made her sharply catch her breath dorn had fallen in love with her intuition declared that while her intelligence repudiated it stranger than all was the thrill which began somewhere in the unknown depths of her and mounted to leave her tingling all over she had told her father that she did not want to ride to the bend country but she did want to go and that thought flashing up would not be denied to want to meet a strange young man again was absolutely a new and irritating discovery for lenore it mystified her because she had not had time to like dorn liking an acquaintance had nothing to do with the fact and that stunned her  could it belove at first sight she whispered incredulously as she stared out over the shadowing fields  for me why how absurdimpossible ii only remembered hima big handsome boy with blazing eyes and now im sorry for him  to whisper her amaze and doubt and consternation only augmented the instinctive recurring emotion she felt something she could not explain and that something was scarcely owing to this young mans pitiful position between duty to his father and love for his country it had to do with his blazing eyes intangible dreamlike perceptions of him as not real of vague sweet fancies that retreated before her introspective questioning what alarmed lenore was a tendency of her mind to shirk this revealing analysis never before had she been afraid to look into herself but now she was finding unplumbed wells of feeling secret chambers of dreams into which she had never let the light strange instinctive activities more physical than mental when in her life before had she experienced a nameless palpitation of her heart  long she sat there staring out into the night and the change in the aspect of the broad spaces now dark and impenetrable and mysterious seemed like the change in the knowledge of herself once she had flattered herself that she was an inch of crystal water now she seemed a complex aloof and contrary creature almost on the verge of tumultuous emotions  she said her prayers that night a girlish habit resumed since her brother had declared his intention of enlisting in the army and to that old prayer which her mother had prayed before her she added an appeal of her own strange that young dorns face should flash out of gloom it was there and her brothers was fading  i wonderwill he and jimmeet over thereon the battlefield she whispered she hoped they would like tigers those boys would fight the germans her heart beat high then a cold wind seemed to blow over her it had a sickening weight if that icy and somber wind could have been traced to its source then the mystery of life would have been clear but that source was the cause of war as its effect was the horror of women a hideous and monstrous thing existed out there in the darkness lenore passionately loved her brother and this black thing had taken him away why could not women who suffered most have some word in the regulation of events if women could help govern the world there would be no wars  at last encroaching drowsiness dulled the poignancy of her feelings and she sank to sleep     chapter vi  singing of birds at her window awakened lenore the dawn streamed in bright and sweetly fragrant the wheatfields seemed a rosy gold and all that open slope called to her thrillingly of the beauty of the world and the happiness of youth it was not possible to be morbid at dawn i hear i hear she whispered from a thousand slopes far and wide  at the breakfasttable when there came opportunity she looked up serenely and said father on second thought i will go the bend thank you  anderson laid down his knife and fork and his eyes opened wide in surprise changed your mind he exclaimed  thats a privilege i have you know she replied calmly  mrs anderson appeared more anxious than surprised daughter dont go that will be a fearful ride  hum sure glad to have you lass added anderson with his keen eyes on her  let me go too begged rose  kathleen was solemnly gazing at lenore with the wise penetrating eyes of extreme youth  lenore ill bet youve got a new beau up there she declared  lenore flushed scarlet she was less angry with her little sister than with the incomprehensible fact of a playful word bringing the blood stingingly to her neck and face  kitty you forget your manners she said sharply  kit is fresh shes an awful child added rose with a superior air  i didnt say a thing cried kathleen hotly lenore if it isnt true whyd you blush so red  hush you silly children ordered the mother reprovingly  lenore was glad to finish that meal and to get outdoors she could smile now at that shrewd and terrible kitty but recollection of her fathers keen eyes was confusing lenore felt there was really nothing to blush for still she could scarcely tell her father that upon awakening this morning she had found her mind made upthat only by going to the bend country could she determine the true state of her feelings she simply dared not accuse herself of being in unusually radiant spirits because she was going to undertake a long hard ride into a barren desert country  the grave and thoughtful mood of last night had gone with her slumbers often lenore had found problems decided for her while she slept on this fresh sweet summer morning with the sun bright and warm presaging a hot and glorious day lenore wanted to run with the winds to wade through the alfalfa to watch with strange and renewed pleasure the waves of shadow as they went over the wheat all her life she had known and loved the fields of waving gold but they had never been to her what they had become overnight perhaps this was because it had been said that the issue of the great war the salvation of the world and its happiness its hope depended upon the millions of broad acres of golden grain bread was the staff of life lenore felt that she was changing and growing if anything should happen to her brother jim she would be heiress to thousands of acres of wheat a pang shot through her heart she had to drive the cold thought away and she must learnmust know the bigness of this question the women of the country would be called upon to help to do their share  she ran down through the grove and across the bridge coming abruptly upon nash her fathers driver he had the car out  good morning he said with a smile doffing his cap  lenore returned his greeting and asked if her father intended to go anywhere  no im taking telegrams to huntington  telegrams whats the matter with the phone she queried  wire was cut yesterday  by iww men  so your father says i dont know  something ought to be done to those men said lenore severely  nash was a darkbrowed heavyjawed young man with light eyes and hair he appeared to be intelligent and had some breeding but his manner when alone with lenorehe had driven her to town several timeswas not the same as when her father was present lenore had not bothered her mind about it but today the look in his eyes was offensive to her  between you and me lenore ive sympathy for those poor devils he said  lenore drew back rather haughtily at this familiar use of her first name it doesnt concern me she said coldly and turned away  wont you ride along with me im driving around for the mail he called after her  no returned lenore shortly and hurried on out of earshot the impertinence of the fellow  mawnin miss lenore drawled a cheery voice the voice and the jingle of spurs behind her told lenore of the presence of the best liked of all her fathers men  good morning jake wheres my dad  wal hes with adams an i wouldnt be adams for no money replied the cowboy  neither would i laughed lenore  reckon you aint ridin this mawnin you sure look powerful fine miss lenore but you cant ride in thet dress  jake nothing but an aeroplane would satisfy me today  want to fly hey wal excuse me from them birds i seen one an thets enough for me an changin the subject miss lenore beggin your pardonyou aint ridin in the car much these days  no jake im not she replied and looked at the cowboy she would have trusted jake as she would her brother jim and now he looked earnest  wal im sure glad i heerd nash call an ask you to go with him i seen his eyes when he said it sure i know youd never look at the likes of him but i want to tell youhe aint no good ive been watchin him your dads orders hes mixed up with the iwws but thet aint what i mean itshesi  thank you jake replied lenore as the cowboy floundered i appreciate your thought of me but you neednt worry  i was worryin a little he said you see i know men better n your dad an i reckon this nash would do anythin  whats father keeping him for  wal anderson wants to find out a lot about thet iww an he aint above takin risks to do it either  the stableboys and men lenore passed all had an eager good morning for her she often boasted to her father that she could run many waters as well as he sometimes there were difficulties that lenore had no little part in smoothing over the barns and corrals were familiar places to her and she insisted upon petting every horse in some instances to jakes manifest concern  some of them bosses are bad he insisted  to be sure they arewhen wicked cowboys cuff and kick them replied lenore laughingly  wal if im wicked im agoin to war said jake reflectively them germans bother me  but jake you dont come in the draft age do you  jest how old do you think i am  sometimes about fourteen jake  much obliged wal the fact is im over age but ill gamble i can pack a gun an shoot as straight an eat as much as any young feller  ill bet so too jake but i hope you wont go we absolutely could not run this ranch without you  sure i knew thet wal then i reckon ill hang around till youre married miss lenore he drawled  again the scarlet mantled lenores cheeks  good well have many harvests then jake and many rides she replied  aw i dont know he began  but lenore ran away so that she could hear no more  whats the matter with me that peoplethat jake should she began and ended with a hand on each soft hot cheek there was something different about her that seemed certain and if her eyes were as bright as the day with its deep blue and white clouds and shining green and golden fields then any one might think what he liked and have proof for his tormenting  but married i not much do i want a husband getting shot  the path lenore trod so lightly led along a great peach and apple orchard where the trees were set far apart and the soil was cultivated so that not a weed nor a blade of grass showed the fragrance of fruit in the air however did not come from this orchard for the trees were young and the reddening fruit rare down the wide aisles she saw the thick and abundant green of the older orchards  at length lenore reached the alfalfafields and here among the mounds of newly cut hay that smelled so fresh and sweet she wanted to roll and she had to run two great wagons with four horses each were being loaded lenore knew all the workmen except one silas warner an old grayheaded farmer had been with her father as long as she could remember  whar you goin lass he called as he halted to wipe his red face with a huge bandana its too hot to run the way youre adoin  oh silas its a grand morning she replied  why so tis pitchin hay hyar made me think it was hot he said as she tripped on now lass dont go up to the wheatfields  but lenore heard heedlessly and she ran on till she came to the uncut alfalfa which impeded her progress a wonderful space of green and purple stretched away before her and into it she waded it came up to her knees rich thick soft and redolent of blossom and ripeness hard tramping it soon got to be she grew hot and breathless and her legs ached from the force expended in making progress through the tangled hay at last she was almost across the field far from the cutters and here she flung herself to roll and lie flat and gaze up through the deep azure of sky wonderingly as if to penetrate its secret and then she hid her face in the fragrant thickness that seemed to force a whisper from her  i wonderhow will i feelwhen i see himagain oh i wonder  the sound of the whispered words the question the inevitableness of something involuntary proved traitors to her happy dreams her assurance her composure she tried to burrow under the hay to hide from that tremendous brightblue eye the sky suddenly she lay very quiet feeling the strange glow and throb and race of her blood sensing the mystery of her body trying to trace the thrills to control this queer tremulous internal state but she found she could not think clearly she could only feel and she gave up trying it was sweet to feel  she rose and went on another field lay beyond a gradual slope covered with a new growth of alfalfa it was a light greena contrast to the rich darkness of that behind her at the end of this field ran a swift little brook clear and musical open to the sky in places and in others hidden under flowery banks birds sang from invisible coverts a quail sent up clear flutelike notes and a lark caroled seemingly out of the sky  lenore wet her feet crossing the brook and climbing the little knoll above she sat down upon a stone to dry them in the sun it had a burn that felt good no matter how hot the sun ever got there she liked it always there seemed air to breathe and the shade was pleasant  from this vantagepoint a favorite one with lenore she could see all the alfalfafields the hill crowned by the beautiful whiteandred house the acres of garden and the miles of orchards the grazing and grain fields began behind her  the brook murmured below her and the birds sang she heard the bees humming by the air out here was clear of scent of fruit and hay and it bore a drier odor not so sweet she could see the workmen first those among the alfalfa and then the men and women too bending over on the vegetablegardens likewise she could see the gleam of peaches apples pears and plumsa colorful and mixed gleam delightful to the eye  wet or dry it seemed that her feet refused to stay still and once again she was wandering a gray slatecolored field of oats invited her steps and across this stretch she saw a long yellow slope of barley where the men were cutting beyond waved the golden fields of wheat lenore imagined that when she reached them she would not desire to wander farther  there were two machines cutting on the barley slope one drawn by eight horses and the other by twelve when lenore had crossed the oatfield she discovered a number of strange men lounging in the scant shade of a line of low trees that separated the fields here she saw adams the foreman and he espied her at the same moment he had been sitting down talking to the men at once he rose to come toward lenore  is your father with you he asked  no hes too slow for me replied lenore who are these men  theyre strangers looking for jobs  iww men queried lenore in lower voice  surely must be he replied adams was not a young not a robust man and he seemed to carry a burden of worry your father said he would come right out  i hope he doesnt said lenore bluntly father has a way with him you know  yes i know and its the way were needing here in the valley replied the foreman significantly  is that the new harvesterthresher father just bought asked lenore pointing to the huge machine shining and creeping behind the twelve horses  yes thats the mccormack and its a dandy returned adams with machines like that we can get along without the iww  i want a ride on it declared lenore and she ran along to meet the harvester she waved her hand to the driver bill jones another old hand long employed by her father bill hauled back on the manybranched reins and when the horses stopped the clattering whirring roar of the machine also ceased  howdy miss reckon this s a regular iww holdup  worse than that bill gaily replied lenore as she mounted the platform where another man sat on a bag of barley lenore did not recognize him he looked rugged and honest and beamed upon her  watch out fer yer dress he said pointing with grimy hand to the dusty wheels and braces so near her  let me drive bill she asked  wal now i wisht i could he replied dryly you sure can drive miss but drivin aint all this here job  what cant i do ill bet you  i never seen a girl that could throw anythin straight did you  well not so very i forgot how you drove the horses go ahead dont let me delay the harvest  bill called sonorously to his twelve horses and as they bent and strained and began to bob their heads the clattering roar filled the air also a cloud of dust and thin flying streams of chaff enveloped lenore the high stalks of barley in wide sheets fell before the cutter upon an apron to be carried by feeders into the body of the machine the straw denuded of its grain came out at the rear to be dropped while the grain streamed out of a tube on the side next to lenore to fall into an open sack it made a short shift of harvesting  lenore liked the even nodding rhythm of the plodding horses and the way bill threw a pebble from a sack on his seat to hit this or that horse not keeping in line or pulling his share bills aim was unerring he never hit the wrong horse which would have been the case had he used a whip the grain came out in so tiny a stream that lenore wondered how a bag was ever filled but she saw presently that even a tiny stream if running steadily soon made bulk that was proof of the value of small things even atoms  no marvel was it that bill and his helper were as grimy as stokers of a furnace lenore began to choke with the fine dust and to feel her eyes smart and to see it settle on her hands and dress she then had appreciation of the nature of a tenhour day for workmen cutting eighteen acres of barley how would they ever cut the two thousand acres of wheat no wonder many men were needed lenore sympathized with the operators of that harvesterthresher but she did not like the dirt if she had been a man though that labor hard as it was would have appealed to her harvesting the grain was beautiful whether in the old slow method of threshing or with one of these modern mansaving machines  she jumped off and the big ponderous thing almost gifted with intelligence it seemed to lenore rolled on with its whirring roar drawing its cloud of dust and leaving behind a litter of straw  it developed then that adams had walked along with the machine and he now addressed her  will you be staying here till your father comes he asked  no mr adams why do you ask  you oughtnt come out here alone or go back alone all these strange men some of them hard customers youll excuse me miss but this harvest is not like other harvests  ill wait for my father and ill not go out of sight replied lenore thanking the foreman for his thoughtfulness she walked away and soon she stood at the edge of the first wheatfield  the grain was not yet ripe but near at hand it was a pale gold the wind out of the west waved and swept the wheat while the almost imperceptible shadows followed  a road half overgrown with grass and goldenrod bordered the wheatfield and it wound away down toward the house her father appeared mounted on the white horse he always rode lenore sat down in the grass to wait for him nodding stalks of goldenrod leaned to her face when looked at closely how truly gold their color yet it was not such a gold as that of the rich blaze of ripe wheat she was admitting to her consciousness a jealousy of anything comparable to wheat and suddenly she confessed that her natural love for it had been augmented by a subtle growing sentiment not sentiment about the war or the need of the allies or meaning of the staff of life she had sensed young dorns passion for wheat and it had made a difference to her  no use lying to myself she soliloquized i think of him i cant help it i ran out here wild restless unable to reason just because id decided to see him againto make sure ii really didnt care how furioushow ridiculous ill feelwhenwhen  lenore did not complete her thought because she was not sure nothing could be any truer than the fact that she had no idea how she would feel she began sensitively to distrust herself she who had always been so sure of motives so contented with things as they were had been struck by an absurd fancy that haunted because it was fiercely repudiated and scorned that would give her no rest until it was proven false but suppose it were true  a succeeding blankness of mind awoke to the clipclop of hoofs and her fathers cheery halloo  anderson dismounted and throwing his bridle he sat down heavily beside her  you can ride back home he said  lenore knew she had been reproved for her wandering out there and she made a motion to rise his big hand held her down  no hurry now im here grand day aint it an i see the barleys goin them sacks look good to me  lenore waited with some perturbation she had a guilty conscience and she feared he meant to quiz her about her sudden change of front regarding the bend trip so she could not look up and she could not say a word  jake says that nash has been tryin to make up to you any sense in what he says asked her father bluntly  why hardly oh ive noticed nash isis rather fresh as rose calls it replied lenore somewhat relieved at this unexpected query  yes hes been makin eyes at rose she told me replied anderson  discharge him said lenore forcibly  so i ought but let me tell you lenore ive been hopin to get nash dead to rights  what more do you want she demanded  i mean regardin his relation to the iww listen heres the point nash has been tracked an caught in secret talks with prominent men in this country men of foreign blood an mebbe foreign

packin two guns right now an you bet jake is packin the same we dont travel far apart any more this summer  lenore had started shudderingly and her look showed her voiceless fear  you neednt tell your mother he went on more intimately i can trust you an  to come back to nash he an this gliddenyou remember one of those men at dorns housethey are usin gold they must have barrels of it if i could find out where that gold comes from probably they dont know but i might find out if men here in our own country are hatchin plots with the iww  plots what for queried lenore breathlessly  to destroy my wheat to drive off or bribe the harvesthands to cripple the crop yield in the northwest to draw the militia here in short to harass an weaken an slow down our government in its preparation against germany  why that is terrible declared lenore  ive a hunch from jaketheres a whisper of a plot to put me out of the way said anderson darkly  ohgood heavens you dont mean it cried lenore distractedly

wheatlands of mine some day its in my will thats because you like your dad always loved the wheat youd fight wouldnt you to save your grain for our soldiersbread for your own brother jiman for your own land  fight would i burst out lenore with a passionate little cry  good now youre talkin exclaimed her father  ill find out about this nashif youll let me declared lenore as if inspired  how what do you mean girl  ill encourage him ill make him think im a wishywashy moonstruck girl smitten with him alls fair in war if he means ill by my father  anderson muttered low under his breath and his big hand snapped hard at the nodding goldenrod  for my saketo help meyoud encourage nashflirt with him a littlefind out all you could  yes i would she cried deliberately but she wanted to cover her face with her hands she trembled slightly then grew cold with a sickening disgust at this strange new uprising self  wait a minute before you say too much went on anderson youre my bestbeloved child my lenore the lass ive been so proud of all my life id spill blood to avenge an insult to you but lenore weve entered upon a terrible war people out here especially the women dont realize it yet but

the terrible danger to that country think of you an rose an kathleen bein treated like those poor belgian girls well youd get that an worse if the germans won this war an the point is for us to win every last one of us must fight sacrifice to that end an hang together  anderson paused huskily and swallowed hard while he looked away across the fields lenore felt herself drawn by an irresistible power the west wind rustled through the waving wheat she heard the whir of the threshers yet all seemed unreal her fathers passion had made this place another world  so much for that resumed anderson im goin to do my best an i may make blunders ill play the game as its dealt out to me lord knows i feel all in the dark but its the nature of the effort the spirit thatll count im goin to save most of the wheat on my ranches an bein a westerner who can see ahead i know theres goin to be blood spilled id give a lot to know who sent this nash spyin on me im satisfied now hes an agent a spy a plotter for a gang thats marked me i cant prove it yet but i feel it maybe nothin worth whileworth the troublewill ever be found out from him but i dont figure that way i say play their own game an take a chance if you encouraged nash youd probably find out all about him the worst of it is could you be slick enough could a girl as fine an square an highspirited as you ever doublecross a man even a scoundrel like nash i reckon you could considerin the motive women are wonderful well if you can fool him make him think hes a winner flatter him till he swells up like a toad promise to elope with him be curious jealous make him tell where he goes whom he meets show his letters all without ever sufferin his hand on you ill give my consent id think more of you for it now the question is can you do it  yes whispered lenore  good exploded anderson in a great relief then he began to mop his wet face he arose showing the weight of heavy guns in his pockets and he gazed across the wheatfields that wheatll be ripe in a week it sure looks fine lenore you ride back home now dont let jake pump you hes powerful curious an ill go give these iwws a first dose of anderson  he turned away without looking at her and he hesitated bending over to pluck a stem of goldenrod  lassyoureyoure like your mother he said unsteadily an she helped me win out durin my struggle here youre brave an youre big  lenore wanted to say something to show her feeling to make her task seem lighter but she could not speak  were pards nowwith no secrets he continued with a different note in his voice an i want you to know that it aint likely nash or glidden will get out of this country alive     chapter vii  three days later lenore accompanied her father on the ride to the bend country she sat in the back seat of the car with jakean arrangement very gratifying to the cowboy but received with illconcealed displeasure by the driver nash they had arranged to start at sunrise and it became manifest that nash had expected lenore to sit beside him all during the long ride it was her father however who took the front seat and behind nashs back he had slyly winked at lenore as if to compliment her on the evident success of their deep plot lenore at the first opportunity that presented shot nash a warning glance which was sincere enough jake had begun to use keen eyes and there was no telling what he might do  the morning was cool sweet fresh with a red sun presaging a hot day the big car hummed like a droning bee and seemed to cover the miles as if by magic lenore sat with face uncovered enjoying the breeze and the endless colorful scene flashing by listening to jakes amusing comments and trying to keep back thought of what discovery might await her before the end of this day  once across the copper river they struck the gradual ascent and here the temperature began to mount and the dust to fly lenore drew her veils close and leaning comfortably back she resigned herself to wait and to endure  by the flight of a crow it was about a hundred miles from andersons ranch to palmer but by the roundabout roads necessary to take the distance was a great deal longer lenore was well aware when they got up on the desert and the time came when she thought she would suffocate there appeared to be intolerable hours in which no one spoke and only the hum and creak of the machine throbbed in her ears she could not see through her veils and did not part them until a stop was made at palmer  her father got out sputtering and gasping shaking the dust in clouds from his long linen coat jake who always said he lived on dust and heat averred it was not exactly a regular fine day lenore looked out trying to get a breath of air nash busied himself with the hot engine  the little country town appeared dead and buried under dust there was not a person in sight nor a sound to be heard the sky resembled molten lead with a blazing center too bright for the gaze of man  anderson and jake went into the little hotel to get some refreshments lenore preferred to stay in the car saying she wanted only a cool drink the moment the two men were out of sight nash straightened up to gaze darkly and hungrily at lenore  thiss a good a chance as well get he said in an eager hurried whisper  for what asked lenore aghast  to run off he replied huskily  lenore had proceeded so cleverly to carry out her scheme that in three days nash had begun to implore and demand that she elope with him he had been so much of a fool but she as yet had found out but little about him his right name was ruenke he was a socialist he had plenty of money and hinted of mysterious sources for more  at this lenore hid her face and while she fell back in pretended distress she really wanted to laugh she had learned something new in these few days and that was to hate  oh no no she murmured ii cant think of thatyet  but why not he demanded in shrill violence his gloved hand clenched on the tool he held  mother has been so unhappywith my brother jimoff to the war ii just couldntnow harry you must give me time its all soso sudden please wait  nash appeared divided between two emotions lenore watched him from behind her parted veil she had been astonished to find out that side by side with her intense disgust and shame at the part she was playing there was a strong keen passionate interest in it owing to the fact that though she could prove little against this man her womans intuition had sensed his secret deadly antagonism toward her father by little significant mannerisms and revelations he had more and more betrayed the german in him she saw it in his overbearing conceit his almost instant assumption that he was her master at first lenore feared him but as she learned to hate him she lost her fear she had never been alone with him except under such circumstances as this and she had decided she would not be  wait he was expostulating but its going to get hot for me  oh what do you mean she begged you frighten me  lenore the iww will have hard sledding in this wheat country i belong to that i told you but the union is run differently this summer and ive got work to dothat i dont like since i fell in love with you come run off with me and ill give it up  lenore trembled at this admission she appeared to be close upon further discovery  harry how wildly you talk she exclaimed i hardly know you you frighten me with your mysterious talk haveaa little consideration for me  nash strode back to lean into the car behind his huge goggles his eyes gleamed his gloved hand closed hard on her arm  it is sudden its got to be sudden he said in fierce undertone you must trust me  i will but you must confide in me she replied earnestly im not quite a fool youre rushing metootoo  suddenly he released her threw up his hand then quickly stepped back to the front of the car jake stood in the door of the hotel he had seen that action of nashs then anderson appeared followed by a boy carrying a glass of water for lenore they approached the car jake sauntering last with his curious gaze on nash  go in an get a bite an a drink said anderson to the driver an hurry  nash obeyed jakes eyes never left him until he entered the door then jake stepped in beside lenore  thet waters wet anyhow he drawled  well get a good cold drink at dorns said anderson lass how are you makin it  fine she replied smiling  so i seen significantly added jake with a piercing glance at her  lenore realized then that she would have to confide in jake or run the risk of having violence done to nash so she nodded wisely at the cowboy and winked mischievously and taking advantage of andersons entering the car she whispered in jakes ear im finding out things tell youlater  the cowboy looked anything but convinced and he glanced with narrowed eyes at nash as that worthy hurried back to the car  with a lurch and a leap the car left palmer behind in a cloud of dust the air was furnacehot oppressive and exceedingly dry lenores lips smarted so that she continually moistened them on all sides stretched dreary parched wheatfields anderson shook his head sadly jake said aint thet too bad not half growed an sure too late now  near at hand lenore saw the short immature dirtywhitish wheat and she realized that it was ruined  its been gettin worse jake remarked anderson most of this wont be cut at all an what is cut wont yield seedlings i see a yellow patch here an there on the north slopes but on the most part the bends a failure  father you remember dorns section that promised so well asked lenore  yes but it promised only in case of rain i look for the worst replied anderson regretfully  it looks like stormclouds over there said lenore pointing far ahead  through the drifting veils of heat far across the bare dreamy hills of fallow and the blasted fields of wheat stood up some huge white columnar clouds a vivid contrast to the coppery sky  by george theres a thunderhead exclaimed anderson jake what do you make of that  looks good to me replied jake who was always hopeful  lenore bore the hot wind and the fine choking dust without covering her face she wanted to see all the hills and valleys of this desert of wheat her heart beat a little faster as looking across that waste on waste of heroic labor she realized she was nearing the end of a ride that might be momentous for her the very aspect of that wide treeless expanse with all its overwhelming meaning seemed to make her a stronger and more thoughtful girl if those endless wheatfields were indeed ruined what a pity what a tragedy not only would young dorn be ruined but perhaps many other toiling farmers somehow lenore felt no hopeless certainty of ruin for the young man in whom she was interested  there on that slope spoke up anderson pointing to a field which was yellow in contrast to the surrounding gray field theres a halfsection of fair wheat  but such tinges of harvest gold were not many in half a dozen miles of dreary hills where were the beautiful shadows in the wheat wondered lenore not a breath of wind appeared to stir across those fields  as the car neared the top of a hill the road curved into another and lenore saw a dusty flash of another car passing on ahead  suddenly jake leaned forward  boss i seen somethin throwed out of thet carinto the wheat he said  whatmebbe it was a bottle replied anderson peering ahead  nope sure wasnt thet there i seen it again watch boss  lenore strained her eyes and felt a stir of her pulses jakes voice was perturbing was it strange that nash slowed up a little where there was no apparent need then lenore saw a hand flash out of the side of the car ahead and throw a small glinting object into the wheat  there seen it again said jake  i saw jake mark that spot nash slow down yelled anderson  lenore gathered from the look of her father and the cowboy that something was amiss but she could not guess what it might be nash bent sullenly at his task of driving  i reckon about here said jake waving his hand  stop her ordered anderson and as the car came to a halt he got out followed by jake  wal i marked it by thet rock declared the cowboy  so did i responded anderson lets get over the fence an find what it was they threw in there  jake rested a lean hand on a post and vaulted the fence but anderson had to climb laboriously and painfully over the barbedwire obstruction lenore marveled at his silence and his persistence anderson hated wire fences presently he got over and then he divided his time between searching in the wheat and peering after the strange car that was drawing far away  lenore saw jake pick up something and scrutinize it  ill be doggoned he muttered then he approached anderson what is thet  jake you can lambaste me if i ever saw the likes replied anderson but it looks bad lets rustle after that car  as anderson clambered into his seat once more he looked dark and grim  catch that car ahead he tersely ordered nash whereupon the driver began to go through his usual motions in starting  lenore what do you make of this queried anderson turning to show her a small cake of some gray substance soft and wet to the touch  i dont know what it is replied lenore wonderingly do you  no an id give a lotsay nash hurry overhaul that car  anderson turned to see why his order had not been obeyed he looked angry nash made hurried motions the car trembled the machinery began to whirthen came a tremendous buzzing roar a violent shaking of the car followed by sharp explosions and silence  you stripped the gears shouted anderson with the red fading out of his face  no but somethings wrong replied nash he got out to examine the engine  anderson manifestly controlled strong feeling lenore saw jakes hand go to her fathers shoulder boss he whispered we cant ketch thet car now anderson resigned himself averted his face so that he could not see nash who was tinkering with the engine lenore believed then that nash had deliberately stalled the engine or disordered something so as to permit the escape of the strange car ahead she saw it turn off the long straight road ahead and disappear to the right after some minutes delay nash resumed his seat and started the car once more  from the top of the next hill lenore saw the dorn farm and home all the wheat looked parched she remembered however that the section of promising grain lay on the north slope and therefore out of sight from where she was  looks as bad as any said anderson goodby to my money  lenore shut her eyes and thought of herself her inward state she seemed calm and glad to have that first part of the journey almost ended her motive in coming was not now the impelling thing that had actuated her  when next the car slowed down she heard her father say drive in by the house  then lenore opening her eyes saw the gate the trim little orchard with its scant shade the gray old weatherbeaten house which she remembered so well the big porch looked inviting as it was shady and held an old rockingchair and a bench with blue cushions a door stood wide open no one appeared to be on the premises  nash blow your horn an then hunt around for somebody said anderson come get out lenore you must be half dead  oh no only half dust and half fire replied lenore laughing as she stepped out what a relief to get rid of coat veils bonnet and to sit on a shady porch where a faint breeze blew just at that instant she heard a low distant rumbling thunder it thrilled her jake brought her a cold refreshing drink and she sent him back after another she wet her handkerchief and bathed her hot face it was indeed very comfortable there after that long hot ride  miss lenore i seen thet nash pawin you said the cowboy an by gosh i couldnt believe my eyes  not so loud jake the young gentleman imagines im in love with him replied lenore  wall ill remove his imagining declared jake coolly  jake you will do nothing  ahuh then you air in love with him  lenore was compelled to explain to this loyal cowboy just what the situation meant whereupon jake swore his amaze and said im agoin to lick him anyhow fer thet and he caught up the tin cup and shuffled away  footsteps and voices sounded on the path upon which presently appeared anderson and young dorn  fathers gone to wheatly he was saying but im glad to tell you well pay twenty thousand dollars on the debt as soon as we harvest if it rains well pay it all and have thirty thousand left  good i sure hope it rains an that thunder sounds hopeful responded anderson  its been hopeful like that for several days but no rain said dorn and then espying lenore he seemed startled out of his eagerness he flushed slightly ii didnt seeyou had brought your daughter  he greeted her somewhat bashfully and lenore returned the greeting calmly watching him steadily and waiting for the nameless sensations she had imagined would attend this meeting but whatever these might be they did not come to overwhelm her the gladness of his voice as he had spoken so eagerly to her father about the debt had made her feel very kindly toward him it might have been natural for a young man to resent this dragging debt but he was fine she observed as he sat down that once the smile and flush left his face he seemed somewhat thinner and older than she had pictured him a shadow lay in his eyes and his lips were sad he had evidently been working upon their arrival he wore overalls dusty and ragged his arms bare to the elbow were brown and muscular his thin cotton shirt was wet with sweat and it clung to his powerful shoulders  anderson surveyed the young man with friendly glance  whats your first name he queried with his blunt frankness  kurt was the reply  is that american  no neither is dorn but kurt dorn is an american  hum so i see an im powerful glad an youve saved the big section of promisin wheat  yes weve been lucky its the best and finest wheat father ever raised if it rains the yield will go sixty bushels to the acre  sixty whew ejaculated anderson  lenore smiled at these wheat men and said it surely will rainand likely storm today i am a prophet who never fails  by george thats true lenore has anybody beat when it comes to figurin the weather declared anderson  dorn looked at her without speaking but his smile seemed to say that she could not help being a prophet of good of hope of joy  say lenore how many bushels in a section at sixty per acre went on anderson  thirtyeight thousand four hundred replied lenore  an whatll you sell for asked anderson of dorn  father has sold at two dollars and twentyfive cents a bushel replied dorn  good but he ought to have waited the government will set a higher price how much will that come to lenore  dorns smile as he watched lenore do her mental arithmetic attested to the fact that he already had figured out the sum  eightysix thousand four hundred dollars replied lenore is that right  an youll have thirty thousand dollars left after all debts are paid inquired anderson  yes sir i can hardly realize it thats a fortunefor one section of wheat but weve had four bad seasons oh if it only rains today  lenore turned her cheek to the faint west wind and then she looked long at the slowly spreading clouds white and beautiful high up near the skyline and dark and forbidding down along the horizon  i knew a girl who could feel things move when no one else could said lenore im sensitive like thatat least about wind and rain right now i can feel rain in the air  then you have brought me luck said dorn earnestly indeed i guess my luck has turned i hated the idea of going away with that debt unpaid  are yougoing away asked lenore in surprise  yes rather he replied with a short sardonic laugh he fumbled in a pocket of his overalls and drew forth a paper which he opened a flame burned the fairness from his face his eyes darkened and shone with peculiar intensity of pride i was the first man drafted in this bend country my number was the first called  drafted echoed lenore and she seemed to be standing on the threshold of an amazing and terrible truth  lass we forget said her father rather thickly  oh butwhy cried lenore she had voiced the same poignant appeal to her brother jim why need hewhy must he go to war what for and jim had called out a bitter curse on the germans he meant to kill  why returned dorn with the sad thoughtful shadow returning to his eyes how many times have i asked myself that in one way i dont know i havent told father yet its not for his sake but when i think deeplywhen i can feel and seei mean im going for my country for you and your sisters  like a soldier then lenore received her mortal blow facing him who dealt it and it was a sudden overwhelming realization of love no confusion no embarrassment no shame attended the agony of that revelation outwardly she did not seem to change at all she felt her fathers eyes upon her but she had no wish to hide the tumult of her heart the moment made her a woman where was the fulfilment of those vague stingingly sweet dreamy fancies of love where was her maiden reserve that she so boldly recognized an unsolicited passion her eyes met dorns steadily and she felt some vital and compelling spirit pass from her to him she saw him struggle with what he could not understand it was his glance that wavered and fell his hand that trembled his breast that heaved she loved him there had been no beginning always he had lived in her dreams and like her brother he was going to kill and to be killed  then lenore gazed away across the wheatfields the shadows came waving toward her a stronger breeze fanned her cheeks the heavens were darkening and low thunder rolled along the battlements of the great clouds  say kurt what do you make of this asked anderson lenore turning saw her father hold out the little gray cake that jake had found in the wheatfield  young dorn seized it quickly felt and smelled and bit it  whered you get this he asked with excitement  anderson related the circumstance of its discovery  its a preparation mostly phosphorus replied dorn when the moisture evaporates it will igniteset fire to any dry substance that is a trick of the iww to burn the wheatfields  by all thats  swore anderson with his jaw bulging jake an i knew it meant bad but we didnt know what  ive been expecting tricks of all kinds said dorn i have four men watching the section  good say that car turned off to the right back here some miles but worse luck the iwws can work at night  well watch at night too replied dorn  lenore was conscious of anger encroaching upon the melancholy splendor of her emotions and the change was bitter  when the rain comes wont it counteract the ignition of that phosphorus she asked eagerly for she knew that rain would come  only for the time being it ll be just as dry this time tomorrow as it is now  then the wheats goin to burn declared anderson grimly if that trick has been worked all over this country youre goin to have worse n a prairie fire the job on hand is to save this one section that has a fortune tied up in it  mr anderson that job looks almost hopeless in the light of this phosphorus trick what on earth can be done ive four men i cant hire any more because i cant trust these strangers and how can four menor five counting me watch a square mile of wheat day and night  the situation looked hopeless to lenore and she was sick what cruel fates toyed with this young farmer he seemed to be sinking under this last crowning blow there in the sky rolling up and rumbling was the longdeferred rainstorm that meant freedom from debt and a fortune besides but of what avail the rain if it was to rush the wheat to full bursting measure only for the infernal touch of the foreigner  anderson however was no longer a boy he had dealt with many and many a trial never was he plunged into despair until after the dread crisis had come to pass his red forehead frowning and ridged with swelling bloodvessels showed the bent of his mind  oh it is hard said lenore to dorn im so sorry but dont give up while theres life theres hope  he looked up with tears in his eyes  thank you i did weaken you see ive let myself believe too muchfor dads sake i dont care about the money for myself money what good will money be to menow its over for me to get the wheat cutharvestedthats all i hoped the armywarfrancei go to be  hush whispered lenore and she put a soft hand upon his lips checking the end of that bitter speech she felt him start and the look she met pierced her soul hush its going to rain father will find some way to save the wheat and you are coming homeafter the war  he crushed her hand to his hot lips  you make meashamed i wont giveup he said brokenly and when im overtherein the trenches ill think  dorn listen to this rang out anderson well fool that iww gangits agoin to rain so far so good tomorrow you take this cake of phosphorus an ride around all over the country show it an tell the farmers their wheats goin to burn an offer them whose fields are already ruinedthat fire cant do no more harmoffer them big money to help you save your section half a hundred men could put out a fire if one did start an these neighbors of yours some of them will jump at a chance to beat the iww boy it can be done  he ended with a big fist held aloft in triumph  see didnt i tell you murmured lenore softly it touched her deeply to see dorn respond to hope his haggard face suddenly warmed and glowed  i never thought of that he burst out radiantly we can save the wheat mr anderson ii cant thank you enough  dont try replied the rancher  i tell you it will rain cried lenore gaily lets walk out therewatch the storm come across the hills i love to see the shadows blow over the wheat  lenore became aware as she passed the car that nash was glaring at her in no unmistakable manner she had forgotten all about him the sight of his jealous face somehow added to her strange exhilaration  they crossed the road from the house and facing the west had free prospect of the miles of billowy hills and the magnificent ordnance of the stormclouds the deep low mutterings of thunder seemed a grand and welcome music lenore stole a look at dorn to see him bareheaded face upturned entranced it was only a rainstorm coming down in the valley country such storms were frequent at this season too common for their meaning to be appreciated here in the desert of wheat rain was a blessing life itself  the creamywhite rounded edge of the approaching clouds came and coalesced spread and mushroomed under them the body of the storm was purple lit now and then by a flash of lightning long drifting veils of rain gray as thin fog hung suspended between sky and earth  listen exclaimed dorn  a warm wind laden with dry scent of wheat struck lenores face and waved her hair it brought a silken sweeping rustle a whispering of the bearded grain the soft sound thrilled lenore it seemed a sweet hopeful message that waiting had been rewarded that the drought could be broken again and more beautiful than ever before in her life she saw the waves of shadow as they came forward over the wheat rippling like breezes over the surface of a golden lake they came in long broken lines moving following changing until the whole wheatfield seemed in shadowy motion  the cloud pageant rolled on above and beyond lenore felt a sweet drop of rain splash upon her upturned face it seemed like a caress there came a pattering around her suddenly rose a damp faint smell of dust beyond the hill showed a gray pall of rain coming slowly charged with a low roar the whisper of the sweeping wheat was swallowed up  lenore stood her ground until heavy rain drops fell thick and fast upon her sinking through her thin waist to thrill her flesh and then with a last gay call to those two man lovers of wheat and storms she ran for the porch  there they joined her anderson puffing and smiling dorn still with that rapt look upon his face the rain swept up and roared on the roof while all around was streaked gray  boy theres your thirtythousanddollar rain shouted anderson  but dorn did not hear once he smiled at lenore as if she were the good fairy who had brought about this miracle in his look lenore had deeper realization of him of nature and of life she loved rain but always thenceforth she would reverence it fresh cool fragrance of a renewed soil filled the air all that dusty gray hue of the earth had vanished and it was wet and green and bright even as she gazed the water seemed to sink in as it fell a precious relief to thirsty soil the thunder rolled away eastward and the storm passed the thin clouds following soon cleared away from the western sky rainwashed and blue with a rainbow curving down to bury its exquisite hues in the golden wheat     chapter viii  the journey homeward held many incalculable differences from the uncertain doubts and fears that had tormented lenore on the outward trip  for a long time she felt the warm tight clasp of dorns hand on hers as he had said goodby very evidently he believed that was to be his last sight of her lenore would never forget the gaze that seemed to try to burn her image on his memory forever she felt that they would meet again solemn thoughts revolved in her mind still she was not unhappy she had given much unsought but the return to her seemed growing every moment that she lived  the dust had been settled by the rain for many miles however beyond palmer there began to show evidences that the storm had thinned out or sheered off because the road gradually grew dry again when dust rose once more lenore covered her face although obsessed as she was by the deep change in herself neither dust nor heat nor distance affected her greatly like the miles the moments sped by she was aware through closed eyes when darkness fell stops were frequent after the copper river had been crossed and her father appeared to meet and question many persons in the towns they passed most of his questioning pertained to the iww and even excited whispering by her father and jake had no power to interest her it was midnight when they reached many waters and lenore became conscious of fatigue  nash crowded in front of jake as she was about to step out and assisted her he gave her arm a hard squeeze and fiercely whispered in her ear tomorrow  the whisper was trenchant with meaning and thoroughly aroused lenore but she gave no sign and moved away  i seen strangers sneakin off in the dark jake was whispering to anderson  keep your eyes peeled replied anderson ill take lenore up to the house an come back  it was pitch black up the path through the grove and lenore had to cling to her father  is thereany danger she whispered  were lookin for anythin replied anderson slowly  will you be careful  sure lass ill take no foolish risks ive got men watchin the house an ranch but id better have the cowboys down theres jakehe spots some prowlin coyotes the minute we reach home  anderson unlocked and opened the door the hall was dark and quiet he turned on the electric light lenore was detaching her veil  you look pale he said solicitously no wonder that was a ride but im glad we went i saved dorns wheat  im glad too father goodnight  he bade her goodnight and went out locking the door then his rapid footsteps died away wearily lenore climbed the stairs and went to her room                                       she was awakened from deep slumber by kathleen who pulled and tugged at her  lenorry i thought you was dead your eyes were shut so tight declared the child breakfast is waiting did you fetch me anything  yes a new sister replied lenore dreamily  kathleens eyes opened wide where  lenore place a hand over her heart  here  oh you do look funny get up lenorry did you hear the shooting last night  instantly lenore sat up and stared  no was there any  you bet but i dont know what it was all about  lenore dispelled her dreamy state and hurriedly dressing she went down to breakfast her father and rose were still at the table  hello big eyes was his greeting  and rose not to be outdone chirped hello old sleepyhead  lenores reply lacked her usual spontaneity and she felt if she did not explain the wideness of her eyes her father did not look as if anything worried him it was a way of his however not to show stress or worry lenore ate in silence until rose left the diningroom and then she asked her father if there had been shooting  sure he replied with a broad smile jake turned his guns loose on them prowlin men last night by george you ought to have heard them run one plumped into the gate an went clear over it to fall like a log another fell into the brook an made more racket than a drownin horse but it was so dark we couldnt catch them  jake shot to frighten them inquired

like the man nash has been meetin anyway were not takin much more chance on nash i reckon its dangerous keepin him around ill have him drive me todayover to vale an then to huntington you can go along thatll be your last chance to pump him have you found out anythin  lenore told what had transpired between her and the driver andersons face turned fiery red  that aint much to help us declared angrily but it shows him up so his real names ruenke fine american name i dont think that mans a spy an a plotter an before hes another day older im goin to corner him its a sure go i cant hold jake in any longer  to lenore it was a further indication of her fathers temper that when they went down to enter the car he addressed nash in cool careless easy speech it made lenore shiver she had heard stories of her fathers early career among hard men  jake was there dry caustic with keen quiet eyes that any subtle clever man would have feared but nashs thought seemed turned mostly inward  lenore took the front seat in the car beside the driver he showed unconscious response to that action  jake arent you coming she asked of the cowboy  wal i reckon itll be sure dull fer you without me nobody to talk to while your dad fools around but i cant go me an the boys air agoin to hang some iwws this mawnin an i cant miss thet fun  jake drawled his speech and laughed lazily as he ended it he was just boasting as usual but his hawklike eyes were on nash and it was certain that nash turned pale  lenore had no reply to make her father appeared to lose patience with jake but after a moments hesitation decided not to voice it  nash was not a good nor a careful driver under any circumstances and this morning it was evident he did not have his mind on his business there were bumps in the orchard road where the irrigation ditches crossed  say you ought to be drivin a haywagon called anderson sarcastically  at vale he ordered the car stopped at the postoffice and telling lenore he might be detained a few moments he went in nash followed and presently came back with a package of letters upon taking his seat in the car he assorted the letters one of which a large thick envelope manifestly gave him excited gratification he pocketed them and turned to lenore  ah i see you get lettersfrom a woman she said pretending a poison sweetness of jealousy  certainly im not married yet he replied lenore last night  you will never be marriedto mewhile you write to other women let me see that letter let me read itall of them  no lenorenot here and dont speak so loud your father will be coming any minute lenore he suspects me and that cowboy knows things i cant go back to the ranch  oh you must come  no if you love me youve got to run off with me today  but why the hurry she appealed  its getting hot for me  what do you mean by that why dont you explain to me as long as you are so strange so mysterious how can i trust you you ask me to run off with you yet you dont put confidence in me  nash grew pale and earnest and his hands shook  but if i do confide in you then will you come with me he queried breathlessly  ill not promise maybe what you have to tell will proveyouyou dont care for me  it ll prove i do he replied passionately  then tell me lenore realized she could no longer play the part she had assumed but nash was so stirred by his own emotions so carried along in a current that he did not see the difference in her  listen i tell you its getting hot for me he whispered ive been put hereclose to andersonto find out things and to carry out orders lately ive neglected my job because i fell in love with you hes your father if i go on with plansand harm comes to himill never get you is that clear  it certainly is replied lenore and she felt a tightness at her throat  im no member of the iww he went on whatever that organization might have been last year its gone wild this year there are interests that have used the iww im only an agent and im not high up either i see what the government will do to the iww if the northwest leaves any of it but just now therere plots against a few big men like your father hes to be ruined his crops and ranches destroyed and hes to be killed its because hes so well known and has so much influence that he was marked i told you the iww was being used to make trouble they are being stirred up by agitators bribed and driven all for the purpose of making a great disorder in the northwest  germany whispered lenore  i cant say but men are all over and these men work in secret there are american citizens in the northwestone right in this valleywho have plotted to ruin your father  do you know who they are  no i do not  you are for germany of course  i have been my people are german but i was born in the us and if it suits me i will be for america if you come with me ill throw up this dirty job advise glidden to shift the plot from your father to some other man  so its glidden exclaimed lenore  nash bit his lip and for the first time looked at lenore without thinking of himself and surprise dawned in his eyes  yes glidden you saw him speak to me up in the bend the first time your father went to see dorns wheat gliddens playing the iww against itself he means to drop out of this deal with big moneynow ill save your father if youll stick to me  lenore could no longer restrain herself this man was not even big in his wickedness lenore divined that his later words held no truth  mr ruenke you are a detestable coward she said with quivering scorn i let you imagineoh i cant speak it youyou  god you fooled me he ejaculated his jaw falling in utter amaze  you were contemptibly easy youd better jump out of this car and run my father will shoot you  you deceitfulcat he cried haltingly as anger overcame his astonishment ill  andersons big bulk loomed up behind nash lenore gasped as she saw her father for his eyes were upon her and he had recognized events  say mister ruenke the postmaster says you get letters here under different names said anderson bluntly  yesiiget themfor a friend stammered the driver as his face turned white  you lyin german pup ill look over them letters andersons big hand shot out to clutch nash holding him powerless and with the other hand he searched nashs inside coat pockets to tear forth a packet of letters then anderson released him and stepped back get out of that car he thundered  nash made a slow movement as if to comply then suddenly he threw on the power the car jerked forward  anderson leaped to get one hand on the car door the other on nash he almost pulled the driver out of his seat but nash held on desperately and the car gaining momentum dragged anderson he could not get his feet up on the runningboard and suddenly he fell  lenore screamed and tore frantically at the handle of the door nash struck her jerked her back into the seat she struggled until the car shot full speed ahead then it meant death for her to leap out  sit still or youll kill yourself shouted nash hoarsely  lenore fell back almost fainting with the swift realization of what had happened     chapter ix  kurt dorn had indeed no hope of ever seeing lenore anderson again and he suffered a pang that seemed to leave his heart numb though andersons timely visit might turn out as providential as the saving rainstorm the wheat waved and rustled as if with renewed and bursting life the exquisite rainbow still shone a beautiful promise in the sky but dorn could not be happy in that moment  this day lenore anderson had seemed a bewildering fulfilment of the sweetness he had imagined was latent in her she had meant what was beyond him to understand she had gently put a hand to his lips to check the bitter words and he had dared to kiss her soft fingers the thrill the sweetness the incomprehensible and perhaps imagined response of her pulse would never leave him he watched the big car until it was out of sight  the afternoon was only half advanced and there were numberless tasks to do he decided he could think and plan while he worked as he was about to turn away he espied another automobile this one coming from the opposite direction to that anderson had taken the sight of it reminded dorn of the iww trick of throwing phosphorus cakes into the wheat he was suspicious of that car it slowed down in front of the dorn homestead turned into the yard and stopped near where dorn stood the dust had caked in layers upon it someone hailed him and asked if this was the dorn farm kurt answered in the affirmative whereupon a tall man wearing a long linen coat opened the car door to step out in the car remained the driver and another man  my name is hall announced the stranger with a pleasant manner im from washington dc i represent the government and am in the northwest in the interest of the conservation commission your name has been recommended to me as one of the progressive young wheatgrowers of the bend particularly that you are an american located in a country exceedingly important to the united states just nowa country where foreignborn people predominate  kurt somewhat startled and awed managed to give a courteous greeting to his visitor and asked him into the house but mr hall preferred to sit outdoors on the porch he threw off hat and coat and taking an easy chair he produced some cigars  will you smoke he asked offering one  kurt declined with thanks he was aware of this mans penetrating yet kindly scrutiny of him and he had begun to wonder this was no ordinary visitor  have you been drafted abruptly queried mr hall  yes sir mine was the first number replied kurt with a little pride  do you want exemption swiftly came the second query  it shocked dorn then stung him  no he said forcibly  your fathers sympathy is with germany i understand  well sir i dont know how you understand that but its trueto my regret and shame  you want to fight went on the official  i hate the idea of war but ii guess i want to fight maybe thats because im feeling scrappy over these iww tricks  dorn the iww is only one of the many phases of war that we must meet returned mr hall and then for a moment he thoughtfully drew upon his cigar  young man i like your talk and ill tell you a secret my names not hall never mind my name for you its uncle sam  whereupon with a winning and fascinating manner that seemed to kurt at once intimate and flattering he began to talk fluently of the meaning of his visit and of its cardinal importance the government was looking far ahead preparing for a tremendous and perhaps a lengthy war the food of the country must be conserved wheat was one of the most vital things in the whole world and the wheat of america was incalculably preciousonly the government knew how precious if the war was short a wheat famine would come afterward if it was long the famine would come before the war ended but it was inevitable the very outcome of the war itself depended upon wheat  the government expected a nationwide propaganda by the german interests which would be carried on secretly and boldly in every conceivable way to alienate the labor organizations to bribe or menace the harvesters to despoil crops and particularly to put obstacles in the way of the raising and harvesting the transporting and storing of wheat it would take an army to protect the nations grain  dorn was earnestly besought by this official to compass his district to find out who could be depended upon by the united states and who was antagonistic to impress upon the minds of all his neighbors the exceeding need of greater and more persistent cultivation of wheat  i accept ill do my best replied kurt grimly ill be going some the next two weeks  its deplorable that most of the wheat in this section is a failure said the official but we must make up for that next year i see you have one magnificent wheatfield but fact is i heard of that long before i got here  yes where ejaculated kurt quick to catch a significance in the others words  ive motored direct from wheatly and im sorry to say that what i have now to tell you is not pleasant your father sold this wheat for eighty thousand dollars in cash the money was seen to be paid over by a milloperator of spokane and your father is reported to be suspiciously interested in the iww men now at wheatly  oh thats awful exclaimed kurt with a groan how did you learn that  from american farmersmen that i had been instructed to approach the same as in your case the information came quite by accident however and through my inquiring about the iww  father has not been rational since the president declared war hes very old ive had trouble with him he might do anything  my boy there are multitudes of irrational men nowadays and the number is growing i advise you to go at once to wheatly and bring your father home it was openly said that he was taking risks with that large sum of money  risks why i cant understand that the wheats not harvested yet let alone hauled to town and today i learned the iww are working a trick with cakes of phosphorus to burn the wheat  kurt produced the cake of phosphorus and explained its significance to the curious official  cunning devils who but a german would ever have thought of that he exclaimed german science to such ends the germans put their supreme knowledge  i wonder what my father will say about this phosphorus trick i just wonder he loves the wheat his wheat has taken prizes at three worlds fairs maybe to see our wheat burn would untwist that twist in his brain and make him american  i doubt it only death changes the state of a real german physical moral and spiritual come ride back to glencoe with me ill drop you there you can hire a car and make wheatly before dark  kurt ran indoors thinking hard as he changed clothes he told the housekeeper to tell jerry he was called away and would be back next day putting money and a revolver in his pocket he started out but hesitated and halted he happened to think that he was a poor shot with a revolver and a fine one with a rifle so he went back for his rifle a small highpower repeating gun that he could take apart and hide under his coat when he reached the porch the official glanced from the weapon to kurts face and said with a flash of spirit  it appears that you are in earnest  i am something told me to take this responded kurt as he dismounted the rifle ive already had one runin with an iww i know tough customers when i see them these foreigners are the kind i dont want near me and if i see one trying to fire the wheat ill shoot his leg off  im inclined to think that uncle sam would not deplore your shooting a little higher dorn youre fine youre all i heard you were shake hands  kurt tingled all over as he followed the official out to the car and took the seat given him beside the driver back to glencoe was the order and then even if conversation had been in order it would scarcely have been possible that driver could drive he had no fear and he knew his car kurt could drive himself but he thought that if he had been as good as this fellow he would have chosen one of two magnificent services for the armyan ambulancedriver at the front or an aeroplane scout  on the way to glencoe several squads of idling and marching men were passed all of whom bore the earmarks of the iww sight of them made kurt hug his gun and wonder at himself never had he been a coward but neither had he been one to seek a fight this suave distinguished government official by his own significant metaphor uncle sam gone abroad to find true hearts had wrought powerfully upon kurts temper he sensed events he revolved in mind the need for him to be cool and decisive when facing the circumstances that were sure to arise  at glencoe which was reached so speedily that kurt could scarcely credit his eyes the official said youll hear from me goodby and good luck  kurt hired a young man he knew to drive him over to wheatly all the way kurt brooded about his fathers strange action the old man had left home before the rainstorm how did he know he could guarantee so many bushels of wheat as the sellingprice indicated kurt divined that his father had acted upon one of his strange weather prophecies for he must have been absolutely sure of rain to save the wheat  darkness had settled down when kurt reached wheatly and left the car at the railroad station wheatly was a fairly goodsized little town there seemed to be an unusual number of men on the dark streets dim lights showed here and there kurt passed several times near groups of conversing men but he did not hear any significant talk  most of the stores were open and well filled with men but to kurts sharp eyes there appeared to be much more gossip going on than business the town was not as slow and quiet as was usual with bend towns he listened for war talk and heard none two out of every three men who spoke in his hearing did not use the english language kurt went into the office of the first hotel he found there was no one present he glanced at an old register lying on the desk no guests had registered for several days  then kurt went out and accosted a man leaning against a hitchingrail  whats going on in this town  the man stood rather indistinctly in the uncertain light kurt however made out his eyes and they were regarding him suspiciously  nothin onusual was the reply  has harvesting begun in these parts  some barley cut but no wheat next week i reckon  hows the wheat  some bad an some good  is this town a headquarters for the iww  no but theres a big camp of iwws near here reckon youre one of them union fellers  i am not declared kurt bluntly  reckon you sure look like one with thet gun under your coat  are you going to hire iww men asked kurt ignoring the others observation  im only a farmhand was the sullen reply an i tell you i wont join no iww  kurt spared himself a moment to give this fellow a few strong proofs of the fact that any farmhand was wise to take such a stand against the labor organization leaving the fellow gaping and staring after him kurt crossed the street to enter another hotel it was more pretentious than the first with a large well lighted office there were loungers at the tables kurt walked to the desk a man leaned upon his elbows he asked kurt if he wanted a room this man evidently the proprietor was a german though he spoke english  im not sure replied kurt will you let me look at the register  the man shoved the book around kurt did not find the name he sought  my father chris dorn is in town can you tell me where ill find him  so youre young dorn replied the other with instant change to friendliness ive heard of you yes the old man is here he made a big wheat deal today hes eating his supper  kurt stepped to the door indicated and looking into the diningroom he at once espied his fathers huge head with its shock of gray hair he appeared to be in earnest colloquy with a man whose bulk matched his own kurt hesitated and finally went back to the desk  whos the big man with my father he asked  he is a big man both ways dont you know him rejoined the proprietor in a lower voice  im not sure answered kurt the lowered tone had a significance that decided kurt to admit nothing  thats neuman from ruxton one of the biggest wheat men in washington  kurt repressed a whistle of surprise neuman was andersons only rival in the great fertile valley what were neuman and chris dorn doing with their heads together  i thought he was neuman replied kurt feeling his way is he in on the big deal with father  which one queried the proprietor with shrewd eyes taking kurts measure youre in on both of course  sure i mean the wheat sale not the iww deal replied kurt he hazarded a guess with that mention of the iww no sooner had the words passed his lips than he divined he was on the track of sinister events  your father sold out to that spokane miller no neuman is not in on that  i was surprised to hear father had sold the wheat was it speculation or guarantee  old chris guaranteed sixty bushels there were friends of his here who advised against it did you have rain over there  fine the wheat will go over sixty bushels im sorry i couldnt get here sooner  when it rained you hurried over to boost the price well its too late  is glidden here queried kurt hazarding another guess  dont talk so loud warned the proprietor yes he just got here in a car with two other men hes upstairs having supper in his room  supper kurt echoed the word and averted his face to hide the leap of his blood that reminds me im hungry  he went into the big dimly lighted diningroom there was a shelf on one side as he went in and here with his back turned to the room he laid the disjointed gun and his hat several newspapers lying near attracted his eye quickly he slipped them under and around the gun and then took a seat at the nearest table a buxom german waitress came for his order he gave it while he gazed around at his grimfaced old father and the burly neuman and his ears throbbed to the beat of his blood his hand trembled on the table his thoughts flashed almost too swiftly for comprehension it took a stern effort to gain selfcontrol  evil of some nature was afoot neumans presence there was a strange disturbing fact kurt had made two guesses both alarmingly correct if he had any more illusions or hopes he dispelled them his father had been won over by this arch conspirator of the iww and despite his fathers closefistedness where money was concerned that eighty thousand dollars or part of it was in danger  kurt wondered how he could get possession of it if he could he would return it to the bank and wire a warning to the spokane buyer that the wheat was not safe he might persuade his father to turn over the amount of the debt to anderson while thinking and planning kurt kept an eye on his father and rather neglected his supper presently when old dorn and neuman rose and left the diningroom kurt followed them his father was whispering to the proprietor over the desk and at kurts touch he glared his astonishment  you here what for he demanded gruffly in german  i had to see you replied kurt in english  did it rain was the old mans second demand husky and serious  the wheat is made if we can harvest it answered kurt  the blaze of joy on old dorns face gave kurt a twinge of pain he hated to dispel it come aside here a minute he whispered and drew his father over to a corner under a lamp ive got bad news look at this he produced the cake of phosphorus careful to hide it from other curious eyes there and with swift low words he explained its meaning he expected an outburst of surprise and fury but he was mistaken  i know about that whispered his father hoarsely there wont be any thrown in my wheat  father what assurance have you of that queried kurt astounded  the old man nodded his gray head wisely he knew but he did not speak  do you think these iww plotters will spare your wheat asked kurt you are wrong they may lie to your face but theyll betray you the iww is backed byby interests that want to embarrass the government  what government  why oursthe us government  thats not my government the more its embarrassed the better it will suit me  in the stress of the moment kurt had forgotten his fathers bitter and unchangeable hatred  but youreyoure stupid he hissed passionately that government has protected you for fifty years  old dorn growled into his beard his huge oxeyes rolled kurt realized then finally how implacable and hopeless he washow utterly german then kurt importuned him to return the eighty thousand dollars to the bank until he was sure the wheat was harvested and hauled to the railroad  my wheat wont burn was old dorns stubborn reply  well then give me andersons thirty thousand ill take it to him at once our debt will be paid well have it off our minds  no hurry about that replied his father  but there is hurry returned kurt in a hot whisper anderson came to see you today he wants his money  neuman holds the small end of that debt ill pay him anderson can wait  kurt felt no amaze he expected anything but he could scarcely contain his fury how this old man his father whom he had lovedhow he had responded to the influences that must destroy him  anderson shall not wait declared kurt ive got some say in this matter ive worked like a dog in those wheatfields ive a right to demand andersons money he needs it he has a tremendous harvest on his hands  old dorn shook his huge head in somber and gloomy thought his broad face his deep eyes seemed to mask and to hide it was an expression kurt had seldom seen there but had always hated it seemed so old to kurt that alien look something not born of his time  anderson is a capitalist said chris dorn deep in his beard he seeks control of farmers and wheat in the northwest ranch after ranch hes gained by taking up and foreclosing mortgages hes against labor he grinds down the poor he cheated neuman out of a hundred thousand bushels of wheat he bought up my debt he meant to ruin me he  youre talking iww rot whispered kurt shaking with the effort to subdue his feelings anderson is fine big squarea developer of the northwest not an enemy hes our friend oh if only you had an americans eyes just for a minute father i want that money for anderson  my son i run my own business replied dorn sullenly with a pale fire in his opaque eyes youre a wild boy unfaithful to your blood youve fallen in love with an american girl anderson says he needs money with hard gloomy face the old man shook his head he thinks hell harvest again that strange shake of finality i know what i know i keep my money well have other rule i keep my money  kurt had vibrated to those most significant words and he stared speechless at his father  go home get ready for harvest suddenly ordered old dorn as if he had just awakened to the fact of kurts disobedience in lingering here  all right father replied kurt and turning on his heel he strode outdoors  when he got beyond the light he turned and went back to a position where in the dark he could watch without being seen his father and the hotel proprietor were again engaged in earnest colloquy neuman had disappeared kurt saw the huge shadow of a man pass across a drawn blind in a room upstairs then he saw smaller shadows and arms raised in vehement gesticulation the very shadows were sinister men passed in and out of the hotel once old dorn came to the door and peered all around kurt observed that there was a dark side entrance to this hotel presently neuman returned to the desk and said something to old dorn who shook his head emphatically and then threw himself into a chair in a brooding posture that kurt knew well he had seen it so often that he knew it had to do with money his father was refusing demands of some kind neuman again left the office this time with the proprietor they were absent some little time  during this period kurt leaned against a tree hidden in the shadow with keen eyes watching and with puzzled anxious mind he had determined in case his father left that office with neuman on one of those significant disappearances to slip into the hotel at the side entrance and go upstairs to listen at the door of the room with the closely drawn blind neuman returned soon with the hotel man and the two of them half led half dragged old dorn out into the street they took the direction toward the railroad kurt followed at a safe distance on the opposite side of the street soon they passed the stores with lighted windows then several dark houses and at length the railroad station perhaps they were bound for the train kurt heard rumbling in the distance but they went beyond the station across the track and turned to the right  kurt was softfooted and keeneyed he just kept the dim shadows in range they were heading for some freightcars that stood upon a sidetrack the dark figures disappeared behind them then one figure reappeared coming back kurt crouched low this man passed within a few yards of kurt and he was whispering to himself after he was safely out of earshot kurt stole on stealthily until he reached the end of the freightcars here he paused listening he thought he heard low voices but he could not see the men he was following no doubt they were waiting in the secluded gloom for the other men apparently necessary for that secret conference kurt had sensed this event and he had determined to be present he tried not to conjecture it was best for him to apply all his faculties to the task of slipping unseen and unheard close to these men who had involved his father in some dark plot  not long after kurt hid himself on the other side of the freightcar he heard softpadded footsteps and subdued voices dark shapes appeared to come out of the gloom they passed him he distinguished low guttural voices speaking german these men three in number were scarcely out of sight when kurt laid his rifle on the projecting shelf of the freightcar and followed them  presently he came to deep shadow where he paused low voices drew him on again then a light made him thrill now and then the light appeared to be darkened by moving figures a dark object loomed up to cut off kurts view it was a pile of railroad ties and beyond it loomed another stealing along these he soon saw the light again quite close by its glow he recognized his fathers huge frame back to him and the burly neuman on the other side and glidden whose dark face was working as he talked these three were sitting evidently on a flat pile of ties and the other two men stood behind kurt could not make out the meaning of the low voices pressing closer to the freightcar he cautiously and noiselessly advanced  glidden was importuning with expressive hands and swift low utterance his face gleamed dark hard strong intensely strung with corded quivering muscles with eyes apparently green orbs of fire he spoke in german  kurt dared not go closer unless he wanted to be discovered and not yet was he ready for that he might hear some word to help explain his fathers strange significant intimations about anderson  musthavemoney glidden was saying to kurts eyes treachery gleamed in that working face neuman bent over to whisper gruffly in dorns ear one of the silent men standing rubbed his hands together old dorns head was bowed then glidden spoke so low and so swiftly that kurt could not connect sentences but with mounting blood he stood transfixed and horrified to gather meaning from word on word until he realized andersons doom with other rich men of the northwest was sealedthat there were to be burnings of wheatfields and of storehouses and of freighttrainsdestruction everywhere  i give money said old dorn and with heavy movement he drew from inside his coat a large package wrapped in newspaper he laid it before him in the light and began to unwrap it soon there were disclosed two bundles of billsthe eighty thousand dollars  kurt thrilled in all his being his poor father was being misled and robbed a melancholy flash of comfort came to kurt then at sight of gliddens hungry eyes and working face and clutching hands kurt pulled his hat far down drew his revolver and leaped forward with a yell hands up  he discharged the revolver right in the faces of the stunned plotters and snatching up the bundle of money he leaped over the light knocking one of the men down and was gone into the darkness without having slowed in the least his swift action  wheeling round the end of the freightcar he darted back risking a hard fall in the darkness and ran along the several cars to the first one where he grasped his rifle and kept on he heard his fathers roar like that of a mad bull and shrill yells from the other men kurt laughed grimly they would never catch him in the dark while he ran he stuffed the money into his inside coat pockets beyond the railroad station he slowed down to catch his breath his breast was heaving his pulse hammering and his skin was streaming the excitement was the greatest under which he had ever labored  nowwhat shalli do he panted a freighttrain was lumbering toward him and the headlight was almost at the station the train appeared to be going slowly through without stopping kurt hurried on down the track a little farther then he waited he would get on that train and make his way somehow to ruxton there to warn anderson of the plot against his life     chapter x  kurt rode to adrian on that freight and upon arriving in the yards there he jumped off only to mount another headed south he meant to be traveling while it was dark no passengertrains ran at night and he wanted to put as much distance between him and wheatly as possible before daylight  he had piled into an open boxcar it was empty at least of freight and the floor appeared to have a thin covering of hay the train gathering headway made a rattling rolling roar kurt hesitated about getting up and groping back in the pitchblack corners of the car he felt that it contained a presence besides his own and suddenly he was startled by an object blacker than the shadow that sidled up close to him kurt could not keep the cold chills from chasing up and down his back the object was a man who reached for kurt and felt of him with a skinny hand  iww he whispered hoarsely in kurts ear  yes replied kurt  was that adrian where you got on  it sure was answered kurt with grim humor  than youre the feller  sure replied kurt it was evident that he had embarked upon an adventure  when do we stall this freight  not while were on it you can gamble  other dark forms sidled out of the gloomy depths of that cavernlike corner and drew close to kurt he realized that he had fallen in with iww men who apparently had taken him for an expected messenger or leader he was importuned for tobacco drink and money and he judged that his begging companions consisted of an american tramp an austrian a negro and a german fine society to fall into that eighty thousand dollars became a tremendous burden  how many men on this freight queried kurt thinking he could ask questions better than answer them and he was told there were about twentyfive all of whom expected money at this information kurt rather closely pressed his hand upon the revolver in his side coat pocket by asking questions and making judicious replies he passed what he felt was the dark mark in that mixed company of iww men and at length one by one they melted away to their warmer corners leaving kurt by the door he did not mind the cold he wanted to be where at the first indication of a stop he could jump off the train  with his hand on his gun and hugging the bulging coat pockets close to him kurt settled himself for what he believed would be interminable hours he strained eyes and ears for a possible attack from the riffraff iww men hidden there in the car and that was why perhaps that it seemed only a short while until the train bumped and slowed preparatory to stopping the instant it was safe kurt jumped out and stole away in the gloom a fence obstructed further passage he peered around to make out that he was in a road thereupon he hurried along it until he was out of hearing of the train there was light in the east heralding a dawn that kurt surely would welcome he sat down to wait and addressed to his bewildered judgment a query as to whether or not he ought to keep on carrying the burdensome rifle it was not only heavy but when daylight came it might attract attention and his bulging coat would certainly invite curiosity he was in a predicament nevertheless he decided to hang on to the rifle  he almost fell asleep waiting there with his back against a fencepost the dawn came and then the rosy sunrise and he discovered not half a mile away a goodsized town where he believed he surely could hire an automobile  waiting grew to be so tedious that he decided to risk the early hour and proceeded toward the town upon the outskirts he met a farmer boy who in reply to a question said that the town was connell kurt found another early riser in the person of a blacksmith who evidently was a yankee and proud of it he owned a car that he was willing to hire out on good security kurt satisfied him on that score and then proceeded to ask how to get across the copper river and into golden valley the highway followed the railroad from that town to kahlotus and there crossed a big trunkline railroad to turn south toward the river  in half an hour during which time kurt was enabled to breakfast the car was ready it was a large car rather ancient and the worse for wear but its owner assured kurt that it would take him where he wanted to go and he need not be afraid to drive fast with that inspiring knowledge kurt started off  before ten oclock kurt reached kilo far across the copper river with the blue mountains in sight and from there less confusing directions to follow he had been lucky he had passed the wreck of the freighttrain upon which he had ridden from adrian his car had been surrounded by rough men and only quick wits saved him at least delay he had been hailed by more than one group of tramping iww men and he had passed camps and freightyards where idlers were congregated and lastly he had seen far across the valley a pall of smoke from forest fire  he was going to reach many waters in time to warn anderson and that fact gave him strange exultation when it was assured and he had the eighty thousand dollars deposited in a bank he could feel that his gray gloomy future would have several happy memories how would lenore anderson feel toward a man who had saved her father the thought was too rich too sweet for kurt to dwell upon  before noon kurt began to climb gradually up off the wonderfully fertile bottomlands where the endless orchards and boundless gardens delighted his eye and the towns grew fewer and farther between kurt halted at huntington for water and when he was about ready to start a man rushed out of a store glanced hurriedly up and down the almost deserted street and espying kurt ran to him  message over phone iww hell to pay he cried excitedly  whats up tell me the message replied kurt calmly  it just comefrom vale anderson the big rancher he phoned to send men out on all roadsto stop his car his daughters in it shes been made off with iwws  kurts heart leaped the bursting blood burned through him and receded to leave him cold tingling anything might happen to him this day he reached inside the seat to grasp the disjointed rifle and three swift movements seemed to serve to unwrap it and put the pieces together  what else did anderson say he asked sharply  that likely the car would head for the hills where the iwws are camped  what road from here leads that way  take the lefthand road at the end of town replied the man more calmly ten miles down youll come to a fork theres where the iwws will turn off to go up into the foothills anderson just phoned you can head off his car if its on the hill road but youll have to drive do you know andersons car dont you want men with you  no time called kurt as he leaped into the seat and jammed on the power  ill send cars all over shouted the man as kurt whirred away  kurts eyes and hands and feet hurt with the sudden intensity of strain all his nervous force seemed set upon the one great task of driving and guiding that car at the limit of its speed huntington flashed behind two indistinct streaks of houses an open road slightly rising stretched ahead the wind pressed so hard that he could scarcely breathe the car gave forth a humming roar  kurts heart labored swollen and tight high in his breast and his thoughts were swift tumultuous an agony of dread battled with a dominating but strange certainty he felt belief in his luck circumstances one by one had led to this drive and in every one passed by he felt the direction of chance  he sped by fields of wheat a wagon that he missed by an inch some stragglers on the road and then far ahead he saw a signpost of the forks as he neared it he gradually shut off the power to stop at the crossroads there he got out to search for fresh car tracks turning up to the right there were none if andersons car was coming on that road he would meet it  kurt started again but at reasonable speed while his eyes were sharp on the road ahead it was empty it sloped down for a long way and made a wide curve to the right along the base of hilly pastureland and then again turned and just as kurts keen gaze traveled that far a big automobile rounded the bend coming fast he recognized the red color the shape of the car  andersons he cried with that same lift of his heart that bursting gush of blood no dream i see it and ill stop it  the advantage was all his he would run along at reasonable speed choose a narrow place stop his car so as to obstruct the road and get out with his rifle  it seemed a long stretch down that long slope and his car crept along while the other gradually closed the gap slower and slower kurt ran then turned half across the road and stopped when he stepped out the other car was two hundred yards or more distant kurt saw when the driver slackened his speed there appeared to be only two people in the car both in front but kurt could not be sure of that until it was only fifty yards away  then he swung out his rifle and waved for the driver to stop but he did not stop kurt heard a scream he saw a white face he saw the driver swing his hand across that white face dashing it back  halt yelled kurt at the top of his lungs  but the driver hunched down and put on the power the red car leaped as it flashed by kurt recognized nash and andersons daughter she looked terrified kurt dared not shoot for fear of hitting the girl nash swerved took the narrow space left him smashing the right front wheel of kurts car and got by  kurt stepped aside and took a quick shot at the tire of nashs left hind wheel he missed his heart sank and he was like ice as he risked another the little highpower bullet struck and blew the tire off the wheel nashs car lurched skidded into the bank not thirty yards away  with a bound kurt started for it and he was there when nash had twisted out of his seat and over the door  far enough dont move ordered kurt presenting the rifle  nash was ghastly white with hunted eyes and open mouth and his hands shook  oh itskurt dorn cried a broken voice  kurt saw the girl fumble with the door on her side open it and stagger out of his sight then she reappeared round the car bareheaded disheveled white as chalk with burning eyes and bleeding lips she gazed at kurt as if to make sure of her deliverance  miss andersonif hes harmed you broke out kurt hoarsely  oh dont kill him he hasnt touched me she replied wildly  but your lips are bleeding  are they she put a trembling hand to them hehe struck me thats nothing but youyou have saved mefrom god only knows what  i have from him demanded kurt what is he  hes a german returned lenore and red burned out of the white of her cheeks secret agentiww plotter against my fathers life oh he knocked father off the cardragged him he ran the car awaywith meforced me backhe struck me oh if i were a man  nash responded with a passion that made his face drip with sweat and distort into savage fury of defeat and hate  you twofaced cat he hissed you made love to me you fooled me you let me  shut up thundered kurt you german dog i cant murder you because im american do you get that but ill beat you within an inch of your life  as kurt bent over to lay down the rifle nash darted a hand into the seat for weapon of some kind but kurt in a rush knocked him over the front guard nash howled he scrambled up with bloody mouth kurt was on him again  take that cried kurt low and hard as he swung his arm the big fist that had grasped so many plowhandles took nash full on that bloody mouth and laid him flat come on german get out of the trench  like a dog nash thrashed and crawled scraping his hands in the dirt to jump up and fling a rock that kurt ducked by a narrow margin nash followed it swinging wildly beating at his adversary  passion long contained burst in kurt he tasted the salt of his own blood where he had bitten his lips nash showed as in a red haze kurt had to get his hands on this german and when he did it liberated a strange and terrible joy in him no weapon would have sufficed hardly aware of nashs blows kurt tore at him swung and choked him bore him down on the bank and there beat him into a sodden bloodyfaced heap  only then did a cry of distress seemingly from far off pierce kurts ears miss anderson was pulling at him with frantic hands  oh dont kill him please dont kill him she was crying kurtfor my sake dont kill him  that last poignant appeal brought kurt to his senses he let go of nash he allowed the girl to lead him back panting hard he tried to draw a deep full breath  oh he doesnt move whispered lenore with wide eyes on nash  miss andersonhes noteven insensible panted kurt but hes lickedgood and hard  the girl leaned against the side of the car with a hand buried in her heaving breast she was recovering the gray shade left her face her eyes still wide and dark and beginning to glow with softer emotions were upon kurt  youyou were the one to come she murmured i prayed i was terribly frightened ruenke was taking meto the iww camp up in the hills  ruenke queried kurt  yes thats his german name  kurt awoke to the exigencies of the situation searching in the car he found a leather belt with this he securely bound ruenkes hands behind his back then rolled him down into the road  my first german prisoner said kurt half seriously now miss anderson we must be doing things we dont want to meet a lot of iwws out here my car is out of commission i hope yours is not broken  kurt got into the car and found to his satisfaction that it was not damaged so far as runninggear was concerned after changing the ruined tire he backed down the road and turned to stop near where ruenke lay opening the rear door kurt picked him up as if he had been a sack of wheat and threw him into the car next he secured the rifle that had been such a burden and had served him so well in the end  get in miss anderson he said and show me where to drive you home  she got in beside him making a grimace as she saw ruenke lying behind her kurt started and ran slowly by the damaged car  he knocked a wheel off ill have to send back  oh i thought it was all over when we hit said the girl  kurt experienced a relaxation that was weakening he could hardly hold the wheel and his mood became one of exaltation  father suspected this ruenke went on lenore but he wanted to find out things from him and ii undertookto twist mr germany round my finger i made a mess of it he lied i didnt make love to him but i listened to his lovemaking and arrogant german lovemaking it was im afraid i made eyes at him and let him believe i was smitten oh and all for nothing im ashamed but he lied  her confidence at once pathetic and humorous and contemptuous augmented kurts homeric mood he understood that she would not even let him for a moment have a wrong impression of her  it must have been hard agreed kurt didnt you find out anything at all  not much she replied then she put a hand on his sleeve your knuckles are all bloody  so they are i got that punching our german friend  oh how you did beat him she cried i had to look my ire was up too it wasnt very womanlyof methat i gloried in the sight  but you cried outyou pulled me away exclaimed kurt  that was because i was afraid youd kill him she replied  kurt swerved his glance for an instant to her face it was at once flushed and pale with the deep blue of downcast eyes shadowy through her long lashes exceedingly sweet and beautiful to kurts sight he bent his glance again to the road ahead miss anderson felt kindly and gratefully toward him as was of course natural but she was somehow different from what she had seemed upon the other occasions he had seen her kurts heart was full to bursting  i might have killed him he said im gladyou stopped me thatthat frenzy of mine seemed to be the breaking of a dam i have been dammed up within something had to break ive been unhappy for a long time  i saw that what about she replied  the war and what its done to father were estranged i hate everything german i loved the farm my chance in life is gone the wheat debtthe worry about the iwwand thats not all  again she put a gentle hand on his sleeve and left it there for a moment the touch thrilled all through kurt  im sorry your position is sad but maybe it is not utterly hopeless youyoull come back after the war  i dont know that i want to come back he said for thenitd be just as badworse miss anderson it wont hurt to tell you the truth a year agothat first time i saw youi fell in love with you i thinkwhen im awayover in franceid like to feel that you know it cant hurt you and itll be sweet to me i fought against thethe madness but fate was against me i saw you again and it was all over with me  he paused catching his breath she was perfectly quiet he looked on down the winding road there were dustclouds in the distance  im afraid i grew bitter and moody he went on but the last fortyeight hours have changed me forever i found that my poor old dad had been won over by these unscrupulous german agents of the iww but i saved his name ive got the money he took for the wheat we may never harvest but if we do harvest i can pay all our debt then i learned of a plot to ruin your fatherto kill him i was on my way to many waters i can warn him last of all i have saved you  the little hand dropped away from his coat sleeve a soft halfsmothered cry escaped her it seemed to him she was about to weep in her exceeding pity  miss anderson iid rather not haveyou pity me  mr dorn i certainly dont pity you she replied with an unexpected strange tone it was full it seemed to ring in his ears  i know there never was and never could be any hope for me ii  oh you know that murmured the soft strange voice  but kurt could not trust his ears and he had to make haste to terminate the confession into which his folly and emotion had betrayed him he scarcely heard her words  yes i told you why i wanted you to know and now forget thatand when im goneif you think of me ever let it be about how much better it made meto have all this good luckto help your father and to save you  the dustcloud down the road came from a string of automobiles flying along at express speed kurt saw them with relief  here come the cars on your trail he called out your father will be in one of them                                       kurt opened the door of the car and stepped down he could not help his importance or his pride anderson who came running between two cars that had stopped abreast was coatless and hatless covered with dust pale and fireeyed  mr anderson your daughter is safeunharmed kurt assured him  my girl cried the father huskily and hurried to where she leaned out of her seat  all right dad she cried as she embraced him only a little shaky yet  it was affecting for dorn to see that meeting and through it to share something of its meaning andersons thick neck swelled and colored and his utterance was unintelligible his daughter loosened her arm from round him and turned her face toward kurt then he imagined he saw two blue stars sweetly strangely shining upon him  father it was our friend from the bend she said he happened along  anderson suddenly changed to the cool smiling man kurt remembered  howdy kurt he said and crushed kurts hand whatd you do to him  kurt made a motion toward the back of the car then anderson looked over the seats with that he opened the door and in one powerful haul he drew ruenke sliding out into the road ruenkes bruised and bloody face was uppermost a rather gruesome sight anderson glared down upon him while men from the other cars crowded around ruenkes eyes resembled those of a cornered rat andersons jaw bulged his big hands clenched  bill you throw this fellow in your car and land him in jail ill make a charge against him said the rancher  mr anderson i can save some valuable time interposed kurt ive got to return a car i broke down and theres my wheat will you have one of these men drive me back  sure but wont you come home with us said anderson  id like to but i must get home replied kurt please let me speak a few words for your ear alone he drew anderson aside and briefly told about the eighty thousand dollars threw back his coat to show the bulging pockets then he asked andersons advice  id deposit the money an wire the spokane miller returned the rancher i know him hell leave the money in the bank till your wheat is safe go to the national bank in kilo mention my name  then kurt told anderson of the plot against his fortunes and his life  neuman iww german intrigue growled the rancher all in the same class dorn im forewarned an thats forearmed ill beat this outfit at their own game  they returned to andersons car kurt reached inside for his rifle  arent you going home with us asked the girl  why miss anderson iim sorry iid love to see many waters floundered kurt but i cant go now theres no need i must hurry back toto my troubles  i wanted to tell you somethingat home she returned shyly  tell me now said kurt  she gave him such a glance as he had never received in his life kurt felt himself as wax before those blue eyes she wanted to thank him that would be sweet but would only make his ordeal harder he steeled himself  you wont come she asked and her smile was wistful  nothank you ever so much  will you come to see me before youyou go to war  ill try  but you must promise youve done so much for me and my father ii want you to come to see meat my home  then ill come he replied  anderson clambered into the car beside his daughter and laid his big hands on the wheel  sure hell come or well go after him he declared heartily so long son     chapter xi  late in the forenoon of the next day kurt dorn reached home a hot harvest wind breathed off the wheatfields it swelled his heart to see the change in the color of that section of bluestemthe gold had a tinge of rich ripe brown  kurts father awaited him a haggard gloomyfaced man unkempt and holloweyed  was it you who robbed me he shouted hoarsely  yes replied kurt he had caught the eager hope and fear in the old mans tone kurt expected that confession would bring on his fathers terrible fury a mood to dread but old dorn showed immense relief he sat down in his relaxation from what must have been intense strain kurt saw a weariness a shade in the gray lined face that had never been there before  what did you do with the money asked the old man  i banked it in kilo replied kurt then i wired your miller in spokane so youre safe if we can harvest the wheat  old dorn nodded thoughtfully there had come a subtle change in him presently he asked kurt if men had been hired for the harvest  no ive not seen any i would trust replied kurt and then he briefly outlined andersons plan to insure a quick and safe harvesting of the grain old dorn objected to this on account of the expense kurt argued with him and patiently tried to show him the imperative need of it dorn apparently was not to be won over however he was remarkably mild in comparison with what kurt had expected  father do you realize now that the men you were dealing with at wheatly are dishonest i mean with you they would betray you  old dorn had no answer for this evidently he had sustained some kind of shock that he was not willing to admit  look here father went on kurt in slow earnestness he spoke in english because nothing would make him break his word and ever again speak a word of german and his father was not quick to comprehend english cant you see that the iww mean to cripple us wheat farmers this harvest  no replied old dorn stubbornly  but they do they dont want work if they accept work it is for a chance to do damage all this iww talk about more wages and shorter hours is deceit they make a bold face of discontent that is all a lie the iww is out to ruin the great wheatfields and the great lumber forests of the northwest  i do not believe that declared his father stoutly what for  kurt meant to be careful of that subject  no matter what for it does not make any difference what its for weve got to meet it to save our wheat now wont you believe me wont you let me manage the harvest  i will not believe replied old dorn stubbornly not about my wheat i know they mean to destroy they are against rich men like anderson but not me or my wheat  there is where you are wrong ill prove it in a very few days but in that time i can prepare for them and outwit them will you let me  go ahead replied old dorn gruffly  it was a concession that kurt was amazed and delighted to gain and he set about at once to act upon it he changed his clothes and satisfied his hunger then saddling his horse he started out to visit his farmer neighbors  the day bade fair to be rich in experience jerry the foreman was patrolling his long beat up and down the highway jerry carried a shotgun and looked like a sentry the men under him were on the other side of the section of wheat and the ground was so rolling that they could not be seen from the highway jerry was unmistakably glad and relieved to see kurt  some goinson he declared with a grin since you left theres been one hundred and sixteen iww tramps along this here road  have you had any trouble inquired kurt  wal i reckon it wasnt trouble but every time i took a peg at some sneak i sort of broke out sweatin cold  you shot at them  sure i shot when i seen any loafin along in the dark two of them shot back at me an after thet i wasnt particular to aim high reckon im about dead for sleep  ill relieve you tonight replied kurt jerry doesnt the wheat look great  wal i reckon an walkin along here when its quiet an no wind blowin i can just hear the wheat crack its gittin ripe fast an sure the biggest crop we ever raised but im tellin youwhen i think how well ever harvest it my insides just sinks like lead  kurt then outlined andersons plan which was received by the foreman with eager approval and the assurance that the neighbor farmers would rally to his call  kurt found his nearest neighbor olsen cutting a thin scarcely ripe barley olsen was running a new mccormack harvester and appeared delighted with the machine but cast down by the grain prospects he did not intend to cut his wheat at all it was a dead loss  two sectionstwelve hundred an eighty acres he repeated gloomily an the third bad year dorn i cant pay the interest to my bank  olsens sundried and windcarved visage was as hard and rugged and heroic as this desert that had resisted him for years kurt saw under the lines and the bronze all the toil and pain and unquenchable hope that had made olsen a type of the men who had cultivated this desert of wheat  ill give you five hundred dollars to help me harvest said kurt bluntly and briefly stated his plan  olsen whistled he complimented andersons shrewd sense he spoke glowingly of that magnificent section of wheat that absolutely must be saved he promised kurt every horse and every man on his farm but he refused the five hundred dollars  oh say youll have to accept it declared kurt  youve done me good turns asserted olsen  but nothing like this why this will be a rush job with all the men and horses and machines and wagons i can get itll cost tenfifteen thousand dollars to harvest that section even at that and paying anderson well clear twenty thousand or more olsen youve got to take the money  all right if you insist im needin it bad enough replied olsen  further conversation with olsen gleaned the facts that he was the only farmer in their immediate neighborhood who did not have at least a little grain worth harvesting but the amount was small and would require only slight time olsen named farmers that very likely would not take kindly to dorns proposition and had best not be approached the majority however would stand by him irrespective of the large wage offered because the issue was one to appeal to the pride of the bend farmers olsen appeared surprisingly well informed upon the tactics of the iww and predicted that they would cause trouble but be run out of the country he made the shrewd observation that when even those farmers who sympathized with germany discovered that their wheatfields were being menaced by foreign influences and protected by the home government they would experience a change of heart olsen said the war would be a good thing for the united states because they would win it and during the winning would learn and suffer and achieve much  kurt rode away from olsen in a more thoughtful frame of mind how different and interesting the points of view of different men olsen had never taken the time to become a naturalized citizen of the united states there had never been anything to force him to do it but his understanding of the worth of the united states and his loyalty to it were manifest in his love for his wheatlands in fact they were inseparable probably there were millions of pioneers emigrants aliens all over the country who were like olsen who needed the fire of the crucible to mold them into a unity with americans of such americans were molded                                       kurt rode all day and when late that night he got home weary and sore and choked he had enlisted the services of thirtyfive farmers to help him harvest the now famous section of wheat  his father had plainly doubted the willingness of these neighbors to abandon their own labors for the bend exacted toil for every hour of every season whether rich or poor in yield likewise he was plainly moved by the facts his seamed and shaded face of gloom had a moment of light  they will make short work of this harvest he said thoughtfully  i should say so retorted kurt well harvest and haul that grain to the railroad in just three days  impossible ejaculated dorn  youll see declared kurt youll see whos managing this harvest  he could not restrain his little outburst of pride for the moment the great overhanging sense of calamity that for long had haunted him faded into the background it did seem sure that they would save this splendid yield of wheat how much that meant to kurtin freedom from debt in natural love of the fruition of harvest in the loyalty to his government he realized how strange and strong was the need in him to prove he was american to the very core of his heart he did not yet understand that incentive but he felt it  after eating dinner kurt took his rifle and went out to relieve jerry  only a few more days and nights he exclaimed to his foreman then well have all the harvesters in the country right in our wheat  wal a hell of a lot can happen before then declared jerry pessimistically  kurt was brought back to realities rather suddenly but questioning jerry did not elicit any new or immediate cause for worry jerry appeared tired out  you go get some sleep said kurt  all right bills been dividin this night watch with me i reckon hell be out when he wakes up replied jerry and trudged away  kurt shouldered his rifle and slowly walked along the road with a strange sense that he was already doing army duty in protecting property which was at once his own and his countrys  the night was dark cool and quiet the heavens were starry bright a faint breeze brought the tiny crackling of the wheat from far distant came the bay of a hound the road stretched away pale and yellow into the gloom in the silence and loneliness and darkness in all around him and far across the dry whispering fields there was an invisible presence that had its affinity in him hovered over him shadowless and immense and waved in the bursting wheat it was life he felt the wheat ripening he felt it in reawakened tenderness for his old father and in the stir of memory of lenore anderson the past active and important hours had left little room for thought of her  but now she came back to him a spirit in keeping with his steps a shadow under the stars a picture of sweet wonderful young womanhood his whole relation of thought toward her had undergone some marvelous change the most divine of gifts had been granted himan opportunity to save her from harm perhaps from death he had served her father how greatly he could not tell but if measured by the gratitude in her eyes it would have been infinite he recalled that expressionblue warm soft and indescribably strange with its unuttered hidden meaning it was allsatisfying for him to realize that she had been compelled to give him a separate and distinct place in her mind he must stand apart from all others she knew it had been his fortune to preserve her happiness and the happiness that she must be to sisters and mother and that some day she would bestow upon some lucky man they would all owe it to him and lenore anderson knew he loved her  these things had transformed his relation of thought toward her he had no regret no jealousy no fear even the pang of suppressed and overwhelming love had gone with his confession  but he did remember her presence her beauty her intent blue glance and the faint dreaming smile of her lipsremembered them with a thrill and a wave of emotion and a contraction of his heart he had promised to see her once more to afford her the opportunity no doubt to thank him to try to make him see her gratitude he would go but he wished it need not be he asked no more and seeing her again might change his fulness of joy to something of pain  so kurt trod the long road in the darkness and silence pausing and checking his dreams now and then to listen and to watch he heard no suspicious sounds nor did he meet any one the night was melancholy with a hint of fall in its cool breath  soon he would be walking a beat in one of the trainingcamps with a buglecall in his ears and the turmoil of thousands of soldiers in the making around him soon too he would be walking the deck of a transport looking back down the moonblanched wake of the ship toward home listening to the mysterious moan of the ocean and then soon feeling under his feet the soil of a foreign country with hideous and incomparable war shrieking its shell furies and its man anguish all about him but no matter how far away he ever got he knew lenore anderson would be with him as she was there on that dim lonely starlit country road  and in these long hours of his vigil kurt dorn divined a relation between his love for lenore anderson and a terrible need that had grown upon him a need of his heart and his soul more than he needed her if even in his wildest dreams he had permitted himself visions of an earthly paradise he needed to prove to his blood and his spirit that he was actually and truly american he had no doubt of his intelligence his reason his choice the secret lay hidden in the depths of him and he knew it came from the springs of the mother who had begotten him his mother had given him birth and by every tie he was mostly hers  kurt had been in college during the first year of the world war and his name his fair hair and complexion his fluency in german and his remarkable efficiency in handicrafts had opened him to many a hint many a veiled sarcasm that had stung him like a poison brand there was injustice in all this war spirit it changed the minds of men and women he had not doubted himself until those terrible scenes with his father and though he had reacted to them as an american he had felt the drawing burning blood tie he hated everything german and he knew he was wrong in doing so he had clear conception in his mind of the difference between the german war motives and means and those of the other nations  kurts problem was to understand himself his great fight was with his own soul his material difficulties and his despairing love had suddenly been transformed so that they had lent his spirit wings how many poor boys and girls in america must be helplessly divided between parents and country how many faithful and blind parents obedient to the laws of mind and heart set for all time must see a favorite son go out to fight against all they had held sacred  that was all bad enough but kurt had more to contend with no illusions had he of a chastened german spirit a clarified german mind an unbrutalized german heart kurt knew his father what would change his father nothing but death death for himself or death for his only son kurt had an incalculable call to prove forever to himself that he was free he had to spill his own blood to prove himself or he had to spill that of an enemy and he preferred that it should be his own but that did not change a vivid and terrible picture which haunted him at times he saw a dark wide and barren shingle of the world a desert of desolation made by man where strange windy shrieks and thundering booms and awful cries went up in the night and where drifting palls of smoke made starless sky and bursts of reddish fires made hell  suddenly kurts slow pacing along the road was halted as was the trend of his thought he was not sure he had heard a sound but he quivered all over the night was far advanced now the wind was almost still the wheat was smooth and dark as the bosom of a resting sea kurt listened he imagined he heard far away the faint roar of an automobile but it might have been a train on the railroad sometimes on still nights he caught sounds like that  then a swish in the wheat a soft thud very low unmistakably came to kurts ear he listened turning his ear to the wind presently he heard it againa sound relating both to wheat and earth in a hot flash he divined that some one had thrown fairly heavy bodies into the wheatfields phosphorus cakes kurt held his breath while he peered down the gloomy road his heart pounding his hands gripping the rifle and when he descried a dim form stealthily coming toward him he yelled halt  instantly the form wavered moved swiftly with quick pad of footfalls kurt shot oncetwicethree timesand aimed as best he could to hit the form either fell or went on out of sight in the gloom kurt answered the excited shouts of his men calling them to come across to him then he went cautiously down the road peering on the ground for a dark form but he failed to find it and presently had to admit that in the dark his aim had been poor bill came out to relieve kurt and together they went up and down the road for a mile without any glimpse of a skulking form it was almost daylight when kurt went home to get a few hours sleep     chapter xii  next day was one of the rare blisteringhot days with a furnace wind that roared over the wheatfields the sky was steely and the sun like copper it was a day which would bring the wheat to a head  at breakfast jerry reported that fresh auto tracks had been made on the road during the night and that dust and wheat all around the great field showed a fresh tramping  kurt believed a deliberate and particular attempt had been made to insure the destruction of the dorn wheatfield and he ordered all hands out to search for the dangerous little cakes of phosphorus  it was difficult to find them the wheat was almost as high as a mans head and very thick to force a way through it without tramping it down took care and time besides the soil was soft and the agents who had perpetrated this vile scheme had perfectly matched the color kurt almost stepped on one of the cakes before he saw it his men were very slow in finding any but kurts father seemed to walk fatally right to them for in a short hundred yards he found three they caused a profound change in this gloomy man not a word did he utter but he became animated by a tremendous energy  the search was discouraging it was like hunting for dynamite bombs that might explode at any moment all kurts dread of calamity returned fourfold the intense heat of the day that would ripen the wheat to bursting would likewise sooner or later ignite the cakes of phosphorus and when jerry found a cake far inside the field away from the road showing that powerful had been the arm that had thrown it there and how impossible it would be to make a thorough search kurt almost succumbed to discouragement still he kept up a frenzied hunting and inspired the laborers to do likewise  about ten oclock an excited shout from bill drew kurts attention and he ran along the edge of the field bill was sweaty and black yet through it all kurt believed he saw the man was pale he pointed with shaking hand toward olsens hill  kurt vibrated to a shock he saw a long circular yellow column rising from the hill slanting away on the strong wind  dust he cried aghast  smoke replied bill hoarsely  the catastrophe had fallen olsens wheat was burning kurt experienced a profound sensation of sadness what a pity the burning of wheatthe destruction of breadwhen part of the world was starving tears dimmed his eyes as he watched the swelling column of smoke  bill was cursing and kurt gathered that the farmhand was predicting fires all around this was inevitable but it meant no great loss for most of the wheatgrowers whose yield had failed for kurt and his father if fire got a hold in their wheat it meant ruin kurts sadness was burned out by a slow and growing rage  bill go hitch up to the big mower ordered kurt well have to cut all around our field bring drinking water and whatever you can lay a hand on  anything to fight fire  bill ran thumping away over the clods then it happened that kurt looked toward his father the old man was standing with his arms aloft his face turned toward the burning wheat and he made a tragic figure that wrung kurts heart  jerry came running up fire fire olsens burnin look by all thets dirty them iwws hev done it kurt were in fer hell thet winds blowin straight this way  jerry well fight till we drop replied kurt tell the men and father to keep on searching for phosphorus cakes jerry you keep to the high ground watch for fires starting on our land if you see one yell for us and make for it wheat burns slow till it gets started we can put out fires if were quick  kurt there aint no chance on earth fer us yelled jerry pale with anger his big red hands worked if fire starts weve got to hev a lot of men by gawd if i aint mad  dont quit jerry said kurt fiercely you never can tell it looks hopeless but well never give up hustle now  jerry shuffled off as old dorn came haltingly as if stunned toward kurt but kurt did not want to face his father at that moment he needed to fight to keep up his own courage  never mind that yelled kurt pointing at olsens hill keep looking for those damned pieces of phosphorus  with that kurt dove into the wheat and sweeping wide his arms to make a passage he strode on his eyes bent piercingly upon the ground close about him he did not penetrate deeper into the wheat from the road than the distance he estimated a strong arm could send a stone almost at once his keen sight was rewarded he found a cake of phosphorus half buried in the soil it was dry hard and hot either from the sun or its own generating power that inspired kurt he hurried on long practice enabled him to slip through the wheat as a barefoot country boy could run through the cornfields and his passion gave him the eyes of a hunting hawk sweeping down over the grass to and fro he passed within the limits he had marked oblivious to time and heat and effort and covering that part of the wheatfield bordering the road he collected twentyseven cakes of phosphorus the last few of which were so hot they burnt his hands  then he had to rest he appeared as wet as if he had been plunged into water his skin burned his eyes pained his breast heaved panting and spent he lay along the edge of the wheat with closed eyelids and lax muscles  when he recovered he rose and went back along the road the last quarter of the immense wheatfield lay upon a slope of a hill and kurt had to mount this before he could see the valley from the summit he saw a sight that caused him to utter a loud exclamation many columns of smoke were lifting from the valley and before him the sky was darkened olsens hill was as if under a cloud no flames showed anywhere but in places the line of smoke appeared to be approaching  its a thousand to one against us he said bitterly and looked at his watch he was amazed to see that three hours had passed since he had given orders to the men he hurried back to the house no one was there except the old servant who was wringing her hands and crying that the house would burn throwing the cakes of phosphorus into a wateringtrough kurt ran into the kitchen snatched a few biscuits and then made for the fields eating as he went  he hurried down a lane that bordered the big wheatfield on this side was fallow ground for half the length of the section and the other half was ripe barley dry as tinder and beyond that in line with the burning fields a quartersection of blasted wheat the men were there kurt saw at once that other men with horses and machines were also there then he recognized olsen and two other of his neighbors as he ran up he was equally astounded and out of breath so that he could not speak old dorn sat with gray head bowed on his hand  hello shouted olsen his grimy face broke into a hard smile fires all over wheats burnin like prairie grass them chips of phosphorus are sure from hell weve come over to help  youdid you leftyour fields gasped kurt  sure theyre not much to leave and were goin to save this section of yours or bust tryin i sent my son in his car all over to hurry men here with horses machines wagons  kurt was overcome he could only wring olsens hand here was an answer to one of his brooding gloomy queries something would be gained even if the wheat was lost kurt had scarcely any hope left  whats to be done he panted hoarsely in this extremity olsen seemed a tower of strength this sturdy farmer was of andersons breed even if he was a foreigner and he had fought fires before  if we have time well mow a line all around your wheat replied olsen  reckon we wont have time interposed jerry pointing to a smoke far down in the corner of the stunted wheat theres a fire startin  theyll break out all over said olsen and he waved a couple of his men away one had a scythe and the other a long pole with a wet burlap bag tied on one end they hurried toward the little cloud of smoke  i found a lot of cakes over along the road declared kurt with a grim surety that he had done that well  theyve surrounded your wheat returned olsen but if enough men get here well save the whole section lucky youve got two wells an that watertank well need all the water we can get keep a man pumpin fetch all the bags an brooms an scythes ill post lookouts along this lane to watch for fires breakin out in the big field when they do weve got to run an cut an beat them out it wont be long till most of this section is surrounded by fire  thin clouds of smoke were then blowing across the fields and the wind that carried them was laden with an odor of burning wheat to kurt it seemed to be the fragrance of baking bread  howd it be to begin harvestin queried jerry thet wheats ripe  no combines should be risked in there until were sure the dangers past replied olsen there i see more of our neighbors comin down the road were goin to beat the iww  that galvanized kurt into action and he found himself dragging jerry back to the barns they hitched a team to a heavy wagon in record time and then began to load with whatever was available for fighting fire they loaded a barrel and with huge buckets filled it with water leaving jerry to drive kurt rushed back to the fields during his short absence more men with horses and machines had arrived fire had broken out in the stunted wheat and also nearer at hand in the barley kurt saw his father laboring like a giant olsen was taking charge directing the men the sky was obscured now and all the west was thick with yellow smoke the south slopes and valley floor were clouding only in the east over the hill did the air appear clear back of kurt down across the barley and wheat on the dorn land a line of fire was creeping over the hill this was on the property adjoining olsens gremniger the owner had abandoned his own fields at the moment he was driving a mower along the edge of the barley cutting a ninefoot path men behind him were stacking the sheaves the wind was as hot as if from a blastfurnace the air was thick and oppressive the light of day was growing dim  kurt mounted on the seat of one of the combine threshers surveyed with rapid and anxious gaze all the points around him and it lingered over the magnificent sweep of golden wheat the wheat bowed in waves before the wind and the silken rustle heard above the confusion of yelling men was like a voice whispering to kurt somehow his dread lessened then and other emotions predominated he saw more and more farmers arrive in cars in wagons with engines and threshers until the lane was lined with them and men were hurrying everywhere  suddenly kurt espied a slender column of smoke rising above the wheat out in front of him toward the highway this was the first sign of fire in the great section that so many farmers had come to protect yelling for help he leaped off the seat and ran with all his might toward the spot breasting that thick wheat was almost as hard as breasting waves jerry came yelling after him brandishing a crude beater and both of them reached the fire at once it was a small circle burning slowly madly kurt rushed in to tear and stamp as if the little hissing flames were serpents he burned his hands through his gloves and his feet through his boots jerry beat hard accompanying his blows with profane speech plainly indicating that he felt he was at work on the iww in short order they put out this little fire returning to his post kurt watched until he was called to lend a hand down in the stunted wheat  fire had crossed and had gotten a hold on dorns lower field here the wheat was blasted and so burned all the more fiercely horses and mowers had to be taken away to the intervening barleyfield a weird smoky and ruddy darkness enveloped the scene dim red fire in lines and dots and curves appeared on three sides growing larger and longer meeting in some places crisscrossed by black figures of threshing men belaboring the flames kurt came across his father working like a madman kurt warned him not to overexert himself and the father never heard now and then his stentorian yell added to the medley of cries and shouts and blows and the roar of the wind fanning the flames  kurt was put to beating fire in the cut wheat he stood with flames licking at his boots it was astonishing how tenacious the fire appeared how it crept along eating up the mowed wheat all the men that could be spared there were unable to check it and keep it out of the standing grain when it reached this line it lifted a blaze flamed and roared and burned like wildfire in grass the men were driven back threshing and beating all to no avail kurt fell into despair there was no hope it seemed like an inferno  flaring high the light showed the black violently agitated forms of the fighters and the clouds of yellow smoke coalescing and drifting changing to dark and soaring high  olsen had sent three mowers abreast down the whole length of the barleyfield before the fire reached that line it was a wise move and if anything could do so it would save the day the leaping flame thin and high and a mile long curled down the last of the standing wheat and caught the fallen barley but here its speed was checked it had to lick a way along the ground  in desperation in unabated fury the little army of farmers and laborers with no thought of personal gain with what seemed to kurt a wonderful and noble spirit attacked this encroaching line of fire like men whose homes and lives and ideals had been threatened with destruction kurts mind worked as swiftly as his tireless hands this indeed was being in a front line of battle the scene was weird dark fitful at times impressive and again unreal these neighbors of his many of them aliens some of them germans when put to this vital test were proving themselves they had shown little liking for the dorns but here was love of wheat and so in some way loyalty to the government that needed it here was the answer of the northwest to the iww no doubt if the perpetrators of that phosphorus trick could have been laid hold of then blood would have been shed kurt sensed in the fierce energy in the dark grimy faces shining and wet under the light in the hoarse yell and answering shout a nameless force that was finding itself and centering on one common cause  his old father toiled as ten men that burly giant pushed ever in the lead and his hoarse call and strenuous action told of more than a mercenary rage to save his wheat  fire never got across that swath of cut barley it was beaten out as if by a thousand men shadow and gloom enveloped the fighters as they rested where their last strokes had fallen over the hills faint reflection of dying flames lit up the dark clouds of smoke the battle seemed won  then came the thrilling cry fire fire  one of the outposts came running out of the dark  fire the other side fire rang out olsens yell  kurt ran with the gang pellmell through the dark up the barley slope to see a long red line a high red flare and lifting clouds of ruddy smoke fire in the big wheatfield the sight inflamed him carried him beyond his powers and all he knew was that he became the center of a dark and whirling mêlée encircled by living flames that leaped only to be beaten down whether that threshing chaos of fire and smoke and wheat was short or long was beyond him to tell but the fire was extinguished to the last spark  walking back with the weary crowd kurt felt a clearer breeze upon his face smoke was not flying so thickly over the western hill through a rift in the clouds peeped a star the only other light he saw twinkled far down the lane it was that of a lantern dark forms barred it now and then slowly kurt recovered his breath the men were talking and tired voices rang with assurance that the fire was beaten  some one called kurt the voice was jerrys it seemed hoarse and strained kurt could see the lean form of his man standing in the light of the lantern a small dark group of men silent and somehow impressive stood off a little in the shadow  here i am jerry called kurt stepping forward just then olsen joined jerry  boy weve beat the iwws butbut he began and broke off huskily  whats the matter queried kurt and a cold chill shot over him  jerry plucked at his sleeve  your old manyour dadhes overworked hisself whispered jerry its tough nobody could stop him  kurt felt that the fulfilment of his icy sickening dread had come jerrys dark face even in the uncertain light was tragic  boy his heart went back on himhes dead said olsen solemnly  kurt pushed the kind hands aside a few steps brought him to where under the light of the lantern lay his father pale and still with a strange softening of the iron cast of intolerance  dead whispered kurt in awe and horror father oh hes gonewithout a word  again jerry plucked at kurts sleeve  i was with him said jerry i heard him fall an groan i had the light i bent over lifted his head an he said speaking english tell my soni was wrong then he died an thet was all  kurt staggered away from the whispering sympathetic foreman out into the darkness where he lifted his face in the thankfulness of a breaking heart  it had indeed taken the approach of death to change his hard old father oh he meantthat if he had his life to live over againhe would be different whispered kurt that was the one great word needed to reconcile kurt to his father  the night had grown still except for the murmuring of the men smoke veiled the horizon kurt felt an intense and terrible loneliness he was indeed alone in the world a hard tight contraction of throat choked back a sob if only he could have had a word with his father but no grief nothing could detract from the splendid truth of his fathers last message in the black hours soon to come kurt would have that to sustain him     chapter xiii  the bright sun of morning disclosed that wide rolling region of the bend to be a dreary blackened waste surrounding one great wheatfield rich and mellow and golden  kurt dorns neighbor olsen in his kind and matteroffact way making obligation seem slight took charge of kurts affairs and made the necessary and difficult decisions nothing must delay the harvesting and transporting of the wheat the women folk arranged for the burial of old chris dorn  kurt sat and moved about in a gloomy kind of trance for a day and a half until his father was laid to rest beside his mother in the little graveyard on the windy hill after that his mind slowly cleared he kept to himself the remainder of that day avoiding the crowd of harvesters camping in the yard and adjacent field and at sunset he went to a lonely spot on the verge of the valley where with sad eyes he watched the last rays of sunlight fade over the blackened hills all these hours had seemed consecrated to his fathers memory to remembered acts of kindness and of love of the relation that had gone and would never be again reproach and remorse had abided with him until that sunset hour when the load eased off his heart  next morning he went out to the wheatfield                                       what a wonderful harvesting scene greeted kurt dorn never had its like been seen in the northwest nor perhaps in any other place a huge pall of dust chaff and smoke hung over the vast wheatfield and the air seemed charged with a roar the glaring gold of the wheatfield appeared to be crisscrossed everywhere with bobbing black streaks of horsesbays blacks whites and reds by big moving painted machines lifting arms and puffing straw by immense wagons piled high with sheaves of wheat lumbering down to the smoking engines and the threshers that sent long streams of dust and chaff over the lifting strawstacks by wagons following the combines to pick up the plump brown sacks of wheat and by a string of empty wagons coming in from the road  olsen was rushing thirty combine threshers three engine threshingmachines forty wagonteams and over a hundred men well known to him there was a guard around the field this unprecedented harvest had attracted many spectators from the little towns they had come in cars and on horseback and on foot olsen trusted no man on that field except those he knew  the wonderful wheatfield was cut into a thousand squares and angles and lanes and curves the big whirring combines passed one another stopped and waited and turned out of the way leaving everywhere little patches and cubes of standing wheat that soon fell before the onslaught of the smaller combines this scene had no regularity it was one of confusion of awkward halts delays hurries of accident the wind blew clouds of dust and chaff alternately clearing one space to cloud another and a strange roar added the last heroic touch to this heroic field it was indeed the roar of battlemen and horses governing the action of machinery and all fighting time for in delay was peril to the wheat  once kurt ran across the tireless and implacable olsen he seemed a man of dust and sweat and fury  shes half cut an over twenty thousand bushels gone to the railroad he exclaimed an were speedin up  olsen i dont get whats going on replied kurt all this is like a dream  wake up youll be out of debt an a rich man in three days added olsen and went his way  in the afternoon kurt set out to work as he had never worked in his life there was need of his strong hands in many places but he could not choose any one labor and stick by it for long he wanted to do all it was as if this was not a real and wonderful harvest of his fathers greatest wheat yield but something that embodied all years all harvests his fathers death the lifting of the old hard debt the days when he had trod the fields barefoot and this day when strangely enough all seemed over for him peace dwelt with him yet no hope behind his calm he could have found the old dread had he cared to look deeply he loved these heroic workers of the fields it had been given to hima great taskto be the means of creating a test for them his neighbors under a ban of suspicion and now he could swear they were as true as the gold of the waving wheat more than a harvest was this most strenuous and colorful of all times ever known in the bend it had a significance that uplifted him it was american  first kurt began to load bags of wheat as they fell from the whirring combines into the wagons for his powerful arms a full bag containing two bushels was like a toy for a child with a lift and a heave he threw a bag into a wagon they were everywhere these brown bags dotting the stubble field appearing as if by magic in the wake of the machines they rolled off the platforms this toil because it was hard and heavy held kurt for an hour but it could not satisfy his enormous hunger to make that whole harvest his own he passed to pitching sheaves of wheat and then to driving in the wagons from that he progressed to a seat on one of the immense combines where he drove twentyfour horses no driver there was any surer than kurt of his aim with the little stones he threw to spur a lagging horse kurt had felt this when as a boy he had begged to be allowed to try his hand he liked the shifty cloud of fragrant chaff now and then blinding and choking him and he liked the steady rhythmic tramps of hooves and the roaring whir of the great complicated machine it fascinated him to see the wide swath of nodding wheat tremble and sway and fall and go sliding up into the inside of that grinding maw and come out straw and dust and chaff and a slender stream of gold filling the bags  this day kurt dorn was gripped by the unknown some faroff instinct of future drove him set his spiritual need and made him register with his senses all that was so beautiful and good and heroic in the scene about him  strangely now and then a thought of lenore anderson entered his mind and made sudden havoc it tended to retard action he trembled and thrilled with a realization that every hour brought closer the meeting he could not avoid and he discovered that it was whenever this memory recurred that he had to leave off his present task and rush to another only thus could he forget her  the late afternoon found him feeding sheaves of wheat to one of the steamthreshers he stood high upon a platform and pitched sheaves from the wagons upon the sliding track of the ponderous rattling threshingmachine the engine stood off fifty yards or more connected by an endless drivingbelt to the thresher here indeed were whistle and roar and whir and the shout of laborers and the smell of smoke sweat dust and wheat kurt had arms of steel if they tired he never knew it he toiled and he watched the long spout of chaff and straw as it streamed from the thresher to lift magically a glistening evergrowing stack and he felt as a last and cumulative change his physical effort and the physical adjuncts of the scene pass into something spiritual into his heart and his memory  the end of that harvesttime came as a surprise to kurt obsessed with his own emotions he had actually helped to cut the wheat and harvest it he had seen it go swath by swath he had watched the huge wagons lumber away and the huge strawstacks rise without realizing that the hours of this wonderful harvest were numbered  sight of olsen coming in from across the field and the sudden cessation of roar and action made kurt aware of the end it seemed a calamity but olsen was smiling through his dustcaked face about him were relaxation an air of finality and a subtle pride  were through he said she tallies thirtyeight thousand seven hundred an fortyone bushels its too bad the old man couldnt live to hear that  olsen gripped kurts hand and wrung it  boy i reckon you ought to take that a little cheerfuller he went on butwell its been a hard time the men are leavin now in two hours the last wagons will unload at the railroad the wheat will all be in the warehouse an our worrys ended  ii hope so responded kurt he seemed overcome with the passionate longing to show his gratitude to olsen but the words would not flow ii dont know how to thank you all my life  we beat the iww interposed the farmer heartily an now whatll you do dorn  why ill hustle to kilo get my money send you a check for yourself and men pay off the debt to anderson and then  but kurt did not conclude his speech his last words were thoughtprovoking  its turned out well said olsen with satisfaction and shaking hands again with kurt he strode back to his horses  at last the wide sloping field was bare except for the huge strawstacks a bright procession lumbered down the road led by the long strings of wagons filled with brown bags a strange silence had settled down over the farm the wheat was gone that waving stretch of gold had fallen to the thresher and the grain had been hauled away the neighbors had gone leaving kurt rich in bushels of wheat and richer for the hearty farewells and the grips of horny hands kurts heart was full                                       it was evening kurt had finished his supper already he had packed a few things to take with him on the morrow he went out to the front of the house stars were blinking there was a low hum of insects from the fields he missed the soft silken rustle of the wheat and now it seemed he could sit there in the quiet darkness in that spot which had been made sweet by lenore andersons presence and think of her the meeting soon to come the feeling abiding with him then must have been happiness because he was not used to it without deserving anything he had asked a great deal of fate and lo it had been given him all was well that ended well he realized now the terrible depths of despair into which he had allowed himself to be plunged he had been weak wrong selfish there was something that guided events  he needed to teach himself all this with strong and repeated force so that when he went to give lenore anderson the opportunity to express her gratitude to see her sweet face again and to meet the strange warm glance of her blue eyes so mysterious and somehow mocking he could be a man of restraint of pride like any american like any other college man she knew this was no time for a man to leave a girl bearing a burden of his unsolicited love haunted perhaps by a generous reproach that she might have been a little to blame he had told her the truth and so far he had been dignified now let him bid her goodby leaving no sorrow for her and once out of her impelling presence let come what might come he could love her then he could dare what he had never dared he could surrender himself to the furious insistent sweetness of a passion that was sheer bliss in its expression he could imagine kisses on the red lips that were not for him  a husky shout from somewhere in the rear of the house diverted kurts attention he listened it came again his name it seemed a strange call from out of the troubled past that had just ended he hurried through the house to the kitchen the woman stood holding a lamp staring at jerry  jerry appeared to have sunk against the wall his face was pallid with drops of sweat standing out with distorted quivering lower jaw he could not look at kurt he could not speak with shaking hand he pointed toward the back of the house  filled with nameless dread kurt rushed out he saw nothing unusual heard nothing rapidly he walked out through the yard and suddenly he saw a glow in the sky above the barns then he ran so that he could get an unobstructed view of the valley  the instant he obtained this he halted as if turned to stone the valley was a place of yellow light he stared with the wheatfields all burned what was the meaning of such a big light that broad flare had a center low down on the valley floor as he gazed a monstrous flame leaped up lighting colossal pillars of smoke that swirled upward and showing plainer than in day the big warehouse and lines of freightcars at the railroad station eight miles distant  my god gasped kurt the warehousemy wheaton fire  clear and unmistakable was the horrible truth kurt heard the roar of the sinister flames transfixed he stood there at first hardly able to see and to comprehend for miles the valley was as light as at noonday an awful beauty attended the scene how lurid and sinister the red heart of that fire how weird and hellish and impressive of destruction those black mountainhigh clouds of smoke he saw the freightcars disappear under this fierce blazing and smoking pall he watched for what seemed endless moments he saw the changes of that fire swift and terrible and only then did kurt dorn awaken to the full sense of the calamity  all that workolsens sacrificeand the farmersmy fathers deathall for nothing whispered kurt they only waitedthose fiendsto fire the warehouse and the cars  the catastrophe had fallen the wheat was burning he was ruined his wheatland must go to anderson kurt thought first and most poignantly of the noble farmers who had sacrificed the little in their wheatfields to save the much in his never could he repay them  then he became occupied with a horrible heat that seemed to have come from the burning warehouse to all his pulses and veins and to his heart and his soul  this fiendish work as had been forecast was the work of the iww behind it was glidden and perhaps behind him was the grasping black lust of german might kurts loss was no longer abstract or problematical it was a loss so real and terrible that it confounded him he shook and gasped and reeled he wrung his hands and beat his breast while the tumult swayed him the physical hate at last yielding up its significance what then was his great loss he could not tell the thing was mighty like the sense of terror and loneliness in the black night not the loss for his farmer neighbors so true in his hour of trial not the loss of his father nor the wheat nor the land nor his ruined future but it must be a loss incalculable and insupportable to his soul his great ordeal had been the need a terrible and incomprehensible need to kill something intangible in himself he had meant to do it and now the need was shifted subject to a baser instinct if there was german blood in him poisoning the very wells of his heart he could have spilled it and so whether living or dead have repudiated the taint that was now clear in his consciousness but a baser spark had ignited all the primitive passion of the forebears he felt burning and driving within him he felt no noble fire he longed to live to have a hundredfold his strength and fury to be gifted with a genius for time and place and bloody deed to have the wargods set him a thousand opportunities to beat with iron mace and cut with sharp bayonet and rend with hard handto kill and kill and kill the hideous thing that was german     chapter xiv  kurt rushed back to the house encountering jerry he ordered him to run and saddle a couple of horses then kurt got his revolver and a box of shells and throwing on his coat he hurried to the barn jerry was leading out the horses it took but short work to saddle them jerry was excited and talkative he asked kurt many questions which excited few replies  when kurt threw himself into the saddle jerry yelled which way  down the trail replied kurt and was off  aw well break our necks came jerrys yell after him  kurt had no fear of the dark he knew that trail almost as well by night as by day his horse was a mettlesome colt that had not been worked during the harvest and he plunged down the dim winding trail as if indeed to verify jerrys fears presently the thin pale line that was the trail disappeared on the burned wheatground here kurt was at fault as to direction but he did not slacken the pace for that he heard jerry pounding along in the rear trying to catch up the way the colt jumped ditches and washes and other obstructions proved his keen sight kurt let him go and then the ride became both perilous and thrilling  kurt could not see anything on the blackened earth but he knew from the contour of the hills just about where to expect to reach the fence and the road and he did not pull the horse too soon when he found the gate he waited for jerry who could be heard calling from the darkness kurt answered him  heres the gate yelled kurt as jerry came galloping up good road all the way now  lickitycut then shouted jerry to whom the pace had evidently communicated enthusiasm  the ride then became a race with kurt drawing ahead kurt could see the road a broad pale belt dividing the blackness on either side and he urged the colt to a run the wind cut short kurts breath beat at his ears and roared about them closer and closer drew the red flare of the dying fire casting long rays of light into kurts eyes  the colt was almost run out when he entered the circle of reddish flare kurt saw the glowing ruins of the elevators and a long fiery line of boxcars burned to the wheels men were running and shouting round in front of the little railroad station and several were on the roof with brooms and buckets the freighthouse had burned and evidently the station itself had been on fire across the wide street of the little village the roof of a cottage was burning men were on top of it beating the shingles hoarse yells greeted kurt as he leaped out of the saddle he heard screams of frightened women on the other side of the burned boxcars a long thin column of sparks rose straight upward over the ruins of the elevators hung a pall of heavy smoke just then jerry came galloping up his lean face red in the glow  thet you kurt say the sons of guns are burnin down the town he leaped off lemme have your bridle ill tie the hosses up find out what we can do  kurt ran here and there possessed by impotent rage the wheat was gone that fact gave him a hollow sickening pang he met farmers he knew they all threw up their hands at sight of him not one could find a voice finally he met olsen the little wheat farmer was white with passion he carried a gun  hello dorn aint this hell they got your wheat he said hoarsely  olsen howd it happen wasnt anybody set to guard the elevators  yes but the iwws drove all the guards off but grimm an they beat him up bad nobody had nerve enough to shoot  olsen if i run into the glidden ill kill him declared kurt  so will i but dorn theyre a hard crowd theyre over there on the side watchin the fire a gang of them soon as i can get the men together well drive them out of town therell be a fight if i dont miss my guess  hurry the men have all of them get their guns come on  not yet dorn were fightin fire yet you an jerry help all you can  indeed it appeared there was danger of more than one cottage burning the exceedingly dry weather of the past weeks had made shingles like tinder and wherever a glowing spark fell on them there straightway was a smoldering fire water a scarce necessity in that region had been used until all wells and pumps became dry it was fortunate that most of the roofs of the little village had been constructed of galvanized iron beating out blazes and glowing embers with brooms was not effective enough when it appeared that the one cottage nearest the rain of sparks was sure to go kurt thought of the railroad watertank below the station he led a number of men with buckets to the tank and they soon drowned out the smoldering places  meanwhile the blazes from the boxcars died out leaving only the dull glow from the red heap that had once been the elevators however this gave forth light enough for any one to be seen a few rods distant sparks had ceased to fall and from that source no further danger need be apprehended olsen had been going from man to man sending those who were not armed home for guns so it came about that half an hour after kurts arrival a score of farmers villagers and a few railroaders were collected in a group listening to the palefaced olsen  men theres only a few of us an theres hundreds mebbe in thet iww gang but weve got to drive them off he said doggedly theres no tellin what theyll do if we let them hang around any longer they know were weak in numbers weve got to do some shootin to scare them away  kurt seconded olsen in ringing voice  theyve threatened your homes he said theyve burned my wheatruined me they were the death of my father these are facts im telling you we cant wait for law or for militia weve got to meet this iww invasion they have taken advantage of the war situation theyre backed by german agents its now a question of our property weve got to fight  the crowd made noisy and determined response most of them had small weapons a few had shotguns or rifles  come on men called olsen ill do the talkin an if i say shoot why you shoot  it was necessary to go around the long line of boxcars olsen led the way with kurt just back of him the men spoke but little and in whispers at the left end of the line the darkness was thick enough to make objects indistinct  once around the corner kurt plainly descried a big dark crowd of men whose faces showed red in the glow of the huge pile of embers which was all that remained of the elevators they did not see olsens men  hold on whispered olsen if we get in a fight here well be in a bad place weve nothin to hide behind lets go offmore to the leftan come up behind those freightcars on the switches thatll give us cover an well have the iwws in the light  so he led off to the left keeping in the shadow and climbed between several lines of freightcars all empty and finally came out behind the iwws olsen led to within fifty yards of them and was halted by some observant member of the gang who sat with the others on top of a flatcar  this mans yell stilled the coarse talk and laughter of the gang  whats that shouted a cold clear voice with authority in it  kurt thought he recognized the voice and it caused a bursting savage sensation in his blood  heres a bunch of farmers with guns yelled the man from the flatcar  olsen halted his force near one of the detached lines of boxcars which he probably meant to take advantage of in case of a fight  hey you iwws he shouted with all his might  there was a moments silence  theres no iwws here replied the authoritative voice  kurt was sure now that he recognized gliddens voice excitement and anger then gave place to deadly rage  who are you yelled olsen  were tramps watchin the fire came the reply  you set that fire  no we didnt  kurt motioned olsen to be silent as with lifting breast he took an involuntary step forward  glidden i know you he shouted in hard quick tones im kurt dorn ive met you i know your voice take your gangget out of hereor well kill you  this pregnant speech caused a blank dead silence then came a white flash a sharp report kurt heard the thud of a bullet striking some one near him the man cried out but did not fall  spread out an hide ordered olsen an shoot fer keeps  the little crowd broke and melted into the shadows behind and under the boxcars kurt crawled under a car and between the wheels from which vantagepoint he looked out gliddens gang were there in the red glow most of them now standing the sentry who had given the alarm still sat on top of the flatcar swinging his legs his companions however had jumped down kurt heard men of his own party crawling and whispering behind him and he saw dim dark sprawling forms under the far end of the car  boss the hayseeds have run off called the man from the flat car  laughter and jeers greeted this sally  kurt concluded it was about time to begin proceedings resting his revolver on the side of the wheel behind which he lay he took steady aim at the sentry holding low kurt was not a good shot with a revolver and the distance appeared to exceed fifty yards but as luck would have it when he pulled trigger the sentry let out a loud bawl of terror and pain and fell off the car to the ground flopping and crawling like a crippled chicken he got out of sight below  kurts shot was a starter for olsens men four or five of the shotguns boomed at once then the second barrels were discharged along with a sharper cracking of small arms pandemonium broke loose in gliddens gang no doubt at least of the effectiveness of the shotguns a medley of strange sharp enraged and anguished cries burst upon the air a prelude to a wild stampede in a few seconds that lighted spot where the iww had grouped was vacant and everywhere were fleeing forms some swift others slow so far as kurt could see no one had been fatally injured but many had been hurt and that fact augured well for olsens force  presently a shot came from some hidden enemy it thudded into the wood of the car over kurt some one on his side answered it and a heavy bullet striking iron whined away into the darkness then followed flash here and flash there with accompanying reports and whistles of lead from behind and under and on top of cars opened up a fire that proved how well armed these socalled laborers were their volley completely drowned the desultory firing of olsens squad  kurt began to wish for one of the shotguns it was this kind of weapon that saved olsens followers there were a hundred chances to one of missing an iww with a single bullet while a shotgun aimed fairly well was generally productive of results kurt stopped wasting his cartridges some one was hurt behind his car and he crawled out to see a villager named schmidt had been wounded in the leg not seriously but bad enough to disable him he had been using a doublebarreled breechloading shotgun and he wore a vest with rows of shells in the pockets across the front kurt borrowed gun and ammunition and with these he hurried back to his covert grimly sure of himself at thought of glidden he became hot all over and this heat rather grew with the excitement of battle  with the heavy fowlingpiece loaded kurt peeped forth from behind his protecting wheel and watched keenly for flashes or moving dark figures the iww had begun to reserve their fire to shift their positions and to spread out judging from a wider range of the reports it looked as if they meant to try and surround olsens band it was extraordinarythe assurance and deadly intent of this riffraff gang of tramp laboragitators in preceding years a crowd of iww men had been nothing to worry a rancher vastly different it seemed now they acted as if they had the great war back of them  kurt crawled out of his hidingplace and stole from car to car in search of olsen at last he found the rancher in company with several men peering from behind a car one of his companions was sitting down and trying to wrap something round his foot  olsen theyre spreading out to surround us whispered kurt  thats what bill here just said replied olsen nervously if this keeps up well be in a tight place whatll we do dorn  we mustnt break and run of all things said kurt theyd burn the village tell our men to save their shells if i only could get some cracks at a bunch of them togetherwith this big shotgun  say weve been watchin that carthe halfsize one therenext the high boxcar whispered olsen  its full of them sometimes we see a dozen shots come from it all at once  olsen ive an idea returned kurt excitedly you fellows keep shootingattract their attention ill slip below climb on top of a boxcar and get a rakeoff at that bunch  its risky dorn said olsen with hesitation but if you could get in a few tellin shotsstart that gang on the run  ill try it rejoined kurt and forthwith stole off back toward the shadow it struck him that there was more light then when the attack began the fire had increased or perhaps the iww had started another at any rate the light was growing stronger and likewise the danger greater as he crossed an open space a bullet whizzed by him and then another zipped by to strike up the gravel ahead these were not random shots some one was aiming at him how strange and rageprovoking to be shot at deliberately what a remarkable experience for a young wheat farmer raising wheat in the great northwest had assumed responsibilities he had to run and he was the more furious because of that another bullet flying wide hummed to his left before he gained the shelter of the farthest line of freightcars here he hid and watched the firing appeared to be all behind him and thus encouraged he stole along to the end of the line of cars and around a bright blaze greeted his gaze an isolated car was on fire kurt peered forth to make sure of his bearings and at length found the high derrick by which he had marked the boxcar that he intended to climb  he could see plainly and stole up to his objective point with little risk to himself until he climbed upon the boxcar he crouched low almost on hands and knees and finally gained the long shadow of a shed between the tracks then he ran past the derrick to the dark side of the car he could now plainly see the revolver flashes and could hear the thud and spang of their bullets striking drawing a deep breath kurt climbed up the iron ladder on the dark side of the car  he had the same sensation that possessed him when he was crawling to get a potshot at a flock of wild geese only this was mightily more exciting he did not forget the risk he lay flat and crawled little by little every moment he expected to be discovered olsen had evidently called more of his men to his side for they certainly were shooting diligently kurt heard a continuous return fire from the car he was risking so much to get a shot at at length he was within a yard of the end of the caras far as he needed to go he rested a moment he was laboring for breath sweating freely on fire with thrills  his plan was to raise himself on one knee and fire as many double shots as possible presently he lifted his head to locate the car it was half in the bright light half in the shadow lengthwise toward him about sixty or seventy yards distant and full of men he dropped his head tingling all over it was a disappointment that the car stood so far away with fine shot he could not seriously injure any of the iww contingent but he was grimly sure of the fright and hurt he could inflict in his quick glance he had seen flashes of their guns and many red faces and dark huddled forms  kurt took four shells and set them end up on the roof of the car close to him then cocking the gun he cautiously raised himself to one knee he discharged both barrels at once what a boom and what a terrified outburst of yells swiftly he broke the gun reloaded fired as before and then again the last two shots were fired at the men piling frantically over the side of the car yelling with fear kurt had heard the swishing pattering impact of those swarms of small shot the iww gang ran pellmell down the open track away from kurt and toward the light as he reloaded the gun he saw men running from all points to join the gang with an old blunderbuss of a shotgun he had routed the iww it meant relief to olsens men but kurt had yet no satisfaction for the burning of his wheat for the cruel shock that had killed his father  come on olsen he yelled at the top of his lungs theyre a lot of cowards  then in his wild eagerness he leaped off the car the long jump landed him jarringly but he did not fall or lose hold of the gun recovering his balance he broke into a run kurt was fast on his feet not a young man of his neighborhood nor any of his collegemates could outfoot him in a race and then these iww fellows ran like stifflegged tramps long unused to such mode of action and some of them were limping as they ran kurt gained upon them when he got within range he halted short and freed two barrels a howl followed the report some of the fleeing ones fell but were dragged up and on by companions kurt reloaded and bounding forward like a deer yelling for olsen he ran until he was within range then stopped to shoot again thus he continued until the pursued got away from the circle of light kurt saw the gang break up some running one way and some another there were sheds and cars and piles of lumber along the track affording places to hide kurt was halted by the discovery that he had no more ammunition panting he stopped short realizing that he had snapped an empty gun at men either too tired or too furious or too desperate to run any farther  hes out of shells shouted a low hard voice that made kurt leap he welcomed the rush of dark forms and swinging the gun round his head made ready to brain the first antagonist who neared him but some one leaped upon him from behind the onslaught carried him to his knees bounding up he broke the gun stock on the head of his assailant who went down in a heap kurt tried to pull his revolver it became impossible owing to strong arms encircling him wrestling he freed himself only to be staggered by a rush of several men all pouncing upon him at once kurt went down but once down he heaved so powerfully that he threw off the whole crew up again like a cat he began to fight big and strong and swift with fists like a blacksmiths kurt bowled over this assailant and that one he thought he recognized glidden in a man who kept out of his reach and who was urging on the others kurt lunged at him and finally got his hands on him that was fatal for kurt because in his fury he forgot gliddens comrades in one second his big hand wrenched a yell of mortal pain out of glidden then a combined attack of the others rendered kurt powerless a blow on the head stunned himmade all dark     chapter xv  it seemed that kurt did not altogether lose consciousness for he had vague sensations of being dragged along the ground presently the darkness cleared from his mind and he opened his eyes he lay on his back looking up he saw stars through the thin broken clouds of smoke a huge pile of railroad ties loomed up beside him  he tried to take note of his situation his hands were tied in front of him not so securely he imagined that he could not work them free his legs had not been tied both his head and shoulder on the left side pained him severely upon looking around kurt presently made out the dark form of a man he appeared rigid with attention but that evidently had no relation to kurt the man was listening and watching for his comrades kurt heard no voices or shots after a little while however he thought he heard distant footsteps on the gravel he hardly knew what to make of his predicament if there was only one guard over him escape did not seem difficult unless that guard had a gun  hello you he called  hello yourself replied the man jerking up in evident surprise  whats your name inquired kurt amiably  well it aint jj hill or anderson came the gruff response  kurt laughed but you would be one of those names if you could now wouldnt you went on kurt  my name is dennis gloomily returned the man  it certainly is that is the name of all iwws said kurt  say are you the fellow who had the shotgun  i sure am replied kurt  i ought to knock you on the head  why  because ill have to eat standing up for a month  yes queried kurt  the seat of my pants must have made a good target for you sure pasted it full of birdshot  kurt smothered a laugh then he felt the old anger leap up didnt you burn my wheat  are you that young dorn  yes i am replied kurt hotly  well i didnt burn one damn straw of your old wheat  you didnt but youre with these men youre an iww youve been fighting these farmers here  if you want to know im a tramp said the man bitterly years ago i was a prosperous oilproducer in ohio i had a fine oilfield along comes a big fellow tries to buy me out and failing that he shot off dynamite charges into the ground next my oilfield choked my wells ruined me i came westwent to farming along comes a corporation steals my water for irrigationand my land went back to desert so i quit working and trying to be honest it doesnt pay the rich men are getting all the richer at the expense of the poor so now im a tramp  friend thats a hardluck story said kurt it sure makes me think but ill tell you whatyou dont belong to this iww outfit even if you are a tramp  why not  because youre american thats why  well i know i am but i can be american and travel with a labor union cant i  no this iww is no labor union it never was their very first rule is to abolish capital theyre anarchists and now theyre backed by german money the iww is an enemy to america all this hampering of railroads destruction of timber and wheat is an aid to germany in the war the united states is at war my god man cant you see its your own country that must suffer for such deals as this wheatburning tonight  the hell you say ejaculated the man in amaze  this glidden is a german agentperhaps a spy hes no labor leader what does he care for the interests of such men as you  young man if you dont shut up youll give me a hankering to go back to real work  i hope i do let me give you a hunch throw down this iww outfit go to ruxton and get anderson of many waters ranch to give you a job tell him who you are and that i sent you  anderson of many waters hey well maybe itll surprise you to know that glidden is operating there has a lot of men there and is going there from here  no it doesnt surprise me i hope he does go there for if he does hell get killed  sssssh whispered the guard here comes some of the gang  kurt heard low voices and soft footfalls some dark forms loomed up  bradford has he come to yet queried the brutal voice of glidden  nope replied the guard i guess he had a hard knock hes never budged  weve got to beat it out of here said glidden its long after midnight theres a freighttrain down the track i want all the gang to board it you run along bradford and catch up with the others  whatre you going to do with this young fellow queried bradford curiously  thats none of your business returned glidden  maybe not but i reckon ill ask anyhow you want me to join your iww and im asking questions labor strikesstanding up for your rightsis one thing and burning wheat or slugging young farmers is another are you going to let this dorn go  kurt could plainly see the group of five men bradford standing over the smaller glidden and the others strung and silent in the intensity of the moment  ill cut his throat hissed glidden  bradford lunged heavily the blow he struck glidden was square in the face glidden would have had a hard fall but for the obstruction in the shape of his comrades upon whom he was knocked they held him up glidden sagged inertly evidently stunned or unconscious bradford backed guardedly away out of their reach then wheeling he began to run with heavy plodding strides  gliddens comrades seemed anxiously holding him up peering at him but no one spoke kurt saw his opportunity with one strong wrench he freed his hands feeling in his pocket for his gun he was disturbed to find that it had been taken he had no weapon but he did not hesitate bounding up he rushed like a hurricane upon the unprepared group he saw gliddens pale face upheld to the light of the stars and by it saw that glidden was recovering with all his might kurt swung as he rushed and the blow he gave the iww leader far exceeded bradfords glidden was lifted so powerfully against one of his men that they both fell then kurt striking right and left beat down the other two and leaping over them he bounded away into the darkness shrill piercing yells behind him lent him wings  but he ran right into another group of iww men dozens in number he thought and by the light of what appeared to be a fire they saw him as quickly as he saw them the yells behind were significant enough kurt had to turn to run back and he had to run the gauntlet of the men he had assaulted they promptly began to shoot at kurt the whistle of lead was uncomfortably close never had he run so fleetly when he flashed past the end of the line of cars into comparative open he found himself in the light of a new fire this was a shed perhaps a score of rods or less from the station some one was yelling beyond this and kurt thought he recognized jerrys voice but he did not tarry to make sure bullets scattering the gravel ahead of him and singing around his head and hoarse cries behind with a heavybooted tread of pursuers gave kurt occasion to hurry he flew across the freightyard intending to distance his pursuers then circle round the station to the village  once he looked back the gang well spread out was not far behind him just coming into the light of the new fire no one in it could ever catch him of that kurt was sure  suddenly a powerful puff of air like a blast of wind seemed to lift him at the same instant a dazzling blinding yellow blaze illuminated the whole scene the solid earth seemed to rock under kurts flying feet and then a terrific roar appalled him he was thrown headlong through the air and all about him seemed streaks and rays and bursts of fire he alighted to plow through the dirt until the momentum of force had been expended then he lay prone gasping and choking almost blind but sensitive to the rain of gravel and debris the fearful cries of terrified men taste of smoke and dust and the rank smell of exploded gasoline  kurt got up to grope his way through the murky darkness he could escape now if that explosion had not killed his pursuers it had certainly scared them off he heard men running and yelling off to the left a rumble of a train came from below the village finally kurt got clear of the smoke to find that he had wandered off into one of the fields opposite the station here he halted to rest a little and to take cognizance of his condition it surprised him to find out that he was only bruised scratched and sore he had expected to find himself full of bullets  whew they blew up the gasolineshed he soliloquized but some of them miscalculated for if i dont lose my guess there was a bunch of iww closer to that gasoline than i was some adventure i got another punch at glidden i felt it in my bones that id get a crack at him oh for another and that bradford he did make me think how he slugged glidden good good theres your old american spirit coming out  kurt sat down to rest and to listen he found he needed a rest the only sound he heard was the rumbling of a train gradually drawing away a heavy smoke rose from the freightyard but there were no longer any blazes or patches of red fire perhaps the explosion had smothered all the flames  it had been a rather strenuous evening he reflected a good deal of satisfaction lay in the fact that he had severely punished some of the iww members if he had not done away with any of them  when he thought of glidden however he did not feel any satisfaction his fury was gone but in its place was a strong judgment that such men should be made examples he certainly did not want to run across glidden again because if he did he would have blood on his hands  kurts chance meeting with the man bradford seemed far the most interesting if not thrilling incident of the evening it opened up a new point of view how many of the men of that motley and illgoverned iww had grievances like bradfords perhaps there were many kurt tried to remember instances when in the northwest wheat country laborers and farmers had been cheated or deceived by men of large interests it made him grave to discover that he could recall many such instances his own father had long nursed a grievance against anderson neuman his fathers friend had a hard name and there were many who had profited by the misfortune of others that after all was a condition of life he took it for granted then that all members of the iww were not vicious or dishonest he was glad to have this proof the iww had been organized by labor agitators and they were the ones to blame and their punishment should be severest kurt began to see where the war cruel as it would be was going to be of immeasurable benefit to the country  it amazed kurt presently to note that dawn was at hand he waited awhile longer wanting to be sure not to meet any lingering members of the iww it appeared indeed that they had all gone  he crossed the freightyard a black ruin still smoldering lay where the elevators had been that wonderful wheat yield of his had been destroyed in the gray dawn it was hard to realize he felt a lump in his throat several tracks were littered with the remains of burned freightcars when kurt reached the street he saw men in front of the cottages some one hailed him and then several shouted they met him halfway jerry and olsen were in the party  we was pretty much scared said jerry and his haggard face showed his anxiety  boy we thought the iww had made off with you added olsen extending his hand  not much where are they replied kurt  gone on a freighttrain when jerry blew up the gasolineshed that fixed the iww  jerry did you do that queried kurt  i reckon  well you nearly blew me off the map i was running just below the shed when that explosion came i was lifted and thrown a mile thought id never light  so far as we can tell nobody was killed said olsen some of our fellows have got bulletholes to nurse but no one is bad hurt  thats good i guess we came out lucky replied kurt  you must have had some fight runnin off that way after the iwws we heard you shootin an the iwws yellin that part was fun tell us what happened to you  so kurt had to narrate his experiences from the time he stole off with the big shotgun until his friends saw him again it made rather a long story which manifestly was of exceeding interest to the villagers  dorn said one of the men you an jerry saved this here village from bein burned  we all had a share im sure glad theyre gone now what damage was done  it turned out that there had been little hurt to the property of the villagers some freightcars full of barley loaded and billed by the railroad people had been burned and this loss of grain would probably be paid for by the company the loss of wheat would fall upon kurt in the haste of that great harvest and its transportation to the village no provision had been made for loss the railroad company had not accepted his wheat for transportation and was not liable  olsen according to our agreement i owe you fifteen thousand dollars said kurt  yes but forget it replied olsen youre the loser here  ill pay it replied kurt  but boy youre ruined ejaculated the farmer you cant pay that big price now an we dont expect it  didnt you leave your burning fields to come help us save ours queried kurt  sure but there wasnt much of mine to burn  and so did many of the other men who came to help i tell you olsen that means a great deal to me ill pay my debt oror  but how can you interrupted olsen reasonably sometime when you raise another crop like this year then you could pay  the farm will bring that much more than i owe anderson  youll give up the farm exclaimed olsen  yes ill square myself  dorn we wont take that money said the farmer deliberately  youll have to take it ill send you a check soonperhaps tomorrow  give up your land repeated olsen why thats unheard of land in your family so many years what will you do  olsen i waited for the draft just on account of my father if it had not been for him id have enlisted anyway im going to war  that silenced the little group of grimyfaced men  jerry get our horses and well ride home said kurt  the tall foreman strode off kurt sensed something poignant in the feelings of the men especially olsen this matter of the iww dealing had brought kurt and his neighbors closer together and he thought it a good opportunity for a few words about the united states and the war and germany so he launched forth into an eloquent expression of some of his convictions he was still talking when jerry returned with the horses at length he broke off rather abruptly and saying goodby he mounted  hold on kurt called olsen and left the group to lay a hand on the horse and to speak low what you said struck me deep it applies pretty hard to us of the bend weve always been farmers with no thought of country an thats because we left our native country to come here im not german an ive never been for germany but many of my neighbors an friends are germans this war never has come close till now i know germans in this country they have left their fatherland an they are lost to that fatherland it may take some time to stir them up to make them see but the day will come take my word for it dorn the germanamericans of the northwest when it comes to a pinch will find themselves an be true to the country they have adopted     chapter xvi  the sun was up broad and bright burning over the darkened wheatfields when kurt and jerry reached home kurt had never seen the farm look like thatugly and black and bare but the fallow ground hundreds of acres of it billowing away to the south had not suffered any change of color or beauty to kurt it seemed to smile at him to bid him wait for another spring  and that thought was poignant for he remembered he must leave at once for many waters  he found when he came to wash the blood and dirt from his person that his bruises were many there was a lump on his head and his hands were skinned after changing his clothes and packing a few things in a valise along with his papers he went down to breakfast though preoccupied in mind he gathered that both the old housekeeper and jerry were surprised and dismayed to see him ready to leave he had made no mention of his intentions and it struck him that this somehow was going to be hard  indeed when the moment came he found that speech was difficult and his voice not natural  marthajerryim going away for good he said huskily i mean to make over the farm to mr anderson ill leave you in charge hereand recommend that you be kept on heres your money up to date im going away to the warand the chances are ill never come back  the old housekeeper who had been like a mother to him for many years began to cry and jerry struggled with a regret that he could not speak  abruptly kurt left them and hurried out of the house how strange that difficult feelings had arisenemotions he had never considered at all but the truth was that he was leaving his home forever all was explained in that  first he went to the graves of his father and mother out on the south slope where there were always wind and sun the fire had not desecrated the simple buryingground there was no grass but a few trees and bushes kept it from appearing bare  kurt sat down in the shade near his mothers grave and looked away across the hills with dim eyes something came to hima subtle assurance that his mother approved of his going to war kurt remembered herslow quiet patient hardworking dominated by his father  the slope was hot and still with only a rustling of leaves in the wind the air was dry kurt missed the sweet fragrance of wheat what odor there was seemed to be like that of burning weeds the great undulating open of the bend extended on three sides his parents had spent the best of their lives there and had now been taken to the bosom of the soil they loved it seemed natural many were the last restingplaces of toilers of the wheat there on those hills and surely in the long frontier days and in the ages before men innumerable had gone back to the earth from which they had sprung the dwellingplaces of men were beautiful it was only life that was sad in this poignant revealing hour kurt could not resist human longings and regrets though he gained incalculable strength from these two graves on the windy slope it was not for any man to understand to the uttermost the meaning of life                                       when he left he made his way across some of the fallow land and some of the stubble fields that had yielded alas so futilely such abundant harvest his boyhood days came back to him when he used to crush down the stubble with his bare feet every rod of the way revealed some memory he went into the barn and climbed into the huge airy loft it smelled of straw and years of dust and mice the swallows darted in and out twittering how friendly they were year after year they had returned to their neststhe young birds returning to the homes of the old home even for birds was a thing of first and vital importance  it was a very old barn that had not many more useful years to stand kurt decided that he would advise that it be strengthened there were holes in the rough shingling and boards were off the sides in the corners and on the rafters was an accumulation of grain dust as thick as snow mice ran in and out almost as tame as the swallows he seemed to be taking leave of them he recalled that he used to chase and trap mice with all a boys savage ingenuity but that boyish instinct along with so many things so potential then was gone now  best of all he loved the horses most of these were old and had given faithful service for many years indeed there was oneold badgethat had carried kurt when he was a boy once he and a neighbor boy had gone to the pasture to fetch home the cows old badge was there and nothing would do but that they ride him from the fence kurt mounted to his broad back then the neighbor boy full of the devil had struck old badge with a stick the horse set off at a gallop for home with kurt frantically holding on bouncing up and down on his back that had been the ride of kurts life his father had whipped him too for the adventure  how strangely vivid and thoughtcompelling were these ordinary adjuncts to his life there on the farm it was only upon giving them up that he discovered their real meaning the hills of bare fallow and of yellow slope the old barn with its horses swallows mice and odorous loft the cows and chickensthese appeared to kurt in the illuminating light of farewell in their true relation to him for they and the labor of them had made him what he was  slowly he went back to the old house and climbed the stairs only three rooms were there upstairs and one of these his mothers had not been opened for a long time it seemed just the same as when he used to go to her with his stubbed toes and his troubles she had died in that room and now he was a man going out to fight for his country how strange why in his mothers room he could not answer that puzzling question it stung him and with a last look a goodby and a word of prayer on his lips he turned to his own little room  he entered and sat down on the bed it was small with the slope of the roof running down so low that he had learned to stoop when close to the wall there was no ceiling bare yellow rafters and dark old shingles showed he could see light through more than one little hole the window was small low and without glass how many times he had sat there leaning out in the hot dusk of summer nights dreaming dreams that were never to come true alas for the hopes and illusions of boyhood so long as he could remember this room was most closely associated with his actions and his thoughts it was a part of him he almost took it into his confidence as if it were human never had he become what he had dared to dream he would yet somehow at that moment he was not ashamed it struck him then what few belongings he really had but he had been taught to get along with little  living in that room was over for him he was filled with unutterable sadness yet he would not have had it any different bigger and selfless things called to him he was bidding farewell to his youth and all that it related to a solemn procession of beautiful memories passed through his mind born of the nights there in that room of his boyhood with the wind at the eaves and the rain pattering on the shingles what strong and vivid pictures no grief no pain no war could rob him of this best heritage from the past  he got up to go and then a blinding rush of tears burned his eyes this room seemed dearer than all the rest of his home it was hard to leave his last look was magnified transformed goodby he whispered with a swelling constriction in his throat at the head of the dark old stairway he paused a moment and then with bowed head he slowly descended     chapter xvii  an august twilight settled softly down over many waters while lenore anderson dreamily gazed from her window out over the darkening fields so tranquil now after the days harvest toil  of late in thoughtful hours such as this she had become conscious of strain of longing she had fought out a battle with herself had confessed her love for kurt dorn and surrendering to the enchantment of that truth had felt her love grow with every thought of him and every beat of a thrilling pulse in spite of a longing that amounted to pain and a nameless dread she could not deny she was happy and she waited with a womans presaging sense of events for a crisis that was coming  presently she heard her father downstairs his heavy tread and hearty voice these strenuous harvest days left him little time for his family and lenore having lost herself in her dreams had not of late sought him out in the fields she was waiting and besides his keen eyes at once so penetrating and so kind had confused her few secrets had she ever kept from her father  wheres lenore she heard him ask down in the diningroom  lenorrys mooning replied kathleen with a giggle  ahhuh well whereabouts is she moonin went on anderson  why in her room retorted the child and you cant get a word out of her with a crowbar  andersons laugh rang out with a jingle of tableware he was eating his supper then lenore heard her mother and rose and kathleen all burst out with news of a letter come that day from jim away training to be a soldier it was rose who read this letter aloud to her father and outside of her swift soft voice the absolute silence attested to the attention of the listeners lenores heart shook as she distinguished a phrase here and there for jims letter had been wonderful for her he had gained weight he was getting husky enough to lick his father he was feeling great there was not a boy in the outfit who could beat him to a stuffed bag of a german soldier and he sure could make some job with that old bayonet so ran jims message to the loved ones at home then a strange pride replaced the quake in lenores heart not now would she have had jim stay home she had sacrificed him something subtler than thought told her she would never see him again and oh how dear he had become  then anderson roared his delight in that letter and banged the table with his fist the girls excitedly talked in unison but the mother was significantly silent lenore forgot them presently and went back to her dreaming it was just about dark when her father called  lenore  yes father she replied  im comin up he said and his heavy tread sounded in the hall it was followed by the swift patter of little feet say you kids go back i want to talk to lenore  daddy came kathleens shrill guilty whisper i was only in funabout her mooning  the father laughed again and slowly mounted the stairs lenore reflected uneasily that he seldom came to her room also when he was most concerned with trouble he usually sought her  hello all in the dark he said as he came in may i turn on the light  lenore assented though not quite readily but anderson did not turn on the light he bumped into things on the way to where she was curled up in her windowseat and he dropped wearily into lenores big armchair  how are you daddy she inquired  dog tired but feelin fine he replied ive got a meetin at eight an i need a rest reckon id like to smokean talk to youif you dont mind  id sure rather listen to my dad than any one she replied softly she knew he had come with news or trouble or need of help he always began that way she could measure his mood by the preliminaries before his disclosure and she fortified herself  wasnt that a great letter from the boy began anderson as he lit a cigar by the flash of the match lenore got a glimpse of his dark and unguarded face indeed she did well to fortify herself  fine he wrote it to me i laughed i swelled with pride it sent my blood racing it filled me with fight then i sneaked up here to cry  ahhuh exclaimed anderson with a loud sigh then for a moment of silence the end of his cigar alternately paled and glowed lenore did you get anyany kind of a hunch from jims letter  i dont exactly understand what you mean replied lenore  did somethinstrange an different come to you queried anderson haltingly as if words were difficult to express what he meant  why yesi had many strange feelings  jims letter was just like he talks but to me it said somethin he never meant an didnt know jim will never come back  yes dadi divined just that whispered lenore  strange about that mused anderson with a pull on his cigar  and then followed a silence lenore felt how long ago her father had made his sacrifice there did not seem to be any need for more words about jim but there seemed a bigness in the bond of understanding between her and her father a cause united them and they were sustained by unfaltering courage the great thing was the divine spark in the boy who could not have been held back lenore gazed out into the darkening shadows the night was very still except for the hum of insects and the cool air felt sweet on her face the shadows the silence the sleeping atmosphere hovering over many waters seemed charged with a quality of present sadness of the inexplicable great world moving to its fate  lenore you havent been around much lately resumed anderson sure youre missed an jake swears a lot more than usual  father you told me to stay at home she replied  so i did an i reckon its just as well but when did you ever before mind me  why i always obey you replied lenore with her low laugh  ahhuh not so id notice it lenore have you seen the big clouds of smoke driftin over many waters these last few days  yes and ive smelled smoke too from forest fire is it not  theres fire in some of the timber but the winds wrong for us to get smoke from the foothills  then where does the smoke come from queried lenore quickly  some of the bend wheat countrys been burned over  burned you mean the wheat  sure  oh what part of the bend  i reckon its what you called young dorns desert of wheat  oh what a pity have you had word  nothin but rumors yet but im fearin the worst an im sorry for our young friend  a sharp pain shot through lenores breast leaving behind an ache  it will ruin him she whispered  aw no not that bad declared anderson and there was a red streak in the dark where evidently he waved his cigar in quick decisive action itll only be tough on him an sort of embarrassin for mean you that boys proud ill bet he raised hell among them iwws if he got to them and anderson chuckled with the delight he always felt in the western appreciation of summary violence justly dealt  lenore felt the rising tide of her anger she was her fathers daughter yet always had been slow to wrath that was her mothers softness and gentleness tempering the hard spirit of her father but now her blood ran hot beating and bursting about her throat and temples and there was a leap and quiver to her body  dastards father those foreign iww devils should be shot she cried passionately to ruin those poor heroic farmers to ruin thatthat boy its a crime and oh to burn his beautiful field of wheatwith all his hopes oh what shall i call that  wal lass i reckon itd take stronger speech than any you know responded anderson an im usin that same  lenore sat there trembling with hot tears running down her cheeks with her fists clenched so tight that her nails cut into her palms rage only proved to her how impotent she was to avert catastrophe how bitter and black were some trials she shrank with a sense of acute pain at thought of the despair there must be in the soul of kurt dorn  lenore began anderson slowlyhis tone was stronger vibrant with feelingyou love this young dorn  a tumultuous shock shifted lenores emotions she quivered as before but this was a long shuddering thrill shot over her by that spoken affirmation what she had whispered shyly and fearfully to herself when alone and hiddenwhat had seemed a wonderful and forbidden secrether father had spoken out lenore gasped her anger fled as it had never been even in the dark she hid her face and tried to grasp the wild whirling thoughts and emotions now storming her he had not asked he had affirmed he knew she could not deceive him even if she would and then for a moment she was weak at the mercy of contending tides  sure i seen he was in love with you anderson was saying seen that right off an i reckon id not thought much of him if he hadnt been but i wasnt sure of you till the day dorn saved you from ruenke an fetched you back then i seen an ive been waitin for you to tell me  theresnothingto tell faltered lenore  i reckon there is he replied leaning over he threw his cigar out of the window and took hold of her  lenore had never felt him so impelling she was not proof against the strong warm pressure of his hand she felt in its clasp as she had when a little girl a great and sure safety it drew her irresistibly she crept into his arms and buried her face on his shoulder and she had a feeling that if she could not relieve her heart it would burst  oh ddad she whispered with a soft hushed voice that broke tremulously at her lips ii love him i do love him its terrible i knew itthat last time you took me to his homewhen he said he was going to war and oh now you know  anderson held her tight against his broad breast that lifted her with its great heave ahhuh reckon thats some relief i wasnt so darn sure said anderson has he spoken to you  spoken what do you mean  has dorn told you he loved you  lenore lifted her face if that confession of hers had been relief to her father it had been more so to her what had seemed terrible began to feel natural still she was all intense vibrating internally convulsed  yes he has she replied shyly but such a confession he told it as if to explain what he thought was boldness on his part he had fallen in love with me at first sight and then meeting me was too much for him he wanted me to know he was going away to war he asked nothing he seemed to apologize forfor daring to love me he asked nothing and he has absolutely not the slightest idea i care for him  wal ill be doggoned ejaculated anderson whats the matter with him  dad he is proud replied lenore dreamily hes had a hard struggle out there in his desert of wheat theyve always been poor he imagines theres a vast distance between an heiress of many waters and a farmer boy then more than all i think the war has fixed a morbid trouble in his mind god knows it must be real enough a house divided against itself is what he called his home his father is german he is american he worshiped his mother who was a native of the united states he has become estranged from his father i dont knowim not surebut i felt that he was obsessed by a calamity in his german blood i divined that was the great reason for his eagerness to go to war  wal kurt dorns not goin to war replied her father i fixed that all right  an amazing and rapturous start thrilled over lenore daddy she cried leaping up in his arms what have you done  i got exemption for him thats what replied anderson with great satisfaction  exemption exclaimed lenore in bewilderment  dont you remember the government official from washington you met him in spokane he was out west to inspire the farmers to raise more wheat there are many young farmers needed a thousand times more on the wheatfields than on the battlefields an kurt dorn is one of them that boy will make the biggest sower of wheat in the northwest i recommended exemption for dorn an hes exempted an doesnt know it  doesnt know hell never accept exemption declared lenore  lass im some worried myself rejoined anderson reckon youve explained dorn to methat somethin queer about him but hes sensible he can be told things an hell see how much more hes needed to raise wheat than to kill germans  but fathersuppose he wants to kill germans asked lenore earnestly how strangely she felt things about dorn that she could not explain  then by george its up to you my girl replied her father grimly understand me ive no sentiment about dorn in this matter one good wheatraiser is worth a dozen soldiers to win the warto feed our country after the warwhy only a man like me knows what it ll take it means millions of bushels of wheat ive sent my own boy hell fight with the best or the worst of them but hed never been a man to raise wheat all jim ever raised is hell an his kind is needed now so let him go to war but dorn must be kept home an thats up to lenore anderson  me ohhow cried lenore faintly  womans wiles daughter said anderson with his frank laugh when dorn comes let me try to show him his duty the northwest cant spare young men like him hell see that if he has lost his wheat hell come down here to make me take the land in payment of the debt ill accept it then hell say hes goin to war an then ill say he aint well have it out ill offer him such a chance here an in the bend that hed have to be crazy to refuse but if he has got a twist in his mindif he thinks hes got to go out an kill germansthen youll have to change him  but dad how on earth can i do that implored lenore distracted between hope and joy and fear  youre a woman now an women are in this war up to their eyes youll be doin more to keep him home than if you let him go hes moony about you you can make him stay an its your futureyour happiness child no anderson ever loves twice  i cannot throw myself into his arms whispered lenore very low  reckon i didnt mean you to returned anderson gruffly  thenifif he does not ask me toto marry himhow can i  lenore no man on earth could resist you if you just let yourself be sweetas sweet as you are sometimes dorn could never leave you  im not so sure of that daddy she murmured  then take my word for it he replied and he got up from the chair though still holding her ill have to go now but ive shown my hand to you your happiness is more to me than anythin else in this world you love that boy he loves you an i never met a finer lad wal heres the point he need be no slacker to stay home he can do more good here then outside of bein a wheat man for his army an his country he can be one for me im growin old my lass heres the biggest ranch in washington to look after an i want kurt dorn to look after it now lenore do we understand each other  she put her arms around his neck dear old daddy youre the wonderfulest father any girl ever had i would do my besti would obey even if i did not love kurt dorn to hear you speak so of himoh its sweet itchokes me now goodnight hurry before i  she kissed him and gently pushed him out of the room then before the sound of his slow footfalls had quite passed out of hearing she lay prone upon her bed her face buried in the pillow her hands clutching the coverlet utterly surrendered to a breaking storm of emotion terrible indeed had come that presaged crisis of her life love of her wild brother jim gone to atone forever for the errors of his youth love of her father confessing at last the sad fear that haunted him love of dorn that stalwart cleareyed lad who set his face so bravely toward a hopeless tragic fatethese were the burden of the flood of her passion and all they involved rushing her from girlhood into womanhood calling to her with imperious desires with deathless loyalty     chapter xviii  after lenores paroxysm of emotion had subsided and she lay quietly in the dark she became aware of soft hurried footfalls passing along the path below her window at first she paid no particular heed to them but at length the steady steps became so different in number and so regular in passing every few moments that she was interested to go to her window and look out watching there awhile she saw a number of men whispering and talking low come from the road pass under her window and disappear down the path into the grove then no more came lenore feared at first these strange visitors might be prowling iww men she concluded however that they were neighbors and farmhands come for secret conference with her father  important events were pending and her father had not taken her into his confidence it must be then something that he did not wish her to know only a week ago when the iww menace had begun to be serious she had asked him how he intended to meet it and particularly how he would take sure measures to protect himself anderson had laughed down her fears and lenore absorbed in her own tumult had been easily satisfied but now with her curiosity there returned a twofold dread  she put on a cloak and went downstairs the hour was still early she heard the girls with her mother in the sittingroom as lenore slipped out she encountered jake he appeared to loom right out of the darkness and he startled her  howdy miss lenore he said where might you be goin  jake im curious about the men i heard passing by my window she replied then she observed that jake had a rifle under his arm and she added what are you doing with that gun  wal ive sort of gone back to packin a winchester replied jake  lenore missed his smile ever ready for her jake looked somber  youre on guard she exclaimed  i reckon theres four of us boys round the house youre not goin off thet step miss lenore  oh ahhuh replied lenore imitating her father and bantering jake more for the fun of it than from any intention of disobeying him whos going to keep me from it  i am bosss orders miss lenore im doggone sorry but you sure oughtnt to be outdoors this far replied jake  look here my cowboy dictator im going to see where those men went said lenore and forthwith she stepped down to the path  then jake deliberately leaned his rifle against a post and laying hold of her with no gentle hands he swung her in one motion back upon the porch the broad light streaming out of the open door showed that whatever his force meant it had paled his face to exercise it  why jaketo handle me that way cried lenore in pretended reproach she meant to frighten or coax the truth out of him you hurt me  im beggin your pardon if i was rough said jake fact is im a little upset an i mean bizness  whereupon lenore stepped back to close the door and then in the shadow she returned to jake and whispered i was only in fun i would not think of disobeying you but you can trust me ill not tell and ill worry less if i know whats what jake is father in danger  i reckon but the best we could do was to make him stand fer a guard theres four of us cowpunchers with him all day an at night hes surrounded by guards there aint much chance of his gittin hurt so you neednt worry about thet  who are these men i heard passing where are they from  farmers ranchers cowboys from all over this side of the river  there must have been a lot of them said lenore curiously  reckon you never heerd the quarter of whats come to attend andersons meetin  what for tell me jake  the cowboy hesitated lenore heard his big hand slap round the riflestock  weve orders not to tell thet he replied  but jake you can tell me you always tell me secrets ill not breathe it  jake came closer to her and his tall head reached to a level with hers where she stood on the porch lenore saw his dark set face his gleaming eyes  wal its jest this here he whispered hoarsely your dad has organized vigilantes like he belonged to in the early days an its the vigilantes thet will attend to this iww outfit  those were thrilling words to jake as was attested by his emotion and they surely made lenores knees knock together she had heard many stories from her father of that famous old vigilante band secret making the law where there was no law  oh i might have expected that of dad she murmured  wal its sure the trick out here an your fathers the man to deal it therell be doggoned little wheat burned in this valley you can gamble on thet  im glad i hate the very thought jake you know about mr dorns misfortune  no i aint heerd about him but i knowed the bend was burnin over an of course i reckoned dorn would lose his wheat fact is he had the only wheat up there worth savin  wal these iwws an their german bosses hev put it all over the early days when rustlin cattle holdin up stagecoaches an jest plain cussedness was stylish  jake id rather have lived back in the early days mused lenore  me too though i aint no youngster he replied reckon youd better go in now miss lenore dont you worry none or lose any sleep  lenore bade the cowboy goodnight and went to the sittingroom her mother sat preoccupied with sad and thoughtful face rose was writing many pages to jim kathleen sat at the table surreptitiously eating while she was pretending to read  my but you look funny lenorry she cried  why dont you laugh then retorted lenore  youre white your eyes are big and purple you look like a starved cannibal if thats what its like to be in loveexcuse meill never fall for any man  you ought to be in bed mother i recommend the baby of the family be sent upstairs  yes child its long past your bedtime said mrs anderson  aw no wailed kathleen  yes ordered her mother  but youd never thought of itif lenorry hadnt said so replied kathleen  you should obey lenore reprovingly said mrs anderson  what me mind her burst out kathleen hotly as she got up to go well i guess not kathleen backed to the door and opened it then making a frightful face at lenore most expressive of ridicule and revenge she darted upstairs  my dear will you write to your brother inquired mrs anderson  yes replied lenore ill send mine with roses  mrs anderson bade the girls goodnight and left the room after that nothing was heard for a while except the scratching of pens  it was late when lenore retired yet she found sleep elusive the evening had made subtle indefinable changes in her she went over in mind all that had been said to her and which she felt with the result that one thing remained to torment and perplex and thrill herto keep kurt dorn from going to war                                       next day lenore did not go out to the harvest fields she expected dorn might arrive at any time and she wanted to be there when he came yet she dreaded the meeting she had to keep her hands active that day so in some measure to control her mind a thousand times she felt herself on the verge of thrilling and flushing her fancy and imagination seemed wonderfully active the day was more than usually golden crowned with an azure blue like the blue of the pacific she worked in her room helped her mother took up her knitting and sewed upon a dress and even lent a hand in the kitchen but action could not wholly dull the song in her heart she felt unutterably young as if life had just opened with haunting limitless beautiful possibilities never had the harvesttime been so sweet  anderson came in early from the fields that day he looked like a farmhand with his sweaty shirt his dusty coat his begrimed face and when he kissed lenore he left a great smear on her cheek  thats a harvest kiss my lass he said with his big laugh best of the whole year  it sure is dad she replied but ill wait till you wash your face before i return it hows the harvest going  we had trouble today he said  what happened  nothin much but it was annoyin we had some machines crippled an it took most of the day to fix them weve got a couple of hundred hands at work some of them are iwws thats sure but they all swear they are not an we have no way to prove it an we couldnt catch them at their tricks all the same weve got half your big wheatfield cut a thousand acres lenore some of the wheat ll go forty bushels to the acre but mostly under that  better than last harvest lenore replied gladly we are lucky father did you hear any news from the bend  sure did he replied and patted her head they sent me a message up from vale young dorn wired from kilo hed be here today  today echoed lenore and her heart showed a tendency to act strangely  yep hell be here soon said anderson cheerfully tell your mother mebbe hell come for supper an have a room ready for him  yes father replied lenore  wal if dorn sees you as you look nowsleeves rolled up apron on flour on your nosea regular farmer girlan sure huggable as jake saysyou wont have no trouble winnin him  how you talk exclaimed lenore with burning cheeks she ran to her room and made haste to change her dress  but dorn did not arrive in time for supper eight oclock came without his appearing after which with keen disappointment lenore gave up expecting him that night she was in her fathers study helping him with the harvest notes and figures when jake knocked and entered  dorns here he announced  good fetch him in replied anderson  father iid rather go whispered lenore  you stay right along by your dad was his reply an be a real anderson  when lenore heard dorns step in the hall the fluttering ceased in her heart and she grew calm how glad she would be to see him it had been the suspense of waiting that had played havoc with her feelings  then dorn entered with jake the cowboy set down a bag and went out he seemed strange to lenore and very handsome in his gray flannel suit  as he stepped forward in greeting lenore saw how white he was how tragic his eyes there had come a subtle change in his face it hurt her  miss anderson im glad to see you he said and a flash of red stained his white cheeks how are you  very well thank you she replied offering her hand im glad to see you  they shook hands while anderson boomed out hello son i sure am glad to welcome you to many waters  no doubt as to the ranchers warm and hearty greeting it warmed some of the coldness out of dorns face  thank you its good to comeyet itsits hard  lenore saw his throat swell his voice seemed low and full of emotion  bad news to tell said anderson wal forget it have you had supper  yes at huntington id have been here sooner but we punctured a tire my driver said the iww was breaking bottles on the roads  iww now whered i ever hear that name asked anderson quizzically bustin bottles hey wal theyll be bustin their heads presently sit down dorn you look fine only youre sure pale  i lost my father said dorn  what your old man dead aw thats tough  lenore felt an almost uncontrollable impulse to go to dorn oh im sorry she said  that is a surprise went on anderson rather huskily my lord but its only round the corner for every man come on tell us all about it an the rest of the bad news get it over then mebbe lenore n me  but anderson did not conclude his last sentence  dorns face began to work as he began to talk and his eyes were dark and deep burning with gloom  bad news it is indeed mr anderson the iww marked us youll remember your suggestion about getting my neighbors to harvest our wheat in a rush i went all over and almost all of them came we had been finding phosphorus everywhere then on the hot day fires broke out all around my neighbors left their own burning fields to save ours we fought fire we fought fire all around us late into the night my father had grown furious maddened at the discovery of how he had been betrayed by glidden you remember thethe plot in which some way my father was involved he would not believe the iww meant to burn his wheat and when the fires broke out he worked like a madman it killed him i was not with him when he died but jerry our foreman was and my fathers last words were tell my son i was wrong thank god he sent me that message i think in that he confessed the iniquity of the germans well my neighbor olsen managed the harvest he sure rushed it id have given a good deal for you and miss anderson to have seen all those big combines at work on one field it was great we harvested over thirtyeight thousand bushels and got all the wheat safely to the elevators at the station and that night the iww burned the elevators  andersons face turned purple he appeared about to explode there was a deep rumbling within his throat that lenore knew to be profanity restrained on account of her presence as for her own feelings they were a strange mixture of sadness for dorn and pride in her fathers fury and something unutterably sweet in the revelation about to be made to this unfortunate boy but she could not speak a word just then and it appeared that her father was in the same state  evidently the telling of his story had relieved dorn the strain relaxed in his white face and it lost a little of its stern fixity he got up and opening his bag he took out some papers  mr anderson id like to settle all this right now he said i want it off my mind  go ahead son an settle replied anderson thickly he heaved a big sigh and then sat down fumbling for a match to light his cigar when he got it lighted he drew in a big breath and with it manifestly a great draught of consoling smoke  i want to make over thethe landin fact all the propertyto youto settle mortgage and interest went on dorn earnestly and then paused  all right i expected that returned anderson as he emitted a cloud of smoke  the only thing is here dorn hesitated evidently with difficult speechthe property is worth more than the debt  sure i know said anderson encouragingly  i promised our neighbors big money to harvest our wheat you remember you told me to offer it well they left their own wheat and barley fields to burn and they saved ours and then they harvested it and hauled it to the railroad i owe andrew olsen fifteen thousand dollars for himself and the men who worked with him if i could pay thatidalmost be happy do you think my property is worth that much more than the debt  i think it isjust about replied anderson well mail the money to olsen lenore write out a check to andrew olsen for fifteen thousand  lenores hand trembled as she did as her father directed it was the most poorly written check she had ever drawn her heart seemed too big for her breast just then how cool and calm her father was never had she loved him quite so well as then when she looked up from her task it was to see a change in kurt dorn that suddenly dimmed her eyes  there send this to olsen said anderson well run into town in a day or so an file the papers  lenore had to turn her gaze away from dorn she heard him in broken husky accents try to express his gratitude  ahhuh suresure interrupted anderson hastily now listen to me things aint so bad as they look for instance were goin to fool the iww down here in the valley  how can you there are so many returned dorn  youll see were just waitin a chance  i saw hundreds of iww men between her and kilo  can you tell an iww from any other farmhand asked anderson  yes i can replied dorn grimly  wal i reckon we need you round here powerful much said the rancher dryly dorn ive got a big proposition to put up to you  lenore thrilling at her fathers words turned once more dorn appeared more composed  have you he inquired in surprise  sure but theres no hurry about tellin you suppose we put it off  id rather hear it now my stay here must be short iiyou know  hum sure i know wal then its this will you go in business with me want you to work that bend wheatfarm of yours for meon half shares more particular i want you to take charge of many waters you see imnot so spry as i used to be its a big job an ive a lot of confidence in you youll live here of course an run to an fro with one of my cars ive some landdevelopment schemesan to cut it short theres a big place waitin for you in the northwest  mr anderson cried dorn in a kind of rapturous amaze red burned out the white of his face thats great its too great to come true youre good if im lucky enough to come back from the war  son youre not goin to war interposed anderson  what exclaimed dorn blankly he stared as if he had not heard aright  anderson calmly repeated his assertion he was smiling he looked kind but underneath that showed the will that had made him what he was  but i am flashed the young man as if he had been misunderstood  listen youre like all boyshotheaded an hasty let me talk a little resumed anderson and he began to speak of the future of the northwest he painted that in the straight talk of a farmer who knew but what he predicted seemed like a fairytale then he passed to the needs of the government and the armies and lastly the people of the nation all depended upon the farmer wheat was indeed the staff of life and of victory young dorn was one of the farmers who could not be spared patriotism was a noble thing fighting however did not alone constitute a duty and loyalty to the nation this was an economic war a war of peoples and the nation that was the best fed would last longest adventure and the mistaken romance of war called indeed to all redblooded young americans it was good that they did call but they should not call the young farmer from his wheatfields  but ive been drafted dorn spoke with agitation he seemed bewildered by andersons blunt eloquence his intelligence evidently accepted the elder mans argument but something instinctive revolted  theres exemption my boy easy in your case replied anderson  exemption echoed dorn and a dark tide of blood rose to his temples i wouldnti couldnt ask for that  you dont need to said the rancher dorn do you recollect that washington official who called on you some time ago  yes replied dorn slowly  did he say anythin about exemption  no he asked me if i wanted it thats all  wal you had it right then i took it upon myself to get exemption for you that government official heartily approved of my recommendin exemption for you an he gave it  anderson you tookit uponyourself gasped dorn slowly rising if he had been whitefaced before he was ghastly now  sure i did good lord dorn dont imagine i ever questioned your nerve its only youre not neededor rather youre needed more at home i let my son jim go to war thats enough for one family  but dorn did not grasp the significance of andersons reply  how dared you what right had you he demanded passionately  no right at all lad replied anderson i just recommended it an the official approved it  but i refuse cried dorn with ringing fury i wont accept exemption  talk sense now even if you are mad returned anderson rising ive paid you a high compliment young man an offered you a lot more n you see i guess why wont you accept exemption  im going to war was the grim hard reply  but youre needed here youd be more of a soldier here you could do more for your country than if you gave a hundred lives cant you see that  yes i can assented dorn as if forced  youre no fool an youre a loyal american your duty is to stay home an raise wheat  ive a duty to myself returned dorn darkly  son your fortune stares you right in the facehere are you goin to turn from it  yes  you want to get in that war youve got to fight  yes  ahhuh anderson threw up his hands in surrender got to kill some germans hey why not come out to my harvest fields an hogstick a few of them german iwws  dorn had no reply for that  wal im doggone sorry resumed anderson i see its a tough place for you though i cant understand youll excuse me for mixin in your affairs an now considerin other ways ive really helped you i hope youll stay at my home for a few days we all owe you a good deal my family wants to make up to you will you stay  thank youyesfor a few days replied dorn  good thatll help some mebbe after runnin around many waters with lewith the girlsyoull begin to be reasonable i hope so  you think me ungrateful exclaimed dorn shrinking  i dont think nothin replied anderson i turn you over to lenore he laughed as he pronounced dorns utter defeat and his look at lenore was equivalent to saying the issue now depended upon her and that he had absolutely no doubt of its outcome lenore take him in to meet mother an the girls an entertain him ive got work to do  lenore felt the blushes in her cheeks and was glad dorn did not look at her he seemed locked in somber thought as she touched him and bade him come he gave a start then he followed her into the hall lenore closed her fathers door and the instant she stood alone with dorn a wonderful calmness came to her  miss anderson id rather notnot meet your mother and sisters tonight said dorn im upset wont it be all right to wait till tomorrow  surely but i think theyve gone to bed replied lenore as she glanced into the dark sittingroom so they have come let us go into the parlor  lenore turned on the shaded lights in the beautiful room how inexplicable was the feeling of being alone with him yet utterly free of the torment that had possessed her before she seemed to have divined an almost insurmountable obstacle in dorns will she did not have her fathers assurance it made her tremble to realize her responsibility that her fathers earnest wishes and her future of love or woe depended entirely upon what she said and did but she felt that indeed she had become a woman and it would take a womans wit and charm and love to change this tragic boy  missanderson he began brokenly with restraint let down your fatherdoesnt understand ive got to go and even if i am sparedi couldnt ever come back to work for himall the time in love with youi couldnt stand it hes so good i know i could care for him too oh i thought i was bitterly resignedhardinhuman but all this makes itsoso much worse  he sat down heavily and completely unnerved he covered his face with his hands his shoulders heaved and short strangled sobs broke from him  lenore had to overcome a rush of tenderness it was all she could do to keep from dropping to her knees beside him and slipping her arms around his neck in her agitation she could not decide whether that would be womanly or not only she must make no mistakes a hot sweet flush went over her when she thought that always as a last resort she could reveal her secret and use her power what would he do when he discovered she loved him  kurt i understand she said softly and put a hand on his shoulder and she stood thus beside him sadly troubled vaguely divining that her presence was helpful until he recovered his composure as he raised his head and wiped tears from his eyes he made no excuses for his weakness nor did he show any shame  miss anderson he began  please call me lenore i feel soso stiff when you are formal my friends call me lenore she said  you meanyou consider me your friend he queried  indeed i do she replied smiling  iim afraid i misunderstood your asking me to visit you he said i thank you im proud and glad that you call me your friend it will be splendid to rememberwhen i am over there  i wonder if we could talk of anything except trouble and war replied lenore plaintively if we cant then lets look at the bright side  is there a bright side he asked with his sad smile  every cloud you know for instance if you go to war  not if i am going he interrupted  oh so you say returned lenore softly and she felt deep in her the inception of a tremendous feminine antagonism it stirred along her pulse have your own way then but i say if you go think how fine it will be for me to get letters from you at the frontand to write you  youd like to hear from me you would answer he asked breathlessly  assuredly and ill knit socks for you  yourevery good he said with strong feeling  lenore again saw his eyes dim how strangely sensitive he was if he exaggerated such a little kindness as she had suggested if he responded to it with such emotion what would he do when the great and marvelous truth of her love was flung in his face the very thought made lenore weak  youll go to trainingcamp went on lenore and because of your wonderful physique and your intelligence you will get a commission then youll go tofrance lenore faltered a little in her imagined prospect youll be in the thick of the great battles youll give and take youll kill some of thosethosegermans youll be wounded and youll be promoted then the allies will win uncle sams grand army will have saved the world glorious youll come backhome to usto take the place dad offered you there that is the bright side  indeed the brightness seemed reflected in dorns face  i never dreamed you could be like this he said wonderingly  like what  i dont know just what i mean only youre different from mymy fancies not cold oror proud  youre beginning to get acquainted with me thats all after youve been here awhile  please dont make it so hard for me he interrupted appealingly i cant stay  dont you want to she asked  yes and i will stay a couple of days but no longer itll be hard enough to go then  perhaps iwell make it so hard for you that you cant go  then he gazed piercingly at her as if realizing a will opposed to his a conviction not in sympathy with his  youre going to keep this upthis trying to change my mind  i surely am she replied both wistfully and wilfully  why i should think youd respect my sense of duty  your duty is more here than at the front the government man said so my father believes it so do i you have some otherother thing you think duty  i hate germans he burst out with a dark and terrible flash  who does not she flashed back at him and she rose feeling as if drawn by a powerful current she realized then that she must be prepared any moment to be overwhelmed by the inevitable climax of this meeting but she prayed for a little more time she fought her emotions  she saw him tremble lenore id better run off in the night he said  instinctively with swift soft violence she grasped his hands perhaps the moment had come she was not afraid but the suddenness of her extremity left her witless  you would not that would be unkindnot like you at all to run off without giving me a chancewithout goodby promise me you will not  i promise he replied wearily as if nonplussed by her attitude you said you understood me but i cant understand you  she released his hands and turned away i promisethat you shall understandvery soon  you feel sorry for me you pity me you think ill only be cannonfodder for the germans you want to be nice kind sweet to meto send me away with better thoughts isnt that what you think  he was impatient almost angry his glance blazed at her all about him his tragic face his sadness his defeat his struggle to hold on to his manliness and to keep his faith in nobler thoughtsthese challenged lenores compassion her love and her womans combative spirit to save and to keep her own she quivered again on the brink of betraying herself and it was panic alone that held her back  kurti thinkpresently ill give you the surprise of your life she replied and summoned a smile  how obtuse he was how blind perhaps the stress of his emotion the terrible sense of his fate left him no keenness no outward penetration he answered her smile as if she were a child whose determined kindness made him both happy and sad  i dare say you will he replied you andersons are full of surprises but i wish you would not do any more for me i am like a dog the kinder you are to me the more i love you how dreadful to go away to warto violence and blood and deathto all thats brutalizingwith my heart and mind full of love for a noble girl like youif i come to love you any more ill not be a man  to lenore he looked very much of a man so tall and lithe and whitefaced with his eyes of fire his simplicity and his tragic refusal of all that was for most men the best of life whatever his ideal it was magnificent lenore had her chance then but she was absolutely unable to grasp it her blood beat thick and hot if she could only have been sure of herself or was it that she still cared too much for herself the moment had not come and in her tumult there was a fleeting fury at dorns blindness at his reverence of her that he dare not touch her hand did he imagine she was stone  let us say good night she said you are worn out and i amnot just myself tomorrow well begood friends father will take you to your room  dorn pressed the hand she offered and saying goodnight he followed her to the hall lenore tapped on the door of her fathers study then opened it  good night dad im going up she said will you look after kurt  sure come in son replied her father  lenore felt dorns strange intent gaze upon her as she passed him lightly she ran upstairs and turned at the top the hall was bright and dorn stood full in the light his face upturned it still wore the softer expression of those last few moments lenore waved her hand and he smiled the moment was natural youth to youth lenore felt it she marveled that he did not a sweet devil of wilful coquetry possessed her  oh did you say you wouldnt go she softly called  i said only good night he replied  if you dont go then you will never be general dorn will you what a pity  ill go and then it will beprivate dornmissing no relatives he replied  that froze lenore her heart quaked she gazed down upon him with all her soul in her eyes she knew it and did not care but he could not see  good night kurt dorn she called and ran to her room  composure did not come to her until she was ready for bed with the light out and in her old seat at the window night and silence and starlight always lent lenore strength she prayed to them now and to the spirit she knew dwelt beyond them and then she whispered what her intelligence told her was an unalterable factkurt dorn could never be changed but her sympathy and love and passion all that was womanly emotion stormed at her intelligence and refused to listen to it  nothing short of a great shock would divert dorn from his tragic headlong rush toward the fate he believed unalterable lenore sensed a terrible sinister earnestness in him she could not divine its meaning but it was such a driving passion that no man possessing it and free to the violence of war could ever escape death even if by superhuman strife and the guidance of providence he did escape death he would have lost something as precious as life if dorn went to war at allif he ever reached those bloodred trenches in the thick of fire and shriek and ferocitythere to express in horrible earnestness what she vaguely felt yet could not definethen so far as she was concerned she imagined that she would not want him to come back  that was the strength of spirit that breathed out of the night and the silence to her dorn would go to war as no ordinary soldier to obey to fight to do his duty but for some strange unfathomable obsession of his own and therefore if he went at all he was lost war in its inexplicable horror killed the souls of endless hordes of men therefore if he went at all she too was lost to the happiness that might have been hers she would never love another man she could never marry she would never have a child  so his soul and her happiness were in the balance weighed against a womans power it seemed to lenore that she felt hopelessly unable to carry the issue to victory and yet on the other hand a tumultuous and wonderful sweetness of sensation called to her insidiously of the infallible potency of love what could she do to save dorns life and his soul there was only one answer to that she would do anything she must make him love her to the extent that he would have no will to carry out this desperate intent there was little time to do that the gradual growth of affection through intimacy and understanding was not possible here it must come as a flash of lightning she must bewilder him with the revelation of her love and then by all its incalculable power hold him there  it was her fathers wish it would be the salvation of dorn it meant all to her but if to keep him there would make him a slacker lenore swore she would die before lifting her lips to his the government would rather he stayed to raise wheat than go out and fight men lenore saw the sanity the cardinal importance of that as her father saw it so from all sides she was justified and sitting there in the darkness and silence with the cool wind in her face she vowed she would be all woman all sweetness all love all passion all that was feminine and terrible to keep dorn from going to war     chapter xix  lenore awakened early the morning seemed golden birds were singing at her window what did that day hold in store for her she pressed a hand hard on her heart as if to hold it still but her heart went right on swift exultant throbbing with a fullness that was almost pain  early as she awakened it was nevertheless late when she could direct her reluctant steps downstairs she had welcomed every little suggestion and task to delay the facing of her ordeal  there was merriment in the sittingroom and dorns laugh made her glad the girls were at him and her fathers pleasant deep voice chimed in evidently there was a controversy as to who should have the society of the guest they had all been to breakfast mrs anderson expressed surprise at lenores tardiness and said she had been called twice lenore had heard nothing except the birds and the music of her thoughts she peeped into the sittingroom  didnt you bring me anything kathleen was inquiring of dorn  dorn was flushed and smiling anderson stood beaming upon them and rose appeared to be inclined toward jealousy  whyyou seei didnt even know lenore had a little sister dorn explained  oh exclaimed kathleen evidently satisfied all lenorrys beaux bring me things but i believe im going to like you best  lenore had intended to say good morning she changed her mind however at kathleens naïve speech and darted back lest she be seen she felt the blood hot in her cheeks that awful irrepressible kathleen if she liked dorn she would take possession of him and kathleen was lovable irresistible lenore had a sudden thought that kathleen would aid the good cause if she could be enlisted while lenore ate her breakfast she listened to the animated conversation in the sittingroom presently her father came in  hello lenore did you get up he greeted her cheerily  i hardly ever did it seems dad the day was something to face she said  ahhuh its like getting up to work lenore the biggest duty of life is to hide your troubles dorn looks like a human bein this mornin the kids have won him i reckon he needs that sort of cheer let them have him then after a while you fetch him out to the wheatfield lenore our harvestin is half done every day ive expected some trick or deviltry but it hasnt come yet  are any of the other ranchers having trouble she inquired  i hear rumors of bad work but facts told by ranchers an men who were here only yesterday make little of the rumors all that burnin of wheat an timber an the destruction of machines an strikin of farmhands havent hit golden valley yet we wont need any militia here you can bet on that  father it wont do to be overconfident she said earnestly you know you are the mark for the iww sabotage if you are not carefulany moment  lenore paused with a shudder  lass im just like i was in the old rustlin days an ive surrounded myself with cowboys like jake an bill an old hands who pack guns an keep still as in the good old western days were just waitin for the iwws to break loose  then what queried lenore  wal well chase that outfit so fast itll be lost in dust he replied  but if you chase them away it ll only be into another state where theyll make trouble for other farmers you dont do any real good  my dear i reckon youve said somethin strong he replied soberly and went out  then kathleen came bouncing in her beautiful eyes were full of mischief and excitement lenorry your new beau has all the others skinned to a frazzle she said  for once lenore did not scold kathleen but drew her close and whispered do you want to please me do you want me to do everything for you  i sure do replied kathleen with wonderful eyes  then be nice sweet good to him make him love you dont tease him about my other beaux think how you can make him like many waters  will you promiseeverything whispered kathleen solemnly evidently lenores promises were rare and reliable  yes cross my heart there and you must not tell  kathleen was a precocious child with all the potentialities of youth she could not divine lenores motive but she sensed a new and fascinating mode of conduct for herself she seemed puzzled a little at lenores earnestness  its a bargain she said soberly as if she had accepted no slight gauge  now kathleen take him all over the gardens the orchards the corrals and barns directed lenore be sure to show him the horsesmy horses especially take him round the reservoirand everywhere except the wheatfields i want to take him there myself besides father does not want you girls to go out to the harvest  kathleen nodded and ran back to the sittingroom lenore heard them all go out together before she finished breakfast her mother came in again  lenore i like mr dorn she said meditatively he has an oldfashioned manner that reminds me of my boy friends when i was a girl i mean hes more courteous and dignified than boys are nowadays a splendidlooking boy too only his face is so sad when he smiles he seems another person  no wonder hes sad replied lenore and briefly told kurt dorns story  ah sighed mrs anderson we have fallen upon evil days poor boy your father seems much interested in him and you are too my daughter  yes i am replied lenore softly  two hours later she heard kathleens gay laughter and pattering feet lenore took her widebrimmed hat and went out on the porch dorn was indeed not the same somber young man he had been  good morning kurt said lenore extending her hand  the instant he greeted her she saw the stiffness the aloofness had gone from him kathleen had made him feel at home he looked younger there was color in his face  kathleen ill take charge of mr dorn now if you will allow me that pleasure  lenorry i sure hate to give him up we sure had a fine time  did he like many waters  well if he didnt hes a grand fibber replied kathleen but he did you cant fool me i thought id never get him back to the house then as she tripped up the porch steps she shook a finger at dorn remember  ill never forget said dorn and he was as earnest as he was amiable then as she disappeared he exclaimed to lenore what an adorable little girl  do you like kathleen  like her dorn laughed in a way to make light of such words my life has been empty i see that  come well go out to the wheatfields said lenore what do you think of many waters this is harvesttime you see many waters at its very best  i can hardly tell you he replied all my life ive lived on my barren hills i seem to have come to another world many waters is such a ranch as i never dreamed of the orchards the fruit the gardensand everywhere running water it all smells so fresh and sweet and then the green and red and purple against that background of blazing gold many waters is verdant and fruitful the bend is desert  now that youve been here do you like it better than your barren hills asked lenore  kurt hesitated i dont know he answered slowly but maybe that desert ive lived in accounts for much i lack  would you like to stay at many watersif you werent going to war  i might prefer many waters to any place on earth its a paradise but i would not chose to stay here  why when you returnyou knowmy father will need you here and if anything should happen to him i will have to run the ranch then i would need you  dorn stopped in his tracks and gazed at her as if there were slight misgivings in his mind  lenore if you owned this ranch would you want meme for your manager he asked bluntly  yes she replied  you would knowing i was in love with you  well i had forgotten that she replied with a little laugh it would be rather embarrassingand funny wouldnt it  yes it would he said grimly and walked on again he made a gesture of keen discomfiture i knew you hadnt taken me seriously  i believed you but i could not take you very seriously she murmured  why not he demanded as if stung and his eyes flashed on her  because your declaration was not accompanied by the usualquestionthat a girl naturally expects under such circumstances  good heaven you say that lenore anderson you think me insincere because i did not ask you to marry me he asserted with bitter pathos  no i merely said you were notvery serious she replied it was fascination to torment him this way yet it hurt her too she was playing on the verge of a precipice not afraid of a misstep but glorying in the prospect of a leap into the abyss something deep and strange in her bade her make him show her how much he loved her if she drove him to desperation she would reward him  i am going to war he began passionately to fight for you and your sisters i am ruined the only noble and holy feeling left to methat i can have with me in the dark hoursis my love for you if you do not believe that i am indeed the most miserable of beggars most boys going to the front leave many behind whom they love i have no one but you dont make me a coward  i believe you forgive me she said  if i had asked you to marry memewhy id have been a selfish egotistical fool you are far above me and i want you to know i know it but even if i had nothad the blood i haveeven if i had been prosperous instead of ruined id never have asked you unless i came back whole from the war  they had been walking out the lane during this conversation and had come close to the wheatfield the day was hot but pleasant the dry wind being laden with harvest odors the hum of the machines was like the roar in a flourmill  if you go to warand come back whole began lenore tantalizingly she meant to have no mercy upon him it was incredible how blind he was yet how glad that made her he resembled his desert hills barren of many little things but rich in hidden strength heroic of mold  then just to add one more to the conquests girls love illill propose to you he declared banteringly  beware boy i might accept you she exclaimed  his play was shortlived he could not be gay even under her influence  please dont jest he said frowning cant we talk of something besides love and war  they seem to be popular just now she replied audaciously anyway alls fairyou know  no it is not fair he returned lowvoiced and earnest so once for all let me beg of you dont jest oh i know youre sweet youre full of so many wonderful surprising words and looks i cant understand you but i beg of you dont make me a fool  well if you pay such compliments and if iwant themwhat then you are very original very gallant mr kurt dorn and ii rather like you  ill get angry with you he threatened  you couldnt im the only girl youre going to leave behindand if you got angry id never write to you  it thrilled lenore and wrung her heart to see how her talk affected him he was in a torment he believed she spoke lightly girlishly to tease himthat she was only a gayhearted girl fancyfree and just a little proud of her conquest over even him  i surrender say what you like he said resignedly ill stand anythingjust to get your letters  if you go ill write as often as you want me to she replied  with that they emerged upon the harvestfield machines and engines dotted the golden slope and wherever they were located stood towering strawstacks horses and men and wagons were strung out as far as the eye could see long streams of chaff and dust and smoke drifted upward  lenore theres trouble in the very air said dorn look  she saw a crowd of men gathering round one of the great combineharvesters some one was yelling  lets stay away from trouble replied lenore weve enough of our own  im going over there declared dorn perhaps youd better wait for meor go back  well youre the first boy who ever  come on he interrupted with grim humor id rather enjoy your seeing me break looseas i will if theres any iww trickery  before they got to the little crowd lenore both heard and saw her father he was in a rage and not aware of her presence jake and bill the cowboys hovered over him anderson strode to and fro from one side of the harvester to the other lenore did not recognize any of the harvesthands and even the driver was new to her they were not a typical western harvest crew that was certain she did not like their sullen looks and dorns muttered imprecation the moment he neared them confirmed her own opinion  andersons foreman stood gesticulating pale and anxious of face  no i dont hold you responsible roared the rancher but i want action i want to know why this machines broke down  it was in perfect workin order declared the foreman i dont know why it broke down  thats the fourth machine in two days no accident i tell you shouted anderson then he espied dorn and waved a grimy hand come here dorn he called and stepped out of the group of dusty men somethin wrong here this new harvesters broke down its a mccormack an new to us but it has worked great an i jest believe its been tampered with do you know these mccormack harvesters  yes theyre reliable replied dorn  ahhuh wal get your coat off an see whats been done to this one  dorn took off his coat and was about to throw it down when lenore held out her hand for it  unhitch the horses said dorn  anderson gave this order which was complied with then dorn disappeared around or under the big machine  lenore ill bet he tells us somethin in a minute said anderson to her these new claptraps are beyond me im no mechanic  dad i dont like the looks of your harvesthands whispered lenore  wal this is a sample of the lot i hired no society for you my lass  im going to stay now she replied  dorn appeared to be raising a racket somewhere out of sight under or inside the huge harvester rattling and rasping sounds creaks and cracks attested to his strong and impatiently seeking hands  presently he appeared his white shirt had been soiled by dust and grease there was chaff in his fair hair in one grimy hand he held a large monkeywrench what struck lenore most was the piercing intensity of his gaze as he fixed it upon her father  anderson i knew right where to find it he said in a sharp hard voice this monkeywrench was thrown upon the platform carried to the elevator into the thresher your machine is torn to pieces insideout of commission  ahhuh exclaimed anderson as if the truth was a great relief  whered that monkeywrench come from asked the foreman aghast its not ours i dont buy that kind  anderson made a slight significant motion to the cowboys they lined up beside him and like him they looked dangerous  come here kurt he said and then putting lenore before him he moved a few steps aside out of earshot of the shiftyfooted harvesthands say you called the turn right off didnt you  anderson ive had a hard experience all in one harvesttime replied dorn ill bet you i can find out who threw this wrench into your harvester  i dont doubt you my lad but how  it had to be thrown by one of these men near the machine that harvester hasnt run twenty feet from where the trick was done let these men face me ill find the guilty one  wait till we get lenore out of the way replied anderson  boss me an bill can answer fer thet outfit as it stands an no risks fer nobody put in jake coolly  andersons reply was cut short by a loud explosion it frightened lenore she imagined one of the steamengines had blown up  that threshers on fire shouted dorn pointing toward a big machine that was attached by an endless driving belt to an engine  the workmen uttering yells and exclamations ran toward the scene of the new accident leaving anderson his daughter and the foreman behind smoke was pouring out of the big harvester the harvesthands ran wildly around shouting and calling evidently unable to do anything the line of wagons full of wheatsheaves broke up men dragged at the plunging horses then flame followed the smoke out of the thresher  ive heard of threshers catchin fire said anderson as if dumfounded but i never seen one now how on earth did that happen  another trick anderson replied dorn some iww has stuffed a handful of matches into a wheatsheaf or maybe a small bomb  ahhuh come on lets go over an see my money burn up kurt im gettin some new education these days  dorn appeared to be unable to restrain himself he hurried on ahead of the others and anderson whispered to lenore ill bet somethins comin off  this alarmed lenore yet it also thrilled her  the threshingmachine burned like a house of cards farmhands came running from all over the field but nothing manifestly could be done to save the thresher anderson holding his daughters arm calmly watched it burn there was excitement all around it had not been communicated however to the rancher he looked thoughtful the foreman darted among the groups of watchers and his distress was very plain dorn had gotten out of sight lenore still held his coat and wondered what he was doing she was thoroughly angry and marveled at her fathers composure the big thresher was reduced to a blazing smoking hulk in short order  dorn came striding up his face was pale and his mouth set  mr anderson youve got to make a strong standand quick he said deliberately  i reckon an im ready if its the right time replied the rancher but what can we prove  thats proof declared dorn pointing at the ruined thresher do you know all your honest hands  yes an ive got enough to clean up this outfit in no time were only waitin  what for  wal i reckon for whats just come off  dont let them go any farther look at these fellows cant you tell the iwws from the others  no i cant unless i count all the new harvesthands iwws  every one you dont know here is in with that gang declared dorn and he waved a swift hand at the groups his eyes swept piercingly over and apparently through the men nearest at hand  at this juncture jake and bill with two other cowboys strode up to anderson  another accident boss said jake sarcastically aint it about time we corralled some of this outfit  anderson did not reply he had suddenly imitated lenore who had become solely bent upon dorns look that indeed was cause for interest it was directed at a member of the nearest groupa man in rough garb with slouchhat pulled over his eyes as lenore looked she saw this man suddenly becoming aware of dorns scrutiny hastily turn and walk away  hold on called dorn his voice a ringing command it halted every moving person on that part of the field then dorn actually bounded across the intervening space  come on boys said anderson get in this dorns spotted some one an now thats all we want lenore stick close behind me jake you keep near her  they moved hastily to back up dorn who had already reached the workman he had halted anderson took out a whistle and blew such a shrill blast that it deafened lenore and must have been heard all over the harvestfield not improbably that was a signal agreed upon between anderson and his men lenore gathered that all had been in readiness for a concerted movement and that her father believed dorns action had brought the climax  havent i seen you before queried dorn sharply  the man shook his head and kept it bent a little and then he began to edge back nearer to the stragglers who slowly closed into a group behind him he seemed nervous shifty  he cant speak english spoke up one of them gruffly  dorn looked aggressive and stern suddenly his hand flashed out to snatch off the slouchhat which hid the fellows face amazingly a gray wig came with it this man was not old he had fair thick hair  for a moment dorn gazed at the slouchhat and wig then with a fierce action he threw them down and swept a clutching hand for the man the fellow dodged and straightening up he reached for a gun but dorn lunged upon him then followed a hard grappling sound and a hoarse yell something bright glinted in the sun it made a sweeping circle belched fire and smoke the report stunned lenore she shut her eyes and clung to her father she heard cries a scuffling sodden blows  jake bill called anderson hold on no gunplay yet dorns makin hash out of that fellow but watch the others sharp  then lenore looked again dorn had twisted the man around and was in the act of stripping off the further disguise of beard disclosing the pale and convulsed face of a comparatively young man  glidden burst out dorn his voice had a terrible ring of furious amaze his whole body seemed to gather as in a knot and then to spring the man called glidden went down before that onslaught and his gun went flying aside  three of gliddens group started for it the cowboy bill leaped forward a gun in each hand hyar back he yelled and then all except the two struggling principals grew rigid  lenores heart was burning in her throat the movements of dorn were too swift for her sight but glidden she saw handled as if by a giant up and down he seemed thrown with bloody face flinging arms while he uttered hoarse bawls dorns form grew more distinct it plunged and swung in frenzied energy lenore heard men running and yells from all around her father spread wide his arm before her so that she had to bend low to see he shouted a warning jake was holding a gun thrust forward  boss hes goin to kill glidden said the cowboy in a low tone  andersons reply was incoherent but its meaning was plain  lenores lips and tongue almost denied her utterance oh dont let him  the crowd behind the wrestling couple swayed back and forth and men changed places here and there bill strode across the space guns leveled evidently this action was due to the threatening movements of several workmen who crouched as if to leap on dorn as he whirled in his fight with glidden  wal its about time yelled anderson as a number of lean rangy men rushing from behind reached bills side there to present an armed and threatening front  all eyes now centered on dorn and glidden lenore seeing clearly for the first time suffered a strange hot paroxysm of emotion never before experienced by her it left her weak it seemed to stultify the cry that had been trying to escape her she wanted to scream that dorn must not kill the man yet there was a ferocity in her that froze the cry gliddens coat and blouse were half torn off blood covered him he strained and flung himself weakly in that iron clutch he was beaten and bent back his tongue hung out bloody fluttering with strangled cries a ghastly face appalling in its fear of death  lenore broke her mute spell of mingled horror and passion  for gods sake dont let dorn kill him she implored  why not muttered anderson thats glidden he killed dorns fatherburned his wheatruined him  dadfor mysake she cried brokenly  jake stop him yelled anderson pull him off  as lenore saw it with eyes again half failing her jake could not separate dorn from his victim  leggo dorn he yelled youre cheatin the gallowshey bill hes a bull help hyarquick  lenore did not see the resulting conflict but she could tell by something that swayed the crowd when glidden had been freed  hold up this outfit yelled anderson to his men come on jake drag him along jake appeared leading the disheveled and wildeyed dorn son you did my heart good but there was some around here who didnt want you to spill blood an thats well for i am seein redjake you take dorn an lenore a piece toward the house then hurry back  then lenore felt that she had hold of dorns arm and she was listening to jake without understanding a word he said while she did hear her fathers yell of command line up there you iwws  jake walked so swiftly that lenore had to run to keep up dorn stumbled he spoke incoherently he tried to stop at this lenore clasped his arm and cried oh kurt come home with me  they hurried down the slope lenore kept looking back the crowd appeared bunched now with little motion that relieved her there was no more fighting  presently dorn appeared to go more willingly he had relaxed let go jake he said imall rightnow that arm hurts  wal youll excuse me dorn for handlin you rough mebbe you dont remember punchin me one when i got between you an glidden  did i i couldnt see jake said dorn his voice was weak and had a spent ring of passion in it he did not look at lenore but kept his face turned toward the cowboy  i reckon this s fur enough rejoined jake halting and looking back no one comin an therell be hell to pay out there you go on to the house with miss lenore will you  yes replied dorn  rustle along then an you miss lenore dont you worry none about us  lenore nodded and holding dorns arm closely she walked as fast as she could down the lane  ii kept your coat she said though i never thought of ittill just now  she was trembling all over hot and cold by turns afraid to look up at him yet immensely proud of him with a strange sickening dread he walked rather dejectedly now or else bent somewhat from weakness she stole a quick glance at his face it was white as a sheet suddenly she felt something wet and warm trickle from his arm down into her hand blood she shuddered but did not lose her hold after a faintish instant there came a change in her  are youhurt she asked  i guessnot i dont know he said  but thethe blood she faltered  he held up his hands his knuckles were bloody and it was impossible to tell whether from injury to them or not but his left forearm was badly cut  the gun cut me and he bit me too said dorn im sorry you were there what a beastly spectacle for you  never mind me she murmured im all right now but oh  she broke off eloquently  was it you who had the cowboys pull me off him jake said as he broke me loose for miss lenores sake  it was dad who sent them but i begged him to  that was glidden the iww agitator and german agent hejust the same as murdered my father he burned my wheatlost my all  yes ii know kurt whispered lenore  i meant to kill him  that was easy to tell oh thank god you did not come dont let us stop she could not face the piercing gloomy eyes that went through her  why should you care some one will have to kill glidden  oh do not talk so she implored surely now youre glad you did not  i dont understand myself but im certainly sorry you were there theres a beast in menin me i had a gun in my pocket but do you think id have used it i wanted to feel his flesh tear his bones break his blood spurt  kurt  yes that was the hun in me he declared in sudden bitter passion  oh my friend do not talk so she cried you make meoh there is no hun in you  yes thats what ails me  there is not she flashed back roused to passion you had been made desperate you acted as any wronged man you fought he tried to kill you i saw the gun no one could blame you i had my own reason for begging dad to keep you from killing hima selfish womans reason but i tell you i was so furiousso wrought upthat if it had been any man but youhe should have killed him  lenore youre beyond my understanding replied dorn with emotion but i thank youfor excusing mefor standing up for me  it was nothingoh how you bleed doesnt that hurt  ive no painno feeling at allexcept a sort of dying down in me of what must have been hell  they reached the house and went in no one was there which fact relieved lenore  im glad mother and the girls wont see you she said hurriedly go up to your room ill bring bandages  he complied without any comment lenore searched for what she needed to treat a wound and ran upstairs dorn was sitting on a chair in his room holding his arm from which blood dripped to the floor he smiled at her  you would be a pretty red cross nurse he said  lenore placed a bowl of water on the floor and kneeling beside dorn took his arm and began to bathe it he winced the blood covered her fingers  my blood on your hands he exclaimed morbidly german blood  kurt youre out of your head retorted lenore hotly if you dare to say that again ill she broke off  what will you do  lenore faltered what would she do a revelation must come sooner or later and the strain had begun to wear upon her she was stirred to her depths and instincts there were leaping no sweet gentle kindly sympathy would avail with this tragic youth he must be carried by storm something of the violence he had shown with glidden seemed necessary to make him forget himself all his whole soul must be set in one direction he could not see that she loved him when she had looked it acted it almost spoken it his blindness was not to be endured  kurt dorn dont dare toto say that again  she ceased bathing his arm and looked up at him suddenly quite pale  i apologize i am only bitter he said dont mind what i say its so good of youto do this  then in silence lenore dressed his wound and if her heart did beat unwontedly her fingers were steady and deft he thanked her with moody eyes seeing far beyond her  when i lieover therewith  if you go she interrupted he was indeed hopeless i advise you to rest a little  id like to know what becomes of glidden he said  so should i that worries me  werent there a lot of cowboys with guns  so many that theres no need for you to go outand start another fight  i did start it didnt i  you surely did she left him then turning in the doorway to ask him please to be quiet and let the day go by without seeking those excited men again he smiled but he did not promise  for lenore the time dragged between dread and suspense from her window she saw a motley crowd pass down the lane to the main road no harvesters were working at the noon meal only her mother and the girls were present word had come that the iww men were being driven from many waters mrs anderson worried and lenores sisters for once were quiet all afternoon the house was lifeless no one came or left lenore listened to every little sound it relieved her that dorn had remained in his room her hope was that the threatened trouble had been averted but something told her that the worst was yet to come  it was nearly suppertime when she heard the men returning they came in a body noisy and loitering as if reluctant to break away from one another she heard the horses tramp into the barns and the loud voices of drivers  when she went downstairs she encountered her father he looked impressive triumphant his effort at evasion did not deceive lenore but she realized at once that in this instance she could not get any news from him he said everything was all right and that iww men were to be deported from washington but he did not want any supper and he had a lowvoiced significant interview with dorn lenore longed to know what was pending dorns voice when he said at his door anderson ill go was ringing hard and deadly it frightened lenore go where what were they going to do lenore thought of the vigilantes her father had organized  suppertime was an ordeal dorn ate a little then excusing himself he went back to his room lenore got through the meal somehow and going outside she encountered jake the moment she questioned him she knew something extraordinary had taken place or was about to take place she coaxed and entreated for once jake was hard to manage but the more excuses he made the more he evaded her the greater became lenores need to know and at last she wore the cowboy out he could not resist her tears which began to flow in spite of her  see hyar miss lenore i reckon you care a heap fer young dornbeggin your pardon queried jake  care for him jake i love him  then take a hunch from me an keep him homewith youtonight  does father want kurt dorn to gowherever hes going  wal i should smile your dad likes the way dorn handles iwws replied jake significantly  vigilantes whispered lenore     chapter xx  lenore waited for kurt and stood half concealed behind the curtains it had dawned upon her that she had an ordeal at hand her heart palpitated she heard his quick step on the stairs she called before she showed herself  hello oh but you startled me he exclaimed he had been surprised too at the abrupt meeting certainly he had not been thinking of her his pale determined face attested to stern and excitable thought  he halted before her  where are you going asked lenore  to see your father  what about  its rather important he replied with hesitation  will it take long  he showed embarrassment ihewell be occupied most all evening  indeed very well if youd rather beoccupiedthan spend the evening with me lenore turned away affecting a disdainful and hurt manner  lenore its not that he burst out iid rather spend an evening with you than anybody elseor do anything  thats very easy to say mr dorn she returned lightly  but its true he protested  come out of the hall father will hear us she said and led him into the room it was not so light in there but what light there was fell upon his face and left hers in shadow  ive made anan appointment for tonight he declared with difficulty  cant you break it she asked  no that would lay me open toto cowardiceperhaps your fathers displeasure  kurt dorn its brave to give up some things and if you go youll incur my displeasure  go he ejaculated staring at her  oh i know and imwell not flattered to see youd rather go hang iwws than stay here with me lenore did not feel the assurance and composure with which she spoke she was struggling with her own feelings she believed that just as soon as she and kurt understood each otherfaced each other without any dissimulationthen she would feel free and strong if only she could put the situation on a sincere footing she must work for that her difficulty was with a sense of falsity there was no time to plan she must change his mind  her words had made him start  then you know he asked  of course  im sorry for that he replied soberly as he brushed a hand up through his wet hair  but you will stay home  no he returned shortly and he looked hard  kurt i dont want you mixed up with any lynchingbees she said earnestly  im a citizen of washington ill join the vigilantes im american ive been ruined by these iwws no man in the west has lost so much fatherhomelandmy great harvest of wheat why shouldnt i go  theres no reason exceptme she replied rather unsteadily  he drew himself up with a deep breath as if fortifying himself thats a mighty good reason but you will be kinder if you withdraw your objections  cant you conceive of any reason why ii beg you not to go  i cant he replied staring at her it seemed that every moment he spent in her presence increased her effect upon him lenore felt this and that buoyed up her failing courage  kurt youve made a very distressinga terrible and horrible blunder she said with a desperation that must have seemed something else to him  my heavens what have i done he gasped his face growing paler how ready he was to see more catastrophe it warmed her heart and strengthened her nerve  the moment had come even if she did lose her power of speech she still could show him what his blunder was nothing in all her life had ever been a hundredth part as hard as this yet as the words formed her whole heart seemed to be behind them forcing them out if only he did not misunderstand  then she looked directly at him and tried to speak her first attempt was inarticulate her second was a whisper didnt you everthink ii might care for you  it was as if a shock went over him leaving him trembling but he did not look as amazed as incredulous no i certainly never did he said  wellthats your blunderfor ii do youyou neverneverasked me  you do whatcare for me what on earth do you mean by that  lenore was fighting many emotions now the one most poignant being a wild desire to escape which battled with an equally maddening one to hide her face on his breast  yet she could see how white he had grownhow different his hands worked convulsively and his eyes pierced her very soul  what should a girl meantelling she cared  i dont know girls are beyond me he replied stubbornly  indeed thats true ive felt so far beyond youi had to come to this  lenore he burst out hoarsely you talk in riddles youve been so strange yet so fine so sweet and now you say you care for me care what does that mean a word can drive me mad but i never dared to hope i love youlove youlove youmy god youre all ive left to love i  do you think youve a monopoly on all the love in the world interrupted lenore coming to her real self his impassioned declaration was all she needed her ordeal was over  it seemed as if he could not believe his ears or eyes  monopoly world he echoed of course i dont but  kurt i love you just as much asas you love me so there  lenore had time for one look at his face before he enveloped her what a relief to hide her own it was pressed to his breast very closely her eyes shut and she felt hot tears under the lids all before her darkened sight seemed confusion whirling chaos it seemed that she could not breathe and strangely did not need to how unutterably happy she felt that was an agelong momentwonderful for her own relief and gladnessfull of changing emotions presently kurt appeared to be coming to some semblance of rationality he released her from that crushing embrace but still kept an arm around her while he held her off and looked at her  lenore will you kiss me he whispered  she could have cried out in sheer delight at the wonder of that whisper in her ear it had been she who had changed the world for kurt dorn  yespresently she replied with a tremulous little laugh wait tilli get my breath  i was beside myselfam so yet he replied low voiced as if in awe ive been lifted to heaven it cannot be true i believe yet ill not be sure till you kiss me youlenore anderson this girl of my dreams do you love meis it true  yes kurt indeed i dovery dearly she replied and turned to look up into his face it was transfigured lenores heart swelled as a deep and profound emotion waved over her  please kiss methen  she lifted her face flushing scarlet their lips met then with her head upon his shoulder and her hands closely held she answered the thousand and one questions of a bewildered and exalted lover who could not realize the truth lenore laughed at him and eloquently furnished proof of her own obsession and told him how and why and when it all came about  not for hours did kurt come back to actualities i forgot about the vigilantes he exclaimed suddenly its too late now how the time has flown oh lenore thought of other things breaks in alas  he kissed her hand and got up another change was coming over him lenore had long expected the moment when realization would claim his attention she was prepared  yes you forgot your appointment with dad and the vigilantes youve missed some excitement and violence  his face had grown white againgrave now and troubled may i speak to your father he asked  yes she replied  if i come back from the warwellnot crippledwill you promise to marry me  kurt i promise now  that seemed to shake him but lenore it is not fair to you i dont believe a soldier should bind a girl by marriage or engagement before he goes to war she should be free i want you to be free  thats for you to say she replied softly but for my part i dont want to be freeif you go away to war  if im going he said with a start you dont want to be free lenore would you be engaged to me  my dear boy of course i would it seems i am doesnt it she replied with one of her deep low laughs  he gazed at her fascinated worked upon by overwhelming emotions would you marry mebefore i go  yes she flashed  he bent and bowed then under the storm stumbling to her almost on his knees he brokenly expressed his gratitude his wonder his passion and the terrible temptation that he must resist which she must help him to resist  kurt i love you i will see things through your eyes if i must i want to be a comfort to you not a source of sorrow  but lenore what comfort can i find to leave you now is going to be horrible to part from you nowi dont see how i can  then lenore dared to broach the subject so delicate so momentous  you need not part from me my father has asked me to try to keep you home he secured exemption for you you are more needed here than at the front you can feed many soldiers you would be doing your dutywith honor you would be a soldier the government is going to draft young men for farm duty why not you there are many good reasons why you would be better than most young men because you know wheat and wheat is to become the most important thing in the world no one misjudges your loyalty and surely you see that the best service to your country is what you can do best  he sat down beside her with serious frown and somber eyes lenore are you asking me not to go to war  yes i am she replied i have thought it all over ive given up my brother id not ask you to stay home if you were needed at the front as much as here that question i have had out with my conscience kurt dont think me a silly sentimental girl events of late have made me a woman  he buried his face in his hands thats the most amazing of allyoulenore anderson my american girlasking me not to go to war  but dear it is not so amazing its reasonable your peculiar point of view makes it look different i am no weak timid lovesick girl afraid to let you go ive given you good honorable patriotic reasons for your exemption from draft can you see that  yes i grant all your claims i know wheat well enough to tell you that if vastly more wheatraising is not done the world will starve that would hold good for the united states in forty years without war  then if you see my point why are you opposed to it she asked  because i am kurt dorn he replied bitterly  his tone his gloom made her shiver it would take all her intelligence and wit and reason to understand him and vastly more than that to change him she thought earnestly this was to be an ordeal profoundly more difficult than the confession of her love it was indeed a crisis dwarfing the other she had met she sensed in him a remarkably strange attitude toward this war compared with that of her brother or other boys she knew who had gone  because you are kurt dorn she said thoughtfully its in the name then but i think it a pretty namea good name have i not consented to accept it as minefor life  he could not answer that blindly he reached out with a shaking hand to find hers to hold it close lenore felt the tumult in him she was shocked a great tenderness sweet and motherly flooded over her  dearest in this dark hourthat was so bright a little while agoyou must not keep anything from me she replied i will be true to you i will crush my selfish hopes i will be your mother tell me why you must go to war because you are kurt dorn  my father was german he hated this countryyours and mine he plotted with the iww he hated your father and wanted to destroy him before he died he realized his crime for so i take the few words he spoke to jerry but all the same he was a traitor to my country i bear his name i have german in me and by god im going to pay  his deep passionate tones struck into lenores heart she fought with a rising terror she was beginning to understand him how helpless she felthow she prayed for inspirationfor wisdom  pay how she asked  in the only way possible ill see that a dorn goes to warwho will show his american bloodwho will fight and killand be killed  his passion then was more than patriotism it had its springs in the very core of his being he had it seemed a debt that he must pay but there was more than this in his grim determination and lenore divined that it lay hidden in his bitter reference to his german blood he hated thatdoubted himself because of it she realized now that to keep him from going to war would be to make him doubt his manhood and eventually to despise himself no longer could she think of persuading him to stay home she must forget herself she knew then that she had the power to keep him and she could use it but she must not do so this tragic thing was a matter of his soul but if he went to war with this bitter obsession with this wrong motive this passionate desire to spill blood in him that he hated he would lose his soul he must be changed all her love all her womans flashing subtle thought concentrated on this fact how strange the choice that had been given her not only must she relinquish her hope of keeping him home but she must perhaps go to desperate ends to send him away with a changed spirit the moment of decision was agony for her  kurt this is a terrible hour for both of us she said but thank heaven you have confessed to me now i will confess to you  confess you what nonsense he exclaimed but in his surprise he lifted his head from his hands to look at her  when we came in here my mind was made up to make you stay home father begged me to do it and i had my own selfish motive it was love oh i do love you kurt more than you can dream of i justified my resolve i told you that but i wanted you i wanted your loveyour presence i longed for a home with you as husbandmasterfather to my babies i dreamed of all it filled me with terror to think of you going to war you might be crippledmangledmurdered oh my dear i could not bear the thought so i meant to overcome you i had it all planned i meant to love youto beg youto kiss youto make you stay  lenore what are you saying he cried in shocked amaze  she flung her arms round his neck oh i couldi could have kept you she answered low voiced and triumphant it fills me with joy tell me i could have kept youtell me  yes ive no power to resist you but i might have hated  hush its all might have ive risen above myself  lenore you distress me a little while ago you bewildered me with your sweetness and love nowyou look like an angel or a goddess oh to have your face like thisalways with me yet it distresses meso terrible in purpose what are you about to tell me i see something  listen she broke in i meant to make you weak i implore you now to be strong you must go to war but with all my heart and soul i beg you to go with a changed spirit you were about to do a terrible thing you hated the german in you and meant to kill it by violence you despised the german blood and you meant to spill it like a wild man you would have rushed to fight to stab and beat to murderand you would have left your breast open for a bayonetthrust oh i know it kurt you are horribly wrong that is no way to go to war war is a terrible business but men dont wage it for motives such as yours we americans all have different strains of bloodenglishfrenchgerman one is as good as another you are obsessedyou are out of your head on this german question you must kill that ideakill it with one bayonetthrust of sense you must go to war as my soldierwith my ideal your country has called you to help uphold its honor its pledged word you must fight to conquer an enemy who threatens to destroy freedom you must be brave faithful merciful cleanan american soldier you are only one of a million you have no personal need for war you are as good as fine as noble as any manmy choice sir of all the men in the world i am sending you i am giving you up oh my darlingyou will never know how hard it is but go your life has been sad you have lost so much i feel in my womans heart what will beif only youll changeif you see god in this as i see promise me love that which you hated prove for yourself what i believe trust mepromise me thenoh i know god will send you back to me  he fell upon his knees before her to bury his face in her lap his whole frame shook his hands plucked at her dress a low sob escaped him  lenore he whispered brokenly i cant see god in thisfor me i cant promise     chapter xxi  thirty masked men sat around a long harvest messtable two lanterns furnished light enough to show a bare barnlike structure the roughgarbed plotters the grim set of hard lips below the halfmasks and big hands spread out ready to draw from the hat that was passing  the talk was low and serious no names were spoken a heavy man at the head of the table said we thirty picked men represent the country let each member here write on his slip of paper his choice of punishment for the iwwsdeath or deportation  the members of the band bent their masked faces and wrote in a dead silence a noiseless wind blew through the place the lanterns flickered huge shadows moved on the walls when the papers had been passed back to the leader he read them  deportation he announced so much for the iww men now for the leader but before we vote on what to do with glidden let me read an extract from one of his speeches this is authentic it has been furnished by the detective lately active in our interest also it has been published i read it because i want to bring home to you all an issue that goes beyond our own personal fortunes here  leaning toward the flickering flare of the lantern the leader read from a slip of paper if the militia are sent out here to hinder the iww we will make it so damned hot for the government that no troops will be able to go to france i dont give a damn what this country is fighting for i am fighting for the rights of labor american soldiers are uncle sams scabs in disguise  the deep impressive voice ended the leaders huge fist descended upon the table with a crash he gazed up and down the rows of sinister masked figures have you anything to say  no replied one  pass the slips said another  and then a man evidently on in years for his hair was gray and he looked bent got up neighbors he began i lived here in the early days for the last few years ive been apologizing for my home town i dont want to apologize for it any longer  he sat down and a current seemed to wave from him around that dark square of figures the leader cleared his throat as if he had much to say but he did not speak instead he passed the hat each man drew forth a slip of paper and wrote upon it the action was not slow presently the hat returned round the table to the leader he spilled its contents and with steady hand picked up the first slip of paper  death he read sonorously and laid it down to pick up another again he spoke that grim word the third brought forth the same and likewise the next and all until the verdict had been called out thirty times  at daylight well meet boomed out that heavy voice instruct gliddens guards to make a show of resistance well hang glidden to the railroad bridge then each of you get your gangs together round up all the iwws drive them to the railroad yard there well put them aboard a railroad train of empty cars and that train will pass under the bridge where glidden will be hanging well escort them out of the country                                       that august dawn was gray and cool with gold and pink beginning to break over the dark eastern ranges the town had not yet awakened it slept unaware of the stealthy forms passing down the gray road and of the distant hum of motorcars and trot of hoofs  gliddens place of confinement was a square warehouse near the edge of town before the improvised jail guards paced up and down strangely alert  daylight had just cleared away the gray when a crowd of masked men appeared as if by magic and bore down upon the guards there was an apparent desperate resistance but significantly no cries or shots the guards were overpowered and bound  the door of the jail yielded to heavy blows of an ax in the corner of a dim bare room groveled glidden bound so that he had little use of his body but he was terribly awake when six men entered he asked hoarsely whatre youafter whatyou mean  they jerked him erect they cut the bonds from his legs they dragged him out into the light of breaking day  when he saw the masked and armed force he cried my god whatll youdo with me  ghastly working sweating his face betrayed his terror  youre to be hanged by the neck spoke a heavy solemn voice  the man would have collapsed but for the strong hands that upheld him  whatfor he gasped  for iww crimesfor treasonfor speeches no american can stand in days like these then this deepvoiced man read to glidden words of his own  do you recognize that  glidden saw how he had spoken his own doom yes i said that he had nerve left to say buti insist on arresttrialjustice im no criminal ive big interests behind me youll suffer  a loop of a lasso slung over his head and jerked tight choked off his intelligible utterance but as the silent ruthless men dragged him away he gave vent to terrible halfstrangled cries  the sun rose red over the fertile valleyover the harvest fields and the pastures and the orchards and over the many towns that appeared lost in the green and gold of luxuriance  in the harvest districts west of the river all the towns were visited by swiftflying motorcars that halted long enough for a warning to be shouted to the citizens keep off the streets  simultaneously armed forces of men on foot and on horseback too numerous to count appeared in the roads and the harvest fields  they accosted every man they met if he were recognized or gave proof of an honest identity he was allowed to go otherwise he was marched along under arrest these armed forces were thorough in their search and in the country districts they had an especial interest in likely campingplaces and around old barns and strawstacks in the towns they searched every corner that was big enough to hide a man  so it happened that many motley groups of men were driven toward the railroad line where they were held until a freighttrain of empty cattlecars came along this train halted long enough to have the iww contingent driven aboard with its special armed guard following and then it proceeded on to the next station as stations were many so were the halts and news of the train with its strange freight flashed ahead crowds lined the railroad tracks many boys and men in these crowds carried rifles and pistols which they leveled at the iww prisoners as the train passed jeers and taunts and threats accompanied this presentation of guns  before the last station of that wheat district was reached full three hundred members of the iww or otherwise suspicious characters were packed into the open cars at the last stop the number was greatly augmented and the armed forces were cut down to the few guards who were to see the iww deported from the country here provisions and drinkingwater were put into the cars and amid a hurrahing roar of thousands the train with its strange load slowly pulled out  it did not at once gather headway the engine whistled a prolonged blasta signal or warning not lost on many of its passengers  from the front cars rose shrill cries that alarmed the prisoners in the rear the reason soon became manifest arms pointed and eyes stared at the figure of a man hanging from a rope fastened to the center of a high bridge span under which the engine was about to pass  the figure swayed in the wind it turned halfway round disclosing a ghastly distorted face and a huge printed placard on the breast then it turned back again slowly the engine drew one carload after another past the suspended body of the dead man there were no more cries all were silent in that slowmoving train all faces were pale all eyes transfixed  the placard on the hanged mans breast bore in glaring red a strange message last warning 3777  the figures were the ones used in the frontier days by vigilantes     chapter xxii  a dusty motorcar climbed the long road leading up to the neuman ranch it was not far from wade a small hamlet of the wheatgrowing section and the slopes of the hills bare and yellow with waving grain bore some semblance to the bend country four mena driver and three cowboyswere in the automobile  a big stone gate marked the entrance to neumans ranch cars and vehicles lined the roadside men were passing in and out neumans home was unpretentious but his barns and granaries and stockhouses were built on a large scale  bill are you goin in with me after this pard of the kaisers inquired jake leisurely stretching himself as the car halted he opened the door and stiffly got out gimme a hoss any day fer gittin places  jake my regard fer your rep as andersons foreman makes me want to hug the background replied bill ive done a hell of a lot these last fortyeight hours  wal i reckon you have bill an no mistake but i was figgerin on you wantin to see the fun  fun jake it ll be fun enough fer me to sit hyar an smoke in the shade an watch fer you to come arunnin from thet big german devil pard they say hes a bad man  sure i know thet all them germans is bad  if the boss hadnt been so doggone strict about gunplay id love to go with you responded bill but he didnt give me no orders youre the whole outfit this roundup  bill youd have to take orders from me said jake coolly  sure thets why i come with andy  the other cowboy called andy manifested uneasiness and he said aw now jake you aint agoin to ask me to go in there an me hatin germans the way i do  nope i guess ill order bill to go in an fetch neuman out replied jake complacently as he made as if to reenter the car  bill collapsed in his seat jake he expostulated weakly this job was given you because of your rep fer deploomacy sure i havent none of thet an you jake why youre the smoothest an slickest talker thet ever come to the northwest  evidently jake had a vulnerable point he straightened up with a little swagger wal you watch me he said ill fetch the big dutchman eatin out of my hand an say when we git him in the car an start back lets scare the daylights out of him  thetd be powerful fine but how  you fellers take a hunch from me replied jake and he strode off up the lane toward the ranchhouse  jake had been commissioned to acquaint neuman with the fact that recent developments demanded his immediate presence at many waters the cowboy really had a liking for the job though he pretended not to  neuman had not yet begun harvesting there were signs to jakes experienced eye that the harvesthands were expected this very day jake fancied he knew why the rancher had put off his harvesting and also he knew that the extra force of harvesthands would not appear he was regarded with curiosity by the women members of the neuman household and rather enjoyed it there were several comely girls in evidence jake did not look a typical northwest foreman and laborer booted and spurred with his gun swinging visibly and his big sombrero and gaudy scarf he looked exactly what he was a cowman of the open ranges  his inquiries elicited the fact that neuman was out in the fields waiting for the harvesthands  wal if hes expectin thet outfit of iwws hell never harvest said jake for some of them is hanged an the rest run out of the country  jake did not wait to see the effect of his news he strode back toward the fields and with the eye of a farmer he appraised the barns and corrals and the fields beyond neuman raised much wheat and enough alfalfa to feed his stock his place was large and valuable but not comparable to many waters  out in the wheatfields were engines with steam already up with combines and threshers and wagons waiting for the word to start jake enjoyed the keen curiosity roused by his approach neuman strode out from a group of waiting men he was huge of build ruddyfaced and bearded with deepset eyes  are you neuman inquired jake  thats me gruffly came the reply  im andersons foreman ive been sent over to tell you thet youre wanted pretty bad at many waters  the man stared incredulously what who wants me  anderson an i reckon theres morethough i aint informed  neuman rumbled a curse amaze dominated him anderson well i dont want to see him he replied  i reckon you dont was the cowboys cool reply  the rancher looked him up and down however familiar his type was to anderson it was strange to neuman the cowboy breathed a potential force the least significant thing about his appearance was that swinging gun he seemed cool and easy with hard keen eyes neumans face took a shade off color  but im going to harvest today he said im late ive a hundred hands coming  nope you havent none comin asserted jake  what ejaculated neuman  reckon its near ten oclock said the cowboy we run over here powerful fast  yes its near ten bellowed neuman on the verge of a rage i havent harvesthands coming whats this talk  wal about ninethirty i seen all your damned iwws except what was shot an hanged loaded in a cattlecar an started out of the country  a blow could not have hit harder than the cowboys biting speech astonishment and fear shook neuman before he recovered control of himself  if its true whats that to me he bluffed in hoarse accents  neuman i didnt come to answer questions said the cowboy curtly my boss jest sent me fer you an if you bucked on comin then i was to say it was your only chance to avoid publicity an bein run out of the country  neuman was livid of face now and shaking all over his huge frame  anderson threatens me he shouted anderson suspicions me gott in himmel me he always cheated an now he insults  say it aint healthy to talk like thet about my boss interrupted jake forcibly an were wastin time if you dont go with me well be comin backthe whole outfit of us anderson means youre to face his man  what man  dorn young dorn son of old chris dorn of the bend dorn has some things to tell you thet you wont want made public andersons givin you a square deal if it wasnt fer thet id sling my gun on you do you git my hunch  the name of dorn made a slack figure of the aggressive neuman  all righti go he said gruffly and without a word to his men he started off  jake followed him neuman made a short cut to the gate thus avoiding a meeting with any of his family at the road however some men observed him and called in surprise but he waved them back  bill you an andy collect yourselves an give mr neuman a seat said jake as he opened the door to allow the farmer to enter  the two cowboys gave neuman the whole of the back seat and they occupied the smaller side seats jake took his place beside the driver  burn her up was his order  the speed of the car made conversation impossible until the limits of a town necessitated slowing down then the cowboys talked for all the attention they paid to neuman he might as well not have been present before long the driver turned into a road that followed a railroad track for several miles and then crossed it to enter a goodsized town the streets were crowded with people and the car had to be driven slowly at this juncture jake suggested  lets go down by the bridge  sure agreed his allies  then the driver turned down a still more peopled street that sloped a little and evidently overlooked the railroad tracks presently they came in sight of a railroad bridge around which there appeared to be an excited yet awestruck throng all faces were turned up toward the swaying form of a man hanging by a rope tied to the high span of the bridge  wal gliddens hangin there yet remarked jake cheerfully  with a violent start neuman looked out to see the ghastly placarded figure and then he sank slowly back in his seat the cowboys apparently took no notice of him they seemed to have forgotten his presence  funny theyd cut all the other iwws down an leave glidden hangin there observed bill  them vigilantes sure did it up brown added andy i was dyin to join the band but they didnt ask me  nor me replied jake regretfully an i cant understand why onless it was they was afeared i couldnt keep a secret  who is them vigilantes anyhow asked bill curiously  wal i reckon nobody knows but i seen a thousand armed men this mornin they sure looked bad you ought to have seen them poke the iwws with cocked guns  was any one shot queried andy  not in the daytime nobody killed by this citizens protective league as they call themselves they just rounded up all the suspicious men an herded them on to thet cattletrain an carried them off it was at night when the vigilantes workedmasked an secret an sure bloody jest like the old vigilante days  an you can gamble they aint through yet  uncle sam wont need to send any soldiers here  wal i should smile not thetd be a disgrace to the northwest it was a bad time fer the iww to try any tricks on us  jake shook his lean head and his jaw bulged he might have been haranguing cowboylike for the benefit of the man they feigned not to notice but it was plain nevertheless that he was angry  what gits me wuss n them iwws is the skunks thet give uncle sam the doublecross said andy with dark face ill stand fer any man an respect him if hes aboveboard an makes his fight in the open but them coyotes thet live off the land an pretend to be american when they aintthey make me pisen mad  i heerd the vigilantes has marked men like thet observed bill  ill give you a hunch fellers replied jake grimly by gawd the west wont stand fer traitors  all the way to many waters where it was possible to talk and be heard the cowboys continued in like strain and not until the driver halted the car before andersons door did they manifest any awareness of neuman  git out an come in said jake to the pallid sweating rancher  he led neuman into the hall and knocked upon andersons study door it was opened by dorn  wal hyar we are announced jake and his very nonchalance attested to pride  anderson was standing beside his desk he started and his hand flashed back significantly as he sighted his rival and enemy  no gunplay boss was your orders said jake an neuman aint packin no gun  it was plain that anderson made a great effort at restraint but he failed and perhaps the realization that he could not kill this man liberated his passion then the two big ranchers faced each otherneuman livid and shaking anderson black as a thundercloud  neuman you hatched up a plot with glidden to kill me said anderson bitterly  neuman in hoarse brief answer denied it  sure deny it what do we care  weve got you neuman burst out anderson his heavy voice ringing with passion but its not your lowdown plot thets riled me theres been a good many men whove tried to do away with me ive outplayed you in many a deal so your personal hate for me doesnt count im sorean you an me cant live in the same place because youre a damned traitor youve lived here for twenty years youve grown rich off the country an youd sell us to your rotten germany what i think of you for that im goin to tell you  anderson paused to take a deep breath then he began to curse neuman all the rough years of his frontier life as well as the quieter ones of his ranching days found expression in the swift thunderous roll of his terrible scorn every vile name that had ever been used by cowboy outlaw gambler leaped to andersons stinging tongue all the keen hard epithets common to the modern day he flung into neumans face and he ended with a profanity that was as individual in character as its delivery was intense  im callin you for my own relief he concluded an not that i expect to get under your hide  then he paused he wiped the beaded drops from his forehead and he coughed and shook himself his big fists unclosed passion gave place to dignity  neuman its a pity you an men like you cant see the truth thats the mystery to mewhy any one who had spent half a lifetime an prospered here in our happy an beautiful country could ever hate it i never will understand that but i do understand that america will never harbor such men for long you have your reasons i reckon an no doubt you think youre justified thats the tragedy you run off from hardruled germany you will not live there of your own choice you succeed here an live in peace an plenty an by god you take up with a lot of foreign riffraff an doublecross the people you owe so much whats wrong with your mind think it over an thats the last word i have for you  anderson turning to his desk took up a cigar and lighted it he was calm again there was really sadness where his face had shown only fury then he addressed dorn  kurt its up to you now he said as my superintendent an someday partner what youll say goes with me i dont know what bein square would mean in relation to this man  anderson sat down heavily in his desk chair and his face became obscured in cigar smoke  neuman do you recognize me asked dorn with his flashing eyes on the rancher  no replied neuman  im chris dorns son my father died a few days ago he overtaxed his heart fighting fire in the wheat  fire set by iww men gliddens men  they burned our wheat ruined us  neuman showed shock at the news at the sudden death of an old friend but he did not express himself in words  do you deny implication in gliddens plot to kill anderson demanded dorn  yes replied neuman  well youre a liar retorted dorn i saw you with glidden and my father i followed you at wheatlyout along the railroad tracks i slipped up and heard the plot it was i who snatched the money from my father  neumans nerve was gone but with his stupid and stubborn process of thought he still denied stuttering incoherently  glidden has been hanged went on dorn a vigilante band has been organized here in the valley men of your known sympathy will not be safe irrespective of your plot against anderson but as to that publicity alone will be enough to ruin you americans of the west will not tolerate traitors now the question youve got to decide is this will you take the risks or will you sell out and leave the country  ill sell out replied neuman  what price do you put on your ranch as it stands  one hundred thousand dollars  dorn turned to anderson and asked is it worth that much  no seventyfive thousand would be a big price replied the rancher  neuman we will give you seventyfive thousand for your holdings do you accept  i have no choice replied neuman sullenly  choice exclaimed dorn yes you have and youre not being cheated ive stated facts you are done in this valley youre ruined now and gliddens fate stares you in the face will you sell and leave the country  yes came the deep reply wrenched from a stubborn breast  go draw up your deeds then notify us said dorn with finality  jake opened the door stolidly and slowly neuman went out precisely as he had entered like a huge man in conflict with unintelligible thoughts  send him home in the car called anderson     chapter xxiii  for two fleeting days lenore anderson was happy when she forgot miserable when she remembered then the third morning dawned  at the breakfasttable her father had said cheerily to dorn better take off your coat an come out to the fields weve got some job to harvest that wheat with only halfforce but by george my troubles over  dorn looked suddenly blank as if andersons cheery words had recalled him to the realities of life he made an incoherent excuse and left the table  ahhuh andersons characteristic exclamation might have meant little or much lenore what ails the boy  nothing that i know of he has been asas happy as i am she replied  then its all settled  father ii  kathleens high shrill gleeful voice cut in sure its settled look at lenorry blush  lenore indeed felt the blood stinging face and neck nevertheless she laughed  come into my room said anderson  she followed him there and as he closed the door she answered his questioning look by running into his arms and hiding her face  wal ill be doggoned the rancher ejaculated with emotion he held her and patted her shoulder with his big hand tell me lenore  theres little to tell she replied softly i love himand he loves me soso well that ive been madly happyin spite ofof  is that all asked anderson dubiously  is not that enough  but dorns lovin you so well doesnt say hell not go to war  and it was then that forgotten bitterness returned to poison lenores cup of joy  ah she whispered  good lord lenore you dont mean you an dorn have been alone all the time these few daysan you havent settled that war question queried anderson in amaze  yes how strange but sincewell since something happenedwewe forgot she replied dreamily  wal go back to it said anderson forcibly i want dorn to help me why hes a wonder hes saved the situation for us here in the valley every rancher i know is praisin him high an he sure treated neuman square an here i am with three big wheatranches on my hands lenore youve got to keep him home  dad ii could not replied lenore she was strangely realizing an indefinable change in herself i cant try to keep him from going to war i never thought of that sincesince we confessed our love but its made some difference itll kill me i think to let him gobut id die before id ask him to stay home  ahhuh sighed anderson and releasing her he began to pace the room i dont begin to understand you girl but i respect your feelins its a hell of a muddle id forgotten the war myself while chasin off them iwws but this war has got to be reckoned with send dorn to me  lenore found dorn playing with kathleen these two had become as brother and sister  kurt dad wants to see you said lenore seriously  dorn looked startled and the light of fun on his face changed to a sober concern  you told him  yes kurt i told him what little i had to tell  he gave her a strange glance and then slowly went toward her fathers study lenore made a futile attempt to be patient she heard her fathers deep voice full and earnest and she heard dorns quick passionate response she wondered what this interview meant anderson was not one to give up easily he had set his heart upon holding this capable young man in the great interests of the wheat business lenore could not understand why she was not praying that he be successful but she was not it was inexplicable and puzzlingthis change in herthis end of her selfishness yet she shrank in terror from an impinging sacrifice she thrust the thought from her with passionate physical gesture and with stern effort of will  dorn was closeted with her father for over an hour when he came out he was white but apparently composed lenore had never seen his eyes so piercing as when they rested upon her  whew he exclaimed and wiped his face your father has my poor old dadwhat does kathleen sayskinned to a frazzle  what did he say asked lenore anxiously  a lotand just as if i didnt know it all better than he knows replied dorn sadly the importance of wheat his three ranches and nobody to run them his growing years my future and a great opportunity as one of the big wheat men of the northwest the present need of the government his only son gone to war which was enough for his family and then he spoke of youheiress to many waterswhat a splendid noble girl you werelike your mother what a shame to ruin your happinessyour future he said youd make the sweetest of wivesthe truest of mothers oh my god  lenore turned away her face shocked to her heart by his tragic passion dorn was silent for what seemed a long time  andthen he cussed mehardas no doubt i deserved added dorn  butwhat did you say she whispered  i said a lot too replied dorn remorsefully  diddid you began lenore and broke off unable to finish  i arrivedto where i am nowpretty dizzy he responded with a smile that was both radiant and sorrowful he took her hands and held them close lenore if i come home from the warstill with my arms and legswholewill you marry me  only come home alive and no matter what you lose yesyes she whispered brokenly  but its a conditional proposal lenore he insisted you must never marry half a man  i will marry you she cried passionately  it seemed to her that she loved him all the more every moment even though he made it so hard for her then through blurred dim eyes she saw him take something from his pocket and felt him put a ring on her finger  it fits isnt that lucky he said softly my mothers ring lenore  he kissed her hand  kathleen was standing near them openeyed and openmouthed in an ecstasy of realization  kathleen your sister has promised to marry mewhen i come from the war said dorn to the child  she squealed with delight and manifestly surrendering to a longconsidered temptation she threw her arms around his neck and hugged him close  its perfectly grand she cried but what a chump you are for going at allwhen you could marry lenorry  that was kathleens point of view and it must have coincided somewhat with mr andersons  kathleen you wouldnt have me be a slacker asked dorn gently  no but we let jim go was her argument  dorn kissed her then turned to lenore lets go out to the fields                                       it was not a long walk to the alfalfa but by the time she got there lenores impending woe was as if it had never been dorn seemed strangely gay and unusually demonstrative apparently he forgot the warcloud in the joy of the hour that they were walking in the open seemed not to matter to him  kurt some one will see you lenore remonstrated  youre more beautiful than ever today he said by way of answer and tried to block her way  lenore dodged and ran she was fleet and eluded him down the lane across the cut field to a huge square stack of baled alfalfa but he caught her just as she got behind its welcome covert lenore was far less afraid of him than of laughing eyes breathless she backed up against the stack  youreacannibal she panted but she did not make much resistance  yourea goddess he replied  me of what  why of many waters goddess of wheat the sweet waving wheat rich and goldenthe very spirit of life  if anybody sees youmauling methis wayill not seem a goddess to him my hair is downmy waistoh kurt  yet it did not very much matter how she looked or what happened beyond all was the assurance of her dearness to him suddenly she darted away from him again her heart swelled her spirit soared her feet were buoyant and swift she ran into the uncut alfalfa it was thick and high tangling round her feet here her progress was retarded dorn caught up with her his strong hands on her shoulders felt masterful and the sweet terror they inspired made her struggle to get away  you shallnothold me she cried  but i will you must be taughtnot to run he said and wrapped her tightly in his arms  now surrender your kisses meekly  isurrender but kurt someone will see dear well go backorsomewhere  who can see us here but the birds he said and the strong hands held her fast you will kiss meenoughright noweven if the whole worldlooked on he said ringingly lenore my soul lenore i love you  he would not be denied and if she had any desire to deny him it was lost in the moment she clasped his neck and gave him kiss for kiss  but her surrender made him think of her she felt his effort to let her go  lenores heart felt too big for her breast it hurt she clung to his hand and they walked on across the field and across a brook up the slope to one of lenores favorite seats and there she wanted to rest she smoothed her hair and brushed her dress aware of how he watched her with his heart in his eyes  had there ever in all the years of the life of the earth been so perfect a day how dazzling the sun what heavenly blue the sky and all beneath so gold so green a lark caroled over lenores head and a quail whistled in the brush below the brook babbled and gurgled and murmured along happy under the open sky and a soft breeze brought the low roar of the harvest fields and the scent of wheat and dust and straw  life seemed so stingingly full so poignant so immeasurably worth living so blessed with beauty and richness and fruitfulness  lenore your eyes are windowsand i can see into your soul i can readand first im uplifted and then im sad  it was he who talked and she who listened this glorious day would be her strength when theah but she would not complete a single bitter thought  she led him away up the slope across the barleyfield now cut and harvested to the great swelling golden spaces of wheat far below the engines and harvesters were humming here the wheat waved and rustled in the wind it was as high as lenores head  its fine wheat observed dorn but the wheat of my desert hills was richer more golden and higher than this  no regrets today murmured lenore leaning to him  there was magic in those wordsthe same enchantment that made the hours fly she led him at will here and there along the rustlingbordered lanes from afar they watched the busy harvest scene with eyes that lingered long on a great glittering combine with its thirtytwo horses plodding along  i can drive them thirtytwo horses she asserted proudly  no  yes will you come i will show you  it is a temptation he said with a sigh but there are eyes there they would break the spell  whos talking about eyes now she cried  they spent the remainder of that day on the windy wheatslope high up alone with the beauty and richness of many waters beneath them and when the sun sent its last ruddy and gold rays over the western hills and the weary harvesters plodded homeward lenore still lingered loath to break the spell for on the way home she divined he would tell her he was soon to leave  sunset and evening star their beauty and serenity pervaded lenores soul surely there was a life somewhere else beyond in that infinite space and the defeat of earthly dreams was endurable  they walked back down the wheat lanes hand in hand as dusk shadowed the valley and when they reached the house he told her gently that he must go  butyou will stay tonight she whispered  no its all arranged he replied thickly theyre to drive me overmy trains due at eight ive kept ittill the last few minutes  they went in together  were too late for dinner said lenore but she was not thinking of that and she paused with head bent ii want to say goodby to youhere she pointed to the dim curtained entrance of the livingroom  id like that too he replied ill go up and get my bag wait  lenore slowly stepped to that shadowed spot beyond the curtains where she had told her love to dorn and there she stood praying and fighting for strength to let him go for power to conceal her pain the one great thing she could do was to show him that she would not stand in the way of his duty to himself she realized then that if he had told her sooner if he were going to remain one more hour at many waters she would break down and beseech him not to leave her  she saw him come downstairs with his small handbag which he set down his face was white his eyes burned but her womans love made her divine that this was not a shock to his soul as it was to hers but stimulationa mans strange spiritual accounting to his fellowmen  he went first into the diningroom and lenore heard her mothers and sisters voices in reply to his presently he came out to enter her fathers study lenore listened but heard no sound there outside a motorcar creaked and hummed by the window to stop by the side porch then the door of her fathers study opened and closed and dorn came to where she was standing  lenore did precisely as she had done a few nights before when she had changed the world for him but following her kiss there was a terrible instant when with her arms around his neck she went blind at the realization of loss she held to him with a savage intensity of possession it was like giving up life she knew then as never before that she had the power to keep him at her side but a thought saved her from exerting itthe thought that she could not make him less than other menand so she conquered  lenore i want you to think alwayshow you loved me he said  loved you oh my boy it seems your lot has been hard youve toiledyouve lost alland now  listen he interrupted and she had never heard his voice like that the thousands of boys who go to fight regard it a duty for our country i had that but more my father was german and he was a traitor the horror for me is that i hate what is german in me i will have to kill that but youve helped me i know im american ill do my duty whatever it is i would have gone to war only a beast with my soul killed before i ever got there with no hopeno possibility of return but you love me cant you seehow great the difference  lenore understood and felt it in his happiness yes kurt i know thank god ive helped you i want you to go ill pray always i believe you will come back to me life could not be so utterly cruel she broke off  life cant rob me nownor death he cried in exaltation i have your love your face will always be with meas nowlovely and brave not a tear and only that sweet smile like an angels oh lenore what a girl you are  say goodbyand go she faltered another moment would see her weaken  yes i must hurry his voice was a whisperalmost gone he drew a deep breath lenoremy promised wifemy star for all the black nightsgod bless youkeep you goodby  she spent all her strength in her embrace all her soul in the passion of her farewell kiss then she stood alone tottering sinking the swift steps now heavy and uneven passed out of the hallthe door closedthe motorcar creaked and rolled awaythe droning hum ceased  for a moment of despairing shock before the storm broke lenore blindly wavered there unable to move from the spot that had seen the beginning and the end of her brief hour of love then she summoned strength to drag herself to her room to lock her door  alone in the merciful darkness and silence and loneliness she need not lie nor play false nor fool herself here she had let him go inconceivable and monstrous truth for what it was not now with her that deceiving spirit which had made her brave but she was a woman she fell upon her knees beside her bed shuddering  that moment was the beginning of her sacrifice the sacrifice she shared in common now with thousands of other women before she had pitied now she suffered and all that was sweet loving noble and motherlyall that was womanlyrose to meet the stretch of gray future with its endless suspense and torturing fear its face of courage for the light of day its despair for the lonely night and its vague faith in the lessons of life its possible and sustaining and eternal hope of god     chapter xxiv      camp october      dear sister lenoreits been long since i wrote you im sorry     dear but i havent just been in shape to write have been     transferred to a trainingcamp not far from new york i dont like     it the air is raw penetrating different from our high mountain     air in the west so many gray gloomy days and wetwhy you never     saw a rain in washington fine bunch of boys though we get up in     the morning at 430 sweep the streets of the camp im glad to get     up and sweep for im near frozen long before daylight yesterday i     peeled potatoes till my hands were cramped nine million spuds i     guess im wearing citizens clothestoo thin by goshand     sleeping in a tent on a canvas cot with one blanket wouldnt care     ascoose me sisi wouldnt mind if i had a real gun and some     real fighting to look forward to some life i dont think but i     meant to tell you why im here      you remember how i always took to cowboys well i got chummy with a     big cow puncher from montana his name was andersen isnt that     queer his name same as mine except for the last e where i have o     hes a swede or norwegian trueblue american well i should smile     like all cowboys hes six feet four broad as a door with a flat     head of an indian and a huge bulging chin not real handsome but     say hes one of the finest fellows that ever lived we call him     montana      there were a lot of roughnecks in our outfit and right away i got     in bad you know i never was much on holding my temper anyway i     got licked powerful fine as dad would say and id been all beaten     up but for montana that made us two fast friends and sure some     enemies you bet      we had the tough luck to run into six of the roughnecks just     outside of the little town where theyd been drinking i never     heard the name of one of that outfit we werent acquainted at all     strange how they changed my soldier career right at the start this     day when we met them they got fresh and of course i had to start     something i soaked that roughneck sis and dont you forget it     well it was a fight sure i got laid outnot knocked out for i     could seebut i wasnt any help to pard montana it looked as if he     didnt need any the roughnecks jumped him then one after     another he piled them up in the road just a swingand down went     each onecold but the fellow i hit came to and grabbing up a     pickhandle with all his might he soaked montana over the head     what an awful crack montana went down and there was blood     everywhere      they took montana to the hospital sewed up his head it wasnt long     before he seemed all right again but he told me sometimes he felt     queer then they put us on a trooptrain with boys from california     and all over and we came east i havent seen any of those other     western boys though since we got here      one day without any warning montana keeled over down and out     paralysis they took him to a hospital in new york no hope the     doctors said and he was getting worse all the time but some new     york surgeon advised operation anyway so they opened that     healedover place in his head where the pickhandle hitand what     do you think they found a splinter off that pickhandle stuck two     inches under his skull in his brain they took it out every day     they expected montana to die but he didnt but he will die i     went over to see him hes unconscious part of the timecrazy the     rest no part of his right side moves it broke me all up why     couldnt that soak he got have been on the kaisers head      i tell you lenore a fellow has his eye teeth cut in this getting     ready to go to war it makes me sick i enlisted to fight not to be     chased into a climate that doesnt agree with menot to sweep roads     and juggle a wooden gun there are a lot of things but say ive     got to cut out that kind of talk      i feel almost as far away from you all as if i were in china but     im nearer france i hope youre well and standing pat lenore     remember youre dads white hope i was the black sheep you know     tell him i dont regard my transfer as a disgrace the officers     didnt and he neednt give my love to mother and the girls tell     them not to worry maybe the war will be over beforeill write you     often now so cheer up      your loving brother      jim       camp october      my dearest lenoreif my writing is not very legible it is because     my hand shakes when i begin this sweet and sacred privilege of     writing to my promised wife my other letter was short and this is     the second in the weeks since i left you what an endless time you     must understand and forgive me for not writing oftener and for not     giving you definite address      i did not want to be in the western regiment for reasons hard to     understand i enlisted in new york and am trying hard to get into     the rainbow division with some hope of success there is nothing to     me in being a member of a crack regiment but it seems that this one     will see action first of all american units i dont want to be an     officer either      how will it be possible for me to write you as i want toletters     that will be free of the plague of myselfletters that you can     treasure if i never come back sleeping and waking i never forget     the wonderful truth of your love for me it did not seem real when i     was with you but now that we are separated i know that it is     real mostly my mind contains only two thingsthis constant memory     of you and that other terrible thing of which i will not speak all     else that i think or do seems to be mechanical      the work the training is not difficult for me though so many boys     find it desperately hard you know i followed a plow and that is     real toil right now i see the brown fallow hills and the great     squares of gold but visions or thoughts of home are rare that is     well for they hurt like a stab i cannot think now of a single     thing connected with my training here that i want to tell you yet     some things i must tell for instance we have different     instructors and naturally some are more forcible than others we     have one at whom the boys laugh he tickles them they like him but     he is an ordeal for me the reason is that in our first bayonet     practice when we rushed and thrust a stuffed bag he made us yell     god damn you germandie i dont imagine this to be general     practice in army exercises but the fact is he started us that way     i cant forget when i begin to charge with a bayonet those words     leap silently but terribly to my lips think of this as reality     lenorea sad and incomprehensible truth in 1917 all in me that is     spiritual reasonable all that was once hopeful revolts at this     actuality and its meaning but there is another side that dark one     which revels in anticipation it is the caveman in me hiding by     night waiting with a bludgeon to slay i am beginning to be struck     by the gradual change in my comrades i fancied that i alone had     suffered a retrogression i have a deep consciousness of baseness     that is going to keep me aloof from them i seem to be alone with my     own soul yet i seem to be abnormally keen to impressions i feel     what is going on in the soldiers minds and it shocks me set me     wondering forces me to doubt myself i keep saying it must be my     peculiar way of looking at things      lenore i remember your appeal to me shall i ever forget your sweet     faceyour sad eyes when you bade me hope in godi am trying but     i do not see god yet perhaps that is because of my morbidnessmy     limitations perhaps i will face him over there when i go down into     the valley of the shadow one thing however i do begin to see is     that there is a divinity in men slowly something divine is     revealing itself to me to give up work property friends sister     mother home sweetheart to sacrifice all and go out to fight for     country for honorthat indeed is divine it is beautiful it     inspires a man and lifts his head but alas if he is a thinking     man when he comes in contact with the actual physical preparation     for war he finds that the divinity was the hour of his sacrifice     and that to become a good soldier he must change forget grow     hard strong merciless brutal humorous and callous all of which     is to say base i see boys who are tenderhearted who love life     who were born sufferers who cannot inflict pain how many silent     cries of protest of wonder of agony must go up in the night over     this camp the sum of them would be monstrous the sound of them if     voiced would be a clarion blast to the world it is sacrifice that     is divine and not the making of an efficient soldier      i shall write you endlessly the action of writing relieves me i     feel less burdened now sometimes i cannot bear the burden of all     this unintelligible consciousness my mind is not large enough     sometimes i feel that i am going to be every soldier and every     enemyeach one in his strife or his drifting or his agony or his     death but despite that feeling i seem alone in a horde i make no     friends i have no way to pass my leisure but writing i can hardly     read at all when off duty the boys amuse themselves in a hundred     waysgoing to town the theaters and movies chasing the girls     especially that to judge by their talk play boxing games and i     am sorry to add many of them gamble and drink but i cannot do any     of these things i cannot forget what i am here for i cannot forget     that i am training to kill men never do i forget that soon i will     face death what a terrible strange vague thrill that sends     shivering over me amusement and forgetfulness are past for kurt     dorn i am concerned with my soul i am fighting that black passion     which makes of me a sleepless watcher and thinker      if this war only lets me live long enough to understand its meaning     perhaps that meaning will be the meaning of life in which case i am     longing for the unattainable but underneath it all must be a     colossal movement of evolution of spiritual growthor of     retrogression who knows when i ask myself what i am going to fight     for i answerfor my country as a patriotfor my hate as an     individual my time is almost up i go on duty the rain is roaring     on the thin roof how it rains in this east whole days and nights     it pours i cannot help but think of my desert hills always so     barren and yellow with the dustclouds whirling one day of this     rain useless and wasted here would have saved the bend crop of     wheat nature is almost as inscrutable as god      lenore goodby for this time think of me but not as lonely or     unhappy or uncomfortable out there in the cold raw black wet     night i will be neither some onea spiritwill keep beside me as     i step the beat i have put unhappiness behind me and no rain or     mud or chill will ever feaze me      yours with love      kurt dorn       camp october      dear sister

come for jim     anderson to make good ive a rich dad and hes the best dad any     harumscarum boy ever had im going to prove more than one thing     this trip      we hear so many rumors and none of them ever come true one of them     is funnythat we have so many rich men with political influence in     our regiment that we will never get to france isnt that the limit     but its funny because if we have rich men id like to see them     still there are thirty thousand soldiers here and in my neck of     the woods such rumors are laughed and cussed at we hear also that     were going to be ordered south i wish that would come true its     so cold and drab and muddy and monotonous      my friend montana fooled everybody he didnt die he seems to be     hanging on lately he recovered consciousness told me he had no     feeling on his left side except sometimes his hand itched you     know like prickly needles but montana will never be any good     again that fine big cowboy hes been one grand soldier it sickens     me sometimes to think of the difference between what thrilled me     about this war game and what we get maybe thoughthere goes my     call i must close love to all      jim       new york city october      dearest lenoreit seems about time that i had a letter from you     im sure letters are on the way but they do not come quickly the     boys complain of the mail service isnt it strange that there is     not a soul to write me except you jeff my farmhand will write me     whenever i write him which i havent done yet      im on duty here in new york at an armory bazaar its certainly the     irony of fate why did the officer pick on me id like to know but     ive never complained of an order so far and im standing it     several of usand they chose the husky boyshave been sent over     here for absolutely no purpose that i can see except to exhibit     ourselves in uniform its a womans bazaar to raise money for     warrelief work and so on the hall is almost as large as that field     back of your house and every night it is packed with people mostly     young my comrades are having fun out of it but i feel like a fish     out of water      just the same lenore im learning more every day if i was not so     disgusted id think this was a wonderful opportunity as it is i     regard it only as an experience over which i have no control and     that interests me in spite of myself new york is an awful     placeendless narrow tornup streets crowded with hurrying     throngs taxicabs cars and full of noise and dust i am always     choked for air and these streets reek where do the people come     from and where are they going they look wild as if they had to go     somewhere but did not know where that was ive no time or     inclination to see new york though under happier circumstances i     think id like to      people in the east seem strange to me still as i never mingled     with many people in the west i cannot say truly whether eastern     people are different from western people but i think so anyway     while i was in spokane portland san francisco and los angeles i     did not think people were greatly concerned about the war denver     people appeared not to realize there was a war but here in new york     everything is war you cant escape it you see that war will soon     obsess rich and poor alien and neutral and belligerent pacifist     and militarist since i wrote you last ive tried to read the     newspapers sent to us its hard to tell you which makes me the     sickerthe prattle of the pacifist or the mathematics of the     military experts both miss the spirit of men neither has any soul     i think the german minds must all be mathematical      but i want to write about the women and girls i see here in new     york in the camps and towns on the trains everywhere lenore the     war has thrown them off their balance i have seen and studied at     close hand women of all classes believe me as the boys say i have     thought more than twice whether or not i would tell you the stark     truth but somehow i am impelled to i have an overwhelming     conviction that all american girls and mothers should know what the     truth is they will never be told lenore and most would never     believe if they were told and that is one thing wrong with people      i believe every soldier from the time he enlists until the war is     ended should be kept away from women this is a sweeping statement     and you must take into account the mind of him who makes it but i     am not leaping at conclusions the soldier boys have terrible peril     facing them long before they get to the trenches not all or nearly     all the soldiers are going to be vitally affected by the rottenness     of great cities or by the mushroom hotbeds of vice springing up near     the camps these evils exist and are being opposed by military and     government by police and ymca and good influence of good     people but they will never wholly stamp it out      nor do i want to say much about the society women who are rushing     the officers there may be one here and there with her heart in the     right place but with most of them it must be first this something     about war that has unbalanced women and secondly a fad a novelty     a new sentimental stunt a fashion set by some leader likewise i     want to say but little about the horde of common streetchasing     rattledbrained women and girls who lie in wait for soldiers at     every corner so to speak all these to be sure may be     unconsciously actuated by motives that do not appear on the surface     and if this be true their actions are less bold less raw than they     look      what i want to dwell upon is my impression of something strange     unbalanced incomprehensible about the frank conduct of so many     welleducated refined and good women i see and about the     eagerness restlessness the singular response of nice girls to     situations that are not natural      tonight a handsome stylishly gowned woman of about thirty came up     to me with a radiant smile and a strange brightness in her eyes     there were five hundred couples dancing on the floor and the music     and sound of sliding feet made it difficult to hear her she said     you handsome soldier boy come dance with me i replied politely     that i did not dance then she took hold of me and said ill teach     you i saw a weddingring on the hand she laid on my arm then i     looked straight at her madam very soon ill be learning the dance     of death over in france and my minds concerned with that she     grew red with anger she seemed amazed and she snapped well you     are a queer soldier later i watched her flirting and dancing     with an officer      overtures and advances innumerable have been made to me ranging     from the assured possessiontaking onslaught like this womans to     the slight subtle something felt more than seen of a more complex     nature and lenore i blush to tell you this but ive been mobbed     by girls they have a thousand ways of letting a soldier know i     could not begin to tell them but i do not actually realize what it     is that is conveyed that i know and i am positive the very large     majority of soldiers misunderstand at night i listen to the talks     of my comrades and wellif the girls only heard many times i go     out of hearing and when i cannot do that i refuse to hear      lenore i am talking about nice girls now i am merciless there are     many girls like youthey seem like you though none so pretty i     mean you know there are certain manners and distinctions that at     once mark a really nice girl for a month ive been thrown here and     there so that it seems ive seen as many girls as soldiers i have     been sent to different entertainments given for soldiers at one     place a woman got up and invited the girls to ask the boys to dance     at another a crowd of girls were lined up wearing different ribbons     and the boys marched along until each one found the girl wearing a     ribbon to match the one he wore that was his partner it was     interesting to see the eager mischievous brooding eyes of these     girls as they watched and waited just as interesting was it to see     this boys face when he found his partner was ugly and that boy     swell with pride when he found he had picked a winner it was all     adventure for both boys and girls but i saw more than that in it     whenever i could not avoid meeting a girl i tried to be agreeable     and to talk about war and soldiers and what was going on i did     not dance of course and i imagine more than one girl found me a     queer soldier      it always has touched me though to see and feel the sweetness     graciousness sympathy kindness and that other indefinable     something in the girls i have met how they made me think of you     lenore no doubt about their hearts their loyalty their     americanism every soldier who goes to france can fight for some     girl they make you feel that i believe i have gone deeper than     most soldiers in considering what i will call warrelation of the     sexes if it is normal then underneath it all is a tremendous     inscrutable design of nature or god if that be true actually true     then war must be inevitable and right how horrible my thoughts     confound me sometimes anyway the point i want to make is this i     heard an officer tell an irate father whose two daughters had been     insulted by soldiers my dear sir it is regrettable these men     will be punished but they are not greatly to blame because so many     girls throw themselves at their heads your daughters did not of     course but they should not have come here that illustrates the     fixed idea of the military all through the rankswomen throw     themselves at soldiers it is true that they do but the idea is     false nevertheless because the mass of girls are misunderstood      misunderstoodi can tell you why surely the mass of american     girls are nice fine sweet wholesome they are young the news of     war liberates something in them that we can find no name for but it     must be noble a soldier the very name from childhood is one to     make a girl thrill what then the actual thing the uniform     invested somehow with chivalry and courage the cleancut athletic     young man somber and fascinating with his intent eyes his serious     brow or his devilmaycare gallantry the compelling presence of     him that breathes of his sacrifice of his near departure to     privation to squalid comfortless trenches to the fire and hell of     war to blood and agony and deathin a word to fight fight fight     for women so through this beautiful emotion women lose their     balance and many are misunderstood those who would not and could     not be bold are susceptible to advances that in an ordinary time     would not affect them war invests a soldier with a glamour love at     first sight flirtations rash intimacies quick engagements     immediate marriages the soldier who is soon going away to fight and     perhaps to die strikes hard at the very heart of a girl either she     is not her real self then or else she is suddenly transported to a     womanhood that is instinctive elemental universal for the future     she feels what she does not know she surrenders because there is an     imperative call to the depths of her nature she sacrifices because     she is the inspiritor of the soldier the reward for his loss the     savior of the race if women are the spoils of barbarous conquerors     they are also the sinews the strength the soul of defenders      and so however you look at it war means for women sacrifice     disillusion heartbreak agony doom i feel that so powerfully that     i am overcome i am sick at the gaiety and playing i am full of     fear wonder admiration and hopeless pity for them      no man can tell what is going on in the souls of soldiers while     noble women are offering love and tenderness throwing themselves     upon the altar of war hoping blindly to send their great spirits     marching to the front perhaps the man who lives through the war     will feel the change in his soul if he cannot tell it day by day i     think i see a change in my comrades as they grow physically     stronger they seem to grow spiritually lesser but maybe that is     only my idea i see evidences of fear anger sullenness moodiness     shame i see a growing indifference to fatigue toil pain as these     boys harden physically they harden mentally always way off there     is the war and that seems closely related to the near duty     herewhat it takes to make a man these fellows will measure men     differently after this experience with sacrifice obedience labor     and pain in that they will become great but i do not think these     things stimulate a mans mind changes are going on in me some of     which i am unable to define for instance physically i am much     bigger and stronger than i was i weigh one hundred and eighty     pounds as for my mind something is always tugging at it i feel     that it grows tired it wants to forget in spite of my will all of     these keen desires of mine to know everything lag and fail often     and i catch myself drifting i see and feel and hear without     thinking i am only an animal then at these times sight of blood     or a fight or a plunging horse or a broken legand these sights     are commonaffects me little until i am quickened and think about     the meaning of it all at such moments i have a revulsion of     feeling with memory comes a revolt and so on until i am the     distressed inquisitive and morbid person i am now i shudder at     what war will make me actual contact with earth exploding guns     fighting comrades striking foes will make brutes of us all it is     wrong to shed another mans blood if life was meant for that why do     we have progress i cannot reconcile a god with all this horror i     have misgivings about my mind if i feel so acutely here in safety     and comfort what shall i feel over there in peril and agony i fear     i shall laugh at death oh lenore consider that to laugh in the     ghastly face of death if i yield utterly to a fiendish joy of     bloody combat then my mind will fail and that in itself would be     evidence of god      i do not read over my letters to you i just write forgive me if     they are not happier every hour i think of you at night i see your     face in the shadow of the tent wall and i love you unutterably      faithfully      kurt dorn       camp  november       dear sisterits bad news ive

hereand im     so cold ive thought a lot about you girls and mother and dad tell     dad i made good      jim     chapter xxv  jims last letter was not taken seriously by the other members of the anderson family the father shook his head dubiously that aint like jim but made no other comment mrs anderson sighed the young sisters were not given to worry lenore however was haunted by an unwritten meaning in her brothers letter  weeks before she had written to dorn and told him to hunt up jim no reply had yet come from dorn every day augmented her uneasiness until it was dreadful to look for letters that did not come all this fortified her however to expect calamity like a bolt out of the clear sky it came in the shape of a telegram from camp  saying that jim was dying  the shock prostrated the mother jim had been her favorite mr anderson left at once for the east lenore had the care of her mother and the management of many waters on her hands which duties kept her mercifully occupied mrs anderson however after a day rallied surprisingly lenore sensed in her mother the strength of the spirit that sacrificed to a noble and universal cause it seemed to be mrs andersons conviction that jim had been shot or injured by accident in guntraining or at least by a horse lenore did not share her mothers idea and was reluctant to dispel it on the evening of the fifth day after mr andersons departure a message came saying that he had arrived too late to see jim alive mrs anderson bore the news bravely though she weakened perceptibly  the family waited then for further news none came day after day passed then one evening while lenore strolled in the gloaming kathleen came running to burst out with the announcement of their fathers arrival he had telephoned from vale for a car to meet him  not long after that lenore who had gone to her room heard the return of the car and recognized her fathers voice she ran down in time to see him being embraced by the girls and her mother leaning with bowed head on his shoulder  yes i fetched jimback he said steadily but very low its all arranged an well bury him tomorrow  ohdad cried lenore  hello my girl he replied and kissed her im sorry to tell you i couldnt locate kurt dorn that new yorkan that trainin camp  he held up his hands in utter futility of expression lenores quick eyes noted his face had grown thin and haggard and she made sure with a pang that his hair was whiter  im sure glad to be home he said with a heavy expulsion of breath i want to clean up an have a bite to eat                                       lenore was so disappointed at failing to hear from dorn that she did not think how singular it was her father did not tell more about jim later he seemed more like himself and told them simply that jim had contracted pneumonia and died without any message for his folk at home this prostrated mrs anderson again  later lenore sought her father in his room he could not conceal from her that he had something heartrending on his mind then there was more than tragedy in his expression lenore felt a leap of fear at what seemed her fathers hidden anger she appealed to himimportuned him plainer it came to her that he wanted to relieve himself of a burden then doubling her persuasions she finally got him to talk  lenore its not been so long ago that right here in this room jim begged me to let him enlist he wasnt of age but would i let him goto fight for the honor of our countryfor the future safety of our home we all felt the boys eagerness his fire his patriotism wayward as hes been we suddenly were proud of him we let him go we gave him up he was a part of our flesh an bloodsent by us andersonsto do our share  anderson paused in his halting speech and swallowed hard his white face twitched strangely and his brow was clammy lenore saw that his piercing gaze looked far beyond her for the instant that he broke down  jim was a born fighter the father resumed he wasnt vicious he just had a leanin to help anybody as a lad he fought for his little pardsalways on the right sidean he always fought fair this opportunity to train for a soldier made a man of him hed have made his mark in the war strong an game an fierce hed  hed  well hes deadhes dead four months after enlistment hes dead an he never had a rifle in his hands he never had his hands on a machinegun or a piece of artillery he never had a uniform he never had an overcoat he never   then mr andersons voice shook so that he had to stop to gain control lenore was horrified she felt a burning stir within her  lemme get thisout choked anderson his face now livid his veins bulging im drove to tell it i was near all day locatin jims company found the tent where hed lived it was cold damp muddy jims messmates spoke high of him called him a prince they all owed him money hed done many a good turn for them he had only a thin blanket an he caught cold all the boys had colds one night he gave that blanket to a boy sicker than he was next day he got worse there was miles an miles of them tents i like to never found the hospital where theyd sent jim an then it was six oclock in the mornina raw bleak day thatd freeze one of us to the marrow i had trouble gettin in but a soldier went with me anan   andersons voice went to a whisper and he looked pityingly at lenore  that hospital was a barn no doctors too early the nurses werent in sight i met one later an poor girl she looked ready to drop herself we found jim in one of the little rooms no heat it was winter there only a bed jim lay on the floor dead hed fallen or pitched off the bed he had on only his underclothes that he had onwhen heleft home he was stiffan must havebeen deada good while  lenore held out her trembling hands deadjim deadlike that she faltered  yes he got pneumonia replied anderson hoarsely the camp was full of it  butmy god were not thethe poor boys taken care of implored lenore faintly  its a terrible time all was done that could be done  thenit was allfor nothing  all all our boy an many like himthe best blood of our countrywestern blooddead because  because   andersons voice failed him  oh jim oh my brother dead like a poor neglected dog jimwho enlisted to fightfor  lenore broke down then and hurried away to her room  with great difficulty mrs anderson was revived and it became manifest that the prop upon which she had leaned had been slipped from under her the spirit which had made her strong to endure the death of her boy failed when the sordid bald truth of a miserable and horrible waste of life gave the lie to the splendid fighting chance jim had dreamed of  when anderson realized that she was fading daily he exhausted himself in long expositions of the illness and injury and death common to armies in the making more deaths came from these causes than from war it was the elision of the weaker elementthe survival of the fittest and some indeed very many mothers must lose their sons that way the government was sound at the core he claimed and his own rage was at the few incompetents and profiteers these must be weeded outa process that was going on the gigantic task of a government to draft and prepare a great army and navy was something beyond the grasp of ordinary minds anderson talked about what he had seen and heard proving the wonderful stride already made but all that he said now made no impression upon mrs anderson she had made her supreme sacrifice for a certain end and that was as much the boys fiery ambition to fight as it was her duty common with other mothers to furnish a man at the front what a hopeless awful sacrifice she sank under it  those were trying days for lenore just succeeding her fathers return and she had little time to think of herself when the mail came day after day without a letter from dorn she felt the pang in her breast grow heavier intimations crowded upon her of impending troubles that would make the present ones seem light  it was not long until the mother was laid to rest beside the son  when that day ended lenore and her father faced each other in her room where he had always been wont to come for sympathy they gazed at each other with hard dry eyes starknaked truthgrim realitythe nature of this catastrophethe consciousness of wardawned for each in the look of the other brutal shock and then this second exceeding bitter woe awakened their minds to the futility of individual life  lenoreits over he said huskily as he sank into a chair like a nightmare what have i got to live for  you have us girls replied lenore and if you did not have us there would be many others for you to live for dad cant you seenow  i reckon but im growin old an mebbe ive quit  no dad youll never quit suppose all we americans quit thatd mean a german victory never never never  by god youre right he ejaculated with the trembling strain of his face suddenly fixing blood and life shot into his eyes he got up heavily and began to stride to and fro before her you see clearer than me you always did lenore  im beginning to see but i cant tell you replied lenore closing her eyes indeed there seemed a colossal vision before her veiled and strange whatever happens we cannot break its because of the war we have our tasksgreater now than ever we believe could be thrust upon us yours to show men what you are made of to raise wheat as never before in your life mine to show my sisters and my friendsall the womenwhat their duty is we must sacrifice work prepare and fight for the future  i reckon he nodded solemnly loss of mother an jim changes this damned war whatevers in my power to do must go on so some one can take it up when i  thats the great conception dad added lenore earnestly we are tragically awakened weve been surprisedterribly struck in the dark something monstrous and horrible i can feel the menace in it for allover every family in this broad land  lenore you said once that jimnow howd you know it was all over for him  a womans heart dad when i said goodby to jim i knew it was goodby forever  did you feel that way about kurt dorn  no he will come back to me i dream it its in my spiritmy instinct of life my fleshandblood life of the futureits in my belief in god kurt dorns ordeal will be worse than death for him but i believe as i praythat he will come home alive  then after all you do hope said her father lenore when i was down east i seen what women were doin the bad women are good an the good women are great i think women have more to do with war then men even if they do stay home it must be because women are mothers lenore youve bucked me up ill go at things now the need for wheat next year will be beyond calculation ill buy ten thousand acres of that wheatland round old chris dorns farm an my shot at the germans will be wheat ill raise a million bushels                                       next morning in the mail was a long thick envelope addressed to lenore in handwriting that shook her heart and made her fly to the seclusion of her room      new york city november       dearestwhen you receive this i will be in france  then lenore sustained a strange shock the beloved handwriting faded the thick sheets of paper fell and all about her seemed dark and whirling as the sudden joy and excitement stirred by the letter changed to sickening pain  france hes in france she whispered oh kurt a storm of love and terror burst over her it had the onset and the advantage of a bewildering surprise it laid low for the moment her fortifications of sacrifice strength and resolve she had been forced into womanhood and her fear her agony were all the keener for the intelligence and spirit that had repudiated selfish love kurt dorn was in france in the land of the trenches strife possessed her and had a moment of raw bitter triumph she bit her lips and clenched her fists to restrain the impulse to rush madly around the room to scream out her fear and hate with forcing her thought with hard return to old welllearned arguments there came back the nobler emotions but when she took up the letter again with trembling hands her heart fluttered high and sick and she saw the words through blurred eyes      ill give the letter to an ensign who has promised to mail it     the moment he gets back to new york      lenore your letter telling me about jim was held up in the mail     but thank goodness i got it in time id already been transferred     and expected orders any day to go on board the transport where i am     writing now id have written you or at least telegraphed you     yesterday after seeing jim if i had not expected to see him again     today but this morning we were marched on board and i cannot even     get this letter off to you      lenore your brother is a very sick boy i lost some hours finding     him they did not want to let me see him but i imploredsaid that     i was engaged to his sisterand finally i got in the nurse was     very sympathetic but i didnt care for the doctors in charge they     seemed hard hurried brusque but they have their troubles the     hospital was a long barracks and it was full of cripples      the nurse took me into a small bare room too damp and cold for a     sick man and i said so she just looked at me      jim looks like you more than any other of the andersons i     recognized that at the same moment i saw how very sick he was they     had told me outside that he had a bad case of pneumonia he was     awake perfectly conscious and he stared at me with eyes that set     my heart going      hello jim i said and offered my hand as i sat down on the bed     he was too weak to shake hands      whore you he asked he couldnt speak very well when i told him     my name and that i was his sisters fiancé his face changed so he     did not look like the same person it was beautiful oh it showed     how homesick he was then i talked a blue streak about you about     the girls about many watershow i lost my wheat and everything     he was intensely interested and when i got through he whispered     that he guessed lenore had picked a winner what do you think of     that he was curious about me and asked me questions till the nurse     made him stop i was never so glad about anything as i was about the     happiness it evidently gave him to meet me and hear from home i     promised to come next day if we did not sail then he showed what i     must call despair he must have been passionately eager to get to     france the nurse dragged me out jim called weakly after me     goodby kurt stick some germans for me ill never forget his     tone nor his look lenore he doesnt expect to get over to     france      i questioned the nurse and she shook her head doubtfully she     looked sad she said jim had been the lion of his regiment i     questioned a doctor and he was annoyed he put me off with a sharp     statement that jim was not in danger but i think he is i hope and     pray he recovers      thursday      we sailed yesterday it was a wonderful experience leaving hoboken     our transport and the dock looked as if they had a huge swarm of     yellow bees hanging over everything the bees were soldiers the     most profound emotion i ever hadexcept the one when you told me     you loved mecame over me as the big boat swung free of the     dockof the good old us of home i wanted to jump off and swim     through the eddying green water to the piles and hide in them till     the boat had gone as we backed out pulled up tugs and got started     down the river my thrills increased until we passed the statue of     libertyand then i couldnt tell how i felt one thing i could not     see very well i gazed beyond the colossal statue that france     gave to the usway across the water and the ships and the docks     toward the west that i was leaving feeling like mine then only     comes once to a man in his life first i seemed to see all the vast     space the farms valleys woods deserts rivers and mountains     between me and my golden wheathills then i saw my home and it was     as if i had a magnificent photograph before my very eyes a sudden     rush of tears blinded me such a storm of sweetness regret memory     then at last youyou as you stood before me last the very     loveliest girl in all the world my heart almost burst and in the     wild sick pain of the moment i had a strange comforting flash of     thought that a man who could leave you must be impelled by something     great in store for him i feel that i told you once to laugh at     death that is what i shall do but perhaps that is not the great     experience which will come to me      i saw the sun set in the sea way back toward the western horizon     where the thin dark line that was land disappeared in the red glow     the wind blows hard the water is rough dark gray and cold i like     the taste of the spray our boat rolls heavily and many boys are     already sick i do not imagine the motion will affect me it is     stuffy belowdeck ill spend what time i can above where i can see     and feel it was dark just now when i came below and as i looked     out into the windy darkness and strife i was struck by the     strangeness of the sea and how it seemed to be like my soul for a     long time i have been looking into my soul and i find such     ceaseless strife such dark unlit depths such chaos these     thoughts and emotions always with me keep me from getting close to     my comrades no not me but it keeps them away from me i think     they regard me strangely they all talk of submarines they are     afraid some will lose sleep at night but i never think of a     submarine when i gaze out over the tumbling black waters what i     think of what i am going after what i need seems far far away     always i am no closer now than when i was at your home so it has     not to do with distance and lenore maybe it has not to do with     trenches or germans      wednesday      it grows harder to get a chance to write and harder for me to     express myself when i could write i have to work or am on duty     when i have a little leisure i am somehow clamped this old chugging     boat beats the waves hour after hour all day and all night i can     feel the vibration when im asleep many things happen that would     interest you just the duty and play of the soldiers for that     matter and the stories i hear going from lip to lip and the     accidents oh so much happens but all these rush out of my mind     the moment i sit down to write there is something at work in me as     vast and heaving as the ocean      at first i had a fear a dislike of the ocean but that is gone it     is indescribable to stand on the open deck at night as we are     driving on and on and onto look up at the grand silent stars     that know that understand yet are somehow mercilessto look out     across the starlit moving sea its ceaseless movement at first     distressed me now i feel that it is perpetually moving to try to     become still to seek a level to find itself to quiet down to     peace but that will never be and i think if the ocean is not like     the human heart then what is it like      this voyage will be good for me the hard incessant objective life     the physical life of a soldier somehow comes to a halt on board     ship and every hour now is immeasurable for me whatever the     mystery of life of death of what drives me of why i cannot help     fight the demon in me of this thing called warthe certainty is     that these dark strange nights on the sea have given me a hope and     faith that the truth is not utterly unattainable      sunday      were in the danger zone now with destroyers around us and a     cruiser ahead i am all eyes and ears i lose sleep at night from     thinking so hard the ship doctor stopped me the other daystudied     my face then he said youre too intense you think too hard     are you afraid and i laughed in his face absolutely no i told     him then forgetand mix with the boys playcut upfightdo     anything but think that doctor is a good chap but he doesnt     figure kurt dorn if he imagines the germans can kill me by making me     think      were nearing france now and the very air is charged an aeroplane     came out to meet uswelcome us i guess and it flew low the     soldiers went wild i never had such a thrill that air game would     just suit me if i were fitted for it but im no mechanic besides     im too big and heavy my place will be in the front line with a     bayonet strange how a bayonet fascinates me      they say we cant write home anything about the war ill write you     something whenever i can dont be unhappy if you do not hear     oftenor if my letters cease to come my heart and my mind are full     of you whatever comes to methe training over herethe going to     the trenchesthe fightingi shall be safe if only i can remember     you      with love      kurt  lenore carried that letter in her bosom when she went out to walk in the fields to go over the old ground she and kurt had trod hand in hand from the stone seat above the brook she watched the sunset all was still except the murmur of the running water and somehow she could not long bear that as the light began to shade on the slopes she faced them feeling as always a strength come to her from their familiar lines twilight found her high above the ranch and absolutely alone she would have this lonely hour and then all her mind and energy must go to what she knew was imperative duty she would work to the limit of her endurance  it was an autumn twilight with a cool wind gray sky and sad barren slopes the fertile valley seemed half obscured in melancholy haze and over toward the dim hills beyond night had already fallen no stars no moon no afterglow of sunset illumined the grayness that in this hour seemed prophetic of lenores future  safe he said i shall be safe if only i can remember you she whispered to herself wonderingly what did he mean  pondering the thought she divined it had to do with dorns singular spiritual mood he had gone to lend his body as so much physical brawn so much weight to a concerted movement of men but his mind was apart from a harmony with that lenore felt that whatever had been the sacrifice made by kurt dorn it had been passed with his decision to go to war what she prayed for then was something of his spirit  slowly in the gathering darkness she descended the long slope the approaching night seemed sad with autumn song of insects all about her breathed faith from the black hills above the gray slopes below from the shadowy void from the murmuring of insect life in the grass the rugged fallow ground under her feet seemed to her to be a symbol of faithfaith that winter would come and passthe spring sun and rain would burst the seeds of wheatand another summer would see the golden fields of waving grain if she did not live to see them they would be there just the same and so life and nature had faith in its promise that strange whisper was to lenore the whisper of god     chapter xxvi  through the pale obscurity of a french night cool raw moist with a hint of spring in its freshness a line of soldiers plodded along the lonely melancholy lanes wan starlight showed in the rifts between the clouds neither dark nor light the midnight hour had its unreality in this line of marching men and its reality in the dim vague hedges its spectral posts its barren fields  rain had ceased to fall but a fine cold penetrating mist filled the air the ground was muddy in places slippery in others and here and there it held pools of water ankledeep the stride of the marching men appeared short and dragging without swing or rhythm it was weary yet full of the latent power of youth of unused vitality stern cleancut youthful faces were set northward unchanging in the shadowy pale gleams of the night these faces lifted intensely whenever a strange muffled deeptoned roar rolled out of the murky north the night looked stormy but that rumble was not thunder fifty miles northward beyond that black and mysterious horizon great guns were booming war  sometimes as the breeze failed the night was silent except for the slow sloppy tramp of the marching soldiers then the low voices were hushed when the wind freshened again it brought at intervals those deep significant detonations which as the hours passed seemed to grow heavier and more thunderous  at length a faint gray light appeared along the eastern sky and gradually grew stronger the dawn of another day was close at hand it broke as if reluctantly cold and gray and sunless  the detachment of united states troops halted for camp outside of the french village of a  kurt dorn was at mess with his squad  the months in france had flown away on wings of training and absorbing and waiting dorn had changed incalculably but all he realized of it was that he weighed one hundred and ninety pounds and that he seemed to have lived a hundred swift lives all that he saw and felt became part of him his comrades had been won to him as friends by virtue of his everready helping hand by his devotion to training by his closelipped acceptance of all the toils and knocks and pains common to the making of a soldier the squad lived together as one large family of brothers dorns comrades had at first tormented him with his german name they had made fun of his abstraction and his letterwriting they had misunderstood his aloofness but the ridicule died away and now in the presaged nature of events his comrades all governed by the physical life of the soldier took him for a man  perhaps it might have been chance or it might have been true of all the american squads but the fact was that dorns squad was a strangely assorted set of young men perhaps that might have been dorns conviction from coming to live long with them they were a part of the new york division of the th all supposed to be new york men as a matter of fact this was not true dorn was a native of washington sanborn was a thickset sturdy fellow with the clear brown tan and clear brown eyes of the californian brewer was from south carolina a lean lanky southerner with deepset dark eyes dixon hailed from massachusetts from a fighting family and from harvard where he had been a noted athlete he was a big lithe handsome boy redfaced and curlyhaired purcell was a newyorker of rich family highly connected and his easy clean fine ways with the elegance of his person his blond distinction made him stand out from his khakiclad comrades though he was clad identically with them rogers claimed the bronx to be his home and he was proud of it he was little almost undersized but a knot of muscle a keenfaced youth with irish blood in him these particular soldiers of the squad were closest to dorn  corporal bob owens came swinging in to throw his sombrero down  whats the orders bob some one inquired  were going to rest here he replied  the news was taken impatiently by several and agreeably by the majority they were all travelstained and worn dorn did not comment on the news but the fact was that he hated the french villages they were so old so dirty so obsolete so different from what he had been accustomed to but he loved the pastoral french countryside so calm and picturesque he reflected that soon he would see the devastation wrought by the huns  any news from the front asked dixon  i should smile replied the corporal grimly  well open up you clam  owens thereupon told swiftly and forcibly what he had heard more advance of the germansit was familiar news but somehow it was taken differently here within sound of the guns dorn studied his comrades wondering if their sensations were similar to his he expressed nothing of what he felt but all the others had something to say hard cool fiery violent speech that differed as those who uttered it differed yet its predominant note rang fight  just heard a funny story said owens presently  spring it somebody replied  this comes from berlin so they say according to rumor the kaiser and the crown prince seldom talk to each other they happened to meet the other day and the crown prince said say pop what got us into this war  the emperor replied my son i was deluded  oh sire impossible exclaimed the prince how could it be  well some years ago i was visited by a grinning sonofagun from new yorkno other than the great tr i took him around he was most interested in my troops after he had inspected them and particularly the imperial guard he slapped me on the back and shouted bill you could lick the world  and my son i fell for it  this story fetched a roar from every soldier present except dorn an absence of mirth in him had been noted before  dorn cant you laugh protested dixon  sure i canwhen i hear something funny replied dorn  his comrades gazed hopelessly at him  my lawd boy thet was shore funny drawled brewer with his lazy southern manner  kurt youre not human said owens sadly thats why they call you demon dorn  all the boys in the squad had nicknames in dorns case several had been applied by irrepressible comrades before one stuck the first one received a poor reception from kurt the second happened to be a great blunder for the soldier who invented it he was not in dorns squad but he knew dorn pretty well and in a moment of deviltry he had coined for dorn the name kaiser dorn dorns reaction to this appellation was discomfiting and painful for the soldier as he lay flat on the ground where dorn had knocked him he had struggled with a natural rage quickly to overcome it he showed the right kind of spirit he got up dorn i apologize i was only in fun but some fun is about as funny as death on the way out he suggested a more felicitous namedemon dorn somehow the boys took to that it fitted many of dorns violent actions in training especially the way he made a bayonet charge dorn objected strenuously but the name stuck no comrade or soldier ever again made a hint of dorns german name or blood  fellows if a funny story cant make dorn laugh hes absolutely a dead one said owens  spring a new one quick spoke up some one gee its great to laugh why ive not heard from home for a month  dorn will you beat it so i can spring this one queried owens  sure replied dorn amiably as he started away i suppose you think me one of these idareyoutomakemelaugh sort of chaps  forget her dorncome out of it chirped up rogers  to dorns regret he believed that he failed his comrades in one way and he was always trying to make up for it part of the training of a soldier was the everpresent need and duty of cheerfulness every member of the squad had his secret his own personal memory his inner consciousness that he strove to keep hidden long ago dorn had divined that this or that comrade was looking toward the bright side or pretending there was one they all played their parts like men they faced this incomprehensible duty this tremendous separation this dark and looming future as if it was only hard work that must be done in good spirit but dorn despite all his will was mostly silent aloof brooding locked up in his eternal strife of mind and soul he could not help it notwithstanding all he saw and divined of the sacrifice and pain of his comrades he knew that his ordeal was infinitely harder it was natural that they hoped for the best he had no hope  boys said owens theres a squad of blue devils camped over here in an old barn just back from the front some one said there wasnt a man in it who hadnt had a dozen wounds and some twice that many we must see that bunch bravest soldiers of the whole war theyve been through the three yearsat verdunon the marneand now this awful flanders drive its up to us to see them  news like this thrilled dorn during all the months he had been in france the deeds and valor of these germannamed blue devils had come to him here and there and everywhere dorn remembered all he heard and believed it too though some of the charges and some of the burdens attributed to these famed soldiers seemed unbelievable his opportunity had now come with the moving up to the front he would meet reality and all within him the keen strange eagerness the curiosity that perplexed the unintelligible longing the heat and burn of passion quickened and intensified  not until late in the afternoon however did off duty present an opportunity for him to go into the village it looked the same as the other villages he had visited and the inhabitants old men old women and children all had the somber eyes the strained hungry faces the oppressed look he had become accustomed to see but sad as were these inhabitants of a village near the front there was never in any one of them any absence of welcome to the americans indeed in most people he met there was a quick flashing of intense joy and gratitude the americans had come across the sea to fight beside the french that was the import tremendous and beautiful  dorn met dixon and rogers on the main street of the little village they had been to see the blue devils  better stay away from them advised dixon dubiously  no why ejaculated dorn  dixon shook his head greatest bunch i ever looked at but i think they resented our presence pat and i were talking about them its strange dorn but i believe these blue devils that have saved france and england and perhaps america too dont like our being here  impossible replied dorn  go and see for yourself put in rogers i believe we all ought to look them over  thoughtfully dorn strode on in the direction indicated and presently he arrived at the end of the village where in an old orchard he found a low rambling dilapidated barn before which clusters of soldiers in blue lounged around smoking fires as he drew closer he saw that most of them seemed fixed in gloomy abstraction a few were employed at some task of hand and several bent over the pots on fires dorns sweeping gaze took in the whole scene and his first quick strange impression was that these soldiers resembled ghouls who had lived in dark holes of mud  kurt meant to make the most of his opportunity to him in his peculiar need this meeting would be of greater significance than all else that had happened to him in france the nearest soldier sat on a flattened pile of straw around which the ground was muddy at first glance kurt took him to be an african so dark were face and eyes no one heeded kurts approach the moment was poignant to kurt he spoke french fairly well so that it was emotion rather than lack of fluency which made his utterance somewhat unintelligible the soldier raised his head his face seemed a black flashhis eyes piercingly black staring deep full of terrible shadow they did not appear to see in kurt the man but only the trim clean united states army uniform kurt repeated his address this time more clearly  the frenchman replied gruffly and bent again over the faded worn coat he was scraping with a knife then kurt noticed two thingsthe mans great hollow spare frame and the torn shirt stained many colors one of which was dark red his hands resembled both those of a mason with the horny callous inside and those of a saltwater fisherman with bludgy fingers and barked knuckles that never healed  dorn had to choose his words slowly because of unfamiliarity with french but he was deliberate too because he wanted to say the right thing his eagerness made the frenchman glance up again but while dorn talked of the long waits the long marches the arrival at this place the satisfaction at nearing the front his listener gave no sign that he heard but he did hear and so did several of his comrades  were coming strong he went on his voice thrilling a million of us this year were untrained well have to split up among english and french troops and learn how from you but weve comeand well fight  then the frenchman put on his coat that showed him to be an officer he wore medals the dark glance he then flashed over dorn was different from his first it gave dorn both a twinge of shame and a thrill of pride it took in dorns characteristic teutonic blond features and likewise an officers swift appreciation of an extraordinarily splendid physique  youve german blood he said  yes but im american replied dorn simply and he met that soulsearching black gaze with all his intense and fearless spirit dorn felt that never in his life had he been subjected to such a test of his manhood of his truth  my names huon said the officer and he extended one of the huge deformed hands  mines dorn replied kurt meeting that hand with his own  whereupon the frenchman spoke rapidly to the comrade nearest him so rapidly that all kurt could make of what he said was that here was an american soldier with a new idea they drew closer and it became manifest that the interesting idea was kurts news about the american army it was news here and carefully pondered by these frenchmen as slowly one by one they questioned him they doubted but dorn convinced them they seemed to like his talk and his looks dorns quick faculties grasped the simplicity of these soldiers after three terrible years of unprecedented warfare during which they had performed the impossible they did not want a fresh army to come along and steal their glory by administering a final blow to a tottering enemy gazing into those strange seared faces beginning to see behind the iron mask dorn learned the one thing a soldier lives fights and dies forglory  kurt dorn was soon made welcome he was made to exhaust his knowledge of french he was studied by eyes that had gleamed in the face of death his hand was wrung by hands that had dealt death how terribly he felt that and presently when his excitement and emotion had subsided to the extent that he could really see what he looked at then came the reward of reality with all its incalculable meaning expressed to him in the gleaming bayonets in the worn accoutrements in the greatcoats like clapboards of mud in the hands that were claws in the feet that hobbled in the strange wonderful significance of bodily presence standing there as proof of valor of mans limitless endurance in the faces ah there dorn read the history that made him shudder and lifted him beyond himself for there in those still dark faces of boys grown old in three years shone the terror of war and the spirit that had resisted it  dorn in his intensity in the overemotion of his selfcentered passion so terribly driven to prove to himself something vague yet allpowerful illusive yet imperious divined what these blue devil soldiers had been through his mind was more than telepathic almost it seemed that souls were bared to him these soldiers quiet intent made up a grim group of men they seemed slow thoughtful plodding wrapped and steeped in calm but dorn penetrated all this and established the relation between it and the nameless and dreadful significance of their weapons and medals and uniforms and stripes and the magnificent vitality that was now all but spent  dorn might have resembled a curious adventureloving boy to judge from his handling of rifles and the way he slipped a strong hand along the gleaming bayonetblades but he was more than the curious youth he had begun to grasp a strange intangible something for which he had no name something that must be attainable for him something that for an hour or a moment would make him a fighter not to be slighted by these supermen  whatever his youth or his impelling spirit of manhood the fact was that he inspired many of these veterans of the bloody years to homeric narratives of the siege of verdun of the retreat toward paris of the victory of the marne and lastly of the kaisers battle this last and most awful offensive of the resourceful and frightful foe  brunelle told how he was the last survivor of a squad at verdun who had been ordered to hold a breach made in a front stone wall along the out posts how they had faced a bombardment of heavy gunsa whistling shrieking thundering roar pierced by the higher explosion of a bursting shellsmoke and sulphur and gasthe crumbling of walls and downward fling of shrapnel how the lives of soldiers were as lives of gnats hurled by wind and burned by flame death had a manifold and horrible diversity a soldiers head with ghastly face and conscious eyes momentarily poised in the air while the body rode away invisibly with an exploding shell he told of men blown up shot through and riddled and brained and disemboweled while their comrades grim and unalterable standing in a stream of blood lived through the rain of shells the smashing of walls lived to fight like madmen the detachment following the bombardment and to kill them every one  mathie told of the great retreathow men who had fought for days who were unbeaten and unafraid had obeyed an order they hated and could not understand and had marched day and night day and night eating as they toiled on sleeping while they marched on and on bloodyfooted desperate and terrible filled with burning thirst and the agony of ceaseless motion on with dragging legs and laboring breasts and redhazed eyes on and onward unquenchable with the spirit of france  sergeant delorme spoke of the sudden fierce aboutface at the marne of the irresistible onslaught of men whose homes had been invaded whose children had been murdered whose women had been enslaved of a ruthless fighting swift and deadly and lastly of a bayonet charge by his own division running down upon superior numbers engaging them in handtohand conflict malignant and fatal routing them over a field of blood and death  monsieur dorn do you know the french use of a bayonet asked delorme  no replied dorn  allons i will show you he said taking up two rifles and handing one to dorn come it is soand soa trick the boches cant face cold steel ah monsieur you have the supple wrists of a juggler you have the arms of a giant you have the eyes of a duelist you will be one grand spitter of german pigs  dorn felt the blanching of his face the tingling of his nerves the tightening of his muscles a cold and terrible meaning laid hold of him even in the instant when he trembled before this flamingeyed french veteran who complimented him while he instructed how easily dorn thought could this soldier slip the bright bayonet over his guard and pierce him from breast to back how horrible the proximity of that sinister blade with its glint its turn its edge so potently expressive of its history even as dorn crossed bayonets with this inspired frenchman he heard a soldier comrade say that delorme had let daylight through fourteen boches in that memorable victory of the marne  you are very big and strong and quick monsieur said the officer huon simply in bayonetwork you will be a killer of boches  in their talk and practice and help in their intent to encourage the young american soldier these blue devils one and all dealt in frank and inevitable terms of death that was their meaning in life it was immeasurably horrible for dorn because it seemed a realization of his imagined visions he felt like a child among old savages of a war tribe yet he was fascinated by this closeup suggestion of man to man in battle of german to american of materialist to idealist and beyond all control was the bursting surge of his blood the exercises he had gone through the trick he had acquired somehow had strange power to liberate his emotion  the officer huon spoke english and upon his words dorn hung spellbound  you americans have the fine dash the nerve you will perform wonders but you dont realize what this war is you will perish of sheer curiosity to see or eagerness to fight but these are the least of the horrors of this war  actual fighting is to me a relief a forgetfulness an excitement and is so with many of my comrades we have survived wounds starvation shellshock poison gas and fire the diseases of war the awful toil of the trenches and each and every one of us who has served long bears in his mind the particular horror that haunts him i have known veterans to go mad at the screaming of shells i have seen good soldiers stand upon a trench inviting the fire that would end suspense for a man who hopes to escape alive this war is indeed the ninth circle of hell  my own particular horrors are mud water and cold i have lived in dark cold mudholes so long that my mind concerning them is not right i know it the moment i come out to rest rest do you know that we cannot rest the comfort of this dirty old barn of these fires of this bare ground is so great that we cannot rest we cannot sleep we cannot do anything when i think of the past winter i do not remember injury and agony for myself or the maimed and mangled bodies of my comrades i remember only the horrible cold the endless ages of waiting the hopeless misery of the dugouts foul black ratholes that we had to crawl into through sticky mud and filthy water mud water and cold with the stench of the dead clogging your nostrils that to me is war les misérables you americans will never know that thank god for it could not be endured by men who did not belong to this soil after all the filthy water is half blood and the mud is part of the dead of our people  huon talked on and on with the eloquence of a frenchman who relieves himself of a burden he told of trenches dug in a swamp lived in and fought in and then used for the graves of the dead trenches that had to be lived in again months afterward the rotting dead were everywhere when they were covered the rain would come to wash away the earth exposing them again that was the strange refrain of this soldiers moody lamentthe rain that fell the mud that forever held him rooted fast in the tracks of his despair he told of night and storm of a weary squad of men lying flat trying to dig in under cover of rain and darkness of the hell of cannonade over and around them he told of hours that blasted mens souls of death that was a blessing of escape that was torture beyond the endurance of humans crowning that night of horrors piled on horrors when he had seen a dozen men buried alive in mud lifted by a monster shell when he had seen a refuge deep underground opened and devastated by a like projectile came a cloudburst that flooded the trenches and the fields drowning soldiers whose injuries and mudladen garments impeded their movements and rendering escape for the others an infernal labor and a hideous wretchedness unutterable and insupportable  round the campfires the blue devils stood or lay trying to rest but the habit of the trenches was upon them dorn gazed at each and every soldier so like in strange resemblance so different in physical characteristics and the sad profound and terrifying knowledge came to him of what they must have in their minds he realized that all he needed was to suffer and fight and live through some little part of the war they had endured and then some truth would burst upon him it was there in the restless steps in the prone forms in the sunken glaring eyes what soldiers what men what giants three and a half years of unnamable and indescribable fury of action and strife of thought not dead nor stolid like oxen were these soldiers of france they had a simplicity that seemed appalling we have given all we have stood in the way borne the brunt saved youthis was flung at dorn not out of their thought but from their presence the fact that they were there was enough he needed only to find these bravest of brave warriors real alive throbbing men  dorn lingered there loath to leave the great lesson of his life held vague connection in some way with this squad of french privates but he could not pierce the veil this meeting came as a climax to four months of momentous meetings with the best and the riffraff of many nations dorn had studied talked listened and learned he who had as yet given nothing fought no enemy saved no comrade or refugee or child in all this whirlpool of battling millions felt a profound sense of his littleness his ignorance he who had imagined himself unfortunate had been blind sick selfcentered here were soldiers to whom comfort and rest were the sweetest blessings upon the earth and they could not grasp them no more could they grasp them than could the gaping civilians and the distinguished travelers grasp what these grand hulks of veteran soldiers had done once a group of civilians halted near the soldiers an officer was their escort he tried to hurry them on but failed delorme edged away into the gloomy damp barn rather than meet such visitors some of his comrades followed suit ferier the incomparable of the blue devils the wearer of all the french medals and the bearer of twentyfive wounds received in battlehe sneaked away afraid and humble and sullen to hide himself from the curious that action of feriers was a revelation to dorn he felt a sting of shame there were two classes of people in relation to this warthose who went to fight and those who stayed behind what had delorme or mathie or ferier to do with the world of selfish comfortable wellfed men dorn heard a million voices of france crying out the bitter truththat if these warbowed veterans ever returned alive to their homes it would be with hopes and hearts and faiths burned out with hands forever lost to their old use with bodies that the war had robbed  dorn bade his newmade friends adieu and in the darkening twilight he hurried toward his own camp  if i could go back home now honorably and well i would never do it he muttered i couldnt bear to live knowing what i know nowunless i had laughed at this death and risked itand dealt it  he was full of gladness of exultation in contemplation of the wonderful gift the hours had brought him more than any men of history or present he honored these soldiers the germans feared like an indian dorn respected brawn courage fortitude silence aloofness  there was a divinity in those soldiers he soliloquized i felt it in their complete ignorance of their greatness yet they had pride jealousy oh the mystery of it all when my day comes ill last one short and terrible hour i would never make a soldier like one of them no american could they are frenchmen whose homes have been despoiled  in the tent of his comrades that night dorn reverted from old habit and with a passionate eloquence he told all he had seen and heard and much that he had felt his influence on these young men long established but subtle and unconscious became in that hour a tangible fact he stirred them he felt them thoughtful and sad and yet more unflinching stronger and keener for the inevitable day     chapter xxvii  the monstrous possibility that had consumed kurt dorn for many months at last became an eventhe had arrived on the battlefront in france  all afternoon the company of united states troops had marched from far back of the line resting as darkness came on at a camp of reserves and then going on artillery fire had been desultory during this march the big guns that had rolled their thunder miles and miles were now silent but an immense activity and a horde of soldiers back of the lines brought strange leaden oppression to kurt dorns heart  the last slow travel of his squad over dark barren space and through deep narrow winding lanes in the ground had been a nightmare ending to the long journey france had not yet become clear to him he was a stranger in a strange land in spite of his tremendous interest and excitement all seemed abstract matters of his feeling the plague of himself made actuality the substance of dreams that last day the cumulation of months of training and travel had been one in which he had observed heard talked and felt in a nervous and fevered excitement but now he imagined he could not remember any of it his poignant experience with the blue devils had been a reality he could never forget but now this blackness of subterranean cavern this damp sickening odor of earth this presence of men the strange muffled soundsall these were unreal how had he come here his mind labored with a burden strangely like that on his chest a different utterly unfamiliar emotion seemed rising over him maybe that was because he was very tired and very sleepy sometime that night he must go on duty he ought to sleep it was impossible he could not close his eyes an effort to attend to what he was actually doing disclosed the fact that he was listening with all his strength for what he could not answer then he heard the distant muffled sounds and low voices nearer and thuds and footfalls his comrades were near him he heard their breathing he felt their presence they were strained and intense like him they were locked up in their own prison of emotions  always heretofore on nights that he lay sleepless dorn had thought of the two things dearest on earth to himlenore anderson and the golden wheathills of his home this night he called up lenores image it hung there in the blackness a dim pale phantom of her sweet face her beautiful eyes her sad lips and then it vanished not at all could he call up a vision of his beloved wheatfields so the suspicion that something was wrong with his mind became a certainty it angered him quickened his sensitiveness even while he despaired he ground his teeth and clenched his fists and swore to realize his presence there and to rise to the occasion as had been his vaunted ambition  suddenly he felt something slimy and hairy against his wristthen a stinging bite a rat a trench rat that lived on flesh he flung his arm violently and beat upon the soft earth the incident of surprise and disgust helped dorn at least in one way his mind had been set upon a strange and supreme condition of his being there of an emotion about to overcome him the bite of a rat drawing blood made a literal fact of his being a soldier in a dugout at the front waiting in the blackness for his call to go on guard this incident proved to dorn his limitations and that he was too terribly concerned with his feelings ever to last long as a soldier but he could not help himself his pulse his heart his brain all seemed to beat beat beat with a nameless passion  was he losing his nervewas he afraid his denial did not reassure him he understood that patriotism and passion were emotions and that the realities of a soldiers life were not  dorn forced himself to think of realities hoping thus to get a grasp upon his vanishing courage and memory helped him not so many days weeks months back he had been a different man at bordeaux when his squad first set foot upon french soil that was a splendid reality how he had thrilled at the welcome of the french sailors  then he thought of the strenuous round of army duties of training tasks of traveling in cold boxcars of endless marches of camps and villages of drills and billets never to be forgotten was that morning now seemingly long ago when an officer had ordered the battalion to pack we are going to the front he announced magic words what excitement what whooping what bragging and joy among the boys what hurry and bustle and remarkable efficiency that had been a reality of actual experience but the meaning of it the terrible significance had been beyond the mind of any american  im hereat the frontnow whispered dorn to himself a few rods away are germans  inconceivableno reality at all he went on with his swift account of things with his mind ever sharpening with that strange mounting emotion flooding to the full ready to burst its barriers when he and his comrades had watched their transport trains move awaywhen they had stood waiting for their own trainshad the idea of actual conflict yet dawned upon them dorn had to answer no he remembered that he had made few friends among the inhabitants of towns and villages where he had stayed what leisure time he got had been given to a seeking out of sailors soldiers and men of all races with whom he found himself in remarkable contact the ends of the world brought together by one war how could his memory ever hold all that had come to him but it did passion liberated it he saw now that his eye was a lens his mind a sponge his heart a gulf  out of the hundreds of thousands of american troops in france what honor it was to be in the chosen battalion to go to the front dorn lived only with his squad but he felt the envy of the whole army what luck to be chosen from so manyto go out and see the game through quickly he began to consider that differently now the luck might be with the soldiers left behind always underneath dorns perplexity and pondering under his intelligence and spirit at their best had been a something deeply personal something of the internal of him a selfish instinct it was the nature of manselfpreservation  like a tempest swept over dorn the most significant ordeal and lesson of his experience in francethat wonderful reality when he met the blue devils and they took him in however long he lived his life must necessarily be transformed from contact with those great men  the night march over the unending roads through the gloom and the spectral starlight with the dull rumblings of cannon shocking his heartthat dorn lived over finding strangely a minutest detail of observation and a singular veracity of feeling fixed in his memory  afternoon of that very day at the reserve camp somewhere back there had brought an officers address to the soldiers a strong and emphatic appeal as well as orderto obey to do ones duty to take no chances to be eternally vigilant to believe that every man had advantage on his side even in war if he were not a fool or a daredevil dorn had absorbed the speech remembered every word but it all seemed futile now then had come the impressive inspection of equipment a careful examination of gasmasks rifles knapsacks after that the order to march  dorn imagined that he had remembered little but he had remembered all perhaps the sense of strange unreality was only the twist in his mind yet he did not know where he waswhat part of francehow far north or south on the front linein what sector could not that account for the sense of feeling lost  nevertheless he was there at the end of all this incomprehensible journey he became possessed by an irresistible desire to hurry once more dorn attempted to control the farflinging of his thoughtsto come down to earth the earth was there under his hand soft sticky moldy smelling vilely he dug his fingers into it until the feel of something like a bone made him jerk them out perhaps he had felt a stone a tiny creeping chilly shudder went up his back then he remembered he felt he saw his little attic room in the old home back among the wheathills of the northwest six thousand miles away he would never see that room again what unaccountable vagary of memory had ever recalled it to him it faded out of his mind  some of his comrades whispered now and then one rolled over none snored for none of them slept dorn felt more aloof from them than ever how isolated each one was locked in his own trouble every one of them like himself had a lonely soul perhaps they were facing it he could not conceive of a careless thoughtless emotionless attitude toward this first night in the frontline trench  dorn gradually grew more acutely sensitive to the many faint rustling whispering sounds in and near the dugout  a soldier came stooping into the opaque square of the dugout door his rifle striking the framework gave out a metallic clink this fellow expelled a sudden heavy breath as if throwing off an oppression  is that you sanborn this whisper dorn recognized as dixons it was full of suppressed excitement  yes  guess its my turn next howhow does it go  sanborns laugh had an odd little quaver why so far as i know i guess its all right damn queer though i wish wed got here in daytime but maybe that wouldnt help  humph pretty quiet out there  so bob says but whats he knowmore than us i heard guns up the line and riflefire not so far off  can you see any  not a damn thingyet everything interrupted sanborn enigmatically  dixon called owens low and quickly from the darkness  dixon did not reply his sudden hard breathing the brushing of his garments against the door then swift soft steps dying away attested to the fact of his going  dorn tried to compose himself to rest if not to sleep he heard sanborn sit down and then apparently stay very still for some time all of a sudden he whispered to himself dorn distinguished the word hell  whats ailin you pard drawled brewer  sanborn growled under his breath and when some one else in the dugout quizzed him curiously he burst out ill bet you galoots the state of california against a dill pickle that when your turn comes youll be sick in your gizzards  well take our medicine came in the soft quiet voice of purcell  no more was said the men all pretended to fall asleep each ashamed to let his comrade think he was concerned  a short dull heavy rumble seemed to burst the outer stillness for a moment the dugout was silent as a tomb no one breathed then came a jar of the earth a creaking of shaken timbers some one gasped involuntarily another whispered  by god the real thing  dorn wondered how far away that jarring shell had alighted not so far it was the first he had ever heard explode near him roaring of cannon exploding of shellthis had been a source of everyday talk among his comrades but the jar the tremble of the earth had a dreadful significance another rumble another jar not so heavy or so near this time and then a few sharply connected reports clamped dorn as in a cold vise machinegun shots many thousand machinegun shots had he heard but none with the life and the spite and the spang of these did he imagine the difference cold as he felt he began to sweat and continually as he wiped the palms of his hands they grew wet again a queer sensation of lightheadedness and weakness seemed to possess him the roots of his willpower seemed numb nevertheless all the more revolving and allembracing seemed his mind  the officer in his speech a few hours back had said the sector to which the battalion had been assigned was alive by this he meant that active bombardment machinegun fire handgrenade throwing and gasshelling or attack in force might come any time and certainly must come as soon as the germans suspected the presence of an american force opposite them  that was the stunning reality to dornthe actual existence of the huns a few rods distant but realization of them had not brought him to the verge of panic he would not flinch at confronting the whole german army nor did he imagine he put a great price upon his life nor did he have any abnormal dread of pain nor had the wellremembered teachings of the bible troubled his spirit was he going to be a coward because of some incalculable thing in him or force operating against him already he sat there shivering and sweating with the load on his breast growing laborsome with all his sensorial being absolutely at keenest edge  rapid footfalls halted his heartbeats they came from above outside the dugout from the trench  dorn come out called the corporal  dorns response was instant but he was as blind as if he had no eyes and he had to feel his way to climb out the indistinct blurred form of the corporal seemed half merged in the pale gloom of the trench a cool wind whipped at dorns hot face surcharged with emotion the nature of which he feared dorn followed the corporal stumbling and sliding over the wet boards knocking bits of earth from the walls feeling a sick icy gripe in his bowels some strange light flared updied away another rumble distinct heavy and vibrating to his left somewhere the earth received a shock dorn felt a wave of air that was not wind  the corporal led the way past motionless men peering out over the top of the wall and on to a widening where an abutment of filled bags loomed up darkly here the corporal cautiously climbed up breaks in the wall and stooped behind the fortification dorn followed his legs did not feel natural something was lost out of them then he saw the little figure of rogers beside him dorns turn meant rogerss relief how pale against the night appeared the face of rogers as he peered under his helmet at dorn a low whining passed in the air overhead rogers started slightly a thump sounded out there interrupting the corporal who had begun to speak he repeated his order to dorn bending a little to peer into his face dorn tried to open his lips to say he did not understand but his lips were mute then the corporal led rogers away  that moment alone out in the open with the strange windy pall of nightallenveloping with the flares like sheetlightning along the horizon with a rumble here and a roar there with whistling fiends riding the blackness above with a series of popping impelling reports seemingly close in frontthat drove home to kurt dorn a cruel and present and unescapable reality  at that instant like bitter fate shot up a rocket or a starflare of calcium light bursting to expose all underneath in pitiless radiance with a gasp that was a sob dorn shrank flat against the wall staring into the fading circle feeling a creep of paralysis he must be seen he expected the sharp biting series of a machinegun or the bursting of a bomb but nothing happened except that the flare died away it had come from behind his own lines control of his muscles had almost returned when a heavy boom came from the german side miles away perhaps but close that boom meant a great shell speeding on its hideous mission it would pass over him he listened the wind came from that side it was cold it smelled of burned powder it carried sounds he was beginning to appreciateshots rumbles spats and thuds whistles of varying degree all isolated sounds then he caught a strange low moaning it rose it was coming fast it became an oooooo nearer and nearer it took on a singing whistle it was passingnofalling a mighty blow was delivered to the eartha jara splitting shock to windy darkness a wave of heavy air was flung afarand then came the soft heavy thumping of falling earth  that shell had exploded close to the place where dorn stood it terrified him it reduced him to a palpitating stricken wretch utterly unable to cope with the terror it was not what he had expected what were words anyhow by words alone he had understood this shell thing death was only a word too but to be blown to atoms it came every moment to some poor devil it might come to him but that was not fighting somewhere off in the blackness a huge iron monster belched this hell out upon defenseless men revolting and inconceivable truth  it was dorns ordeal that his mentality robbed this hour of novelty and of adventure that while his natural physical fear incited panic and nausea and a horrible convulsive internal retching his highly organized exquisitely sensitive mind more like a womans in its capacity for emotion must suffer through imagining the infinite agonies that he might really escape every shell then must blow him to bits every agony of every soldier must be his  but he knew what his duty was and as soon as he could move he began to edge along the short beat once at the end he drew a deep and shuddering breath and fighting all his involuntary instincts he peered over the top an invisible thing whipped close over his head it did not whistle it cut out in front of him was only thick pale gloom with spectral forms leading away to the horizon where flares like sheetlightning of a summer nights storm ran along showing smoke and bold ragged outlines then he went to the other end to peer over there his eyes were keen and through long years of habit at home going about at night without light he could see distinctly where ordinary sight would meet only a blank wall the flat ground immediately before him was bare of living or moving objects that was his duty as sentinel hereto make sure of no surprise patrol from the enemy lines it helped dorn to realize that he could accomplish this duty even though he was in a torment  that space before him was empty but it was charged with current wind shadow gloom smoke electricity death spiritwhatever that current was dorn felt it he was more afraid of that than the occasional bullets which zipped across sometimes shots from his own squad rang out up and down the line off somewhat to the north a machinegun on the allies side spoke now and then spitefully way back a big gun boomed dorn listened to the whine of shells from his own side with a far different sense than that with which he heard shells whine from the enemy how natural and yet how unreasonable shells from the other side came over to destroy him shells from his side went back to save him but both were shot to kill was he the unknown and shrinking novice of a soldier any better than an unknown and shrinking soldier far across there in the darkness what was equality but these were germans that thing so often saidso beaten into his braindid not convince out here in the face of death                                       four oclock with the gray light came a gradually increasing number of shells most of them struck far back a few to right and left dropped near the front line the dawn brokesuch a dawn as he never dreamed ofsmoky and raw with thunder spreading to a circle all around the horizon  he was relieved on his way in he passed purcell at the nearest post the elegant newyorker bore himself with outward calm but in the gray dawn he looked haggard and drawn older that flashed through dorns mind a single night had contained years more than years others of the squad had subtly changed dixon gave him a penetrating look as if he wore a mask under which was a face of betrayal of contrast to that soldier bearing of youth that was gone forever     chapter xxviii  the squad of men to which dorn belonged had to be on the lookout continually for an attack that was inevitable the germans were feeling out the line probably to verify spy news of the united states troops taking over a sector they had not however made sure of this fact  the gasshells came over regularly making life for the men a kind of suffocation most of the time and the great shells that blew enormous holes in front and in back of their position never allowed a relaxation from strain drawn and haggard grew the faces that had been so cleancut and brown and fresh                                       one evening at mess when the sector appeared quiet enough to permit of rest rogers was talking to some comrades before the door of the dugout  it sure got my goat that little promenade of ours last night over into no mans land he said we had orders to slip out and halt a german patrol that was supposed to be stealing over to our line we crawled on our bellies looking and listening every minute if that isnt the limit my heart was in my mouth i couldnt breathe and for the first moments if id run into a hun id had no more strength than a rabbit but all seemed clear it was not a bright nightsort of opaque and gloomyshadows everywhere there wasnt any patrol coming but corporal owens thought he heard men farther on working with wire we crawled some more and we must have got pretty close to the enemy linesin fact we hadwhen up shot one of those damned calcium flares we all burrowed into the ground i was paralyzed it got as light as noonstrange greenishwhite flare it magnified flat as i lay i saw the german embankments not fifty yards away i made sure we were goners slowly the light burned out then that machinegun you all heard began to rattle something queer about the way every shot of a machinegun bites the air we heard the bullets low down right over us say boys id almost rather be hit and have it done with we began to crawl back i wanted to run we all wanted to but owens is a nervy guy and he kept whispering another machinegun cut loose and bullets rained over us like hail they hit somewhere ahead scattering the gravel wed almost reached our line when smith jumped up and ran he said afterward that he just couldnt help himself the suspense was awful i know ive been a clerk in a bank get that and there i was under a hail of hun lead without being able to understand why or feel that any time had passed since giving up my job to go to war queer how i saw my old desk well thats how smith got his i heard the bullets spat him sort of thick and soft ugh owens and i dragged him along and finally into the trench he had a bullet through his shoulder and leg guess hell live all right boys take this from me nobody can tell you what a machinegun is like a rifle now is not so much you get shot at and you know the man must reload and aim that takes time but a machinegun whew its a comba finetoothed comband youre the louse its after you hear that steady rattle and then you hear bullets everywhere think of a man against a machinegun its not a square deal  dixon was one of the listeners he laughed  rogers id like to have been with you next time ill volunteer you had actiona run for your money thats what i enlisted for standing stilldoing nothing but waitthat drives me half mad my years of football have made action necessary otherwise i go stale in mind and body last night before you went on that scouting trip i had been on duty two hours near midnight the shelling had died down all became quiet no flaresno flashes anywhere there was a luminous kind of glow in the skymoonlight through thin clouds i had to listen and watch but i couldnt keep back my thoughts there i was a soldier facing no mans land across whose dark space were the huns we have come to regard as devils in brutality yet less than men and i thought of home no man knows what home really is until he stands that lonely midnight guard a shipwrecked sailor appreciates the comforts he once had a desert wanderer lost and starving remembers the food he once wasted a volunteer soldier facing death in the darkness thinks of his home it is a hell of a feeling and thinking of home i remembered my girl ive been gone four monthshave been at the front seven days or is it seven years and last night in the darkness she came to me oh yes she was there she seemed reproachful as she was when she coaxed me not to enlist my girl was not one of the kind who sends her lover to war and swears she will die an old maid unless he returns mine begged me to stay home or at least wait for the draft but i wasnt built that way i enlisted and last night i felt the bitterness of a soldiers fate all this beautiful stuff is bunk my girl is a peach she had many admirers two in particular that made me run my best down the stretch one is clubfooted he couldnt fight the other is all yellow him she liked best he had her fooled the damned slacker i wish i could believe id get safe back home with a few huns to my creditthe croix de guerreand an officers uniform that would be great how i could show up those fellows but ill get killedas sure as god made little apples ill get killedand she will marry one of the men who would not fight  it was about the middle of a clear morning still cold but the sun was shining guns were speaking intermittently those soldiers who were off duty had their gasmasks in their hands all were gazing intently upward  dorn sat a little apart from them he too looked skyward and he was so absorbed that he did not hear the occasional rumble of a distant gun he was watching the airmen at workthe most wonderful and famous feature of the war it absolutely enthralled dorn as a boy he had loved to watch the soaring of the golden eagles and once he had seen a great widewinged condor swooping along a mountaincrest how he had envied them the freedom of the heightsthe loneliness of the unscalable cragsthe companionship of the clouds here he gazed and marveled at the maneagles of the air  german planes had ventured over the lines flying high and english planes had swept up to intercept them one was rising then not far away climbing fast like a fishhawk with prey in its claws its color its framework its propeller and its aviator showed distinctly against the sky the buzzing highpitched drone of its motor floated down  the other aeroplanes far above had lost their semblance to mechanical mandriven machines they were now the eagles of the air they were rising circling diving in maneuvers that dorn knew meant pursuit but he could not understand these movements to him the airbattle looked as it must have looked to an indian birds of prey in combat dorn recalled verses he had learned as a boy written by a poet who sang of future wars in the air what he prophesied had come true was there not a sage now who could pierce the veil of the future and sing of such a thing as sacred human life dorn had his doubts poets and dreamers appeared not to be the men who could halt materialism strangely then as dorn gazed bitterly up at these fierce fliers who fought in the heavens he remembered the story of the three wise men and of bethlehem was it only a story where on this sunny spring morning was christ and the love of man for man  at that moment one of the forward aeroplanes which was drifting back over the enemy lines lost its singular grace of slow sweeping movement it poised in the air it changed shape it pitched as if from wave to wave of wind a faint puff of smoke showed tiny specks visible to dorns powerful eyes seemed to detach themselves and fall to be followed by the plane itself in sheer downward descent  dorn leaped to his feet what a thrilling and terrible sight his comrades stood bareheaded red faces uplifted openmouthed and wild with excitement not daring to disobey orders and yell at the top of their lungs dorn felt strong above the softened wonder and thought of a moment back a tingling pulsating wave of gushing blood go over him like his comrades he began to wave his arms and stamp and bite his tongue  swiftly the doomed plane swept down out of sight gone at that instant something which had seemed like a bird must have become a broken mass the other planes drifted eastward  dorn gasped and broke the spell on him he was hot and wet with sweat quivering with a frenzy how many thousand soldiers of the allies had seen that downward flight of the boche dorn pitied the destroyed airman hated himself and had all the fury of savage joy that had been in his comrades                                       dorn relieved from guard and firingpost rushed back to the dugout he needed the dark of that dungeon he crawled in and searching out the remotest blackest corner hidden from all human eyes and especially his own he lay there clammy and wet all over with an icy sickening rend like a wound in the pit of his stomach he shut his eyes but that did not shut out what he saw so help me god he whispered to himself six endless months had gone to the preparation of a deed that had taken one second that transformed him his life on earth his spirit in the beyond could never be now what they might have been and he sobbed through grinding teeth as he felt the disintegrating agonizing irremediable forces at work on body mind and soul  he had blown out the brains of his first german  fires of hell in two long lines bordering a barren ghastly hazy strip of land burst forth from the earth from holes where men hid poured thunder of guns and stream of smoke and screeching of iron that worthless strip of land barring deadly foes shook as with repeated earthquakes huge spouts of black and yellow earth lifted fountainlike to the dull heavy bursts of shells pound and jar whistle and whine long broken rumble and the rattling concatenation of quick shots like metallic cries exploding hailstorm of iron in the air a desert over which thousands of puffs of smoke shot up and swelled and drifted the sliding crash far away the sibilant hiss swift overhead boom weeeeeeeeeooooo from the east boom weeeeeeeeeooooo from the west  at sunset there was no letup the night was all the more hideous along the horizon flashed up the hot sheets of lightning that were not of a summer storm angry lurid red these upflung blazes and flames illumined the murky sky showing in the fitful and flickering intervals wagons driving toward the front and patrols of soldiers running toward some point and great upheavals of earth spread high  this heavy cannonading died away in the middle of the night until an hour before dawn when it began again with redoubled fury and lasted until daybreak  dawn came reluctantly dorn thought he was glad it meant a charge another night of that hellish shrieking and bursting of shells would kill his mind if not his body he stood on guard at a fightingpost corporal owens lay at his feet wounded slightly he would not retire as the cannons ceased he went to sleep rogers stood close on one side dixon on the other the squad had lived through that awful night soldiers were bringing food and drink to them all appeared grimly gay  dorn was not gay but he knew this was the day he would laugh in the teeth of death a slumbrous slow heat burned deep in him like a covered fire fierce and hot at heart awaiting the wind watching there he did not voluntarily move a muscle yet all his body twitched like that of the trained athlete strained to leap into the great race of his life  an officer came hurrying through the talking hushed men on guard backs to the trench never moved their eyes from the forbidden land in front the officer spoke look for a charge reserves were close behind he gave his orders and passed on  then an allied gun opened up with a boom the shell moaned on over dorn saw where it burst sending smoke and earth aloft that must have been a signal for a bombardment of the enemy all along this sector for big and little guns began to thunder and crack  the spectacle before dorns hard keen eyes was one that he thought wonderful far across no mans land which sloped somewhat at that point in the plain he saw movement of troops and guns his eyes were telescopic over there the ground appeared grassy in places with green ridges rising and patches of brush and straggling trees standing out clearly faint graycolored squads of soldiers passed in sight with helmets flashing in the sun guns were being hauled forward mounted horsemen dashed here and there vanishing and reappearing and all through that wide area of color and action shot up live black spouts of earth crowned in white smoke that hung in the air after the earth fell back they were beautiful these shellbursts round balls of white smoke magically appeared in the air to spread and drift long yellow columns or streaks rose here and there leaped up a fanshaped dirty cloud savage and sinister sometimes several shells burst close together dashing the upflung sheets of earth together and blending their smoke at intervals a huge creamyyellow explosion like a geyser rose aloft to spread and mushroom then to detach itself from the heavier body it had upheaved and float away white and graceful on the wind  sinister beauty dorn soon lost sight of that there came a gnawing at his vitals the far scene of action could not hold his gaze that dark uneven hummocky break in the earth which was a goodly number of rods distant yet now seemed close drew a startling attention dorn felt his eyes widen and pop spots and dots shiny illusive bobbed along that break behind the mounds beyond the farther banks a yell as from one lusty throat ran along the line of which dorns squad held the center dorns sight had a piercing intensity all was hard under his griphis rifle the boards and bags against which he leaned corporal owens rose beside him bareheaded to call low and fiercely to his men  the gray dots and shiny spots leaped up magically and appallingly into men german soldiers boches huns on a charge they were many but wide apart they charged running low  machinegun rattle riflefire and strangled shouts blended along the line from the charging huns seemed to come a sound that was neither battlecry nor yell nor chant yet all of them together the gray advancing line thinned at points opposite the machineguns but it was coming fast  dorn cursed his hard fumbling hands which seemed so eager and fierce that they stiffened they burned too from their grip on the hot rifle shot after shot he fired missing he could not hit a field full of huns he dropped shells fumbled with them at the breech loaded wildly aimed at random pulled convulsively his brain was on fire he had no anger no fear only a great and futile eagerness yell and crack filled his ears the gray stolid unalterable huns must be driven back dorn loaded crushed his rifle steady pointed low at a great gray bulk and fired that hun pitched down out of the gray advancing line the sight almost overcame dorn dizzy with blurred eyes he leaned over his gun his abdomen and breast heaved and he strangled over his gorge almost he fainted but violence beside him somehow great heaps of dust and gravel flung over him hoarse wild yells in his ears roused him the boches were on the line he leaped up through the dust he saw charging gray forms thick and heavy they plunged as if actuated by one will bulky blond men ashen of face with eyes of blue fire and brutal mouths set grimhuns  up out of the shallow trench sprang comrades on each side of dorn no rats to be cornered in a hole dorn seemed drawn by powerful hauling chains he did not need to climb four big germans appeared simultaneously upon the embankment of bags they were shooting one swung aloft an arm and closed fist he yelled like a demon he was a bombthrower on the instant a bullet hit dorn tearing at the side of his head stinging excruciatingly knocking him down flooding his face with blood the shock like a weight held him down but he was not dazed a body khakiclad rolled down beside him convulsively flopped against him he bounded erect his ears filled with a hoarse and clicking din his heart strangely lifting in his breast  only one german now stood upon the embankment of bags and he was the threatening bombthrower the others were downgray forms wrestling with brown dixon was lunging at the bombthrower and reaching him with the bayonet ran him through the belly he toppled over with an awful cry and fell hard on the other side of the wall of loaded bags the bomb exploded in the streaky burst dixon seemed to charge in bulkto be flung aside like a leaf by a gale  little rogers had engaged an enemy who towered over him they feinted swung and cracked their guns together then locked bayonets another german striding from behind stabbed rogers in the back he writhed off the bloody bayonet falling toward dorn showing a white face that changed as he fell with quiver of torture and dying eyes  that dormant inhibited self of dorn suddenly was no more fast as a flash he was upon the murdering hun bayonet and riflebarrel lunged through him and so terrible was the thrust that the german was thrown back as if at a blow from a batteringram dorn whirled the bloody bayonet and it crashed to the ground the rifle of the other german dorn saw not the visage of the foeonly the thickset body and this he ripped open in one mighty slash the germans life spilled out horribly  dorn leaped over the bloody mass owens lay next wideeyed alive but stricken purcell fought with clubbed rifle backing away from several foes brewer was being beaten down gray forms closing in dorn saw leveled small guns flashes of red the impact of lead striking him but he heard no shots the roar in his ears was the filling of a gulf out of that gulf pierced his laugh gray formsgunsbullets bayonetsdeathhe laughed at them his moment had come here he would pay his immense and terrible joy bridged the ages between the past and this moment when he leaped light and swift like a huge cat upon them they fired and they hit but dorn sprang on tigerishly with his loud and nameless laugh bayonets thrust at him were straws these enemies gave way appalled with sweep and lunge he killed one and split a seconds skull before the first had fallen a third he lifted and upset and gored like a bull in one single stroke the fourth and last of that group screaming his terror and fury ran in close to get beyond that sweeping blade he fired as he ran dorn tripped him heavily and he had scarcely struck the ground when that steel transfixed his bulging throat  brewer was down but purcell had been reinforced soldiers in brown came on the run shooting yelling brandishing they closed in on the germans and dorn ran into that mêlée to make one thrust at each gray form he encountered  shriller yells along the lineamerican yellsthe enemy there had given ground dorn heard he saw the gray line waver he saw reserves running to aid his squad the germans would be beaten back there was whirling blackness in his head through which he seemed to see the laugh broke hoarse and harsh from his throat dust and blood choked him  another gray form blocked his leaping way dorn saw only low down the gray arms reaching with bright unstained blade his own bloody bayonet clashed against it locked and felt the helplessness of the arms that wielded it an instant of pausea heaving breathless instinct of impending exhaustiona moment when the petrific mace of primitive man stayed at the return of the humanthen with bloody foam on his lips dorn spent his madness  a supple twistthe french trickand dorns powerful lunge with all his ponderous weight drove his bayonet through the enemys lungs  kamarod came the strange strangling cry  a weight sagged down on dorns rifle he did not pull out the bayonet but as it lowered with the burden of the body his eyes fixed at one height suddenly had brought into their range the face of his foe  a boydying on his bayonet then came a resurrection of kurt dorns soul he looked at what must be his last deed as a soldier his mind halted he saw only the ghastly face the eyes in which he expected to see hate but saw only love of life suddenly reborn suddenly surprised at death  god save you german id give my life for yours  too late dorn watched the youths last clutching of empty fingers the last look of consciousness at his conqueror the last quiver the youth died and slid back off the rigid bayonet war of men  a heavy thud sounded to the left of dorn a bursting flash hid the face of his german victim a terrific wind sharp and hard as nails lifted dorn into roaring blackness     chapter xxix  many waters shone white and green under the bright may sunshine seen from the height of slope the winding brooks looked like silver bands across a vast belt of rainy green and purple that bordered the broad river in the bottomlands a summer haze filled the air and hints of gold on the waving wheat slopes presaged an early and bountiful harvest  it was warm up there on the slope where lenore anderson watched and brooded the breeze brought fragrant smell of freshcut alfalfa and the rustling song of the wheat the stately house gleamed

terrible line in a spokane newspaper publishing an associated press despatch of pershings casualtylist no more that had been the only news of kurt dorn for a long time a month had dragged by of doubt of hope of slow despairing  up to the time of that fatal announcement lenore had scarcely noted the fleeting of the days with all her spirit and energy she had thrown herself into the organizing of the women of the valley to work for the interests of the war she had made herself a leader who spared no effort no sacrifice no expense in what she considered her duty conservation of food intensive farm production knitting for soldiers liberty loans and red crossthese she had studied and mastered to the end that the women of the great valley had accomplished work which won national honor it had been excitement joy and a strange fulfilment for her but after the shock caused by the fatal news about dorn she had lost interest though she had worked on harder than ever  just a night ago her father had gazed at her and then told her to come to his office she did so and there he said youre workin too hard youve got to quit  oh no dad im only tired tonight she had replied let me go on ive planned so  no he said banging his desk youll run yourself down  but father these are wartimes could i do lesscould i think of  youve done wonders youve been the life of this work some one else can carry it on now youd kill yourself an this war has cost the andersons enough  should we count the cost she asked  anderson had sworn no we shouldnt but im not goin to lose my girl do you get that hunch ive bought bonds by the bushel ive given thousands to your relief societies i gave up my son jiman that cost us mother im raisin a million bushels of wheat this year that the government can have an im starvin to death because i dont get what i used to eat then this last blowdornthat fine young wheatman the bestaw lenore  but dad isisnt there anyany hope  anderson was silent  dad she had pleaded if he were really deadburiedoh wouldnt i feel it  youve overworked yourself now youve got to rest her father had replied huskily  but dad   i said no ive a heap of pride in what youve done an i sure think youre the best anderson of the lot thats all now kiss me an go to bed  that explained how lenore came to be alone high up on the vast wheatslope watching and feeling with no more work to do the slow climb there had proved to her how much she needed rest but work even under strain or pain would have been preferable to endless hours to think to remember to fight despair  mortally wounded she whispered the tragic phrase when where how had her lover been mortally wounded that meant death but no other word had come and no spiritual realization of death abided in her soul it seemed impossible for lenore to accept things as her father and friends did nevertheless equally impossible was it not to be influenced by their practical minds because of her nervousness of her overstrain she had lost a good deal of her mental poise and she divined that the only help for that was certainty of dorns fate she could bear the shock if only she could know positively and leaning her face in her hands with the warm wind blowing her hair and bringing the rustle of the wheat she prayed for divination  no answer absolutely no mystic consciousness of deathof an end to her love here on earth instead of that breathed a strong physical presence of life all about her in the swelling waving slopes of wheat in the beautiful butterflies in the singing birds low down and the soaring eagles high abovelife beating and surging in her heart her veins unquenchable and indomitable it gave the lie to her morbidness but it seemed only a physical state how could she find any tangible hold on realities  she lifted her face to the lonely sky and her hands pressed to her breast where the deep ache throbbed heavily  its not that i cant give him up she whispered as if impelled to speak i can i have given him up its this torture of suspense oh not to know but if that newspaper had claimed him one of the killed id not believe  so lenore trusted more to the mystic whisper of her womans soul than to all the unproven outward things still trust as she might the voice of the world dinned in her ears and between the two she was on the rack loss of jimloss of her motherwhat unfilled gulfs in her heart she was one who loved only few but these deeply today when they were gone was different from yesterday when they were heredifferent because memory recalled actual words deeds kisses of loved ones whose life was ended utterly futile was it for lenore to try to think of dorn in that way she saw his stalwart form down through the summer haze coming with his springy stride through the wheat yetthe wordsmortally wounded they had burned into her thought so that when she closed her eyes she saw them darkly red against the blindness of sight pain was a sluggish stream with source high in her breast and it moved with her unquickened blood if dorn were really dead what would become of her selfish question for a girl whose lover had died for his country she would work she would be worthy of him she would never pine she would live to remember but ah the difference to her never for her who had so loved the open the silken rustle of the wheat and the waving shadows the greenandgold slopes the birds of the air and the beasts of the field the voice of child and the sweetness of lifenever again would these be the same to her if dorn were gone forever  that ache in her heart had communicated itself to all her being it filled her mind and her body tears stung her eyes and again they were dry when tears would have soothed just as any other girl she wept and then she burned with fever a longing she had only faintly known a physical thing which she had resisted had become real insistent beating through love and loss she was to be denied a heritage common to all women a weariness dragged at her noble spirit was not a natural thing it must be intelligence seeing the higher but to be human was to love life to hate death to faint under loss to throb and pant with heavy sighs to lie sleepless in the long dark night to shrink with unutterable sadness at the wan light of dawn to follow duty with a laggard sense to feel the slow ebb of vitality and not to care to suffer with a breaking heart                                       sunset hour reminded lenore that she must not linger there on the slope so following the grassgrown lane between the sections of wheat she wended a reluctant way homeward twilight was falling when she reached the yard the cooling air was full of a fragrance of flowers freshly watered kathleen appeared on the path evidently waiting for her the girl was growing tall lenore remembered with a pang that her full mind had left little time for her to be a mother to this sister kathleen came running excited and wideeyed  lenore i thought youd never come she said i know something only dad told me not to tell you  then dont replied lenore with a little start  but id never keep it burst out kathleen breathlessly dads going to new york  lenores heart contracted she did not know how she felt somehow it was momentous news  new york what for she asked  he says its about wheat but he cant fool me he told me not to mention it to you  the girl was keen she wanted to prepare lenore yet did not mean to confide her own suppositions lenore checked a rush of curiosity they went into the house lenore hurried to change her outing clothes and boots and then went down to supper rose sat at table but her father had not yet come in lenore called him he answered and presently came tramping into the diningroom blustering and cheerful not for many months had lenore given her father such close scrutiny as she did then he was not natural and he baffled her a fleeting vague hope that she had denied lodgment in her mind seemed to have indeed been wild and unfounded but the very fact that her father was for once unfathomable made this situation remarkable all through the meal lenore trembled and she had to force herself to eat  lenore id like to see you said her father at last as he laid down his napkin and rose almost he convinced her then that nothing was amiss or different and he would have done so if he had not been too clever too natural she rose to follow catching kathleens whisper  dont let him put it over on you now  anderson lighted a big cigar as always after supper but to lenores delicate sensitiveness he seemed to be too long about it  lenore im takin a run to new yorkleave tonight at eightan i want you to sort of manage while im gone heres some jobs i want the men to doall noted down herean youll answer letters phone calls an all that not much work you know but youll have to hang around somethin important might turn up  yes dad ill be glad to she replied whywhy this sudden trip  anderson turned away a little and ran his hand over the papers on his desk did she only imagine that his hand shook a little  wheat deals i reckonmostly he said an mebbe ill run over to washington  he turned then puffing at his cigar and calmly met her direct gaze if there were really more than he claimed in his going he certainly did not intend to tell her lenore tried to still her mounting emotion these days she seemed all imagination then she turned away her face  will you try to find out if kurt dorn died of his woundand all about him she asked steadily but very low  lenore i sure will he exclaimed with explosive emphasis no doubt the sincerity of that reply was an immense relief to anderson once in new york i can pull wires if need be i absolutely promise you ill find outwhatall you want to know  lenore bade him goodby and went to her room where calmness deserted her for a while upon recovering she found that the time set for her fathers departure had passed strangely then the oppression that had weighed upon her so heavily eased and lifted the moment seemed one beyond her understanding she attributed her relief however to the fact that her father would soon end her suspense in regard to kurt dorn  in the succeeding days lenore regained her old strength and buoyancy and something of a control over the despondency which at times had made life misery  a golden day of sunlight and azure blue of sky ushered in the month of june many waters was a world of verdant green lenore had all she could do to keep from flying to the slopes but as every day now brought nearer the possibility of word from her father she stayed at home the next morning about nine oclock while she was at her fathers desk the telephonebell rang it did that many times every morning but this ring seemed to electrify lenore she answered the call hurriedly  hello lenore my girl how are you came rolling on the wire  dad dad is ityou cried lenore wildly  sure is just got here are you an the girls ok  were wellfine oh dad   you neednt send the car ill hire one  yesyesbut dadoh tell me   wait ill be there in five minutes  she heard him slam up the receiver and she leaned there palpitating with the queer vacant sounds of the telephone filling her ear  five minutes lenore whispered in five more minutes she would know they seemed an eternity suddenly a flood of emotion and thought threatened to overwhelm her leaving the office she hurried forth to find her sisters and not until she had looked everywhere did she remember that they were visiting a girl friend after this her motions seemed ceaseless she could not stand or sit still and she was continually going to the porch to look down the shady lane at last a car appeared coming fast then she ran indoors quite aimlessly and out again but when she recognized her father all her outward fears and tremblings vanished the broad brown flash of his face was reality he got out of the car lightly for so heavy a man and taking his valise he dismissed the chauffeur his smile was one of gladness and his greeting a hearty roar  lenore met him at the porch steps seeing in him feeling as she embraced him that he radiated a strange triumph and finality  say girl you look somethin like your old self he said holding her by the shoulders fine but youre a woman now where are the kids  theyre away replied lenore  how you stare laughed anderson as with arm round her he led her in anythin queer about your dads handsome mug  his jocular tone did not hide his deep earnestness never had lenore felt him so forceful his ruggedness seemed to steady her nerves that again began to fly anderson took her into his office closed the door threw down his valise  great to be home he exploded with heavy breath  lenore felt her face blanch and that intense quiver within her suddenly stilled  tell mequick she whispered  he faced her with flashing eyes and all about him changed youre an anderson you can stand shock  anyany shock but suspense  i lied about the wheat dealabout my trip to new york i got news of dorn i was afraid to tell you  yes  dorn is alive went on anderson  lenores hands went out in mute eloquence  he was all shot up he cant live hurried anderson hoarsely but hes alivehell live to see you  oh i knew i knew whispered lenore clasping her hands oh thank god  lenore steady now youre gettin shaky brace there my girl dorns alive ive brought him home hes here  here screamed lenore  yes theyll have him here in half an hour  lenore fell into her fathers arms blind and deaf to all outward things the light of day failed but her consciousness did not fade before it seemed a glorious radiance that was the truth lost for the moment blindly groping in whirling darkness when she did feel herself again it was as a weak dizzy palpitating child unable to stand her father in alarm and probable anger with himself was coaxing and swearing in one breath then suddenly the joy that had shocked lenore almost into collapse forced out the weakness with amazing strength she blazed she radiated she burst into utterance too swift to understand  hold on there girl interrupted anderson youve got the bit in your teeth listen will you let me talk wellwell there now sure its all right lenore you made me break it suddenlike listen theres all summer to talk just now you want to get a few details get em straight dorn is on the way here they put his stretcherweve been packin him on oneinto a motortruck theres a nurse come with mea man nurse wed better put dorn in mothers room thats the biggest an airiest you hurry an open up the windows an fix the bed an dont go out of your head with joy its sure more n we ever hoped for to see him alive to get him home but hes done for poor boy he cant live an hes in such shape that i dont want you to see him when they fetch him in savvy girl youll stay in your room till we call you an now rustle                                       lenore paced and crouched and lay in her room waiting listening with an intensity that hurt when a slow procession of men lowvoiced and softfooted carried kurt dorn into the house and upstairs lenore trembled with a storm of emotion all her former agitation love agony and suspense compared to what she felt then was as nothing not the joy of his being alive not the terror of his expected death had so charged her heart as did this awful curiosity to see him to realize him  at last a stepa knockher fathers voice lenorecome  her ordeal of waiting was over all else she could withstand that moment ended her weakness her blood leaped with the irresistable revivifying current of her spirit unlocking the door lenore stepped out her father stood there with traces of extreme worry fading from his tired face at sight of her they totally vanished  good youve got nerve you can see him now alone hes unconscious but hes not been greatly weakened by the trip his vitality is wonderful he comes to once in a while sometimes hes rational mostly though hes out of his head an his left arm is gone  anderson said all this rapidly and low while they walked down the hall toward the end room which had not been used since mrs andersons death the door was ajar lenore smelled strong pungent odors of antiseptics  anderson knocked softly  come out you men an let my girl see him he called  doctor lowell the village practitioner lenore had known for years tiptoed out important and excited  lenore its to bad he said kindly and he shook his head  another man glided out with the movements of a woman he was not young his aspect was pale serious  lenore this is mr jarvis the nurse nowgo in an dont forget what i said  she closed the door and leaned back against it conscious of the supreme moment of her life dorns face strange yet easily recognizable appeared against the white background of the bed that moment was supreme because it showed him there alive justifying the spiritual faith which had persisted in her soul if she had ever in moments of distraction doubted god she could never doubt again  the large room had been bright with white curtains softly blowing inward from the open windows as she crept forward not sure on her feet all seemed to blur so that when she leaned over the still face to kiss it she could not see clearly her lips quivered with that kiss and with her sob of thankfulness  my soldier  she prayed then with her head beside his on the pillow and through that prayer and the strange stillness of her lover she received a subtle shock sweet it was to touch him as she bent with eyes hidden terrible it would be to lookto see how the war had wrecked him she tried to linger there all tremulous all gratitude all woman and mother but an incalculable force lifted her up from her knees  ah she gasped as she saw him with cleared sight a knifeblade was at her heart kurt dorn lay before her gazea man and not the boy she had sacrificed to wara man by a larger frame and by older features and by a change difficult to grasp  these features seemed a mask transparent unable to hide a beautiful sad stern and ruthless face beneath which in turn slowly gave to her startled gaze sloping lines of pain and shades of gloom and the pale set muscles of forced manhood and the faint hectic flush of fever and disorder and derangement a livid angry scar smooth yet scarcely healed ran from his left temple back as far as she could see that established his identity as a wounded soldier brought home from the war otherwise to lenore his face might have been that of an immortal suddenly doomed with the curse of humanity dying in agony she had expected to see dorn bronzed haggard gaunt starved bearded and roughskinned bruised and battered blinded and mutilated with gray in his fair hair but she found none of these her throbbing heart sickened and froze at the nameless history recorded in his face was it beyond her to understand what had been his bitter experience would she never suffer his ordeal never that was certain an insupportable sadness pervaded her soul it was not his life she thought of but the youth the nobility the splendor of him that war had destroyed no intuition no divination no power so penetrating as a womans love by that piercing light she saw the transformed man he knew he had found out all of physical life his hate had gone with his blood deedsdeeds of terror had left their imprint upon his brow in the shadows under his eyes that resembled blank walls potent with invisible meaning lenore shuddered through all her soul as she read the merciless record of the murder he had dealt of the strong and passionate duty that had driven him of the eternal remorse but she did not see or feel that he had found god and stricken as he seemed she could not believe he was near to death  this last confounding thought held her transfixed and thrilling gazing down at dorn until her father entered to break the spell and lead her away     chapter xxx  it was night lenore should have been asleep but she sat up in the dark by the window underneath on the porch her father with his men as audience talked like a torrent and lenore hearing what otherwise would never have gotten to her ears found listening irresistible slow dragging footsteps and the clinking of spurs attested to the approach of cowboys  howdy boys sit down an be particlar quiet heres some smokes im wound up an gotta go off or bust anderson said well as i was sayin we folks dont know theres a war from all outward sign here in the northwest but in that new york town i just come fromgod almighty what goinson boys i never knew before how grand it was to be american new yorks got the people the money an its the outgoin an incomin place of all pertainin to this war the liberty loan drive was on the streets were crowded bands an parades grandopera stars singin on the corners famous actors sellin bonds flags an ribbons an banners everywhere an every third man you bumped into wearin some kind of uniform an the women were runnin wild like a stampede of twoyearolds i rode down fifth avenue on one of them hightopped buses with seats on talk about your old stagecoachwhy these buses had em beat a mile ive rode some in my day but this was the ride of my life i couldnt hear myself think music at full blast roar of traffic voices like whisperin without end flash of red an white an blue shine of a thousand automobiles down that wonderful street thats like a canon an up overhead a huge cigarshaped balloon an then an airplane sailin swift an buzzin like a bee them was the first airships i ever seen no wonderjim wanted to  andersons voice broke a little at this juncture and he paused all was still except the murmur of the running water and the song of the insects presently anderson cleared his throat and resumed      i saw five hundred australian soldiers just arrived in new york by     way of panama lean wiry boys like arizona cowboys looked good to     me you ought to have heard the cheerin roar an roar everywhere     they marched along i saw united states sailors marines soldiers     airmen english officers an scotch soldiers them last sure got my     eye funny plaid skirts they worean they had bare legs three i     saw walked lame an all had medals some one said the germans     called these scotch ladies from hell  when i heard that i had     to ask questions an i learned these queerlookin     halfwomendressed fellows were simply hell with cold steel an     after i heard that i looked again an wondered why i hadnt seen it     i ought to know men then i saw the outfit of blue devil     frenchmen that was sent over to help stimulate the liberty loan an     when i seen them i took off my hat ive knowed a heap of tough men     an bad men an handy men an fightin men in my day but i reckoned     i never seen the like of the blue devils i cant tell you why     boys blue devils is another german name for a regiment of french     soldiers they had it on the scotchmen any western man just to     look at them would think of wild bill an billy the kid an     geronimo an custer an see that mebbe the whole four mixed in one     might have made a blue devil      my young friend dorn thats dyin upstairs nowhe had a name     given him pears that this wartime is like the old days when we     used to hit on right pert names for everybody demon dorn they     called him an he got that handle before he ever reached france     the boys of his outfit gave it to him because of the way he run wild     with a bayonet i dont want my girl lenore ever to know that      a soldier named owens told me a lot he was the corporal of dorns     outfit a sort of foreman i reckon anyway he saw dorn every day     of the months they were in the service an the shell that done dorn     made a cripple of owens this fellow owens said dorn had not got so     close to his bunkmates until they reached france then he begun to     have influence over them owens didnt know how he did itin fact     never knew it at all until the outfit got to the front somewhere in     northern france in the first line they were days in the first     line close up to the germans watchin an sneakin all the time     shootin an dodgin but they never had but one real fight      that was when one mornin the germans came pilin over on a charge     far outnumberin our boys then it happened lord i wish i could     remember how owens told that scrap boys you never heard about a     real scrap it takes war like this to make men fighters listen     now an ill tell you some of the things that come off durin this     german charge ill tell them just as they come to mind there was a     boy named griggs who ran the german barragean thats a     gantletseven times to fetch ammunition to his pards another boy     on the same errand was twice blown off the road by explodin     shells an then went back owens told of two of his company who     rushed a bunch of germans killed eight of them an captured their     machinegun before that german charge a big shell came over an     kicked up a hill of mud next day the americans found their sentinel     buried in mud dead at his post with his bayonet presented      owens was shot just as he jumped up with his pards to meet the     chargin germans he fell an dragged himself against a wall of     bags where he lay watchin the fight an it so happened that he     faced dorns squad which was attacked by three times their number     he saw dorn shotgo down an thought he was donebut no dorn     came up with one side of his face all blood dixon a college     football man rushed a german who was about to throw a bomb dixon     got him an got the bomb too when it went off little rogers an     irish boy mixed it with three germans an killed one before he was     bayoneted in the back then dorn like the demon theyd named him     went on the stampede he had a different way with a bayonet so     owens claimed an dorn was heavy powerful an fast he lifted an     slung those two germans one after another quick as thatlike     youd toss a couple of wheat sheafs with your pitchfork an he sent     them rollin with blood squirtin all over an then four more     germans were shootin at him right into their teeth dorn     runlaughin wild an terrible owens said an the germans     couldnt stop that flashin bayonet dorn ripped them all open an     before theyd stopped floppin he was on the bunch thatd killed     brewer an were makin it hard for his other pards whewowens     told it all as if itd took lots of time but that fight was like     lightnin an i cant remember how it was only demon dorn laid out     nine germans before they retreated nine owens seen him do it     like a mad bull loose then the shell came over that put dorn out     an owens too      well dorn had a mangled arm an many wounds they amputated his     arm in france patched him up an sent him back to new york with a     lot of other wounded soldiers they expected him to die long ago     but he hangs on hes full of lead now what a hell of a lot of     killin some men take my boy jim would have been like that      so there boys you have a little bit of american fightin come     home to you straight an true i say thats what the germans have     roused well it was a bad day for them when they figgered     everythin on paper had it all cut an dried but failed to see the     spirit of men  lenore tore herself away from the window so that she could not hear any more and in the darkness of her room she began to pace to and fro beginning to undress for bed shaking in some kind of a frenzy scarcely knowing what she was about until sundry knocks from furniture and the falling over a chair awakened her to the fact that she was in a tumult  whatam idoing she panted in bewilderment reaching out in the dark to turn on the light  like awakening from a nightmare she saw the bright light flash up it changed her feeling who was this person whose image stood reflected in the mirror lenores recognition of herself almost stunned her what had happened she saw that her hair fell wildly over her bare shoulders her face shone white with red spots in her cheeks her eyes seemed balls of fire her lips had a passionate savage curl her breast bare and heaving showed a throbbing tumultuous heart and as she realized how she looked it struck her that she felt an inexplicable passion she felt intense as steel hot as fire quivering with the pulsation of rapid blood a victim to irrepressible thrills that rushed over her from the very soles of her feet to the roots of her hair something glorious terrible and furious possessed her when she understood what it was she turned out the light and fell upon the bed where as the storm slowly subsided she thought and wondered and sorrowed and whispered to herself  the tale of dorns tragedy had stirred to the depths the primitive hidden and unplumbed in the unknown nature of her just now she had looked at herself at her two selvesthe whiteskinned and fairhaired girl that civilization had producedand the blazing panting savage woman of the bygone ages she could not escape from either the story of demon dorns terrible fight had retrograded her for the moment to the female of the species more savage and dangerous than the male no use to lie she had gloried in his prowess he was her man gone out with club to beat down the brutes that would steal her from him  alas what are we what am i she whispered do i know myself what could i not have done a moment ago  she had that primitive thing in her and though she shuddered to realize it she had no regret life was life that dorn had laid low so many enemies was grand to her and righteous since these enemies were as cavemen come for prey even now the terrible thrills chased over her demon dorn what a man she had known just what he would doand how his spiritual life would go under the woman of her gloried in his fight and the soul of her sickened at its significance no hope for any man or any woman except in god  these men these boys like her father and jake like dorn and his comradeshow simple natural inevitable elemental they were they loved a fight they might hate it too but they loved it most life of men was all strife and the greatness in them came out in war war searched out the best and the worst in men what were wounds blood mangled flesh agony and death to mento those who went out for liberation of something unproven in themselves life was only a breath the secret must lie in the beyond for men could not act that way for nothing some hidden purpose through the ages                                       anderson had summoned a great physician a specialist of world renown lenore of course had not been present when the learned doctor examined kurt dorn but she was in her fathers study when the report was made to lenore this little man seemed all intellect all science all electric current  he stated that dorn had upward of twentyfive wounds some of them serious most trivial and all of them combined not necessarily fatal many soldiers with worse wounds had totally recovered dorns vitality and strength had been so remarkable that great loss of blood and almost complete lack of nourishment had not brought about the present grave condition  he will die and that is best for him said the specialist his case is not extraordinary i saw many like it in france during the first year of war when i was there but i will say that he must have been both physically and mentally above the average before he went to fight my examination extended through periods of his unconsciousness and aberration once for a little time he came to apparently sane the nurse said he had noticed several periods of this rationality during the last fortyeight hours but these and the prolonged vitality do not offer any hope  an emotion of exceeding intensity and duration has produced lesions in the kinetic organs some passion has immeasurably activated his brain destroying brain cells which might not be replaced if he happened to live he might be permanently impaired he might be neurasthenic melancholic insane at times or even grow permanently so it is very sad he appears to have been a fine young man but he will die and that really is best for him  thus the man of science summed up the biological case of kurt dorn when he had gone anderson wore the distressed look of one who must abandon his last hope he did not understand though he was forced to believe he swore characteristically at the luck and then at the great specialist  ive known indian medicinemen who could give that doctor cards an spades he exploded with gruff finality  lenore understood her father perfectly and imagined she understood the celebrated scientist the former was just human and the latter was simply knowledge neither had that which caused her to go out alone into the dark night and look up beyond the slowrising slope to the stars these men particularly the scientist lacked something he possessed all the wonderful knowledge of body and brain of the metabolism and chemistry of the organs but he knew nothing of the source of life lenore accorded science its place in progress but she hated its elimination of the soul stronger than ever strength to endure and to trust pervaded her spirit the dark night encompassing her the vast lonely heave of wheatslope the dim sky with its steady starsthese were voices as well as tangible things of the universe and she was in mysterious harmony with them lift thine eyes to the hills from whence cometh thy help                                       the day following the specialists visit dorn surprised the family doctor the nurse anderson and all except lenore by awakening to a spell of consciousness which seemed to lift for the time at least the shadow of death  kathleen was the first to burst in upon lenore with the wonderful news lenore could only gasp her intense eagerness and sit trembling hands over her heart while the child babbled  i listened and i peeped in was kathleens reiterated statement kurt was awake he spoke too but very soft say he knows hes at many waters i heard him say lenore oh im so happy lenorethat before he dies hell know youtalk to you  hush child whispered lenore kurts not going to die  but they all say so that funny little doctor yesterdayhe made me tiredbut he said so i heard him as dad put him into the car  yes kathie i heard him too but i do not believe replied lenore dreamily  kurt doesnt look soso sick went on kathleen onlyonly i dont know whatdifferent i guess im crazy to go into see him lenore will they ever let me  their fathers abrupt entrance interrupted the conversation he was pale forceful as when issues were at stake but were undecided  kathie go out he said  lenore rose to face him  my girldorns come toan hes asked for you i was for lettin him see you but lowell an jarvis say nonot yet now he might die any minute seems to me he ought to see you its right an if you say so  yes replied lenore  by heaven he shall see you then said anderson breathing hard im justified eveneven if it he did not finish his significant speech but left her abruptly  presently lenore was summoned when she left her room she was in the throes of uncontrolled agitation and all down the long hallway she fought herself at the halfopen door she paused to lean against the wall there she had the will to still her nerves to acquire serenity and she prayed for wisdom to make her presence and her words of infinite good to dorn in this crisis                                       she was not aware of when she movedhow she ever got to dorns bedside but seemingly detached from her real self serene with emotions locked she was there looking down upon him  lenore he said with faroff voice that just reached her gladness shone from his shadowy eyes  welcome homemy soldier boy she replied then she bent to kiss his cheek and to lay hers beside it  i neverhopedto see youagain he went on  oh but i knew murmured lenore lifting her head his right hand brown bare and rough lay outside the coverlet upon his breast it was weakly reaching for her lenore took it in both hers while she gazed steadily down into his eyes she seemed to see then how he was comparing the image he had limned upon his memory with her face  changedyoure oldermore beautifulyet the same he said it seemslong ago  yes long ago indeed i am older butalls well that ends well you are back  lenore havent youbeen toldi cant live  yes but its untrue she replied and felt that she might have been life itself speaking  dear somethings gonefrom me something vital gonewith the shell thattook my arm  no she smiled down upon him all the conviction of her soul and faith she projected into that single word and serene smileall that was love and woman in her opposing death a subtle indefinable change came over dorn  lenorei paidfor my father he whispered i killed huns i spilled theblood in mei hated but all was wrongwrong  yes but you could not help that she said piercingly blame can never rest upon you you were only anamerican soldier oh i know you were magnificent but your duty that way is done a higher duty awaits you  his eyes questioned sadly and wonderingly  you must be the great sower of wheat  sower of wheat he whispered and a light quickened in that questioning gaze  there will be starving millions after this war wheat is the staff of life you must get well listen  she hesitated and sank to her knees beside the bed kurt the day youre able to sit up ill marry you then ill take you hometo your wheathills  for a second lenore saw him transformed with her spirit her faith her love and it was that for which she had prayed she had carried him beyond the hopelessness beyond incredulity some guidance had divinely prompted her and when his mute rapture suddenly vanished when he lost consciousness and a pale gloom and shade fell upon his face she had no fear  in her own room she unleashed the strange bonds on her feelings and suffered their recurrent surge and strife until relief and calmness returned to her then came a flashing uplift of soul a great and beautiful exaltation lenore felt that she had been gifted with incalculable power she had pierced dorns fatalistic consciousness with the truth and glory of possible life as opposed to the dark and evil morbidity of war she saw for herself the wonderful and terrible stairs of sand which women had been climbing all the ages and must climb on to the heights of solid rock of equality of salvation for the human race she saw woman the primitive the female of the species but she saw her also as the mother of the species made to save as well as perpetuate learning from the agony of childbirth and childcare the meaning of him who said thou shalt not kill tremendous would be the final resistance of woman to the brutality of man women were to be the saviors of humanity it seemed so simple and natural that it could not be otherwise lenore realized with a singular conception of the splendor of its truth that when most women had found themselves their mission in life as she had found hers then would come an end to violence to greed to hate to war to the black and hideous imperfection of mankind  with all her intellect and passion lenore opposed the theory of the scientist and biologists if they proved that strife and fight were necessary to the development of man that without violence and bloodshed and endless contention the race would deteriorate then she would say that it would be better to deteriorate and to die women all would declare against that and in fact would never believe she would never believe with her heart but if her intellect was forced to recognize certain theories then she must find a way to reconcile life to the inscrutable designs of nature the theory that continual strife was the very life of plants birds beasts and men seemed verified by every reaction of the present but if these things were fixed materialistic rules of the existence of animated forms upon the earth what then was god what was the driving force in kurt dorn that made warduty some kind of murder which overthrew his mind what was the love in her heart of all living things and the nameless sublime faith in her soul  if we poor creatures must fight said lenore and she meant this for a prayer let the women fight eternally against violence and let the men forever fight their destructive instincts                                       from that hour the condition of kurt dorn changed for the better doctor lowell admitted that lenore had been the one medicine which might defeat the death that all except she had believed inevitable  lenore was permitted to see him a few minutes every day for which fleeting interval she must endure the endless hours but she discovered that only when he was rational and free from pain would they let her go in what dorns condition was all the rest of the time she could not guess but she began to get inklings that it was very bad  dad im going to insist on staying with kurt asas long as i want asserted lenore when she had made up her mind  this worried anderson and he appeared at a loss for words  i told kurt id marry him the very day he could sit up continued lenore  by george that accounts exclaimed her father hes been tryin to sit up an weve had hell with him  dad he will get well and all the sooner if i can be with him more he loves me i feel im the only thing that counteractsthethe madness in his mindthe death in his soul  anderson made one of his violent gestures i believe you that hits me with a bang it takes a woman lenore whats your idea  i want toto marry him murmured lenore to nurse himto take him home to his wheatfields  you shall have your way replied anderson beginning to pace the floor it cant do any harm it might save him an anyway youll be his wifeif only for  by george well do it you never gave me a wrong hunch in your life  but girl itll be hard for you to see him whenwhen he has the spells  spells echoed lenore  yes youve been told that he raves but you didnt know how why it gets even my nerve it fascinated me but once was enough i couldnt stand to see his face when his huns come back to him  his huns ejaculated lenore shuddering what do you mean  those huns he killed come back to him he fights them you see him go through strange motions an its as if his left arm wasnt gone he used his right arman the motions he makes are the ones he made when he killed the huns with his bayonet its terrible to watch himthe look on his face i heard at the hospital in new york that in france they photographed him when he had one of the spells id hate to have you see him then but maybe after doctor lowell explains it youll understand  poor boy how terrible for him to live it all over but when he gets wellwhen he has his wheathills and me to fill his mindthose spells will fade  maybemaybe i hope so lord knows its all beyond me but youre goin to have your way  doctor lowell explained to lenore that dorn like all mentally deranged soldiers dreamed when he was asleep and raved when he was out of his mind of only one thingthe foe in his nightmares dorn had to be held forcibly the doctor said that the remarkable and hopeful indication about dorns condition was a gradual daily gain in strength and a decline in the duration and violence of his bad spells  this assurance made lenore happy she began to relieve the wornout nurse during the day and she prepared herself for the first ordeal of actual experience of dorns peculiar madness but dorn watched her many hours and would not or could not sleep while she was there and the tenth day of his stay at many waters passed without her seeing what she dreaded meanwhile he grew perceptibly better  the afternoon came when anderson brought a minister then a few moments sufficed to make lenore dorns wife     chapter xxxi  the remarkable happened scarcely had the minister left when kurt dorns smiling wonder and happiness sustained a break as sharp and cold and terrible as if nature had transformed him from man to beast  his face became like that of a gorilla struggling up he swept his right arm over and outward with singular twisting energy a bayonetthrust and for him his left arm was still intact a savage unintelligible battlecry yet unmistakably german escaped his lips  lenore stood one instant petrified her father grinding his teeth attempted to lead her away but as dorn was about to pitch off the bed lenore with piercing cry ran to catch him and force him back there she held him subdued his struggles and kept calling with that intensity of power and spirit which must have penetrated even his delirium whatever influence she exerted it quieted him changed his savage face until he relaxed and lay back passive and pale it was possible to tell exactly when his reason returned for it showed in the gaze he fixed upon lenore  i hadoneof my fits he said huskily  ohi dont know what it was replied lenore with quavering voice her strength began to leave her now her arms that had held him so firmly began to slip away  son you had a bad spell interposed anderson with his heavy breathing first one shes seen  lenore i laid out my huns again said dorn with a tragic smile lately i could tell whenthey were coming back  did you know just now queried lenore  i think so i wasnt really out of my head ive known when i did that its a strange feelingthoughtmemory  and action drives it away then i seem always to want tokill my huns all over again  lenore gazed at him with mournful and passionate tenderness do you remember that we were just married she asked  my wife he whispered  husband i knew you were coming home to me i knew you would not die i know you will get well  i begin to feel that too thenmaybe the black spells will go away  they must oror youll lose me faltered lenore if you go on killing your huns over and overitll be i who will die  she carried with her to her room a haunting sense of dorns reception of her last speech some tremendous impression it made on him but whether of fear of domination or resolve or all combined she could not tell she had weakened in mention of the return of his phantoms but neither dorn nor her father ever guessed that once in her room she collapsed from sheer feminine horror at the prospect of seeing dorn change from a man to a gorilla and to repeat the savage orgy of remurdering his huns that was too much for lenore she who had been invincible in faith who could stand any tests of endurance and pain was not proof against a spectacle of dorns strange counterfeit presentment of the actual and terrible killing he had performed with a bayonet  for days after that she was under a strain which she realized would break her if it was not relieved it appeared to be solely her fear of dorns derangement she was with him almost all the daylight hours attending him watching him sleep talking a little to him now and then seeing with joy his gradual improvement feeling each day the slow lifting of the shadow over him and yet every minute of every hour she waited in dread for the return of dorns madness it did not come if it recurred at night she never was told then after a week a more pronounced change for the better in dorns condition marked a lessening of the strain upon lenore a little later it was deemed safe to dismiss the nurse lenore dreaded the first night vigil she lay upon a couch in dorns room and never closed her eyes but he slept and his slumber appeared sound at times and then restless given over to dreams he talked incoherently and moaned and once appeared to be drifting into a nightmare when lenore awakened him next day he sat up and said he was hungry thereafter lenore began to lose her dread                                       well son lets talk wheat said anderson cheerily one beautiful june morning as he entered dorns room  wheat sighed dorn with a pathetic glance at his empty sleeve how can i even do a mans work again in the fields  lenore smiled bravely at him you will sow more wheat than ever and harvest more too  i should smile corroborated anderson  but how ive only one arm said dorn  kurt you hug me better with that one arm than you ever did with two arms replied lenore in sublime assurance  son you lose that argument roared anderson me an lenore stand pat youll sow more an better wheat than everthan any other man in the northwest get my hunch well ill tell you later now see here let me declare myself about you i seen it worries you more an more now youre gettin well you miss that good arm an you feel the pain of bullets that still lodge somewheres in you an you think youll be a cripple always look things in the face square sure compared to what you once was youll be a cripple but kurt dorn weighin one hundred an ninety let loose on a bunch of huns was some man my gawd forget that an forget that youll never chop a cord of wood again in a day look at facts like me an lenore we gave you up an here youre with us comin along fine an youll be able to do hard work some day if youre crazy about it just think how good that is for lenore an me too now listen to this anderson unfolded a newspaper and began to read      continued improvement with favorable weather conditions in the     winterwheat states and encouraging messages from the northwest     warrant an increase of crop estimates made two weeks ago and based     mainly upon the governments report in all probability the yield     from winter fields will slightly exceed 600000000 bushels     increase of acreage in the spring states in unexpectedly large for     example minnesotas food administrator says the addition in his     state is 40 per cent instead of the early estimate of 20 per cent     throughout the spring area the plants have a good start and are in     excellent condition it may be that the yield will rise to     300000000 bushels making a total of about 900000000 from such     a crop 280000000 could be exported in normal times and by     conservation the surplus can easily be enlarged to 350000000 or     even 400000000 in canada also estimates of acreage increase have     been too low it was said that the addition in alberta was 20 per     cent but recent reports make it 40 per cent canada may harvest a     crop of 300000000 bushels or nearly 70000000 more than last     years our allies in europe can safely rely upon the shipment of     500000000 bushels from the united states and canada      after the coming harvest there will be an ample supply of wheat for     the foes of germany at ports which can easily be reached in     addition the large surplus stocks in australia and argentina will     be available when ships can be spared for such service and the     ships are coming from the builders for more than a year to come     there will be wheat enough for our war partners the belgians and     the northern european neutral countries with which we have trade     agreements  lenore eagerly watched her husbands face in pleasurable anticipation yet with some anxiety wheat had been a subject little touched upon and the war had never been mentioned  great he exclaimed with a glow in his cheeks ive been wanting to ask wheat for the allies and neutralsfor more than a year anderson the united states will feed and save the world  i reckon son were sendin thousands of soldiers a day nowships are buildin fastaeroplanes comin like a swarm of beesmoney for the government to burnan every american gettin mad dorn the germans dont know theyre ruined what do you say  dorn looked very strange lenore help me stand up he asked with strong tremor in his voice  oh kurt youre not able yet appealed lenore  help me i want you to do it  lenore complied wondering and frightened yet fascinated too she helped him off the bed and steadied him on his feet then she felt him release himself so he stood free  what do i say anderson i say this i killed germans who had grown up with a training and a passion for war ive been a farmer i did not want to fight duty and hate forced me the germans i met fell before me i was shellshot shocked gassed and bayoneted i took twentyfive wounds and then it was a shell that downed me i saw my comrades kill and kill before they fell that is american our enemies are driven blinded stolid brutal obsessed and desperate they are german they lacknot strength nor efficiency nor couragebut soul  white and spent dorn then leaned upon lenore and got back upon his bed his passion had thrilled her anderson responded with an excitement he plainly endeavored to conceal  i get your hunch he said if i needed any assurance youve given it to me to hell with the germans lets dont talk about them any more an to come back to our job wheat son ive plans that ll raise your hair well harvest a bumper crop at many waters in july an well sow two thousand acres of winter wheat so much for many watersi got mad this summer i blowed myself i bought about all the farms around yours up in the bend country big harvest of spring wheat comin youll superintend that harvest an ill look after ours here an youll sow ten thousand acres of fallow on your own rich hillsthis fall do you get that ten thousand acres  anderson gasped dorn  yes anderson mimicked the rancher my bloods up but id never have felt so good about it if you hadnt come back the lands not all paid for but its ours well meet our notes ive been up there twice this spring youd never know a few hills had burned over last harvest olsen an your other neighbors or most of them will work the land on halfshares youll be boss an sure youll be well for fall sowin thatll make you the biggest sower of wheat in the northwest  my sower of wheat murmured lenore seeing his rapt face through tears  dreams are coming true he said softly lenore just after i saw you the second timeand fell so in love with youi had vain dreams of you but even my wildest never pictured you as the wife of a wheat farmer i never dreamed you loved wheat  but ah i do replied lenore why when i was born dad bought many waters and sowed the slopes in wheat i remember how he used to take me up to the fields all green or golden ive grown up with wheat id never want to live anywhere away from it oh you must listen to me some day while i tell you what i knowabout the history and romance of wheat  begin said dorn with a light of pride and love and wonder in his gaze  leave that for some other time interposed anderson son would it surprise you if id tell you that ive switched a little in my ideas about the iww  no replied dorn  well things happen what made me think hard was the way that government man got results from the iww in the lumber country you see the government had to have an immense amount of timber for ships an spruce for aeroplanes had to have it quick an all the lumbermen an loggers were iwwor most of them anyhow all the strikin lumbermen last summer belonged to the iww these fellows believed that under the capitalistic order of labor the workers an their employers had nothin in common an the government was hand an glove with capital now this government official went up there an convinced the iww that the best interest of the two were identical an he got the work out of them an the government got the lumber he dealt with them fairly those who were on the level he paid high an considered their wants those who were crooked he punished accordin to their offense an the innocent didnt have to suffer with the guilty  that deal showed me how many of the iww could be handled an weve got to reckon with the iww most all the farmhands in the country belong to it this summer ill give the square harvesters what they want an thats a big comedown for me but i wont stand any monkeybizness from soreheaded disorganizers if men want to work they shall have work at big pay you will follow out this plan up in the bend country well meet this labor union halfway after the war there may come trouble between labor an capital it begins to seem plain to me that men who work hard ought to share somethin of the profits if that doesnt settle the trouble then well know were up against an outfit with socialist an anarchist leaders time enough then to resort to measures i regret we practised last summer  anderson youre fineyoure as big as the hills burst out dorn but you know there was bad blood here last summer did you ever get proof that german money backed the iww to strike and embarrass our government  no but i believe so or else the iww leaders took advantage of a critical time im bound to say that now thousands of iww laborers are loyal to the united states and that made me switch  ill deal with them the same way responded dorn with fervor  then lenore interrupted their discussion and pleading that dorn was quite worn out from excitement and exertion she got her father to leave the room                                       the following several days lenore devoted to the happy and busy task of packing what she wanted to take to dorns home she had set the date but had reserved the pleasure of telling him anderson had agreed to her plan and decided to accompany them  ill take the girls he said itll be a fine ride for them well stay in the village overnight an come back home next day lenore it strikes me suddenlike your leavin what will become of me  all at once he showed the ravages of pain and loss that the last year had added to his life of struggle lenore embraced him and felt her heart full  dad im not leaving you she protested hell get well up therefind his balance sooner among those desert wheathills we will divide our time between the two places remember you can run up there any day your interests are there now dad dont think of it as separation kurt has come into our familyand were just going to be away some of the time  thus she won back a smile to the worn face  weve all got a weak spot he said musingly mine is herean its a fear of growin old an bein left alone thats selfish but ive lived an i reckon ive no more to ask for  lenore could not help being sad in the midst of her increasing happiness joy to some brought to others only gloom life was sunshine and stormyouth and age  this morning she found kathleen entertaining dorn this was the second time the child had been permitted to see him and the immense novelty had not yet worn off kathleen was a heroworshiper if she had been devoted to dorn before his absence she now manifested symptoms of complete idolatry lenore had forbidden her to question dorn about anything in regard to the war kathleen never broke her promises but it was plain that dorn had read the mute anguished wonder and flame in her eyes when they rested upon his empty sleeve and evidently had told her things kathleen was white wideeyed and beautiful then with all a childs imagination stirred  ive been telling kathie how i lost my arm explained dorn  i hate germans i hate war cried kathleen passionately  my dear hate them always said dorn  when kathleen had gone lenore asked dorn if he thought it was right to tell the child always to hate germans  right exclaimed dorn with a queer laugh every day now he showed signs of stronger personality lenore what i went through has confused my sense of right and wrong some day perhaps it will all come clear but lenore all my life if i live to be ninety i shall hate germans  oh kurt its too soon for you toto be less narrow less passionate replied lenore with hesitation i understand the day will come when youll not condemn a people because of a form of governmentof military class  it will never come asserted dorn positively lenore people in our country do not understand they are too far away from realities but i was six months in france ive seen the ruined villages thousands of refugeesand ive met the huns at the front i know ive seen the realities in regard to this war i can only feel youve got to go over there and see for yourself before you realize you can understand thisthat but for you and your power over me id be a wornout emotionally burnt out man but through you i seem to be reborn still i shall hate germans all my life and in the afterlife what ever that may be i could give you a thousand reasons one ought to suffice youve read of course about the regiment of frenchmen called blue devils i met some of themgot friendly with them they are greatbeyond words to tell one of them told me that when his regiment drove the huns out of his own village he had found his mother disemboweled his wife violated and murdered his sister left a maimed thing to become the mother of a hun his daughter carried off and his little son crippled for life  these are cold facts as long as i live i will never forget the face of that frenchman when he told me had he cause to hate the huns have i i saw all that in the faces of those huns who would have killed me if they could  lenore covered her face with her hands ohhorrible  is there nothingno hopeonly she faltered and broke down  lenore because theres hate does not prove theres nothing left listen the last fight i had was with a boy i didnt know it when we met i was rushing head down bayonet low i saw only his body his blade that clashed with mine to me his weapon felt like a toy in the hands of a child i swept it asideand lunged he screamed kamarad before the blade reached him too late i ran him through then i looked a boy of nineteen he never ought to have been forced to meet me it was murder i saw him die on my bayonet i saw him slide off it and stretch out i did not hate him then id have given my life for his i hated what he represented that moment was the end of me as a soldier if i had not been in range of the exploding shell that downed me i would have dropped my rifle and have stood strengthless before the next hun so you see though i killed them and though i hate now theres somethingsomething strange and inexplicable  that something is the divine in you it is god oh believe it my husband cried lenore  dorn somberly shook his head god i did not find god out there i cannot see gods hand in this infernal war  but i can what called you so resistlessly what made you go  you know the debt i thought i ought to pay and duty to my country  then when the debt was paid the duty fulfilledwhen you stood stricken at sight of that poor boy dying on your bayonetwhat happened in your soul  i dont know but i saw the wrong of war the wrong to himthe wrong to me i thought of no one else certainly not of god  if you had stayed your bayonetif you had spared that boy as you would have done had you seen or heard him in timewhat would that have been  pity maybe or scorn to slay a weaker foe  no no noi cant accept that replied lenore passionately can you see beyond the physical  i see only that men will fight and that war will come again out there i learned the nature of men  if theres divinity in you theres divinity in every man that will oppose warend it eventually men are not taught right education and religion will bring peace on earth goodwill to man  no they will not they never have done so we have educated men and religious men yet war comes despite them the truth is that life is a fight civilization is only skindeep underneath man is still a savage he is a savage still because he wants the same he had to have when he lived in primitive state war isnt necessary to show how every man fights for food clothing shelter today its called competition in business look at your father he has fought and beaten men like neuman look at the wheat farmers in my country look at the iww they all fight look at the children they fight even at their games their play is a makebelieve battle or escaping or funeral or capture it must be then that some kind of strife was implanted in the first humans and that it is necessary to life  survival of the fittest exclaimed lenore in earnest bitterness kurt we have changed you are facing realities and i am facing the infinite you represent the physical and i the spiritual we must grow into harmony with each other we cant ever hope to learn the unattainable truth of life there is something beyond ussomething infinite which i believe is god my soul finds it in you the first effects of the war upon you have been trouble sacrifice pain and horror you have come out of it impaired physically and with mind still clouded these will pass and therefore i beg of you dont grow fixed in absolute acceptance of the facts of evolution and materialism they cannot be denied i grant i see that they are realities but also i see beyond them there is some great purpose running through the ages in our day the germans have risen and in the eyes of most of the world their brutal force tends to halt civilization and kill idealism but thats only apparentonly temporary we shall come out of this dark time better finer wiser the history of the world is a proof of a slow growth and perfection it will never be attained but is not the growth a beautiful and divine thing does it now oppose a hopeless prospect life is inscrutable when i thinkonly think without faithall seems so futile the poet says we are here as on a darkling plain swept by confused alarms of struggle and flight where ignorant armies clash by night trust me my husband there is something in womanthe instinct of creationthe motherthat feels what cannot be expressed it is the hope of the world  the mother burst out dorn i think of thatin you suppose i have a son and war comes in his day suppose he is killed as i killed that poor boy how then could i reconcile that with this this something you feel so beautifully this strange sense of god this faith in a great purpose of the ages  lenore trembled in the exquisite pain of the faith which she prayed was beginning to illumine dorns dark and tragic soul  if we are blessed with a sonand if he must go to warto kill and be killedyou will reconcile that with god because our son shall have been taught what you should have been taughtwhat must be taught to all the sons of the future  what willthat be queried dorn  the meaning of lifethe truth of immortality replied lenore we live onwe improve that is enough for faith  how will that prevent war  it will prevent itin the years to come mothers will take good care that children from babyhood shall learn the consequences of fightof war boys will learn that if the meaning of war to them is the wonder of charge and thunder of cannon and medals of distinction to their mothers the meaning is loss and agony they will learn the terrible difference between your fury and eagerness to lunge with bayonet and your horror of achievement when the disemboweled victims lie before you the glory of a statue to the great general means countless and nameless graves of forgotten soldiers the joy of the conquering army contrasts terribly with the pain and poverty and unquenchable hate of the conquered  i see what you mean rejoined dorn such teaching of children would change the men of the future it would mean peace for the generations to come but as for my boyit would make him a poor soldier he would not be a fighter he would fall easy victim to the son of the father who had not taught this beautiful meaning of life and terror of war id want my son to be a man  that teachingwould make himall the more a man said lenore beginning to feel faint  but not in the sense of muscle strength courage endurance id rather there never was peace than have my son inferior to another mans  my hope for the future is that all men will come to teach their sons the wrong of violence  lenore never will that day come replied dorn  she saw in him the inevitableness of the masculine attitude the difference between man and woman the preponderance of blood and energy over the higher motives she felt a weak little woman arrayed against the whole of mankind but she could not despair unquenchable as the sun was this fire within her  but it might come she insisted gently but with inflexible spirit  yes it mightif men change  you have changed  yes i dont know myself  if we do have a boy will you let me teach him what i think is right lenore went on softly  lenore as if i would not he exclaimed i try to see your way but just because i cant ill never oppose you teach me if you can  she kissed him and knelt beside his bed grieved to see shadow return to his face yet thrilling that the way seemed open for her to inspire but she must never again choose to talk of war of materialism of anything calculated to make him look into darkness of his soul to ponder over the impairment of his mind she remembered the great specialist speaking of lesions of the organic system of a loss of brain cells her inspiration must be love charm carea healing and building process she would give herself in all the unutterableness and immeasurableness of her womans heart she would order her life so that it would be a fulfilment of his education of a heritage from his fathers a passion born in him a noble work through which surely he could be savedthe cultivation of wheat  do you love me she whispered  do i nothing could ever change my love for you  i am your wife you know  the shadow left his face  are you really lenore anderson  lenore dorn it is a beautiful name now  it does sound sweet but youmy wife never will i believe  you will have tovery soon  why a light warm and glad and marveling shone in his eyes indeed lenore felt then a break in the strange aloofness of himin his impersonal gentle acceptance of her relation to him  tomorrow im going to take you home to your wheathills     chapter xxxii  lenore told her conception of the history and the romance of wheat to dorn at this critical time when it was necessary to give a trenchant call to hope and future  in the beginning mans struggle was for life and the mainstay of life was food perhaps the original discoverer of wheat was a meateating savage who in roaming the forests and fields forced by starvation to eat bark and plant and berry came upon a stalk of grain that chewed with strange satisfaction perhaps through that accident he became a sower of wheat  who actually were the first sowers of wheat would never be known they were older than any history and must have been among the earliest of the human race  the development of grain produced wheat and wheat was ground into flour and flour was baked into bread and bread had for untold centuries been the sustenance and the staff of life  centuries ago an old chaldean priest tried to ascertain if wheat had ever grown wild that question never was settled it was universally believed however that wheat had to have the cultivation of man nevertheless the origin of the plant must have been analogous to that of other plants wheatgrowers must necessarily have been people who stayed long in one place wandering tribes could not till and sow the fields the origin of wheat furnished a legendary theme for many races and mythology contained tales of wheatgods favoring chosen peoples ancient china raised wheat twentyseven centuries before christ grains of wheat had been found in prehistoric ruins the dwellers along the nile were not blind to the fertility of the valley in the days of the pharaohs the old river annually inundated its low banks enriching the soil of vast areas where soon a greenandgold ocean of wheat waved and shone under the hot egyptian sun the arabs on their weird beasts of burden rode from the desert wastes down to the land of waters and of plenty rebekah when she came to fill her earthen pitcher at the palmshaded well looked out with dusky dreamy eyes across the golden grain toward the mysterious east moses when he stood in the night watching his flock on the starlit arabian waste felt borne to him on the desert wind a scent of wheat the bible said he maketh peace in thy borders and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat  blackbread days of the middle ages when crude grinding made impure flour were the days of the oppressed peasant and the rich landowner dark days of toil and poverty and war of blight and drought and famine when common man in his wretchedness and hunger cried out bread or blood  but with the spreading of wheat came the dawn of a higher civilization and the story of wheat down to modern times showed the development of man wheatfields of many lands surrounding homes of prosperous farmers fruitful toil of happy peoples the miller and his humming mill  when wheat crossed the ocean to america it came to strange and wonderful fulfilment of its destiny america fresh vast and free with its sturdy pioneers ever spreading the golden grain westward with the advancing years when railroad lines kept pace with the indomitable wheatsowers with unprecedented harvests yielding records to each succeeding year with boundless fields tilled and planted and harvested by machines that were mechanical wonders with enormous floormills humming and whirring each grinding daily ten thousand barrels of flour pouring like a white stream from the steel rolls pure clean and sweet the whitest and finest in the world  america the new county became in 1918 the salvation of starving belgium the mainstay of england the hope of france wheat for the world wheatthat was to say food strength fighting life for the armies opposed to the black hideous medieval horde of huns america to succor and to save to sacrifice and to sow rising out of its peaceful slumber to a mighty wrath magnificent and unquenchable throwing its vast resources of soil its endless streams of wheat into the gulf of war it was an exalted destiny for a people its truth was a blazing affront in the face of ageold autocracy fields and toil and grains of wheat first and last the salvation of mankind the freedom and the food of the world                                       far up the slowrising bulge of valley slope above the gleaming river two cars climbed leisurely and rolled on over the height into what seemed a bare and lonely land of green  it was a day in june filled with a rich thick amber light with a fragrant warm wind blowing out of the west  at a certain point on this road where anderson always felt compelled to halt he stopped the car this day and awaited the other that contained lenore and dorn  lenores joy in the ride was reflected in her face dorn rested comfortably beside her upon an improvised couch as he lay half propped up by pillows he could see out across the treeless land that he knew his eyes held a look of the returned soldier who had never expected to see his native land again lenore sensitive to every phase of his feeling watched him with her heart mounting high  anderson got out of his car followed by kathleen who looked glad and mischievous and pretty as a wild rose  i just never can get by this place explained the rancher as he came and stood so that he could put a hand on dorns knee look sonan lenore dont you miss this  never fear dad replied lenore it was i who first told you to look here  terrible big and bare but grand exclaimed kathleen  lenore looked first at dorns face as he gazed away across the length and breadth of land could that land mean as much to him as it did before he went to war infinitely more she saw and rejoiced her faith was coming home to her in verities then she thrilled at the wide prospect before her  it was a scene that she knew could not be duplicated in the world low slowsloping billowy green hills bare and smooth with square brown patches stretched away to what seemed infinite distance valleys and hills with less fallow ground than ever before significant and striking lost the meager details of clumps of trees and dots of houses in a green immensity a million shadows out of the west came waving over the wheat they were ripples of an ocean of grain no dustclouds no bleached roads no yellow hills today june and the desert found its analogy only in the sweep and reach a thousand hills billowing away toward that blue haze of mountain range where rolled the oregon acreage and mileage seemed insignificant all was greengreen the fresh and hopeful color strangely serene and sweet and endless under the azure sky beautiful and lonely hills they were eloquent of toil expressive with the brown squares in the green the lowly homes of men the long lines of roads running everywhither overwhelmingly pregnant with meaningwheatwheatwheatnothing but wheat a staggering visual manifestation of vital need of noble promise  thatthat rolled out anderson waving his big hand as if words were useless only a corner of the great old us what would the germans say if they could look out over this what do you say lenore  beautiful she replied softly like the rainbow in the skygods promise of life  an kathie what do you say went on anderson  some wheatfields replied kathleen with an air of womans wisdom fetch on your young wheatsowers dad and ill pick out a husband  an you son finished anderson as if wistfully yet heartily playing his last card he was remembering jimthe wild but beloved sonthe dead soldier he was fearful for the crowning hope of his years  as ye sowso shall ye reap was dorns reply strong and thrilling and lenore felt her fathers strange heartsatisfying content                                       twilight crept down around the old home on the hill  dorn was alone leaning at the window he had just strength to lean there with uplifted head lenore had left him alone divining his wish as she left him there came a sudden familiar happening in his brain like a snapback and the contending tide of gray formsthe hunsrushed upon him he leaned there at the window but just the same he awaited the shock on the ramparts of the trench a ferocious and terrible storm of brain that used to have its reaction in outward violence now worked inside him like a hot wind that drove his blood during the spell he fought out his great fightagain for the thousandth time he rekilled his foes that storm passed through him without an outward quiver  his hunscharged againbayoneted againand he felt acute pain in the left arm that was gone he felt the closing of the hand which was not there his huns lay in the shadow stark and shapeless with white faces upwarda line of dead foes remorseless and abhorrent to him forever damned by his ruthless spirit he saw the boy slide off his bayonet beyond recall murdered by some evil of which dorn had been the motion then the prone gray forms vanished in the black gulf of dorns brain  lenore will never knowhow my huns come back to me he whispered  night with its trains of stars softly the darkness unfolded down over the dim hills lonely tranquil sweet a nightbird caroled the song of insects very faint and low came to him like a still sad music of humanity from over the hills far away in the striferidden world the world of men was there and life was incessant monstrous and inconceivable this old home of histhe old house seemed full of wellremembered sounds of mouse and cricket and leaf against the roof and soft night wind at the eavessounds that brought his boyhood back his bare feet on the stairs his fathers aloofness his mothers love                                       then clearly floated to him a slow sweeping rustle of the wheat breasthigh it stood down there outside his window a moving body higher than the gloom that rustle was a voice of childhood youth and manhood whispering to him thrilling as never before it was a growing rustle different from that when the wheat had matured it seemed to change and grow in volume in meaning the night wind bore it but lifebursting life was behind it and behind that seemed to come a driving and a mighty spirit beyond the growth of the wheat beyond its life and perennial gift was something measureless and obscure infinite and universal suddenly dorn saw that something as the breath and the blood and the spirit of wheatand of man dust and to dust returned they might be but this physical form was only the fleeting inscrutable moment on earth springing up giving birth to seed dying out for that everincreasing purpose which ran through the ages  a soft footfall sounded on the stairs lenore came she leaned over him and the starlight fell upon her face sweet luminous beautiful in the sense of her compelling presence in the tender touch of her hands in the whisper of womans love dorn felt uplifted high above the dark pale of the present with its war and pain and clouded mind to wheatto the fertile fields of a golden age to come
