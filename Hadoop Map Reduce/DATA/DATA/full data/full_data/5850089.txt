5850089	proserpine    midas  two unpublished mythological dramas  by  mary shelley  edited with introduction  by  a koszul     prefatory note   the editor came across the unpublished texts included in this volume as early as 1905 perhaps he ought to apologize for delaying their appearance in print the fact is he has long been afraid of overrating their intrinsic value but as the great shelley centenary year has come perhaps this little monument of his wifes collaboration may take its modest place among the tributes which will be paid to his memory for mary shelleys mythological dramas can at least claim to be the proper setting for some of the most beautiful lyrics of the poet which so far have been read in undue isolation and even as a literary sign of those times as an example of that classical renaissance which the romantic period fostered they may not be altogether negligible  these biographical and literary points have been dealt with in an introduction for which the kindest help was long ago received from the late dr garnett and the late lord abinger sir walter raleigh was also among the first to give both encouragement and guidance my friends m emile pons and mr roger ingpen have read the book in manuscript the authorities of the bodleian library and of the clarendon press have been as generously helpful as is their wellknown wont to all the editor wishes to record his acknowledgements and thanks  strasbourg     introduction     i   the compositions published in mrs shelleys lifetime afford but an inadequate conception of the intense sensibility and mental vigour of this extraordinary woman  thus wrote dr garnett in 1862 preface to his relics of shelley the words of praise may have sounded unexpectedly warm at that date perhaps the present volume will make the reader more willing to subscribe or less inclined to demur  mary godwin in her younger days certainly possessed a fair share of that nimbleness of invention which generally characterizes women of letters her favourite pastime as a child she herself testifies footnote preface to the 1831 edition of frankenstein had been to write stories and a dearer pleasure had beento use her own characteristic abstract and elongated way of putting itthe following up trains of thought which had for their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents all readers of shelleys life remember how later on as a girl of nineteenand a two years wifeshe was present a devout but nearly silent listener at the long symposia held by her husband and byron in switzerland june 1816 and how the pondering over german horrors and a common resolve to perpetrate ghost stories of their own led her to imagine that most unwomanly of all feminine romances frankenstein the paradoxical effort was paradoxically successful and as publishers lists aver to this day frankensteins monster has turned out to be the hardestlived specimen of the rawheadandbloodybones school of romantic tales so much no doubt to the credit of mary shelley but more creditable surely is the fact that she was not tempted as monk lewis had been to persevere in those lugubrious themes  although her publisherset pour causeinsisted on styling her the author of frankenstein an entirely different vein appears in her later productions indeed a quiet reserve of tone a slow sober and sedate bearing are henceforth characteristic of all her literary attitudes it is almost a case of running from one to the other extreme the force of style which even adverse critics acknowledged in frankenstein was sometimes perilously akin to the most disputable kinds of romantic rant but in the historical or society novels which followed in the contributions which graced the keepsakes of the thirties and evenalasin the various prefaces and commentaries which accompanied the publication of so many poems of shelley his wife succumbed to an increasing habit of almost victorian reticence and dignity and those later novels and tales though they sold well in their days and were kindly reviewed can hardly boast of any reputation now most of them are pervaded by a brooding spirit of melancholy of the moping rather than the musical sort and consequently rather ineffective as an artistic motive students of shelley occasionally scan those pages with a view to pick some obscure hints and indirections some veiled reminiscences in the stories of the adventures and misfortunes of the last man or lodore and the books may be good biography at timesthey are never life  altogether there is a curious contrast between the two aspects hitherto revealed of mary shelleys literary activities it is as if the pulse which had been beating so wildly so frantically in frankenstein 1818 had lapsed with valperga 1823 and the rest into an increasingly sluggish flow  the following pages may be held to bridge the gap between those two extremes in a felicitous way a more purely artistic mood instinct with the serene joy and clear warmth of italian skies combining a good deal of youthful buoyancy with a sort of quiet and unpretending philosophy is here represented and it is submitted that the little classical fancies which mrs shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works  for one thing they give us the longest poetical effort of the writer the moon of epipsychidion never seems to have been thrilled with the music of the highest spheres yet there were times when shelleys inspiration and example fired her into something more than her usual calm and cold brilliancy  one of those periodsperhaps the happiest period in marys lifewas during the early months in italy of the english exiles she never was more strongly impelled to write than at this time she felt her powers fresh and strong within her all she wanted was some motive some suggestion to guide her in the choice of a subject footnote mrs marshall the life and letters of mary w shelley i 216  shelley then expected her to try her hand at a drama perhaps on the terrible story of the cenci or again on the catastrophes of charles the first her frankenstein was attracting more attention than had ever been granted to his own works and shelley with that touching simplicity which characterized his loving moments showed the greatest confidence in the literary career of his wife he helped her and encouraged her in every way he then translated for her platos symposium he led her on in her latin and italian studies he wanted herprobably as a sort of preliminary exercise before her flight into tragedyto translate alfieris myrrha remember charles the first and do you be prepared to bring at least some of myrrha translated he wrote remember remember charles the first and myrrha he insisted and he quoted for her benefit the presumptuous aphorism of godwin in st leon there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute footnote letter from padua 22 september 1818  but in the year that followed these auspicious days the strain and stress of her life proved more powerful on mary shelley than the inspiration of literature the loss of her little girl clara at venice on the 24th of september 1818 was cruel enough however she tried hard not to show the pusillanimous disposition which godwin assured his daughter characterizes the persons that sink long under a calamity of this nature footnote 27 october 1818 but the death of her boy william at rome on the 4th of june 1819 reduced her to a kind of despair whatever it could be to her husband italy no longer was for her a paradise of exiles the flush and excitement of the early months the first fine careless rapture were for ever gone i shall never recover that blow mary wrote on the 27th of june 1819 the thought never leaves me for a single moment everything on earth has lost its interest for me this time her imperturbable father philosophized in vain with a more sympathetic and acuter intelligence of her case leigh hunt insisted july 1819 that she should try and give her paralysing sorrow some literary expression strike her pen into some genial subject and bring up a fountain of gentle tears for us but the poor childless mother could only rehearse her complaintto have won and thus cruelly to have lost 4 august 1819 in fact she had on williams death discontinued her diary  yet on the date just mentioned as shelley reached his twentyseven years she plucked up courage and resumed the task shelley however absorbed by the creative ardour of his annus mirabilis could not but observe that his wifes spirits continued wretchedly depressed 5 august 1819 and though masculine enough to resent the fact at times more than pity it he was human enough to persevere in that habit of cooperative reading and writing which is one of the finest traits of his married life i write in the morning his wife testifies read latin till 2 when we dine then i read some english book and two cantos of dante with shelley footnote letter to mrs hunt 28 august 1819a fair average no doubt of the homely aspect of the great days which produced the cenci and prometheus  on the 12th november in florence the birth of a second son percy florence shelley helped mary out of her sense of bereavement subsequent letters still occasionally admit low spirits but the entries in the journal make it clear that the year 181920 was one of the most pleasantly industrious of her life not dante only but a motley series of books great and small ancient and modern english and foreign bespoke her attention not content with latin and the extemporized translations which shelley could give her of platos republic she started greek in 1820 and soon came to delight in it and again she thought of original composition write workthe words now occur daily in her journal these must mainly refer to the long historical novel which she had planned as early as 1819 footnote she had thought of it at marlow as appears from her letter to mrs gisborne 30 june 1821 in mrs marshall i p 291 but the materials for it were not found before the stay at naples and it was not actually begun till a year afterwards at pisa ibid under the title of castruccio prince of lucca and which was not published until 1823 as valperga it was indeed a laborious task the novel illustrative of the manners of the middle ages in italy had to be raked out of fifty old books as shelley said footnote letter to t l peacock november 1820  but heavy as the undertaking must have been it certainly did not engross all the activities of shelleys wife in this period and it seems highly probable that the two little mythological dramas which we here publish belong to this same year 1820  the evidence for this date is as follows shelleys lyrics which these dramas include were published by his wife posthumous poems 1824 among the poems written in 1820 another composition in blank verse curiously similar to marys own work entitled orpheus has been allotted by dr garnett relics of shelley 1862 to the same category footnote dr garnett in his prefatory note states that orpheus exists only in a transcript by mrs shelley who has written in playful allusion to her toils as amanuensis aspetto fin che il diluvio cala ed allora cerco di posare argine alle sue parole the poem is thus supposed to have been shelleys attempt at improvisation if not indeed a translation from the italian of the improvvisatore sgricci the shelleys do not seem to have come to know and hear sgricci before the end of december 1820 the italian note after all has no very clear import and dr garnett in 1905 inclined to the view that orpheus was the work not of shelley but of his wife a comparison of that fragment and the dramas here published seems to me to suggest the same conclusion though in both cases mary shelley must have been helped by her husband again it may well be more than a coincidence that the proserpine motive occurs in that passage from dantes purgatorio canto 28 on matilda gathering flowers which shelley is known to have translated shortly before medwins visit in the late autumn of 1820            o come that i may hear   thy song like proserpine in ennas glen   thou seemest to my fancysinging here   and gathering flowers as that fair maiden when   she lost the spring and ceres her more dear     footnote as published by medwin 1834 and 1847  but we have a far more important because a direct testimony in a manuscript addition made by thomas medwin in the margin of a copy of his life of shelley 1847 footnote the copy 2 vols was sold at sothebys on the 6th december 1906 mr h buxton forman who was i think the buyer published the contents in the life of percy bysshe shelley by thomas medwin a new edition printed from a copy copiously amended and extended by the author    milford 1913 the passage here quoted appears on p 27 of the 2nd vol of the 1847 edition forman ed p 252 the passage is clearly intendedthough chronology is no more than any other exact science the forte of that most tantalizing of biographersto refer to the year 1820  mrs shelley had at this time been writing some little dramas on classical subjects one of which was the rape of proserpine a very graceful composition which she has never published shelley contributed to this the exquisite fable of arethusa and the invocation to ceresamong the nymphs gathering flowers on enna were two whom she called ino and uno names which i remember in the dialogue were irresistibly ludicrous she also wrote one on midas into which were introduced by shelley in the contest between pan and apollo the sublime effusion of the latter and pans characterised ode  this statement of medwin finally settles the question the friend at whose request mrs shelley says footnote the hymns of pan and apollo were first published by mrs shelley in the posthumous poems 1824 with a note saying that they had been written at the request of a friend to be inserted in a drama on the subject of midas arethusa appeared in the same volume dated pisa 1820 proserpines song was not published before the first collected edition of 1839 the lyrics were written by her husband was herself and she was the author of the dramas footnote not e e williams buxton forman ed 1882 vol iv p 34 the manuscript of the poetical play composed about 1822 by the latter the promise with shelleys autograph poem night with all thine eyes look down was given to the bodleian library in 1914  the manuscript bodleian library ms shelley d 2 looks like a cheap exercisebook originally of 40 now of 36 leaves 8 14 x 6 inches in boards the contents are the dramas here presented written in a clear legible handthe equable hand of mrs shelley footnote shelleys lyrics are also in his wifes writingmr locock is surely mistaken in assuming two different hands to this manuscript the poems of percy bysshe shelley methuen 1909 vol iii p xix there are very few words corrected or cancelled it is obviously a fair copy mr c d locock in his examination of the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library clarendon press oxford 1903 pp 2425 has already pointed out the valuable emendations of the received text of shelleys lyrics which are found here in fact the only mystery is why neither shelley nor mary in the course of her long widowed years should have published these curious and surely not contemptible byproducts of their cooperation in the fruitful year 1820     ii  for indeed there is more than a personal interest attached to these writings of mrs shelleys the fact that the same mind which had revelled a few years earlier in the fantastical horrors of frankensteins abortive creation could now dwell on the melancholy fate of proserpine or the humorous disappointment of midas and delight in their subtle poetical or moral symbolismthis fact has its significance it is one of the earliest indications of the revival in the heart of romanticism of the old love of classical myths and classical beauty  the subject is a wide one and cannot be adequately dealt with in this place but a few words may not be superfluous for a correct historical appreciation of mrs shelleys attempt  how deficient had been the sense of classical beauty in the socalled classical age of english literature is a trite consideration of criticism the treatment of mythology is particularly conclusive on this point throughout the augustan era mythology was approached as a mere treasurehouse of pleasant fancies artificial decorations motives whether sumptuous or meretricious allusions to jove and venus mercury apollo or bacchus are of course found in every other page of dryden pope prior swift gay and parnell but no fresh presentation no loving interpretation of the old myths occur anywhere the immortal stories were then part and parcel of a sort of poetical curriculum through which the whole school must be taken by the stern masters tradition and propriety there is little to be wondered at if this matter of curriculum was treated by the more passive scholars as a matter of course and by the sharper and less reverent disciples as a matter of fun indeed if any personality is then evinced in the adaptation of these old world themes it is generally connected with a more or less emphatic disparagement or grotesque distortion of their real meaning  when dryden for example makes use of the legend of midas in his wife of baths tale he makes not midass minister but his queen tell the mighty secretand thus secures another hit at womans loquacity  priors female phaeton is a younger sister who jealous of her elders success thus pleads with her mamma    ill have my earl as well as she     or know the reason why  and she wants to flaunt it accordingly  finally    fondness prevailed mamma gave way     kitty at hearts desire   obtained the chariot for a day     and set the world on fire  pandora in parnells hesiod or the rise of woman is only a                shining vengeance   a pleasing bosomcheat a specious ill  sent by the gods upon earth to punish the race of prometheus  the most poetical fables of greece are desecrated by gay into mere miniatures for the decoration of his fan  similar instances abound later on when armstrong brings in an apostrophe to the naiads it is in the course of a poetical essay on the art of preserving health and again when cowper stirs himself to intone an ode to apollo it is in the same mockheroic vein    patron of all those luckless brains     that to the wrong side leaning   indite much metre with much pains     and little or no meaning  even in grayspindaric graystreatment of classical themes there is a sort of pervading ennui or the forced appreciativeness of a gouty disappointed man the daughter of jove to whom he dedicates his hymns too often is adversity and classical reminiscences have even with him a dull musty tinge which recalls the antiquarian in his cambridge collegerooms rather than the visitor to florence and rome for one thing his allusions are too many and too transitory to appear anything but artistic tricks and verse making tools the aegean deep and delphis steep and meanders amber waves and the rosycrowned loves are too cursorily summoned and dismissed to suggest that they have been brought in for their own sweet sakes  it was thus with all the fine quintessences of ancient lore with all the pearllike accretions of the faiths and fancies of the old world they were handled about freely as a kind of curious but not so very rare coins which found no currency in the deeper thoughts of our modern humanity and could therefore be used as a mere badge of the learning and taste of a literary coterie  the very names of the ancient gods and heroes were in fact assuming that abstract anaemic look which common nouns have in everyday language thus when garrick in his verses upon a ladys embroidery mentions arachne it is obvious that he does not expect the reader to think of the daring challenger of minervas art or the princess of lydia but just of a plain spider and again when falconer in his early monody on the death of the prince of wales expresses a rhetorical wish    to aid hoarse howling boreas with his sighs  that particular son of astraeus whose love for the nymph orithyia was long unsuccessful because he could not sigh is surely far from the poets mind and to swell the wind or the gale would have served his turn quite as well though less elegantly  even gibbon with all his partiality for whatever was pre or post christian had indeed no better word than elegant for the ancient mythologies of greece and rome and he surely reflected no particularly advanced opinion when he praised and damned in one breath the pleasant and absurd system of paganism footnote essay on the study of literature section 56 no wonder if in his days and for a long time after the passionate giants of the ages of fable had dwindled down to the pretty puppets with which the daughters of the gentry had to while away many a school hour  but the days of this rhetoricalor satirical didacticor perfunctory treatment of classical themes were doomed it is the glory of romanticism to have opened magic casements not only on the foam of perilous seas in the west but also on           the chambers of the east   the chambers of the sun that now     from ancient melody had ceased       footnote blake poetical sketches 1783  romanticism as a freshening up of all the sources of life a general rejuvenescence of the soul a ubiquitous visiting of the spirit of delight and wonder could not confine itself to the fields of mediaeval romance even the records of the greek and roman thought assumed a new beauty the classical sense was let free from its antiquarian trammels and the perennial fanes resounded to the songs of a more impassioned worship  the change however took some time and it must be admitted that in england especially the romantic movement was slow to go back to classical themes winckelmann and goethe and chenierthe last indeed practically all unknown to his contemporarieshad long rediscovered antiquity and felt its pulse anew and praised its enduring power when english poetry had little if anything to show in answer to the plaintive invocation of blake to the ancient muses  the first generation of english romantics either shunned the subject altogether or simply echoed blakes isolated lines in isolated passages as regretful and almost as despondent from persia to paraguay southey could wander and seek after exotic themes his days could be passed among the deadbut neither the classic lands nor the classic heroes ever seem to have detained him walter scotts sphere of sensation may be almost exactly limited by the growth of heather as ruskin says footnote modern painters iii 317 and when he came to rome his last illness prevented him from any attempt he might have wished to make to enlarge his field of vision wordsworth was even less fartravelled and his homemade poetry never thought of the pagan and his creed outworn but as a distinct pisaller in the way of inspiration footnote sonnet the world is too much with us cf the excursion iv 85157 and again though coleridge has a few magnificent lines about them he seems to have even less willingly than wordsworth hearkened after    the intelligible forms of ancient poets   the fair humanities of old religion     footnote the piccolomini ii iv  it was to be otherwise with the later english romantic poets they lived and worked at a time when the whole atmosphere and even the paraphernalia of literary composition had just undergone a considerable change after a period of comparative seclusion and self concentration england at the peace of amiens once more found its way to europeand vice versa and from our point of view this widening of prospects is especially noticeable for the classical revival in romanticism appears to be closely connected with it  it is an alluring subject to investigate how the progress of scholarship the recent finds of archaeology the extension of travelling along mediterranean shores the political enthusiasms evoked by the stirrings of young italy and young greece all combined to reawaken in the poetical imagination of the times the dormant memories of antiquity has not yet been told by the historians of literature footnote at least as far as england is concerned for france cf canat la renaissance de la grece antique hachette paris 1911  butand this is sufficient for our purposeevery one knows what the elgin marbles have done for keats and shelley and what inspirations were derived from their pilgrimages in classic lands by all the poets of this and the following generation from byron to landor such experiences could not but react on the common conception of mythology a knowledge of the great classical sculpture of greece could not but invest with a new dignity and chastity the notions which so far had been nurtured on the venus de medici and the belvedere apolloeven shelley lived and possibly died under their spell and returning to the nature which had inspired the ancient myths the romantic poets must have felt with a keener sense their exquisite vitality footnote j a symonds studies of the greek poets ii p 258 the whole tenor of english romanticism may be said to have been affected thereby  for english romanticismand this is one of its most distinctive meritshad no exclusiveness about it it was too spontaneous one would almost say too unconscious ever to be clannish it grew untrammelled by codes uncrystallized into formulas a living thing always not a subjectmatter for grandiloquent manifestoes and more or less dignified squabbles it could therefore absorb and turn to account elements which seemed antagonistic to it in the more sophisticated forms it assumed in other literatures thus whilst french romanticismin spite of what it may or may not have owed to chenierbecame often distinctly deliberately wilfully anti classical whilst for example footnote as pointed out by brunetiere evolution de la poesie lyrique ii p 147 victor hugo in that allcomprehending legende des siecles could find room for the hegira and for zimzizimi but did not consecrate a single line to the departed glories of mythical greece the romantic poets of england may claim to have restored in freshness and purity the religion of antiquity indeed their voice was so convincing that even the great christian chorus that broke out afresh in the victorian era could not entirely drown it and elizabeth barrett had an apologetic way of dismissing the dead pan and all the vain false gods of hellas with an acknowledgement of             your beauty which confesses   some chief beauty conquering you  this may be taken to have been the average attitude in the forties towards classical mythology that twenty years before at least in the shelley circle it was far less grudging we now have definite proof  not only was shelley prepared to admit with the liberal opinion of the time that ancient mythology was a system of nature concealed under the veil of allegory a system in which a thousand fanciful fables contained a secret and mystic meaning footnote edinb rev july 1808 he was prepared to go a considerable step farther and claim that there was no essential difference between ancient mythology and the theology of the christians that both were interpretations in more or less figurative language of the great mysteries of being and indeed that the earlier interpretation precisely because it was more frankly figurative and poetical than the later one was better fitted to stimulate and to allay the sense of wonder which ought to accompany a reverent and highsouled man throughout his lifecareer  in the earlier phase of shelleys thought this identification of the ancient and the modern faiths was derogatory to both the letter which he had written in 1812 for the edification of lord ellenborough revelled in the contemplation of a time when the christian religion shall have faded from the earth when its memory like that of polytheism now shall remain but remain only as the subject of ridicule and wonder but as time went on shelleys views became less purely negative instead of ruling the adversaries back to back out of court he bethought himself of venturing a plea in favour of the older and weaker one it may have been in 1817 that he contemplated an essay in favour of polytheismfootnote cf our shelleys prose in the bodleian mss 1910 p 124 he was then living on the fringe of a charmed circle of amateur and adventurous hellenists who could have furthered the scheme his great friend thomas love peacock greeky peaky was a personal acquaintance of thomas taylor the platonist alias pagan taylor and taylors translations and commentaries of plato had been favourites of shelley in his college days something at least of taylors queer mixture of flaming enthusiasm and tortuous ingenuity may be said to appear in the unexpected document we have now to examine  it is a little draft of an essay which

ordered to stand round the foot of the mountain  not on pain of death to infringe upon the boundsthe man in whom they confided went up the mountain  came down again bringing them word   the draft unfortunately leaves off here and we are unable to know for certain whether this shelleyan paradox greatly daring meant to minimize the importance of the only public revelation granted to the chosen people but we have enough to understand the general trend of the argument it did not actually intend to sap the foundations of scriptural authority but it was bold enough to risk a little shaking in order to prove that the sacred books of the greeks and romans did not after all present us with a much more rickety structure this was a task of conciliation rather than destruction and yet even this conservative view of the shelleys exegesis cannotand will not detract from the value of the above document surely this curious theory of the equal inspiration of polytheism and the jewish or christian religions whether it was invented or simply espoused by mrs shelley evinces in herfor the time being at leasta very considerable share of that adventurous if somewhat uncritical alacrity of mind which carried the poet through so many religious and political problems it certainly vindicates her more completely perhaps than anything hitherto published against the strictures of those who knew her chiefly or exclusively in later years and could speak of her as a most conventional slave who even affected the pious dodge and was not a suitable companion for the poet footnote trelawnys letter 3 april 1870 in mr h buxton formans edition 1910 p 229 mrs shelleyat twentythree years of agehad not yet run the full career of her humour and her enthusiasm for classical mythology may well have later on gone the way of her admiration for spinoza whom she read with shelley that winter 18201 as medwin notes footnote i e ed h buxton forman p 253 and whose arguments she then thought irrefutabletempora mutantur  however that may be the two little mythological dramas on proserpine and midas assume in the light of that enthusiasm a special interest they standor fallboth as a literary and to a certain extent as an intellectual effort they are more than an attitude and not much less than an avowal not only do they claim our attention as the single poetical work of any length which seems to have been undertaken by mrs shelley they are a unique and touching monument of that intimate cooperation which at times especially in the early years in italy could make the union of the may and the elf almost unreservedly delightful it would undoubtedly be fatuous exaggeration to ascribe a very high place in literature to these little ovidian fancies of mrs shelley the scenes after all are little better than adaptationsfairly close adaptationsof the latin poets wellknown tales  even proserpine though clearly the more successful of the two both more strongly knit as drama and less uneven in style and versification cannot for a moment compare with the far more original interpretations of tennyson swinburne or meredith footnote demeter and persephone 1889 the garden of proserpine 1866 the appeasement of demeter 1888 but it is hardly fair to draw in the great names of the latter part of the century the parallel would be more illuminatingand the final award passed on mrs shelleys attempt more favourableif we were to think of a contemporary production like barry cornwalls rape of proserpine which being published in 1820 it is just possible that the shelleys should have known b w procters poem is also a dramatic scene written in imitation of the mode originated by the greek tragic writers in fact those hallowed models seem to have left far fewer traces in barry cornwalls verse

seasons has been entirely neglected by the author surely his work though published is quite as deservedly obscure as mrs shelleys derelict manuscript midas has the privilege if it be one of not challenging any obvious comparison the subject since lylys and drydens days has hardly attracted the attention of the poets it was so eminently fit for the lighter kinds of presentation that the agile bibliographer who aimed at completeness would have to go through a fairly long list of masques footnote there is one by poor christopher smart comic operas or burlettas all dealing with the ludicrous misfortunes of the phrygian king but an examination of these would be sheer pedantry in this place here again mrs shelley has stuck to her latin source as closely as she could footnote perhaps her somewhat wearying second act on the effects of the goldtransmuting gift would have been shorter if ovid metam xi 10830 had not himself gone into such details on the subject she has made a gallant

themselves a new frame often makes a new face and some of the best known and most exquisite of shelleys lyrics when restored to the surroundings for which the poet intended them needed no other setoff to appeal to the reader with a fresh charm of quiet classical grace and beauty but the charm will operate all the more unfailingly if we remember that this clear classical mood was by no means such a common element in the literary atmosphere of the timesnot even a permanent element in the authors lives we have here none of the feverish ecstasy that lifts prometheus and hellas far above the ordinary range of philosophical or political poetry but shelleys encouragement probably his guidance and supervision have raised his wifes inspiration to a place considerably higher than that of frankenstein or valperga with all their faults these pages reflect some of that irradiation which shelley cast around his own lifethe irradiation of a dream beauteous and generous beauteous in its
