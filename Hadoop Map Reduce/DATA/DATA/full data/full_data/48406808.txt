48406808	tiktok of oz   by  l frank baum      to louis f gottschalk   whose sweet and dainty melodies   breathe the true spirit of fairyland   this book is affectionately dedicated    to my readers  the very marked success of my last years fairy book the patchwork girl of oz convinces me that my readers like the oz stories best of all as one little girl wrote me so here my dears is a new oz story in which is introduced ann soforth the queen of oogaboo whom tiktok assisted in conquering our old acquaintance the nome king it also tells of betsy bobbin and how after many adventures she finally reached the marvelous land of oz  there is a play called the tiktok man of oz but it is not like this story of tiktok of oz although some of the adventures recorded in this book as well as those in several other oz books are included in the play those who have seen the play and those who have read the other oz books will find in this story a lot of strange characters and adventures that they have never heard of before  in the letters i receive from children there has been an urgent appeal for me to write a story that will take trot and capn bill to the land of oz where they will meet dorothy and ozma also they think buttonbright ought to get acquainted with ojo the lucky as you know i am obliged to talk these matters over with dorothy by means of the wireless for that is the only way i can communicate with the land of oz when i asked her about this idea she replied why havent you heard i said no well came the message over the wireless ill tell you all about it by and by and then you can make a book of that story for the children to read  so if dorothy keeps her word and i am permitted to write another oz book you will probably discover how all these characters came together in the famous emerald city meantime i want to tell all my little friendswhose numbers are increasing by many thousands every yearthat i am very grateful for the favor they have shown my books and for the delightful little letters i am constantly receiving i am almost sure that i have as many friends among the children of america as any story writer alive and this of course makes me very

younger sister salye else we shall soon be wading in dust and you are the eldest and the head of the family  im queen of oogaboo said ann proudly but she added with a sigh my kingdom is the smallest and the poorest in all the land of oz  this was quite true away up in the mountains in a far corner of the beautiful fairyland of oz lies a small valley which is named oogaboo and in this valley lived a few people who were usually happy and contented and never cared to wander over the mountain pass into the more settled parts of the land they knew that all of oz including their own territory was ruled by a beautiful princess named ozma who lived in the splendid emerald city yet the simple folk of oogaboo never visited ozma they had a royal family of their ownnot especially to rule over them but just as a matter of pride ozma permitted the various parts of her country to have their kings and queens and emperors and the like but all were ruled over by the lovely girl queen of the emerald city  the king of oogaboo used to be a man named jol jemkiph soforth who for many years did all the drudgery of deciding disputes and telling his people when to plant cabbages and pickle onions but the kings wife had a sharp tongue and small respect for the king her husband therefore one night king jol crept over the pass into the land of oz and disappeared from oogaboo for good and all the queen waited a few years for him to return and then started in search of him leaving her eldest daughter ann soforth to act as queen  now ann had not forgotten when her birthday came for that meant a party and feasting and dancing but she had quite forgotten how many years the birthdays marked in a land where people live always this is not considered a cause for regret so we may justly say that queen ann of oogaboo was old enough to make jellyand let it go at that  but she didnt make jelly or do any more of the housework than she could help she was an ambitious woman and constantly resented the fact that her kingdom was so tiny and her people so stupid and unenterprising often she wondered what had become of her father and mother out beyond the pass in the wonderful land of oz and the fact that they did not return to oogaboo led ann to suspect that they had found a better place to live so when salye refused to sweep the floor of the living room in the palace and ann would not sweep it either she said to her sister  im going away this absurd kingdom of oogaboo tires me  go if you want to answered salye but you are very foolish to leave this place  why asked ann  because in the land of oz which is ozmas country you will be a nobody while here you are a queen  oh yes queen over eighteen men twentyseven women and fortyfour children returned ann bitterly  well there are certainly more people than that in the great land of oz laughed salye why dont you raise an army and conquer them and be queen of all oz she asked trying to taunt ann and so to anger her then she made a face at her sister and went into the back yard to swing in the hammock  her jeering words however had given queen ann an idea she reflected that oz was reported to be a peaceful country and ozma a mere girl who ruled with gentleness to all and was obeyed because her people loved her even in oogaboo the story was told that ozmas sole army consisted of twentyseven fine officers who wore beautiful uniforms but carried no weapons because there was no one to fight once there had been a private soldier besides the officers but ozma had made him a captaingeneral and taken away his gun for fear it might accidentally hurt some one  the more ann thought about the matter the more she was convinced it would be easy to conquer the land of oz and set herself up as ruler in ozmas place if she but had an army to do it with afterward she could go out into the world and conquer other lands and then perhaps she could find a way to the moon and conquer that she had a warlike spirit that preferred trouble to idleness  it all depended on an army ann decided she carefully counted in her mind all the men of her kingdom yes there were exactly eighteen of them all told that would not make a very big army but by surprising ozmas unarmed officers her men might easily subdue them gentle people are always afraid of those that bluster ann told herself i dont wish to shed any blood for that would shock my nerves and i might faint but if we threaten and flash our weapons i am sure the people of oz will fall upon their knees before me and surrender  this argument which she repeated to herself more than once finally determined the queen of oogaboo to undertake the audacious venture  whatever happens she reflected can make me no more unhappy than my staying shut up in this miserable valley and sweeping floors and quarreling with sister salye so i will venture all and win what i may  that very day she started out to organize her army  the first man she came to was jo apple so called because he had an apple orchard  jo said ann i am going to conquer the world and i want you to join my army  dont ask me to do such a fool thing for i must politely refuse your majesty said jo apple  i have no intention of asking you i shall command you as queen of oogaboo to join said ann  in that case i suppose i must obey the man remarked in a sad voice but i pray you to consider that i am a very important citizen and for that reason am entitled to an office of high rank  you shall be a general promised ann  with gold epaulets and a sword he asked  of course said the queen  then she went to the next man whose name was jo bunn as he owned an orchard where grahambuns and wheatbuns in great variety both hot and cold grew on the trees  jo said ann i am going to conquer the world and i command you to join my army  impossible he exclaimed the bun crop has to be picked  let your wife and children do the picking said ann  but im a man of great importance your majesty he protested  for that reason you shall be one of my generals and wear a cocked hat with gold braid and curl your mustaches and clank a long sword she promised  so he consented although sorely against his will and the queen walked on to the next cottage here lived jo cone so called because the trees in his orchard bore crops of excellent icecream cones  jo said ann i am going to conquer the world and you must join my army  excuse me please said jo cone i am a bad fighter my good wife conquered me years ago for she can fight better than i take her your majesty instead of me and ill bless you for the favor  this must be an army of menfierce ferocious warriors declared ann looking sternly upon the mild little man  and you will leave my wife here in oogaboo he asked  yes and make you a general  ill go said jo cone and ann went on to the cottage of jo clock who had an orchard of clocktrees this man at first insisted that he would not join the army but queen anns promise to make him a general finally won his consent  how many generals are there in your army he asked  four so far replied ann  and how big will the army be was his next question  i intend to make every one of the eighteen men in oogaboo join it she said  then four generals are enough announced jo clock i advise you to make the rest of them colonels  ann tried to follow his advice the next four men she visitedwho were jo plum jo egg jo banjo and jo cheese named after the trees in their orchardsshe made colonels of her army but the fifth one jo nails said colonels and generals were getting to be altogether too common in the army of oogaboo and he preferred to be a major so jo nails jo cake jo ham and jo stockings were all four made majors while the next fourjo sandwich jo padlocks jo sundae and jo buttonswere appointed captains of the army  but now queen ann was in a quandary there remained but two other men in all oogaboo and if she made these two lieutenants while there were four captains four majors four colonels and four generals there was likely to be jealousy in her army and perhaps mutiny and desertions  one of these men however was jo candy and he would not go at all no promises could tempt him nor could threats move him he said he must remain at home to harvest his crop of jacksonballs lemondrops bonbons and chocolatecreams also he had large fields of crackerjack and buttered pop corn to be mowed and threshed and he was determined not to disappoint the children of oogaboo by going away to conquer the world and so let the candy crop spoil  finding jo candy so obstinate queen ann let him have his own way and continued her journey to the house of the eighteenth and last man in oogaboo who was a young fellow named jo files this files had twelve trees which bore steel files of various sorts but also he had nine booktrees on which grew a choice selection of storybooks in case you have never seen books growing upon trees i will explain that those in jo files orchard were enclosed in broad green husks which when fully ripe turned to a deep red color then the books were picked and husked and were ready to read if they were picked too soon the stories were found to be confused and uninteresting and the spelling bad however if allowed to ripen perfectly the stories were fine reading and the spelling and grammar excellent  files freely gave his books to all who wanted them but the people of oogaboo cared little for books and so he had to read most of them himself before they spoiled for as you probably know as soon as the books were read the words disappeared and the leaves withered and fadedwhich is the worst fault of all books which grow upon trees  when queen ann spoke to this young man files who was both intelligent and ambitious he said he thought it would be great fun to conquer the world but he called her attention to the fact that he was far superior to the other men of her army therefore he would not be one of her generals or colonels or majors or captains but claimed the honor of being sole private  ann did not like this idea at all  i hate to have a private soldier in my army she said theyre so common i am told that princess ozma once had a private soldier but she made him her captaingeneral which is good evidence that the private was unnecessary  ozmas army doesnt fight returned files but your army must fight like fury in order to conquer the world i have read in my books that it is always the private soldiers who do the fighting for no officer is ever brave enough to face the foe also it stands to reason that your officers must have some one to command and to issue their orders to therefore ill be the one i long to slash and slay the enemy and become a hero then when we return to oogaboo ill take all the marbles away from the children and melt them up and make a marble statue of myself for all to look upon and admire  ann was much pleased with private files he seemed indeed to be such a warrior as she needed in her enterprise and her hopes of success took a sudden bound when files told her he knew where a guntree grew and would go there at once and pick the ripest and biggest musket the tree bore     chapter two  out of oogaboo   three days later the grand army of oogaboo assembled in the square in front of the royal palace the sixteen officers were attired in gorgeous uniforms and carried sharp glittering swords the private had picked his gun and although it was not a very big weapon files tried to look fierce and succeeded so well that all his commanding officers were secretly afraid of him  the women were there protesting that queen ann soforth had no right to take their husbands and fathers from them but ann commanded them to keep silent and that was the hardest order to obey they had ever received  the queen appeared before her army dressed in an imposing uniform of green covered with gold braid she wore a green soldiercap with a purple plume in it and looked so royal and dignified that everyone in oogaboo except the army was glad she was going the army was sorry she was not going alone  form ranks she cried in her shrill voice  salye leaned out of the palace window and laughed  i believe your army can run better than it can fight she observed  of course replied general bunn proudly were not looking for trouble you know but for plunder the more plunder and the less fighting we get the better we shall like our work  for my part said files i prefer war and carnage to anything the only way to become a hero is to conquer and the storybooks all say that the easiest way to conquer is to fight  thats the idea my brave man agreed ann to fight is to conquer and to conquer is to secure plunder and to secure plunder is to become a hero with such noble determination to back me the world is mine goodbye salye when we return we shall be rich and famous come generals let us march  at this the generals straightened up and threw out their chests then they swung their glittering swords in rapid circles and cried to the colonels  forward march  then the colonels shouted to the majors forward march and the majors yelled to the captains forward march and the captains screamed to the private  forward march  so files shouldered his gun and began to march and all the officers followed after him queen ann came last of all rejoicing in her noble army and wondering why she had not decided long ago to conquer the world  in this order the procession marched out of oogaboo and took the narrow mountain pass which led into the lovely fairyland of oz     chapter three  magic mystifies the marchers   princess ozma was all unaware that the army of oogaboo led by their ambitious queen was determined to conquer her kingdom the beautiful girl ruler of oz was busy with the welfare of her subjects and had no time to think of ann soforth and her disloyal plans but there was one who constantly guarded the peace and happiness of the land of oz and this was the official sorceress of the kingdom glinda the good  in her magnificent castle which stands far north of the emerald city where ozma holds her court glinda owns a wonderful magic record book in which is printed every event that takes place anywhere just as soon as it happens  the smallest things and the biggest things are all recorded in this book if a child stamps its foot in anger glinda reads about it if a city burns down glinda finds the fact noted in her book  the sorceress always reads her record book every day and so it was she knew that ann soforth queen of oogaboo had foolishly assembled an army of sixteen officers and one private soldier with which she intended to invade and conquer the land of oz  there was no danger but that ozma supported by the magic arts of glinda the good and the powerful wizard of ozboth her firm friendscould easily defeat a far more imposing army than anns but it would be a shame to have the peace of oz interrupted by any sort of quarreling or fighting so glinda did not even mention the matter to ozma or to anyone else she merely went into a great chamber of her castle known as the magic room where she performed a magical ceremony which caused the mountain pass that led from oogaboo to make several turns and twists the result was that when ann and her army came to the end of the pass they were not in the land of oz at all but in an adjoining territory that was quite distinct from ozmas domain and separated from oz by an invisible barrier  as the oogaboo people emerged into this country the pass they had traversed disappeared behind them and it was not likely they would ever find their way back into the valley of oogaboo they were greatly puzzled indeed by their surroundings and did not know which way to go none of them had ever visited oz so it took them some time to discover they were not in oz at all but in an unknown country  never mind said ann trying to conceal her disappointment we have started out to conquer the world and here is part of it in time as we pursue our victorious journey we will doubtless come to oz but until we get there we may as well conquer whatever land we find ourselves in  have we conquered this place your majesty anxiously inquired major cake  most certainly said ann we have met no people as yet but when we do we will inform them that they are our slaves  and afterward we will plunder them of all their possessions added general apple  they may not possess anything objected private files but i hope they will fight us just the same a peaceful conquest wouldnt be any fun at all  dont worry said the queen we can fight whether our foes do or not and perhaps we would find it more comfortable to have the enemy surrender promptly  it was a barren country and not very pleasant to travel in moreover there was little for them to eat and as the officers became hungry they became fretful many would have deserted had they been able to find their way home but as the oogaboo people were now hopelessly lost in a strange country they considered it more safe to keep together than to separate  queen anns temper never very agreeable became sharp and irritable as she and her army tramped over the rocky roads without encountering either people or plunder she scolded her officers until they became surly and a few of them were disloyal enough to ask her to hold her tongue others began to reproach her for leading them into difficulties and in the space of three unhappy days every man was mourning for his orchard in the pretty valley of oogaboo  files however proved a different sort the more difficulties he encountered the more cheerful he became and the sighs of the officers were answered by the merry whistle of the private his pleasant disposition did much to encourage queen ann and before long she consulted the private soldier more often than she did his superiors  it was on the third day of their pilgrimage that they encountered their first adventure toward evening the sky was suddenly darkened and major nails exclaimed  a fog is coming toward us  i do not think it is a fog replied files looking with interest at the approaching cloud it seems to me more like the breath of a rak  what is a rak asked ann looking about fearfully  a terrible beast with a horrible appetite answered the soldier growing a little paler than usual i have never seen a rak to be sure but i have read of them in the storybooks that grew in my orchard and if this is indeed one of those fearful monsters we are not likely to conquer the world  hearing this the officers became quite worried and gathered closer about their soldier  what is the thing like asked one  the only picture of a rak that i ever saw in a book was rather blurred said files because the book was not quite ripe when it was picked but the creature can fly in the air and run like a deer and swim like a fish inside its body is a glowing furnace of fire and the rak breathes in air and breathes out smoke which darkens the sky for miles around wherever it goes it is bigger than a hundred men and feeds on any living thing  the officers now began to groan and to tremble but files tried to cheer them saying  it may not be a rak after all that we see approaching us and you must not forget that we people of oogaboo which is part of the fairyland of oz cannot be killed  nevertheless said captain buttons if the rak catches us and chews us up into small pieces and swallows uswhat will happen then  then each small piece will still be alive declared files  i cannot see how that would help us wailed colonel banjo a hamburger steak is a hamburger steak whether it is alive or not  i tell you this may not be a rak persisted files we will know when the cloud gets nearer whether it is the breath of a rak or not if it has no smell at all it is probably a fog but if it has an odor of salt and pepper it is a rak and we must prepare for a desperate fight  they all eyed the dark cloud fearfully before long it reached the frightened group and began to envelop them every nose sniffed the cloudand every one detected in it the odor of salt and pepper  the rak shouted private files and with a howl of despair the sixteen officers fell to the ground writhing and moaning in anguish queen ann sat down upon a rock and faced the cloud more bravely although her heart was beating fast as for files he calmly loaded his gun and stood ready to fight the foe as a soldier should  they were now in absolute darkness for the cloud which covered the sky and the setting sun was black as ink then through the gloom appeared two round glowing balls of red and files at once decided these must be the monsters eyes  he raised his gun took aim and fired  there were several bullets in the gun all gathered from an excellent bullettree in oogaboo and they were big and hard they flew toward the monster and struck it and with a wild weird cry the rak came fluttering down and its huge body fell plump upon the forms of the sixteen officers who thereupon screamed louder than before  badness me moaned the rak see what youve done with that dangerous gun of yours  i cant see replied files for the cloud formed by your breath darkens my sight  dont tell me it was an accident continued the rak reproachfully as it still flapped its wings in a helpless manner dont claim you didnt know the gun was loaded i beg of you  i dont intend to replied files did the bullets hurt you very badly  one has broken my jaw so that i cant open my mouth you will notice that my voice sounds rather harsh and husky because i have to talk with my teeth set close together another bullet broke my left wing so that i cant fly and still another broke my right leg so that i cant walk it was the most careless shot i ever heard of  cant you manage to lift your body off from my commanding officers inquired files from their cries im afraid your great weight is crushing them  i hope it is growled the rak i want to crush them if possible for i have a bad disposition if only i could open my mouth id eat all of you although my appetite is poorly this warm weather  with this the rak began to roll its immense body sidewise so as to crush the officers more easily but in doing this it rolled completely off from them and the entire sixteen scrambled to their feet and made off as fast as they could run  private files could not see them go but he knew from the sound of their voices that they had escaped so he ceased to worry about them  pardon me if i now bid you goodbye he said to the rak the parting is caused by our desire to continue our journey if you die do not blame me for i was obliged to shoot you as a matter of selfprotection  i shall not die answered the monster for i bear a charmed life but i beg you not to leave me  why not asked files  because my broken jaw will heal in about an hour and then i shall be able to eat you my wing will heal in a day and my leg will heal in a week when i shall be as well as ever having shot me and so caused me all this annoyance it is only fair and just that you remain here and allow me to eat you as soon as i can open my jaws  i beg to differ with you returned the soldier firmly i have made an engagement with queen ann of oogaboo to help her conquer the world and i cannot break my word for the sake of being eaten by a rak  oh thats different said the monster if youve an engagement dont let me detain you  so files felt around in the dark and grasped the hand of the trembling queen whom he led away from the flapping sighing rak they stumbled over the stones for a way but presently began to see dimly the path ahead of them as they got farther and farther away from the dreadful spot where the wounded monster lay by and by they reached a little hill and could see the last rays of the sun flooding a pretty valley beyond for now they had passed beyond the cloudy breath of the rak here were huddled the sixteen officers still frightened and panting from their run they had halted only because it was impossible for them to run any farther  queen ann gave them a severe scolding for their cowardice at the same time praising files for his courage  we are wiser than he however muttered general clock for by running away we are now able to assist your majesty in conquering the world whereas had files been eaten by the rak he would have deserted your army  after a brief rest they descended into the valley and as soon as they were out of sight of the rak the spirits of the entire party rose quickly just at dusk they came to a brook on the banks of which queen ann commanded them to make camp for the night  each officer carried in his pocket a tiny white tent this when placed upon the ground quickly grew in size until it was large enough to permit the owner to enter it and sleep within its canvas walls files was obliged to carry a knapsack in which was not only his own tent but an elaborate pavilion for queen ann besides a bed and chair and a magic table this table when set upon the ground in anns pavilion became of large size and in a drawer of the table was contained the queens supply of extra clothing her manicure and toilet articles and other necessary things the royal bed was the only one in the camp the officers and private sleeping in hammocks attached to their tent poles  there was also in the knapsack a flag bearing the royal emblem of oogaboo and this flag files flew upon its staff every night to show that the country they were in had been conquered by the queen of oogaboo so far no one but themselves had seen the flag but ann was pleased to see it flutter in the breeze and considered herself already a famous conqueror     chapter four  betsy braves the billows   the waves dashed and the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled and the ship struck a rock betsy bobbin was running across the deck and the shock sent her flying through the air until she fell with a splash into the dark blue water the same shock caught hank a thin little sadfaced mule and tumbled him also into the sea far from the ships side  when betsy came up gasping for breath because the wet plunge had surprised her she reached out in the dark and grabbed a bunch of hair at first she thought it was the end of a rope but presently she heard a dismal heehaw and knew she was holding fast to the end of hanks tail  suddenly the sea was lighted up by a vivid glare the ship now in the far distance caught fire blew up and sank beneath the waves  betsy shuddered at the sight but just then her eye caught a mass of wreckage floating near her and she let go the mules tail and seized the rude raft pulling herself up so that she rode upon it in safety hank also saw the raft and swam to it but he was so clumsy he never would have been able to climb upon it had not betsy helped him to get aboard  they had to crowd close together for their support was only a hatchcover torn from the ships deck but it floated them fairly well and both the girl and the mule knew it would keep them from drowning  the storm was not over by any means when the ship went down blinding bolts of lightning shot from cloud to cloud and the clamor of deep thunderclaps echoed far over the sea the waves tossed the little raft here and there as a child tosses a rubber ball and betsy had a solemn feeling that for hundreds of watery miles in every direction there was no living thing besides herself and the small donkey  perhaps hank had the same thought for he gently rubbed his nose against the frightened girl and said heehaw in his softest voice as if to comfort her  youll protect me hank dear wont you she cried helplessly and the mule said heehaw again in tones that meant a promise  on board the ship during the days that preceded the wreck when the sea was calm betsy and hank had become good friends so while the girl might have preferred a more powerful protector in this dreadful emergency she felt that the mule would do all in a mules power to guard her safety  all night they floated and when the storm had worn itself out and passed away with a few distant growls and the waves had grown smaller and easier to ride betsy stretched herself out on the wet raft and fell asleep  hank did not sleep a wink perhaps he felt it his duty to guard betsy anyhow he crouched on the raft beside the tired sleeping girl and watched patiently until the first light of dawn swept over the sea  the light wakened betsy bobbin she sat up rubbed her eyes and stared across the water  oh hank theres land ahead she exclaimed  heehaw answered hank in his plaintive voice  the raft was floating swiftly toward a very beautiful country and as they drew near betsy could see banks of lovely flowers showing brightly between leafy trees but no people were to be seen at all     chapter five  the roses repulse the refugees   gently the raft grated on the sandy beach then betsy easily waded ashore the mule following closely behind her the sun was now shining and the air was warm and laden with the fragrance of roses  id like some breakfast hank remarked the girl feeling more cheerful now that she was on dry land but we cant eat the flowers although they do smell mighty good  heehaw replied hank and trotted up a little pathway to the top of the bank  betsy followed and from the eminence looked around her a little way off stood a splendid big greenhouse its thousands of crystal panes glittering in the sunlight  there ought to be people somewhere round observed betsy thoughtfully gardeners or somebody lets go and see hank im getting hungrier evry minute  so they walked toward the great greenhouse and came to its entrance without meeting with anyone at all a door stood ajar so hank went in first thinking if there was any danger he could back out and warn his companion but betsy was close at his heels and the moment she entered was lost in amazement at the wonderful sight she saw  the greenhouse was filled with magnificent rosebushes all growing in big pots on the central stem of each bush bloomed a splendid rose gorgeously colored and deliciously fragrant and in the center of each rose was the face of a lovely girl  as betsy and hank entered the heads of the roses were drooping and their eyelids were closed in slumber but the mule was so amazed that he uttered a loud heehaw and at the sound of his harsh voice the rose leaves fluttered the roses raised their heads and a hundred startled eyes were instantly fixed upon the intruders  ii beg your pardon stammered betsy blushing and confused  oooh cried the roses in a sort of sighing chorus and one of them added what a horrid noise  why that was only hank said betsy and as if to prove the truth of her words the mule uttered another loud heehaw  at this all the roses turned on their stems as far as they were able and trembled as if some one were shaking their bushes a dainty moss rose gasped dear me how dreadfully dreadful  it isnt dreadful at all said betsy somewhat indignant when you get used to hanks voice it will put you to sleep  the roses now looked at the mule less fearfully and one of them asked  is that savage beast named hank  yes hanks my comrade faithful and true answered the girl twining her arms around the little mules neck and hugging him tight arent you hank  hank could only say in reply heehaw and at his bray the roses shivered again  please go away begged one cant you see youre frightening us out of a weeks growth  go away echoed betsy why weve no place to go weve just been wrecked  wrecked asked the roses in a surprised chorus  yes we were on a big ship and the storm came and wrecked it explained the girl but hank and i caught hold of a raft and floated ashore to this place andwere tired and hungry what country is this please  this is the rose kingdom replied the moss rose haughtily and it is devoted to the culture of the rarest and fairest roses grown  i believe it said betsy admiring the pretty blossoms  but only roses are allowed here continued a delicate tea rose bending her brows in a frown therefore you must go away before the royal gardener finds you and casts you back into the sea  oh is there a royal gardener then inquired betsy  to be sure  and is he a rose also  of course not hes a mana wonderful man was the reply  well im not afraid of a man declared the girl much relieved and even as she spoke the royal gardener popped into the greenhousea spading fork in one hand and a watering pot in the other  he was a funny little man dressed in a rosecolored costume with ribbons at his knees and elbows and a bunch of ribbons in his hair his eyes were small and twinkling his nose sharp and his face puckered and deeply lined  oho he exclaimed astonished to find strangers in his greenhouse and when hank gave a loud bray the gardener threw the watering pot over the mules head and danced around with his fork in such agitation that presently he fell over the handle of the implement and sprawled at full length upon the ground  betsy laughed and pulled the watering pot off from hanks head the little mule was angry at the treatment he had received and backed toward the gardener threateningly  look out for his heels called betsy warningly and the gardener scrambled to his feet and hastily hid behind the roses  you are breaking the law he shouted sticking out his head to glare at the girl and the mule  what law asked betsy  the law of the rose kingdom no strangers are allowed in these domains  not when theyre shipwrecked she inquired  the law doesnt except shipwrecks replied the royal gardener and he was about to say more when suddenly there was a crash of glass and a man came tumbling through the roof of the greenhouse and fell plump to the ground     chapter six  shaggy seeks his stray brother   this sudden arrival was a queer looking man dressed all in garments so shaggy that betsy at first thought he must be some animal but the stranger ended his fall in a sitting position and then the girl saw it was really a man he held an apple in his hand which he had evidently been eating when he fell and so little was he jarred or flustered by the accident that he continued to munch this apple as he calmly looked around him  good gracious exclaimed betsy approaching him who are you and where did you come from  me oh im shaggy man said he taking another bite of the apple just dropped in for a short call excuse my seeming haste  why i spose you couldnt help the haste said betsy  no i climbed an apple tree outside branch gave way andhere i am  as he spoke the shaggy man finished his apple gave the core to hankwho ate it greedilyand then stood up to bow politely to betsy and the roses  the royal gardener had been frightened nearly into fits by the crash of glass and the fall of the shaggy stranger into the bower of roses but now he peeped out from behind a bush and cried in his squeaky voice  youre breaking the law youre breaking the law  shaggy stared at him solemnly  is the glass the law in this country he asked  breaking the glass is breaking the law squeaked the gardener angrily also to intrude in any part of the rose kingdom is breaking the law  how do you know asked shaggy  why its printed in a book said the gardener coming forward and taking a small book from his pocket page thirteen here it is if any stranger enters the rose kingdom he shall at once be condemned by the ruler and put to death so you see strangers he continued triumphantly its death for you all and your time has come  but just here hank interposed he had been stealthily backing toward the royal gardener whom he disliked and now the mules heels shot out and struck the little man in the middle he doubled up like the letter u and flew out of the door so swiftlynever touching the groundthat he was gone before betsy had time to wink  but the mules attack frightened the girl  come she whispered approaching the shaggy man and taking his hand lets go somewhere else theyll surely kill us if we stay here  dont worry my dear replied shaggy patting the childs head im not afraid of anything so long as i have the love magnet  the love magnet why what is that asked betsy  its a charming little enchantment that wins the heart of everyone who looks upon it was the reply the love magnet used to hang over the gateway to the emerald city in the land of oz but when i started on this journey our beloved ruler ozma of oz allowed me to take it with me  oh cried betsy staring hard at him are you really from the wonderful land of oz  yes ever been there my dear  no but ive heard about it and do you know princess ozma  very well indeed  andand princess dorothy  dorothys an old chum of mine declared shaggy  dear me exclaimed betsy and why did you ever leave such a beautiful land as oz  on an errand said shaggy looking sad and solemn im trying to find my dear little brother  oh is he lost questioned betsy feeling very sorry for the poor man  been lost these ten years replied shaggy taking out a handkerchief and wiping a tear from his eye i didnt know it until lately when i saw it recorded in the magic record book of the sorceress glinda in the land of oz so now im trying to find him  where was he lost asked the girl sympathetically  back in colorado where i used to live before i went to oz brother was a miner and dug gold out of a mine one day he went into his mine and never came out they searched for him but he was not there disappeared entirely shaggy ended miserably  for goodness sake what do you spose became of him she asked  there is only one explanation replied shaggy taking another apple from his pocket and eating it to relieve his misery the nome king probably got him  the nome king who is he  why hes sometimes called the metal monarch and his name is ruggedo lives in some underground cavern claims to own all the metals hidden in the earth dont ask me why  why  cause i dont know but this ruggedo gets wild with anger if anyone digs gold out of the earth and my private opinion is that he captured brother and carried him off to his underground kingdom nodont ask me why i see youre dying to ask me why but i dont know  butdear mein that case you will never find your lost brother exclaimed the girl  maybe not but its my duty to try answered shaggy ive wandered so far without finding him but that only proves he is not where ive been looking what i seek now is the hidden passage to the underground cavern of the terrible metal monarch  well said betsy doubtfully it strikes me that if you ever manage to get there the metal monarch will make you too his prisoner  nonsense answered shaggy carelessly you mustnt forget the love magnet  what about it she asked  when the fierce metal monarch sees the love magnet he will love me dearly and do anything i ask  it must be wonderful said betsy with awe  it is the man assured her shall i show it to you  oh do she cried so shaggy searched in his shaggy pocket and drew out a small silver magnet shaped like a horseshoe  the moment betsy saw it she began to like the shaggy man better than before hank also saw the magnet and crept up to shaggy to rub his head lovingly against the mans knee  but they were interrupted by the royal gardener who stuck his head into the greenhouse and shouted angrily  you are all condemned to death your only chance to escape is to leave here instantly  this startled little betsy but the shaggy man merely waved the magnet toward the gardener who seeing it rushed forward and threw himself at shaggys feet murmuring in honeyed words  oh you lovely lovely man how fond i am of you every shag and bobtail that decorates you is dear to meall i have is yours but for goodness sake get out of here before you die the death  im not going to die declared shaggy man  you must its the law exclaimed the gardener beginning to weep real tears it breaks my heart to tell you this bad news but the law says that all strangers must be condemned by the ruler to die the death  no ruler has condemned us yet said betsy  of course not added shaggy we havent even seen the ruler of the rose kingdom  well to tell the truth said the gardener in a perplexed tone of voice we havent any real ruler just now you see all our rulers grow on bushes in the royal gardens and the last one we had got mildewed and withered before his time so we had to plant him and at this time there is no one growing on the royal bushes who is ripe enough to pick  how do you know asked betsy  why im the royal gardener plenty of royalties are growing i admit but just now they are all green until one ripens i am supposed to rule the rose kingdom myself and see that its laws are obeyed therefore much as i love you shaggy i must put you to death  wait a minute pleaded betsy id like to see those royal gardens before i die  so would i added shaggy man take us there gardener  oh i cant do that objected the gardener but shaggy again showed him the love magnet and after one glance at it the gardener could no longer resist  he led shaggy betsy and hank to the end of the great greenhouse and carefully unlocked a small door passing through this they came into the splendid royal garden of the rose kingdom  it was all surrounded by a tall hedge and within the enclosure grew several enormous rosebushes having thick green leaves of the texture of velvet upon these bushes grew the members of the royal family of the rose kingdommen women and children in all stages of maturity they all seemed to have a light green hue as if unripe or not fully developed their flesh and clothing being alike green they stood perfectly lifeless upon their branches which swayed softly in the breeze and their wide open eyes stared straight ahead unseeing and unintelligent  while examining these curious growing people betsy passed behind a big central bush and at once uttered an exclamation of surprise and pleasure for there blooming in perfect color and shape stood a royal princess whose beauty was amazing  why shes ripe cried betsy pushing aside some of the broad leaves to observe her more clearly  well perhaps so admitted the gardener who had come to the girls side but shes a girl and so we cant use her for a ruler  no indeed came a chorus of soft voices and looking around betsy discovered that all the roses had followed them from the greenhouse and were now grouped before the entrance  you see explained the gardener the subjects of rose kingdom dont want a girl ruler they want a king  a king we want a king repeated the chorus of roses  isnt she royal inquired shaggy admiring the lovely princess  of course for she grows on a royal bush this princess is named ozga as she is a distant cousin of ozma of oz and were she but a man we would joyfully hail her as our ruler  the gardener then turned away to talk with his roses and betsy whispered to her companion lets pick her shaggy  all right said he if shes royal she has the right to rule this kingdom and if we pick her she will surely protect us and prevent our being hurt or driven away  so betsy and shaggy each took an arm of the beautiful rose princess and a little twist of her feet set her free of the branch upon which she grew very gracefully she stepped down from the bush to the ground where she bowed low to betsy and shaggy and said in a delightfully sweet voice i thank you  but at the sound of these words the gardener and the roses turned and discovered that the princess had been picked and was now alive over every face flashed an expression of resentment and anger and one of the roses cried aloud  audacious mortals what have you done  picked a princess for you thats all replied betsy cheerfully  but we wont have her we want a king exclaimed a jacque rose and another added with a voice of scorn no girl shall rule over us  the newlypicked princess looked from one to another of her rebellious subjects in astonishment a grieved look came over her exquisite features  have i no welcome here pretty subjects she asked gently have i not come from my royal bush to be your ruler  you were picked by mortals without our consent replied the moss rose coldly so we refuse to allow you to rule us  turn her out gardener with the others cried the tea rose  just a second please called shaggy taking the love magnet from his pocket i guess this will win their love princess heretake it in your hand and let the roses see it  princess ozga took the magnet and held it poised before the eyes of her subjects but the roses regarded it with calm disdain  why whats the matter demanded shaggy in surprise the magnet never failed to work before  i know said betsy nodding her head wisely these roses have no hearts  thats it agreed the gardener theyre pretty and sweet and alive but still they are roses their stems have thorns but no hearts  the princess sighed and handed the magnet to the shaggy man  what shall i do she asked sorrowfully  turn her out gardener with the others commanded the roses we will have no ruler until a manrosea kingis ripe enough to pick  very well said the gardener meekly you must excuse me my dear shaggy for opposing your wishes but you and the others including ozga must get out of rose kingdom immediately if not before  dont you love me gardy asked shaggy carelessly displaying the magnet  i do i dote on thee answered the gardener earnestly but no true man will neglect his duty for the sake of love my duty is to drive you out soout you go  with this he seized a garden fork and began jabbing it at the strangers in order to force them to leave hank the mule was not afraid of the fork and when he got his heels near to the gardener the man fell back to avoid a kick  but now the roses crowded around the outcasts and it was soon discovered that beneath their draperies of green leaves were many sharp thorns which were more dangerous than hanks heels neither betsy nor ozga nor shaggy nor the mule cared to brave those thorns and when they pressed away from them they found themselves slowly driven through the garden door into the greenhouse from there they were forced out at the entrance and so through the territory of the flowerstrewn rose kingdom which was not of very great extent  the rose princess was sobbing bitterly betsy was indignant and angry hank uttered defiant heehaws and the shaggy man whistled softly to himself  the boundary of the rose kingdom was a deep gulf but there was a drawbridge in one place and this the royal gardener let down until the outcasts had passed over it then he drew it up again and returned with his roses to the greenhouse leaving the four queerly assorted comrades to wander into the bleak and unknown country that lay beyond  i dont mind much remarked shaggy as he led the way over the stony barren ground ive got to search for my longlost little brother anyhow so it wont matter where i go  hank and i will help you find your brother said betsy in her most cheerful voice im so far away from home now that i dont spose ill ever find my way back and to tell the truth its more fun traveling around and having adventures than sticking at home dont you think so hank  heehaw said hank and the shaggy man thanked them both  for my part said princess ozga of roseland with a gentle sigh i must remain forever exiled from my kingdom so i too will be glad to help the shaggy man find his lost brother  thats very kind of you maam said shaggy but unless i can find the underground cavern of ruggedo the metal monarch i shall never find poor brother   this king was formerly named roquat but after he drank of the waters of oblivion he forgot his own name and had to take another   doesnt anyone know where it is inquired betsy  some one must know of course was shaggys reply but we are not the ones the only way to succeed is for us to keep going until we find a person who can direct us to ruggedos cavern  we may find it ourselves without any help suggested betsy who knows  no one knows that except the person whos writing this story said shaggy but we wont find anythingnot even supperunless we travel on heres a path lets take it and see where it leads to     chapter seven  polychromes pitiful plight   the rain king got too much water in his basin and spilled some over the brim that made it rain in a certain part of the countrya real hard shower for a timeand sent the rainbow scampering to the place to show the gorgeous colors of his glorious bow as soon as the mist of rain had passed and the sky was clear  the coming of the rainbow is always a joyous event to earth folk yet few have ever seen it close by usually the rainbow is so far distant that you can observe its splendid hues but dimly and that is why we seldom catch sight of the dancing daughters of the rainbow  in the barren country where the rain had just fallen there appeared to be no human beings at all but the rainbow appeared just the same and dancing gayly upon its arch were the rainbows daughters led by the fairylike polychrome who is so dainty and beautiful that no girl has ever quite equalled her in loveliness  polychrome was in a merry mood and danced down the arch of the bow to the ground daring her sisters to follow her laughing and gleeful they also touched the ground with their twinkling feet but all the daughters of the rainbow knew that this was a dangerous pastime so they quickly climbed upon their bow again  all but polychrome though the sweetest and merriest of them all she was likewise the most reckless moreover it was an unusual sensation to pat the cold damp earth with her rosy toes before she realized it the bow had lifted and disappeared in the billowy blue sky and here was polychrome standing helpless upon a rock her gauzy draperies floating about her like brilliant cobwebs and not a soulfairy or mortalto help her regain her lost bow  dear me she exclaimed a frown passing across her pretty face im caught again this is the second time my carelessness has left me on earth while my sisters returned to our sky palaces the first time i enjoyed some pleasant adventures but this is a lonely forsaken country and i shall be very unhappy until my rainbow comes again and i can climb aboard let me think what is best to be done  she crouched low upon the flat rock drew her draperies about her and bowed her head  it was in this position that betsy bobbin spied polychrome as she came along the stony path followed by hank the princess and shaggy at once the girl ran up to the radiant daughter of the rainbow and exclaimed  oh what a lovely lovely creature  polychrome raised her golden head there were tears in her blue eyes  im the most miserable girl in the whole world she sobbed  the others gathered around her  tell us your troubles pretty one urged the princess  iive lost my bow wailed polychrome  take me my dear said shaggy man in a sympathetic tone thinking she meant beau instead of bow  i dont want you cried polychrome stamping her foot imperiously i want my rainbow  oh thats different said shaggy but try to forget it when i was young i used to cry for the rainbow myself but i couldnt have it looks as if you couldnt have it either so please dont cry  polychrome looked at him reproachfully  i dont like you she said  no replied shaggy drawing the love magnet from his pocket not a little bitjust a wee speck of a like  yes yes said polychrome clasping her hands in ecstasy as she gazed at the enchanted talisman i love you shaggy man  of course you do said he calmly but i dont take any credit for it its the love magnets powerful charm but you seem quite alone and friendless little rainbow dont you want to join our party until you find your father and sisters again  where are you going she asked  we dont just know that said betsy taking her hand but were trying to find shaggys longlost brother who has been captured by the terrible metal monarch wont you come with us and help us  polychrome looked from one to another of the queer party of travelers and a bewitching smile suddenly lighted her face  a donkey a mortal maid a rose princess and a shaggy man she exclaimed surely you need help if you intend to face ruggedo  do you know him then inquired betsy  no indeed ruggedos caverns are beneath the earths surface where no rainbow can ever penetrate but ive heard of the metal monarch he is also called the nome king you know and he has made trouble for a good many peoplemortals and fairiesin his time said polychrome  do you fear him then asked the princess anxiously  no one can harm a daughter of the rainbow said polychrome proudly im a sky fairy  then said betsy quickly you will be able to tell us the way to ruggedos cavern  no returned polychrome shaking her head that is one thing i cannot do but i will gladly go with you and help you search for the place  this promise delighted all the wanderers and after the shaggy man had found the path again they began moving along it in a more happy mood the rainbows daughter danced lightly over the rocky trail no longer sad but with her beautiful features wreathed in smiles shaggy came next walking steadily and now and then supporting the rose princess who followed him betsy and hank brought up the rear and if she tired with walking the girl got upon hanks back and let the stout little donkey carry her for a while  at nightfall they came to some trees that grew beside a tiny brook and here they made camp and rested until morning then away they tramped finding berries and fruits here and there which satisfied the hunger of betsy shaggy and hank so that they were well content with their lot  it surprised betsy to see the rose princess partake of their food for she considered her a fairy but when she mentioned this to polychrome the rainbows daughter explained that when ozga was driven out of her rose kingdom she ceased to be a fairy and would never again be more than a mere mortal polychrome however was a fairy wherever she happened to be and if she sipped a few dewdrops by moonlight for refreshment no one ever saw her do it  as they continued their wandering journey direction meant very little to them for they were hopelessly lost in this strange country shaggy said it would be best to go toward the mountains as the natural entrance to ruggedos underground cavern was likely to be hidden in some rocky deserted place but mountains seemed all around them except in the one direction that they had come from which led to the rose kingdom and the sea therefore it mattered little which way they traveled  by and by they espied a faint trail that looked like a path and after following this for some time they reached a crossroads here were many paths leading in various directions and there was a signpost so old that there were now no words upon the sign at one side was an old well with a chain windlass for drawing water yet there was no house or other building anywhere in sight  while the party halted puzzled which way to proceed the mule approached the well and tried to look into it  hes thirsty said betsy  its a dry well remarked shaggy probably there has been no water in it for many years but come let us decide which way to travel  no one seemed able to decide that they sat down in a group and tried to consider which road might be the best to take hank however could not keep away from the well and finally he reared up on his hind legs got his head over the edge and uttered a loud heehaw betsy watched her animal friend curiously  i wonder if he sees anything down there she said  at this shaggy rose and went over to the well to investigate and betsy went with him the princess and polychrome who had become fast friends linked arms and sauntered down one of the roads to find an easy path  really said shaggy there does seem to be something at the bottom of this old well  cant we pull it up and see what it is asked the girl  there was no bucket at the end of the windlass chain but there was a big hook that at one time was used to hold a bucket shaggy let down this hook dragged it around on the bottom and then pulled it up an old hoopskirt came with it and betsy laughed and threw it away the thing frightened hank who had never seen a hoopskirt before and he kept a good distance away from it  several other objects the shaggy man captured with the hook and drew up but none of these was important  this well seems to have been the dump for all the old rubbish in the country he said letting down the hook once more i guess ive captured everything now nothe hook has caught again help me betsy whatever this thing is its heavy  she ran up and helped him turn the windlass and after much effort a confused mass of copper came in sight  good gracious exclaimed shaggy here is a surprise indeed  what is it inquired betsy clinging to the windlass and panting for breath  for answer the shaggy man grasped the bundle of copper and dumped it upon the ground free of the well then he turned it over with his foot spread it out and to betsys astonishment the thing proved to be a copper man  just as i thought said shaggy looking hard at the object but unless there are two copper men in the world this is the most astonishing thing i ever came across  at this moment the rainbows daughter and the rose princess approached them and polychrome said  what have you found shaggy one  either an old friend or a stranger he replied  oh heres a sign on his back cried betsy who had knelt down to examine the man dear me how funny listen to this  then she read the following words engraved upon the copper plates of the mans body              smith  tinkers   patent doubleaction extraresponsive   thoughtcreating perfecttalking             mechanical man   fitted with our special clockwork attachment   thinks speaks acts and does everything but live   isnt he wonderful exclaimed the princess  yes but heres more said betsy reading from another engraved plate               directions for using    for thinkingwind the clockwork     man under his left arm marked no 1   for speakingwind  the  clockwork     man under his right arm marked no 2   for walking and actionwind clockwork man     in the middle of his back marked no 3    n bthis mechanism is guaranteed to   work perfectly for a thousand years   if hes guaranteed for a thousand years said polychrome he ought to work yet  of course replied shaggy lets wind him up  in order to do this they were obliged to set the copper man upon his feet in an upright position and this was no easy task he was inclined to topple over and had to be propped again and again the girls assisted shaggy and at last tiktok seemed to be balanced and stood alone upon his broad feet  yes said shaggy looking at the copper man carefully this must be indeed my old friend tiktok whom i left ticking merrily in the land of oz but how he came to this lonely place and got into that old well is surely a mystery  if we wind him perhaps he will tell us suggested betsy heres the key hanging to a hook on his back what part of him shall i wind up first  his thoughts of course said polychrome for it requires thought to speak or move intelligently  so betsy wound him under his left arm and at once little flashes of light began to show in the top of his head which was proof that he had begun to think  now then said shaggy wind up his phonograph  whats that she asked  why his talkingmachine his thoughts may be interesting but they dont tell us anything  so betsy wound the copper man under his right arm and then from the interior of his copper body came in jerky tones the words many thanks  hurrah cried shaggy joyfully and he slapped tiktok upon the back in such a hearty manner that the copper man lost his balance and tumbled to the ground in a heap but the clockwork that enabled him to speak had been wound up and he kept saying pickmeup pickmeup pickmeup until they had again raised him and balanced him upon his feet when he added politely many thanks  he wont be selfsupporting until we wind up his action remarked shaggy so betsy wound it as tight as she couldfor the key turned rather hardand then tiktok lifted his feet marched around in a circle and ended by stopping before the group and making them all a low bow  how in the world did you happen to be in that well when i left you safe in oz inquired shaggy  it is a long story replied tiktok but ill tell it in a few words after you had gone in search of your brother ozma saw you wandering in strange lands whenever she looked in her magic picture and she also saw your brother in the nome kings cavern so she sent me to tell you where to find your brother and told me to help you if i could the sorceress glinda the good transported me to this place in the wink of an eye but here i met the nome king himselfold ruggedo who is called in these parts the metal monarch ruggedo knew what i had come for and he was so angry that he threw me down the well after my works ran down i was helpless until you came along and pulled me out again many thanks  this is indeed good news said shaggy i suspected that my brother was the prisoner of ruggedo but now i know it tell us tiktok how shall we get to the nome kings underground cavern  the best way is to walk said tiktok we might crawl or jump or roll over and over until we get there but the best way is to walk  i know but which road shall we take  my machinery isnt made to tell that replied tiktok  there is more than one entrance to the underground cavern said polychrome but old ruggedo has cleverly concealed every opening so that earth dwellers can not intrude in his domain if we find our way underground at all it will be by chance  then said betsy let us select any road haphazard and see where it leads us  that seems sensible declared the princess it may require a lot of time for us to find ruggedo but we have more time than anything else  if you keep me wound up said tiktok i will last a thousand years  then the only question to decide is which way to go added shaggy looking first at one road and then at another  but while they stood hesitating a peculiar sound reached their earsa sound like the tramping of many feet  whats coming cried betsy and then she ran to the lefthand road and glanced along the path why its an army she exclaimed what shall we do hide or run  stand still commanded shaggy im not afraid of an army if they prove to be friendly they can help us if they are enemies ill show them the love magnet     chapter eight  tiktok tackles a tough task   while shaggy and his companions stood huddled in a group at one side the army of oogaboo was approaching along the pathway the tramp of their feet being now and then accompanied by a dismal groan as one of the officers stepped on a sharp stone or knocked his funnybone against his neighbors swordhandle  then out from among the trees marched private files bearing the banner of oogaboo which fluttered from a long pole this pole he stuck in the ground just in front of the well and then he cried in a loud voice  i hereby conquer this territory in the name of queen ann soforth of oogaboo and all the inhabitants of the land i proclaim her slaves  some of the officers now stuck their heads out of the bushes and asked  is the coast clear private files  there is no coast here was the reply but alls well  i hope theres water in it said general cone mustering courage to advance to the well but just then he caught a glimpse of tiktok and shaggy and at once fell upon his knees trembling and frightened and cried out  mercy kind enemies mercy spare us and we will be your slaves forever  the other officers who had now advanced into the clearing likewise fell upon their knees and begged for mercy  files turned around and seeing the strangers for the first time examined them with much curiosity then discovering that three of the party were girls he lifted his cap and made a polite bow  whats all this demanded a harsh voice as queen ann reached the place and beheld her kneeling army  permit us to introduce ourselves replied shaggy stepping forward this is tiktok the clockwork manwho works better than some meat people and here is princess ozga of roseland just now unfortunately exiled from her kingdom of roses i next present polychrome a sky fairy who lost her bow by an accident and cant find her way home the small girl here is betsy bobbin from some unknown earthly paradise called oklahoma and with her you see mr hank a mule with a long tail and a short temper  puh said ann scornfully a pretty lot of vagabonds you are indeed all lost or strayed i suppose and not worth a queens plundering im sorry ive conquered you  but you havent conquered us yet called betsy indignantly  no agreed files that is a fact but if my officers will kindly command me to conquer you i will do so at once after which we can stop arguing and converse more at our ease  the officers had by this time risen from their knees and brushed the dust from their trousers to them the enemy did not look very fierce so the generals and colonels and majors and captains gained courage to face them and began strutting in their most haughty manner  you must understand said ann that i am the queen of oogaboo and this is my invincible army we are busy conquering the world and since you seem to be a part of the world and are obstructing our journey it is necessary for us to conquer youunworthy though you may be of such high honor  thats all right replied shaggy conquer us as often as you like we dont mind  but we wont be anybodys slaves added betsy positively  well see about that retorted the queen angrily advance private files and bind the enemy hand and foot  but private files looked at pretty betsy and fascinating polychrome and the beautiful rose princess and shook his head  it would be impolite and i wont do it he asserted  you must cried ann it is your duty to obey orders  i havent received any orders from my officers objected the private  but the generals now shouted forward and bind the prisoners and the colonels and majors and captains repeated the command yelling it as loud as they could  all this noise annoyed hank who had been eyeing the army of oogaboo with strong disfavor the mule now dashed forward and began backing upon the officers and kicking fierce and dangerous heels at them the attack was so sudden that the officers scattered like dust in a whirlwind dropping their swords as they ran and trying to seek refuge behind the trees and bushes  betsy laughed joyously at the comical rout of the noble army and polychrome danced with glee but ann was furious at this ignoble defeat of her gallant forces by one small mule  private files i command you to do your duty she cried again and then she herself ducked to escape the mules heelsfor hank made no distinction in favor of a lady who was an open enemy betsy grabbed her champion by the forelock however and so held him fast and when the officers saw that the mule was restrained from further attacks they crept fearfully back and picked up their discarded swords  private files seize and bind these prisoners screamed the queen  no said files throwing down his gun and removing the knapsack which was strapped to his back i resign my position as the army of oogaboo i enlisted to fight the enemy and become a hero but if you want some one to bind harmless girls you will have to hire another private  then he walked over to the others and shook hands with shaggy and tiktok  treason shrieked ann and all the officers echoed her cry  nonsense said files ive the right to resign if i want to  indeed you havent retorted the queen if you resign it will break up my army and then i cannot conquer the world she now turned to the officers and said i must ask you to do me a favor i know it is undignified in officers to fight but unless you immediately capture private files and force him to obey my orders there will be no plunder for any of us also it is likely you will all suffer the pangs of hunger and when we meet a powerful foe you are liable to be captured and made slaves  the prospect of this awful fate so frightened the officers that they drew their swords and rushed upon files who stood beside shaggy in a truly ferocious manner the next instant however they halted and again fell upon their knees for there before them was the glistening love magnet held in the hand of the smiling shaggy man and the sight of this magic talisman at once won the heart of every oogabooite even ann saw the love magnet and forgetting all enmity and anger threw herself upon shaggy and embraced him lovingly  quite disconcerted by this unexpected effect of the magnet shaggy disengaged himself from the queens encircling arms and quickly hid the talisman in his pocket the adventurers from oogaboo were now his firm friends and there was no more talk about conquering and binding any of his party  if you insist on conquering anyone said shaggy you may march with me to the underground kingdom of ruggedo to conquer the world as you have set out to do you must conquer everyone under its surface as well as those upon its surface and no one in all the world needs conquering so much as ruggedo  who is he asked ann  the metal monarch king of the nomes  is he rich inquired major stockings in an anxious voice  of course answered shaggy he owns all the metal that lies undergroundgold silver copper brass and tin he has an idea he also owns all the metals above ground for he says all metal was once a part of his kingdom so by conquering the metal monarch you will win all the riches in the world  ah exclaimed general apple heaving a deep sigh that would be plunder worth our while lets conquer him your majesty  the queen looked reproachfully at files who was sitting next to the lovely princess and whispering in her ear  alas said ann i have no longer an army i have plenty of brave officers indeed but no private soldier for them to command therefore i cannot conquer ruggedo and win all his wealth  why dont you make one of your officers the private asked shaggy but at once every officer began to protest and the queen of oogaboo shook her head as she replied  that is impossible a private soldier must be a terrible fighter and my officers are unable to fight they are exceptionally brave in commanding others to fight but could not themselves meet the enemy and conquer  very true your majesty said colonel plum eagerly there are many kinds of bravery and one cannot be expected to possess them all i myself am brave as a lion in all ways until it comes to fighting but then my nature revolts fighting is unkind and liable to be injurious to others so being a gentleman i never fight  nor i shouted each of the other officers  you see said ann how helpless i am had not private files proved himself a traitor and a deserter i would gladly have conquered this ruggedo but an army without a private soldier is like a bee without a stinger  i am not a traitor your majesty protested files i resigned in a proper manner not liking the job but there are plenty of people to take my place why not make shaggy man the private soldier  he might be killed said ann looking tenderly at shaggy for he is mortal and able to die if anything happened to him it would break my heart  it would hurt me worse than that declared shaggy you must admit your majesty that i am commander of this expedition for it is my brother we are seeking rather than plunder but i and my companions would like the assistance of your army and if you help us to conquer ruggedo and to rescue my brother from captivity we will allow you to keep all the gold and jewels and other plunder you may find  this prospect was so tempting that the officers began whispering together and presently colonel cheese said your majesty by combining our brains we have just evolved a most brilliant idea we will make the clockwork man the private soldier  who me asked tiktok not for a single second i cannot fight and you must not forget that it was ruggedo who threw me in the well  at that time you had no gun said polychrome but if you join the army of oogaboo you will carry the gun that mr files used  a soldier must be able to run as well as to fight protested tiktok and if my works run down as they often do i could neither run nor fight  ill keep you wound up tiktok promised betsy  why it isnt a bad idea said shaggy tiktok will make an ideal soldier for nothing can injure him except a sledge hammer and since a private soldier seems to be necessary to this army tiktok is the only one of our party fitted to undertake the job  what must i do asked tiktok  obey orders replied ann when the officers command you to do anything you must do it that is all  and thats enough too said files  do i get a salary inquired tiktok  you get your share of the plunder answered the queen  yes remarked files onehalf of the plunder goes to queen ann the other half is divided among the officers and the private gets the rest  that will be satisfactory said tiktok picking up the gun and examining it wonderingly for he had never before seen such a weapon  then ann strapped the knapsack to tiktoks copper back and said now we are ready to march to ruggedos kingdom and conquer it officers give the command to march  fallin yelled the generals drawing their swords  fallin cried the colonels drawing their swords  fallin shouted the majors drawing their swords  fallin bawled the captains drawing their swords  tiktok looked at them and then around him in surprise  fall in what the well he asked  no said queen ann you must fall in marching order  cannot i march without falling into it asked the clockwork man  shoulder your gun and stand ready to march advised files so tiktok held the gun straight and stood still  what next he asked  the queen turned to shaggy  which road leads to the metal monarchs cavern  we dont know your majesty was the reply  but this is absurd said ann with a frown if we cant get to ruggedo it is certain that we cant conquer him  you are right admitted shaggy but i did not say we could not get to him we have only to discover the way and that was the matter we were considering when you and your magnificent army arrived here  well then get busy and discover it snapped the queen  that was no easy task they all stood looking from one road to another in perplexity the paths radiated from the little clearing like the rays of the midday sun and each path seemed like all the others  files and the rose princess who had by this time become good friends advanced a little way along one of the roads and found that it was bordered by pretty wild flowers  why dont you ask the flowers to tell you the way he said to his companion  the flowers returned the princess surprised at the question  of course said files the fieldflowers must be secondcousins to a rose princess and i believe if you ask them they will tell you  she looked more closely at the flowers there were hundreds of white daisies golden buttercups bluebells and daffodils growing by the roadside and each flowerhead was firmly set upon its slender but stout stem there were even a few wild roses scattered here and there and perhaps it was the sight of these that gave the princess courage to ask the important question  she dropped to her knees facing the flowers and extended both her arms pleadingly toward them  tell me pretty cousins she said in her sweet gentle voice which way will lead us to the kingdom of ruggedo the nome king  at once all the stems bent gracefully to the right and the flower heads nodded oncetwicethrice in that direction  thats it cried files joyfully now we know the way  ozga rose to her feet and looked wonderingly at the fieldflowers which had now resumed their upright position  was it the wind do you think she asked in a low whisper  no indeed replied files there is not a breath of wind stirring but these lovely blossoms are indeed your cousins and answered your question at once as i knew they would     chapter nine  ruggedos rage is rash and reckless   the way taken by the adventurers led up hill and down dale and wound here and there in a fashion that seemed aimless but always it drew nearer to a range of low mountains and files said more than once that he was certain the entrance to ruggedos cavern would be found among these rugged hills  in this he was quite correct far underneath the nearest mountain was a gorgeous chamber hollowed from the solid rock the walls and roof of which glittered with thousands of magnificent jewels here on a throne of virgin gold sat the famous nome king dressed in splendid robes and wearing a superb crown cut from a single bloodred ruby  ruggedo the monarch of all the metals and precious stones of the underground world was a round little man with a flowing white beard a red face bright eyes and a scowl that covered all his forehead one would think to look at him that he ought to be jolly one might think considering his enormous wealth that he ought to be happy but this was not the case the metal monarch was surly and cross because mortals had dug so much treasure out of the earth and kept it above ground where all the power of ruggedo and his nomes was unable to recover it he hated not only the mortals but also the fairies who live upon the earth or above it and instead of being content with the riches he still possessed he was unhappy because he did not own all the gold and jewels in the world  ruggedo had been nodding half asleep in his chair when suddenly he sat upright uttered a roar of rage and began pounding upon a huge gong that stood beside him  the sound filled the vast cavern and penetrated to many caverns beyond where countless thousands of nomes were working at their unending tasks hammering out gold and silver and other metals or melting ores in great furnaces or polishing glittering gems the nomes trembled at the sound of the kings gong and whispered fearfully to one another that something unpleasant was sure to happen but none dared pause in his task  the heavy curtains of clothofgold were pushed aside and kaliko the kings high chamberlain entered the royal presence  whats up your majesty he asked with a wide yawn for he had just wakened  up roared ruggedo stamping his foot viciously those foolish mortals are up thats what and they want to come down  down here inquired kaliko  yes  how do you know continued the chamberlain yawning again  i feel it in my bones said ruggedo i can always feel it when those hateful earthcrawlers draw near to my kingdom i am positive kaliko that mortals are this very minute on their way here to annoy meand i hate mortals more than i do catnip tea  well whats to be done demanded the nome  look through your spyglass and see where the invaders are commanded the king  so kaliko went to a tube in the wall of rock and put his eye to it the tube ran from the cavern up to the side of the mountain and turned several curves and corners but as it was a magic spyglass kaliko was able to see through it just as easily as if it had been straight  hohum said he i see em your majesty  what do they look like inquired the monarch  thats a hard question to answer for a queerer assortment of creatures i never yet beheld replied the nome however such a collection of curiosities may prove dangerous theres a copper man worked by machinery  bah thats only tiktok said ruggedo im not afraid of him why only the other day i met the fellow and threw him down a well  then some one must have pulled him out again said kaliko and theres a little girl  dorothy asked ruggedo jumping up in fear  no some other girl in fact there are several girls of various sizes but dorothy is not with them nor is ozma  thats good exclaimed the king sighing in relief  kaliko still had his eye to the spyglass  i see said he an army of men from oogaboo they are all officers and carry swords and there is a shaggy manwho seems very harmlessand a little donkey with big ears  pooh cried ruggedo snapping his fingers in scorn ive no fear of such a mob as that a dozen of my nomes can destroy them all in a jiffy  im not so sure of that said kaliko the people of oogaboo are hard to destroy and i believe the rose princess is a fairy as for polychrome you know very well that the rainbows daughter cannot be injured by a nome  polychrome is she among them asked the king  yes i have just recognized her  then these people are coming here on no peaceful errand declared ruggedo scowling fiercely in fact no one ever comes here on a peaceful errand i hate everybody and everybody hates me  very true said kaliko  i must in some way prevent these people from reaching my dominions where are they now  just now they are crossing the rubber country your majesty  good are your magnetic rubber wires in working order  i think so replied kaliko is it your royal will that we have some fun with these invaders  it is answered ruggedo i want to teach them a lesson they will never forget  now shaggy had no idea that he was in a rubber country nor had any of his companions they noticed that everything around them was of a dull gray color and that the path upon which they walked was soft and springy yet they had no suspicion that the rocks and trees were rubber and even the path they trod was made of rubber  presently they came to a brook where sparkling water dashed through a deep channel and rushed away between high rocks far down the mountainside across the brook were steppingstones so placed that travelers might easily leap from one to another and in that manner cross the water to the farther bank  tiktok was marching ahead followed by his officers and queen ann after them came betsy bobbin and hank polychrome and shaggy and last of all the rose princess with files the clockwork man saw the stream and the stepping stones and without making a pause placed his foot upon the first stone  the result was astonishing first he sank down in the soft rubber which then rebounded and sent tiktok soaring high in the air where he turned a succession of flipflops and alighted upon a rubber rock far in the rear of the party  general apple did not see tiktok bound so quickly had he disappeared therefore he also stepped upon the stone which you will guess was connected with kalikos magnetic rubber wire and instantly shot upward like an arrow general cone came next and met with a like fate but the others now noticed that something was wrong and with one accord they halted the column and looked back along the path  there was tiktok still bounding from one rubber rock to another each time rising a less distance from the ground and there was general apple bounding away in another direction his threecornered hat jammed over his eyes and his long sword thumping him upon the arms and head as it swung this way and that and there also appeared general cone who had struck a rubber rock headforemost and was so crumpled up that his round body looked more like a bouncingball than the form of a man  betsy laughed merrily at the strange sight and polychrome echoed her laughter but ozga was grave and wondering while queen ann became angry at seeing the chief officers of the army of oogaboo bounding around in so undignified a manner she shouted to them to stop but they were unable to obey even though they would have been glad to do so finally however they all ceased bounding and managed to get upon their feet and rejoin the army  why did you do that demanded ann who seemed greatly provoked  dont ask them why said shaggy earnestly i knew you would ask them why but you ought not to do it the reason is plain those stones are rubber therefore they are not stones those rocks around us are rubber and therefore they are not rocks even this path is not a path its rubber unless we are very careful your majesty we are all likely to get the bounce just as your poor officers and tiktok did  then lets be careful remarked files who was full of wisdom but polychrome wanted to test the quality of the rubber so she began dancing every step sent her higher and higher into the air so that she resembled a big butterfly fluttering lightly presently she made a great bound and bounded way across the stream landing lightly and steadily on the other side  there is no rubber over here she called to them suppose you all try to bound over the stream without touching the steppingstones  ann and her officers were reluctant to undertake such a risky adventure but betsy at once grasped the value of the suggestion and began jumping up and down until she found herself bounding almost as high as polychrome had done then she suddenly leaned forward and the next bound took her easily across the brook where she alighted by the side of the rainbows daughter  come on hank called the girl and the donkey tried to obey he managed to bound pretty high but when he tried to bound across the stream he misjudged the distance and fell with a splash into the middle of the water  heehaw he wailed struggling toward the far bank betsy rushed forward to help him out but when the mule stood safely beside her she was amazed to find he was not wet at all  its dry water said polychrome dipping her hand into the stream and showing how the water fell from it and left it perfectly dry  in that case returned betsy they can all walk through the water  she called to ozga and shaggy to wade across assuring them the water was shallow and would not wet them at once they followed her advice avoiding the rubber stepping stones and made the crossing with ease this encouraged the entire party to wade through the dry water and in a few minutes all had assembled on the bank and renewed their journey along the path that led to the nome kings dominions  when kaliko again looked through his magic spyglass he exclaimed  bad luck your majesty all the invaders have passed the rubber country and now are fast approaching the entrance to your caverns  ruggedo raved and stormed at the news and his anger was so great that several times as he strode up and down his jeweled cavern he paused to kick kaliko upon his shins which were so sensitive that the poor nome howled with pain finally the king said  theres no help for it we must drop these audacious invaders down the hollow tube  kaliko gave a jump at this and looked at his master wonderingly  if you do that your majesty he said you will make tititihoochoo very angry  never mind that retorted ruggedo tititihoochoo lives on the other side of the world so what do i care for his anger  kaliko shuddered and uttered a little groan  remember his terrible powers he pleaded and remember that he warned you the last time you slid people through the hollow tube that if you did it again he would take vengeance upon you  the metal monarch walked up and down in silence thinking deeply  of two dangers said he it is wise to choose the least what do you suppose these invaders want  let the longeared hearer listen to them suggested kaliko  call him here at once commanded ruggedo eagerly  so in a few minutes there entered the cavern a nome with enormous ears who bowed low before the king  strangers are approaching said ruggedo and i wish to know their errand listen carefully to their talk and tell me why they are coming here and what for  the nome bowed again and spread out his great ears swaying them gently up and down and back and forth for half an hour he stood silent in an attitude of listening while both the king and kaliko grew impatient at the delay at last the longeared hearer spoke  shaggy man is coming here to rescue his brother from captivity said he  ha the ugly one exclaimed ruggedo well shaggy man may have his ugly brother for all i care hes too lazy to work and is always getting in my way where is the ugly one now kaliko  the last time your majesty stumbled over the prisoner you commanded me to send him to the metal forest which i did i suppose he is still there  very good the invaders will have a hard time finding the metal forest said the king with a grin of malicious delight for half the time i cant find it myself yet i created the forest and made every tree out of gold and silver so as to keep the precious metals in a safe place and out of the reach of mortals but tell me hearer do the strangers want anything else  yes indeed they do returned the nome the army of oogaboo is determined to capture all the rich metals and rare jewels in your kingdom and the officers and their queen have arranged to divide the spoils and carry them away  when he heard this ruggedo uttered a bellow of rage and began dancing up and down rolling his eyes clicking his teeth together and swinging his arms furiously then in an ecstasy of anger he seized the long ears of the hearer and pulled and twisted them cruelly but kaliko grabbed up the kings sceptre and rapped him over the knuckles with it so that ruggedo let go the ears and began to chase his royal chamberlain around the throne  the hearer took advantage of this opportunity to slip away from the cavern and escape and after the king had tired himself out chasing kaliko he threw himself into his throne and panted for breath while he glared wickedly at his defiant subject  youd better save your strength to fight the enemy suggested kaliko there will be a terrible battle when the army of oogaboo gets here  the army wont get here said the king still coughing and panting ill drop em down the hollow tubeevery man jack and every girl jill of em  and defy tititihoochoo asked kaliko  yes go at once to my chief magician and order him to turn the path toward the hollow tube and to make the tip of the tube invisible so theyll all fall into it  kaliko went away shaking his head for he thought ruggedo was making a great mistake  he found the magician and had the path twisted so that it led directly to the opening of the hollow tube and this opening he made invisible  having obeyed the orders of his master the royal chamberlain went to his private room and began to write letters of recommendation of himself stating that he was an honest man a good servant and a small eater  pretty soon he said to himself i shall have to look for another job for it is certain that ruggedo has ruined himself by this reckless defiance of the mighty tititihoochoo and in seeking a job nothing is so effective as a letter of recommendation     chapter ten  a terrible tumble through a tube   i suppose that polychrome and perhaps queen ann and her army might have been able to dispel the enchantment of ruggedos chief magician had they known that danger lay in their pathway for the rainbows daughter was a fairy and as oogaboo is a part of the land of oz its inhabitants cannot easily be deceived by such common magic as the nome king could command but no one suspected any especial danger until after they had entered ruggedos cavern and so they were journeying along in quite a contented manner when tiktok who marched ahead suddenly disappeared  the officers thought he must have turned a corner so they kept on their way and all of them likewise disappearedone after another queen ann was rather surprised at this and in hastening forward to learn the reason she also vanished from sight  betsy bobbin had tired her feet by walking so she was now riding upon the back of the stout little mule facing backward and talking to shaggy and polychrome who were just behind suddenly hank pitched forward and began falling and betsy would have tumbled over his head had she not grabbed the mules shaggy neck with both arms and held on for dear life  all around was darkness and they were not falling directly downward but seemed to be sliding along a steep incline hanks hoofs were resting upon some smooth substance over which he slid with the swiftness of the wind once betsys heels flew up and struck a similar substance overhead they were indeed descending the hollow tube that led to the other side of the world  stop hankstop cried the girl but hank only uttered a plaintive heehaw for it was impossible for him to obey  after several minutes had passed and no harm had befallen them betsy gained courage she could see nothing at all nor could she hear anything except the rush of air past her ears as they plunged downward along the tube whether she and hank were alone or the others were with them she could not tell but had some one been able to take a flashlight photograph of the tube at that time a most curious picture would have resulted there was tiktok flat upon his back and sliding headforemost down the incline and there were the officers of the army of oogaboo all tangled up in a confused crowd flapping their arms and trying to shield their faces from the clanking swords which swung back and forth during the swift journey and pommeled everyone within their reach now followed queen ann who had struck the tube in a sitting position and went flying along with a dash and abandon that thoroughly bewildered the poor lady who had no idea what had happened to her then a little distance away but unseen by the others in the inky darkness slid betsy and hank while behind them were shaggy and polychrome and finally files and the princess  when first they tumbled into the tube all were too dazed to think clearly but the trip was a long one because the cavity led straight through the earth to a place just opposite the nome kings dominions and long before the adventurers got to the end they had begun to recover their wits  this is awful hank cried betsy in a loud voice and queen ann heard her and called out are you safe betsy  mercy no answered the little girl how could anyone be safe when shes going about sixty miles a minute then after a pause she added but where do you spose were going to your majsty  dont ask her that please dont said shaggy who was not too far away to overhear them and please dont ask me why either  why said betsy  no one can tell where we are going until we get there replied shaggy and then he yelled ouch for polychrome had overtaken him and was now sitting on his head  the rainbows daughter laughed merrily and so infectious was this joyous laugh that betsy echoed it and hank said hee haw in a mild and sympathetic tone of voice  id like to know where and when well arrive just the same exclaimed the little girl  be patient and youll find out my dear said polychrome but isnt this an odd experience here am i whose home is in the skies making a journey through the center of the earthwhere i never expected to be  how do you know were in the center of the earth asked betsy her voice trembling a little through nervousness  why we can t be anywhere else replied polychrome i have often heard of this passage which was once built by a magician who was a great traveler he thought it would save him the bother of going around the earths surface but he tumbled through the tube so fast that he shot out at the other end and hit a star in the sky which at once exploded  the star exploded asked betsy wonderingly  yes the magician hit it so hard  and what became of the magician inquired the girl  no one knows that answered polychrome but i dont think it matters much  it matters a good deal if we also hit the stars when we come out said queen ann with a moan  dont worry advised polychrome i believe the magician was going the other way and probably he went much faster than we are going  its fast enough to suit me remarked shaggy gently removing polychromes heel from his left eye couldnt you manage to fall all by yourself my dear  ill try laughed the rainbows daughter  all this time they were swiftly falling through the tube and it was not so easy for them to talk as you may imagine when you read their words but although they were so helpless and altogether in the dark as to their fate the fact that they were able to converse at all cheered them considerably  files and ozga were also conversing as they clung tightly to one another and the young fellow bravely strove to reassure the princess although he was terribly frightened both on her account and on his own  an hour under such trying circumstances is a very long time and for more than an hour they continued their fearful journey then just as they began to fear the tube would never end tiktok popped out into broad daylight and after making a graceful circle in the air fell with a splash into a great marble fountain  out came the officers in quick succession tumbling heels over head and striking the ground in many undignified attitudes  for the love of sassafras exclaimed a peculiar person who was hoeing pink violets in a garden what can all this mean  for answer queen ann sailed up from the tube took a ride through the air as high as the treetops and alighted squarely on top of the peculiar persons head smashing a jeweled crown over his eyes and tumbling him to the ground  the mule was heavier and had betsy clinging to his back so he did not go so high up fortunately for his little rider he struck the ground upon his four feet betsy was jarred a trifle but not hurt and when she looked around her she saw the queen and the peculiar person struggling together upon the ground where the man was trying to choke ann and she had both hands in his bushy hair and was pulling with all her might some of the officers when they got upon their feet hastened to separate the combatants and sought to restrain the peculiar person so that he could not attack their queen again  by this time shaggy polychrome ozga and files had all arrived and were curiously examining the strange country in which they found themselves and which they knew to be exactly on the opposite side of the world from the place where they had fallen into the tube it was a lovely place indeed and seemed to be the garden of some great prince for through the vistas of trees and shrubbery could be seen the towers of an immense castle but as yet the only inhabitant to greet them was the peculiar person just mentioned who had shaken off the grasp of the officers without effort and was now trying to pull the battered crown from off his eyes  shaggy who was always polite helped him to do this and when the man was free and could see again he looked at his visitors with evident amazement  well well well he exclaimed where did you come from and how did you get here  betsy tried to answer him for queen ann was surly and silent  i cant say exacly where we came from cause i dont know the name of the place said the girl but the way we got here was through the hollow tube  dont call it a hollow tube please exclaimed the peculiar person in an irritated tone of voice if its a tube its sure to be hollow  why asked betsy  because all tubes are made that way but this tube is private property and everyone is forbidden to fall into it  we didnt do it on purpose explained betsy and polychrome added i am quite sure that ruggedo the nome king pushed us down that tube  ha ruggedo did  you say ruggedo cried the man becoming much excited  that is what she said replied shaggy and i believe she is right we were on our way to conquer the nome king when suddenly we fell into the tube  then you are enemies of ruggedo inquired the peculiar person  not exacly enemies said betsy a little puzzled by the question cause we dont know him at all but we started out to conquer him which isnt as friendly as it might be  true agreed the man he looked thoughtfully from one to another of them for a while and then he turned his head over his shoulder and said never mind the fire and pincers my good brothers it will be best to take these strangers to the private citizen  very well tubekins responded a voice deep and powerful that seemed to come out of the air for the speaker was invisible  all our friends gave a jump at this even polychrome was so startled that her gauze draperies fluttered like a banner in a breeze shaggy shook his head and sighed queen ann looked very unhappy the officers clung to each other trembling violently  but soon they gained courage to look more closely at the peculiar person as he was a type of all the inhabitants of this extraordinary land whom they afterward met i will try to tell you what he looked like  his face was beautiful but lacked expression his eyes were large and blue in color and his teeth finely formed and white as snow his hair was black and bushy and seemed inclined to curl at the ends so far no one could find any fault with his appearance he wore a robe of scarlet which did not cover his arms and extended no lower than his bare knees on the bosom of the robe was embroidered a terrible dragons head as horrible to look at as the man was beautiful his arms and legs were left bare and the skin of one arm was bright yellow and the skin of the other arm a vivid green he had one blue leg and one pink one while both his feetwhich showed through the open sandals he worewere jet black  betsy could not decide whether these gorgeous colors were dyes or the natural tints of the skin but while she was thinking it over the man who had been called tubekins said  follow me to the residenceall of you  but just then a voice exclaimed heres another of them tubekins lying in the water of the fountain  gracious cried betsy it must be tiktok and hell drown  water is a bad thing for his clockworks anyway agreed shaggy as with one accord they all started for the fountain but before they could reach it invisible hands raised tiktok from the marble basin and set him upon his feet beside it water dripping from every joint of his copper body  many thathathathanks he said and then his copper jaws clicked together and he could say no more he next made an attempt to walk but after several awkward trials found he could not move his joints  peals of jeering laughter from persons unseen greeted tiktoks failure and the new arrivals in this strange land found it very uncomfortable to realize that there were many creatures around them who were invisible yet could be heard plainly  shall i wind him up asked betsy feeling very sorry for tiktok  i think his machinery is wound but he needs oiling replied shaggy  at once an oilcan appeared before him held on a level with his eyes by some unseen hand shaggy took the can and tried to oil tiktoks joints as if to assist him a strong current of warm air was directed against the copper man which quickly dried him soon he was able to say many thanks quite smoothly and his joints worked fairly well  come commanded tubekins and turning his back upon them he walked up the path toward the castle  shall we go asked queen ann uncertainly but just then she received a shove that almost pitched her forward on her head so she decided to go the officers who hesitated received several energetic kicks but could not see who delivered them therefore they also decidedvery wiselyto go the others followed willingly enough for unless they ventured upon another terrible journey through the tube they must make the best of the unknown country they were in and the best seemed to be to obey orders     chapter eleven  the famous fellowship of fairies   after a short walk through very beautiful gardens they came to the castle and followed tubekins through the entrance and into a great domed chamber where he commanded them to be seated  from the crown which he wore betsy had thought this man must be the king of the country they were in yet after he had seated all the strangers upon benches that were ranged in a semicircle before a high throne tubekins bowed humbly before the vacant throne and in a flash became invisible and disappeared  the hall was an immense place but there seemed to be no one in it beside themselves presently however they heard a low cough near them and here and there was the faint rustling of a robe and a slight patter as of footsteps then suddenly there rang out the clear tone of a bell and at the sound all was changed  gazing around the hall in bewilderment they saw that it was filled with hundreds of men and women all with beautiful faces and staring blue eyes and all wearing scarlet robes and jeweled crowns upon their heads in fact these people seemed exact duplicates of tubekins and it was difficult to find any mark by which to tell them apart  my what a lot of kings and queens whispered betsy to polychrome who sat beside her and appeared much interested in the scene but not a bit worried  it is certainly a strange sight was polychromes reply but i cannot see how there can be more than one king or queen in any one country for were these all rulers no one could tell who was master  one of the kings who stood near and overheard this remark turned to her and said one who is master of himself is always a king if only to himself in this favored land all kings and queens are equal and it is our privilege to bow before one supreme rulerthe private citizen  whos he inquired betsy  as if to answer her the clear tones of the bell again rang out and instantly there appeared seated in the throne the man who was lord and master of all these royal ones this fact was evident when with one accord they fell upon their knees and touched their foreheads to the floor  the private citizen was not unlike the others except that his eyes were black instead of blue and in the centers of the black irises glowed red sparks that seemed like coals of fire but his features were very beautiful and dignified and his manner composed and stately instead of the prevalent scarlet robe he wore one of white and the same dragons head that decorated the others was embroidered upon its bosom  what charge lies against these people tubekins he asked in quiet even tones  they came through the forbidden tube o mighty citizen was the reply  you see it was this way said betsy we were marching to the nome king to conquer him and set shaggys brother free when on a sudden  who are you demanded the private citizen sternly  me oh im betsy bobbin and  who is the leader of this party asked the citizen  sir i am queen ann of oogaboo and  then keep quiet said the citizen who is the leader  no one answered for a moment then general bunn stood up  sit down commanded the citizen i can see that sixteen of you are merely officers and of no account  but we have an army said general clock blusteringly for he didnt like to be told he was of no account  where is your army asked the citizen  its me said tiktok his voice sounding a little rusty im the only private soldier in the party  hearing this the citizen rose and bowed respectfully to the clockwork man  pardon me for not realizing your importance before said he will you oblige me by taking a seat beside me on my throne  tiktok rose and walked over to the throne all the kings and queens making way for him then with clanking steps he mounted the platform and sat on the broad seat beside the citizen  ann was greatly provoked at this mark of favor shown to the humble clockwork man but shaggy seemed much pleased that his old friends importance had been recognized by the ruler of this remarkable country the citizen now began to question tiktok who told in his mechanical voice about shaggys quest of his lost brother and how ozma of oz had sent the clockwork man to assist him and how they had fallen in with queen ann and her people from oogaboo also he told how betsy and hank and polychrome and the rose princess had happened to join their party  and you intended to conquer ruggedo the metal monarch and king of the nomes asked the citizen  yes that seemed the only thing for us to do was tiktoks reply but he was too clever for us when we got close to his cavern he made our path lead to the tube and made the opening invisible so that we all fell into it before we knew it was there it was an easy way to get rid of us and now ruggedo is safe and we are far away in a strange land  the citizen was silent a moment and seemed to be thinking then he said  most noble private soldier i must inform you that by the laws of our country anyone who comes through the forbidden tube must be tortured for nine days and ten nights and then thrown back into the tube but it is wise to disregard laws when they conflict with justice and it seems that you and your followers did not disobey our laws willingly being forced into the tube by ruggedo therefore the nome king is alone to blame and he alone must be punished  that suits me said tiktok but ruggedo is on the other side of the world where he is away out of your reach  the citizen drew himself up proudly  do you imagine anything in the world or upon it can be out of the reach of the great jinjin he asked  oh are you then the great jinjin inquired tiktok  i am  then your name is tititihoochoo  it is  queen ann gave a scream and began to tremble shaggy was so disturbed that he took out a handkerchief and wiped the perspiration from his brow polychrome looked sober and uneasy for the first time while files put his arms around the rose princess as if to protect her as for the officers the name of the great jinjin set them moaning and weeping at a great rate and every one fell upon his knees before the throne begging for mercy betsy was worried at seeing her companions so disturbed but did not know what it was all about only tiktok was unmoved at the discovery  then said he if you are tititihoochoo and think ruggedo is to blame i am sure that something queer will happen to the king of the nomes  i wonder what twill be said betsy  the private citizenotherwise known as tititihoochoo the great jinjinlooked at the little girl steadily  i will presently decide what is to happen to ruggedo said he in a hard stern voice then turning to the throng of kings and queens he continued tiktok has spoken truly for his machinery will not allow him to lie nor will it allow his thoughts to think falsely therefore these people are not our enemies and must be treated with consideration and justice take them to your palaces and entertain them as guests until tomorrow when i command that they be brought again to my residence by then i shall have formed my plans  no sooner had tititihoochoo spoken than he disappeared from sight immediately after most of the kings and queens likewise disappeared but several of them remained visible and approached the strangers with great respect one of the lovely queens said to betsy  i trust you will honor me by being my guest i am erma queen of light  may hank come with me asked the girl  the king of animals will care for your mule was the reply but do not fear for him for he will be treated royally all of your party will be reunited on the morrow  iid like to have some one with me said betsy pleadingly  queen erma looked around and smiled upon polychrome  will the rainbows daughter be an agreeable companion she asked  oh yes exclaimed the girl  so polychrome and betsy became guests of the queen of light while other beautiful kings and queens took charge of the others of the party  the two girls followed erma out of the hall and through the gardens of the residence to a village of pretty dwellings none of these was so large or imposing as the castle of the private citizen but all were handsome enough to be called palacesas in fact they really were     chapter twelve  the lovely lady of light   the palace of the queen of light stood on a little eminence and was a mass of crystal windows surmounted by a vast crystal dome when they entered the portals erma was greeted by six lovely maidens evidently of high degree who at once aroused betsys admiration each bore a wand in her hand tipped with an emblem of light and their costumes were also emblematic of the lights they represented erma introduced them to her guests and each made a graceful and courteous acknowledgment  first was sunlight radiantly beautiful and very fair the second was moonlight a soft dreamy damsel with nutbrown hair next came starlight equally lovely but inclined to be retiring and shy these three were dressed in shimmering robes of silvery white the fourth was daylight a brilliant damsel with laughing eyes and frank manners who wore a variety of colors then came firelight clothed in a fleecy flamecolored robe that wavered around her shapely form in a very attractive manner the sixth maiden electra was the most beautiful of all and betsy thought from the first that both sunlight and daylight regarded electra with envy and were a little jealous of her  but all were cordial in their greetings to the strangers and seemed to regard the queen of light with much affection for they fluttered around her in a flashing radiant group as she led the way to her regal drawingroom  this apartment was richly and cosily furnished the upholstery being of many tints and both betsy and polychrome enjoyed resting themselves upon the downy divans after their strenuous adventures of the day  the queen sat down to chat with her guests who noticed that daylight was the only maiden now seated beside erma the others had retired to another part of the room where they sat modestly with entwined arms and did not intrude themselves at all  the queen told the strangers all about this beautiful land which is one of the chief residences of fairies who minister to the needs of mankind so many important fairies lived there that to avoid rivalry they had elected as their ruler the only important personage in the country who had no duties to mankind to perform and was in effect a private citizen this ruler or jinjin as was his title bore the name of tititihoochoo and the most singular thing about him was that he had no heart but instead of this he possessed a high degree of reason and justice and while he showed no mercy in his judgments he never punished unjustly or without reason to wrongdoers tititihoochoo was as terrible as he was heartless but those who were innocent of evil had nothing to fear from him  all the kings and queens of this fairyland paid reverence to jinjin for as they expected to be obeyed by others they were willing to obey the one in authority over them  the inhabitants of the land of oz had heard many tales of this fearfully just jinjin whose punishments were always equal to the faults committed polychrome also knew of him although this was the first time she had ever seen him face to face but to betsy the story was all new and she was greatly interested in tititihoochoo whom she no longer feared  time sped swiftly during their talk and suddenly betsy noticed that moonlight was sitting beside the queen of light instead of daylight  but tell me please she pleaded why do you all wear a dragons head embroidered on your gowns  ermas pleasant face became grave as she answered  the dragon as you must know was the first living creature ever made therefore the dragon is the oldest and wisest of living things by good fortune the original dragon who still lives is a resident of this land and supplies us with wisdom whenever we are in need of it he is old as the world and remembers everything that has happened since the world was created  did he ever have any children inquired the girl  yes many of them some wandered into other lands where men not understanding them made war upon them but many still reside in this country none however is as wise as the original dragon for whom we have great respect as he was the first resident here we wear the emblem of the dragons head to show that we are the favored people who alone have the right to inhabit this fairyland which in beauty almost equals the fairyland of oz and in power quite surpasses it  i understand about the dragon now said polychrome nodding her lovely head betsy did not quite understand but she was at present interested in observing the changing lights as daylight had given way to moonlight so now starlight sat at the right hand of erma the queen and with her coming a spirit of peace and content seemed to fill the room polychrome being herself a fairy had many questions to ask about the various kings and queens who lived in this faraway secluded place and before erma had finished answering them a rosy glow filled the room and firelight took her place beside the queen  betsy liked firelight but to gaze upon her warm and glowing features made the little girl sleepy and presently she began to nod thereupon erma rose and took betsys hand gently in her own  come said she the feast time has arrived and the feast is spread  thats nice exclaimed the small mortal now that i think of it im awful hungry but praps i cant eat your fairy food  the queen smiled and led her to a doorway as she pushed aside a heavy drapery a flood of silvery light greeted them and betsy saw before her a splendid banquet hall with a table spread with snowy linen and crystal and silver at one side was a broad thronelike seat for erma and beside her now sat the brilliant maid electra polychrome was placed on the queens right hand and betsy upon her left the other five messengers of light now waited upon them and each person was supplied with just the food she liked best polychrome found her dish of dewdrops all fresh and sparkling while betsy was so lavishly served that she decided she had never in her life eaten a dinner half so good  i spose she said to the queen that miss electra is the youngest of all these girls  why do you suppose that inquired erma with a smile  cause electricty is the newest light we know of didnt mr edison discover it  perhaps he was the first mortal to discover it replied the queen but electricity was a part of the world from its creation and therefore my electra is as old as daylight or moonlight and equally beneficent to mortals and fairies alike  betsy was thoughtful for a time then she remarked as she looked at the six messengers of light  we couldnt very well do without any of em could we  erma laughed softly i couldnt im sure she replied and i think mortals would miss any one of my maidens as well daylight cannot take the place of sunlight which gives us strength and energy moonlight is of value when daylight worn out with her long watch retires to rest if the moon in its course is hidden behind the earths rim and my sweet moonlight cannot cheer us starlight takes her place for the skies always lend her power without firelight we should miss much of our warmth and comfort as well as much cheer when the walls of houses encompass us but always when other lights forsake us our glorious electra is ready to flood us with bright rays as queen of light i love all my maidens for i know them to be faithful and true  i love em too declared betsy but sometimes when im real sleepy i can get along without any light at all  are you sleepy now inquired erma for the feast had ended  a little admitted the girl  so electra showed her to a pretty chamber where there was a soft white bed and waited patiently until betsy had undressed and put on a shimmery silken nightrobe that lay beside her pillow then the lightmaid bade her good night and opened the door  when she closed it after her betsy was in darkness in six winks the little girl was fast asleep     chapter thirteen  the jinjins just judgment   all the adventurers were reunited next morning when they were brought from various palaces to the residence of tititihoochoo and ushered into the great hall of state  as before no one was visible except our friends and their escorts until the first bell sounded then in a flash the room was seen to be filled with the beautiful kings and queens of the land the second bell marked the appearance in the throne of the mighty jinjin whose handsome countenance was as composed and expressionless as ever  all bowed low to the ruler their voices softly murmured we greet the private citizen mightiest of rulers whose word is law and whose law is just  tititihoochoo bowed in acknowledgment then looking around the brilliant assemblage and at the little group of adventurers before him he said  an unusual thing has happened inhabitants of other lands than ours who are different from ourselves in many ways have been thrust upon us through the forbidden tube which one of our people foolishly made years ago and was properly punished for his folly but these strangers had no desire to come here and were wickedly thrust into the tube by a cruel king on the other side of the world named ruggedo this king is an immortal but he is not good his magic powers hurt mankind more than they benefit them because he had unjustly kept the shaggy mans brother a prisoner this little band of honest people consisting of both mortals and immortals determined to conquer ruggedo and to punish him fearing they might succeed in this the nome king misled them so that they fell into the tube  now this same ruggedo has been warned by me many times that if ever he used this forbidden tube in any way he would be severely punished i find by referring to the fairy records that this kings servant a nome named kaliko begged his master not to do such a wrong act as to drop these people into the tube and send them tumbling into our country but ruggedo defied me and my orders  therefore these strangers are innocent of any wrong it is only ruggedo who deserves punishment and i will punish him he paused a moment and then continued in the same cold merciless voice  these strangers must return through the tube to their own side of the world but i will make their fall more easy and pleasant than it was before also i shall send with them an instrument of vengeance who in my name will drive ruggedo from his underground caverns take away his magic powers and make him a homeless wanderer on the face of the eartha place he detests  there was a little murmur of horror from the kings and queens at the severity of this punishment but no one uttered a protest for all realized that the sentence was just  in selecting my instrument of vengeance went on tititihoochoo i have realized that this will be an unpleasant mission therefore no one of us who is blameless should be forced to undertake it in this wonderful land it is seldom one is guilty of wrong even in the slightest degree and on examining the records i found no king or queen had erred nor had any among their followers or servants done any wrong but finally i came to the dragon family which we highly respect and then it was that i discovered the error of quox  quox as you well know is a young dragon who has not yet acquired the wisdom of his race because of this lack he has been disrespectful toward his most ancient ancestor the original dragon telling him once to mind his own business and again saying that the ancient one had grown foolish with age we are aware that dragons are not the same as fairies and cannot be altogether guided by our laws yet such disrespect as quox has shown should not be unnoticed by us therefore i have selected quox as my royal instrument of vengeance and he shall go through the tube with these people and inflict upon ruggedo the punishment i have decreed  all had listened quietly to this speech and now the kings and queens bowed gravely to signify their approval of the jinjins judgment  tititihoochoo turned to tubekins  i command you said he to escort these strangers to the tube and see that they all enter it  the king of the tube who had first discovered our friends and brought them to the private citizen stepped forward and bowed as he did so the jinjin and all the kings and queens suddenly disappeared and only tubekins remained visible  all right said betsy with a sigh i dont mind going back so very much cause the jinjin promised to make it easy for us  indeed queen ann and her officers were the only ones who looked solemn and seemed to fear the return journey one thing that bothered ann was her failure to conquer this land of tititihoochoo as they followed their guide through the gardens to the mouth of the tube she said to shaggy  how can i conquer the world if i go away and leave this rich country unconquered  you cant he replied dont ask me why please for if you dont know i cant inform you  why not said ann but shaggy paid no attention to the question  this end of the tube had a silver rim and around it was a gold railing to which was attached a sign that read    if you are out stay there   if you are in dont come out   on a little silver plate just inside the tube was engraved the words     burrowed and built by   hiergargo the magician   in the year of the world   1 9 6 2 5 4 7 8   for his own exclusive uses   he was some builder i must say remarked betsy when she had read the inscription but if he had known about that star i guess hed have spent his time playing solitaire  well what are we waiting for inquired shaggy who was impatient to start  quox replied tubekins but i think i hear him coming  is the young dragon invisible asked ann who had never seen a live dragon and was a little fearful of meeting one  no indeed replied the king of the tube youll see him in a minute but before you part company im sure youll wish he was invisible  is he dangerous then questioned files  not at all but quox tires me dreadfully said tubekins and i prefer his room to his company  at that instant a scraping sound was heard drawing nearer and nearer until from between two big bushes appeared a huge dragon who approached the party nodded his head and said good morning  had quox been at all bashful i am sure he would have felt uncomfortable at the astonished stare of every eye in the groupexcept tubekins of course who was not astonished because he had seen quox so often  betsy had thought a young dragon must be a small dragon yet here was one so enormous that the girl decided he must be full grown if not overgrown his body was a lovely skyblue in color and it was thickly set with glittering silver scales each one as big as a servingtray around his neck was a pink ribbon with a bow just under his left ear and below the ribbon appeared a chain of pearls to which was attached a golden locket about as large around as the end of a bass drum this locket was set with many large and beautiful jewels  the head and face of quox were not especially ugly when you consider that he was a dragon but his eyes were so large that it took him a long time to wink and his teeth seemed very sharp and terrible when they showed which they did whenever the beast smiled also his nostrils were quite large and wide and those who stood near him were liable to smell brimstoneespecially when he breathed out fire as it is the nature of dragons to do to the end of his long tail was attached a big electric light  perhaps the most singular thing about the dragons appearance at this time was the fact that he had a row of seats attached to his back one seat for each member of the party these seats were double with curved backs so that two could sit in them and there were twelve of these double seats all strapped firmly around the dragons thick body and placed one behind the other in a row that extended from his shoulders nearly to his tail  aha exclaimed tubekins i see that tititihoochoo has transformed quox into a carryall  im glad of that said betsy i hope mr dragon you wont mind our riding on your back  not a bit replied quox im in disgrace just now you know and the only way to redeem my good name is to obey the orders of the jinjin if he makes me a beast of burden it is only a part of my punishment and i must bear it like a dragon i dont blame you people at all and i hope youll enjoy the ride hop on please all aboard for the other side of the world  silently they took their places hank sat in the front seat with betsy so that he could rest his front hoofs upon the dragons head behind them were shaggy and polychrome then files and the princess and queen ann and tiktok the officers rode in the rear seats when all had mounted to their places the dragon looked very like one of those sightseeing wagons so common in big citiesonly he had legs instead of wheels  all ready asked quox and when they said they were he crawled to the mouth of the tube and put his head in  goodbye and good luck to you called tubekins but no one thought to reply because just then the dragon slid his great body into the tube and the journey to the other side of the world had begun  at first they went so fast that they could scarcely catch their breaths but presently quox slowed up and said with a sort of cackling laugh  my scales but that is some tumble i think i shall take it easy and fall slower or im likely to get dizzy is it very far to the other side of the world  havent you ever been through this tube before inquired shaggy  never nor has anyone else in our country at least not since i was born  how long ago was that asked betsy  that i was born oh not very long ago im only a mere child if i had not been sent on this journey i would have celebrated my three thousand and fiftysixth birthday next thursday mother was going to make me a birthday cake with three thousand and fiftysix candles on it but now of course there will be no celebration for i fear i shall not get home in time for it  three thousand and fiftysix years cried betsy why i had no idea anything could live that long  my respected ancestor whom i would call a stupid old humbug if i had not reformed is so old that i am a mere baby compared with him said quox he dates from the beginning of the world and insists on telling us stories of things that happened fifty thousand years ago which are of no interest at all to youngsters like me in fact grandpa isnt up to date he lives altogether in the past so i cant see any good reason for his being alive today are you people able to see your way or shall i turn on more light  oh we can see very nicely thank you only theres nothing to see but ourselves answered betsy  this was true the dragons big eyes were like headlights on an automobile and illuminated the tube far ahead of them also he curled his tail upward so that the electric light on the end of it enabled them to see one another quite clearly but the tube itself was only dark metal smooth as glass but exactly the same from one of its ends to the other therefore there was no scenery of interest to beguile the journey  they were now falling so gently that the trip was proving entirely comfortable as the jinjin had promised it would be but this meant a longer journey and the only way they could make time pass was to engage in conversation the dragon seemed a willing and persistent talker and he was of so much interest to them that they encouraged him to chatter his voice was a little gruff but not unpleasant when one became used to it  my only fear said he presently is that this constant sliding over the surface of the tube will dull my claws you see this hole isnt straight down but on a steep slant and so instead of tumbling freely through the air i must skate along the tube fortunately there is a file in my toolkit and if my claws get dull they can be sharpened again  why do you want sharp claws asked betsy  they are my natural weapons and you must not forget that i have been sent to conquer ruggedo  oh you neednt mind about that remarked queen ann in her most haughty manner for when we get to ruggedo i and my invincible army can conquer him without your assistance  very good returned the dragon cheerfully that will save me a lot of botherif you succeed but i think i shall file my claws just the same  he gave a long sigh as he said this and a sheet of flame several feet in length shot from his mouth betsy shuddered and hank said heehaw while some of the officers screamed in terror but the dragon did not notice that he had done anything unusual  is there fire inside of you asked shaggy  of course answered quox what sort of a dragon would i be if my fire went out  what keeps it going betsy inquired  ive no idea i only know its there said quox the fire keeps me alive and enables me to move also to think and speak  ah you are very much like myself said tiktok the only difference is that i move by clockwork while you move by fire  i dont see a particle of likeness between us i must confess retorted quox gruffly you are not a live thing youre a dummy  but i can do things you must admit said tiktok  yes when you are wound up sneered the dragon but if you run down you are helpless  what would happen to you quox if you ran out of gasoline inquired shaggy who did not like this attack upon his friend  i dont use gasoline  well suppose you ran out of fire  whats the use of supposing that asked quox  my greatgreatgreatgrandfather has lived since the world began and he has never once run out of fire to keep him going but i will confide to you that as he gets older he shows more smoke and less fire as for tiktok hes well enough in his way but hes merely copper and the metal monarch knows copper through and through i wouldnt be surprised if ruggedo melted tiktok in one of his furnaces and made copper pennies of him  in that case i would still keep going remarked tiktok calmly  pennies do said betsy regretfully  this is all nonsense said the queen with irritation tiktok is my great armyall but the officersand i believe he will be able to conquer ruggedo with ease what do you think polychrome  you might let him try answered the rainbows daughter with her sweet ringing laugh that sounded like the tinkling of tiny bells and if tiktok fails you have still the big firebreathing dragon to fall back on  ah said the dragon another sheet of flame gushing from his mouth and nostrils its a wise little girl this polychrome anyone would know she is a fairy     chapter fourteen  the longeared hearer learns by listening   during this time ruggedo the metal monarch and king of the nomes was trying to amuse himself in his splendid jeweled cavern it was hard work for ruggedo to find amusement today for all the nomes were behaving well and there was no one to scold or to punish the king had thrown his sceptre at kaliko six times without hitting him once not that kaliko had done anything wrong on the contrary he had obeyed the king in every way but one he would not stand still when commanded to do so and let the heavy sceptre strike him  we can hardly blame kaliko for this and even the cruel ruggedo forgave him for he knew very well that if he mashed his royal chamberlain he could never find another so intelligent and obedient kaliko could make the nomes work when their king could not for the nomes hated ruggedo and there were so many thousands of the quaint little underground people that they could easily have rebelled and defied the king had they dared to do so sometimes when ruggedo abused them worse than usual they grew sullen and threw down their hammers and picks then however hard the king scolded or whipped them they would not work until kaliko came and begged them to for kaliko was one of themselves and was as much abused by the king as any nome in the vast series of caverns  but today all the little people were working industriously at their tasks and ruggedo having nothing to do was greatly bored he sent for the longeared hearer and asked him to listen carefully and report what was going on in the big world  it seems said the hearer after listening for awhile that the women in america have clubs  are there spikes in them asked ruggedo yawning  i cannot hear any spikes your majesty was the reply  then their clubs are not as good as my sceptre what else do you hear  theres a war  bah theres always a war what else  for a time the hearer was silent bending forward and spreading out his big ears to catch the slightest sound then suddenly he said  here is an interesting thing your majesty these people are arguing as to who shall conquer the metal monarch seize his treasure and drive him from his dominions  what people demanded ruggedo sitting up straight in his throne  the ones you threw down the hollow tube  where are they now  in the same tube and coming back this way said the hearer  ruggedo got out of his throne and began to pace up and down the cavern  i wonder what can be done to stop them he mused  well said the hearer if you could turn the tube upside down they would be falling the other way your majesty  ruggedo glared at him wickedly for it was impossible to turn the tube upside down and he believed the hearer was slyly poking fun at him presently he asked  how far away are those people now  about nine thousand three hundred and six miles seventeen furlongs eight feet and four inchesas nearly as i can judge from the sound of their voices replied the hearer  aha then it will be some time before they arrive said ruggedo and when they get here i shall be ready to receive them  he rushed to his gong and pounded upon it so fiercely that kaliko came bounding into the cavern with one shoe off and one shoe on for he was just dressing himself after a swim in the hot bubbling lake of the underground kingdom  kaliko those invaders whom we threw down the tube are coming back again he exclaimed  i thought they would said the royal chamberlain pulling on the other shoe tititihoochoo would not allow them to remain in his kingdom of course and so ive been expecting them back for some time that was a very foolish action of yours rug  what to throw them down the tube  yes tititihoochoo has forbidden us to throw even rubbish into the tube  pooh what do i care for the jinjin asked ruggedo scornfully he never leaves his own kingdom which is on the other side of the world  true but he might send some one through the tube to punish you suggested kaliko  id like to see him do it who could conquer my thousands of nomes  why theyve been conquered before if i remember aright answered kaliko with a grin once i saw you running from a little girl named dorothy and her friends as if you were really afraid  well i was afraid that time admitted the nome king with a deep sigh for dorothy had a yellow hen that laid eggs  the king shuddered as he said eggs and kaliko also shuddered and so did the longeared hearer for eggs are the only things that the nomes greatly dread the reason for this is that eggs belong on the earths surface where birds and fowl of all sorts live and there is something about a hens egg especially that fills a nome with horror if by chance the inside of an egg touches one of these underground people he withers up and blows away and that is the end of himunless he manages quickly to speak a magical word which only a few of the nomes know therefore ruggedo and his followers had very good cause to shudder at the mere mention of eggs  but dorothy said the king is not with this band of invaders nor is the yellow hen as for tititihoochoo he has no means of knowing that we are afraid of eggs  you mustnt be too sure of that kaliko warned him tititihoochoo knows a great many things being a fairy and his powers are far superior to any we can boast  ruggedo shrugged impatiently and turned to the hearer  listen said he and tell me if you hear any eggs coming through the tube  the longeared one listened and then shook his head but kaliko laughed at the king  no one can hear an egg your majesty said he the only way to discover the truth is to look through the magic spyglass  thats it cried the king why didnt i think of it before look at once kaliko  so kaliko went to the spyglass and by uttering a mumbled charm he caused the other end of it to twist around so that it pointed down the opening of the tube then he put his eye to the glass and was able to gaze along all the turns and windings of the magic spyglass and then deep into the tube to where our friends were at that time falling  dear me he exclaimed here comes a dragon  a big one asked ruggedo  a monster he has an electric light on the end of his tail so i can see him very plainly and the other people are all riding upon his back  how about the eggs inquired the king  kaliko looked again  i can see no eggs at all said he but i imagine that the dragon is as dangerous as eggs probably tititihoochoo has sent him here to punish you for dropping those strangers into the forbidden tube i warned you not to do it your majesty  this news made the nome king anxious for a few minutes he paced up and down stroking his long beard and thinking with all his might after this he turned to kaliko and said  all the harm a dragon can do is to scratch with his claws and bite with his teeth  that is not all but its quite enough returned kaliko earnestly on the other hand no one can hurt a dragon because hes the toughest creature alive one flop of his huge tail could smash a hundred nomes to pancakes and with teeth and claws he could tear even you or me into small bits so that it would be almost impossible to put us together again once a few hundred years ago while wandering through some deserted caverns i came upon a small piece of a nome lying on the rocky floor i asked the piece of nome what had happened to it fortunately the mouth was a part of this piecethe mouth and the left eyeso it was able to tell me that a fierce dragon was the cause it had attacked the poor nome and scattered him in every direction and as there was no friend near to collect his pieces and put him together they had been separated for a great many years so you see your majesty it is not in good taste to sneer at a dragon  the king had listened attentively to kaliko said he  it will only be necessary to chain this dragon which tititihoochoo has sent here in order to prevent his reaching us with his claws and teeth  he also breathes flames kaliko reminded him  my nomes are not afraid of fire nor am i said ruggedo  well how about the army of oogaboo  sixteen cowardly officers and tiktok why i could defeat them singlehanded but i wont try to ill summon my army of nomes to drive the invaders out of my territory and if we catch any of them i intend to stick needles into them until they hop with pain  i hope you wont hurt any of the girls said kaliko  ill hurt em all roared the angry metal monarch and that braying mule ill make into hoofsoup and feed it to my nomes that it may add to their strength  why not be good to the strangers and release your prisoner the shaggy mans brother suggested kaliko  never  it may save you a lot of annoyance and you dont want the ugly one  i dont want him thats true but i wont allow anybody to order me around im king of the nomes and im the metal monarch and i shall do as i please and what i please and when i please  with this speech ruggedo threw his sceptre at kalikos head aiming it so well that the royal chamberlain had to fall flat upon the floor in order to escape it but the hearer did not see the sceptre coming and it swept past his head so closely that it broke off the tip of one of his long ears he gave a dreadful yell that quite startled ruggedo and the king was sorry for the accident because those long ears of the hearer were really valuable to him  so the nome king forgot to be angry with kaliko and ordered his chamberlain to summon general guph and the army of nomes and have them properly armed they were then to march to the mouth of the tube where they could seize the travelers as soon as they appeared     chapter fifteen  the dragon defies danger   although the journey through the tube was longer this time than before it was so much more comfortable that none of our friends minded it at all they talked together most of the time and as they found the dragon goodnatured and fond of the sound of his own voice they soon became well acquainted with him and accepted him as a companion  you see said shaggy in his frank way quox is on our side and therefore the dragon is a good fellow if he happened to be an enemy instead of a friend i am sure i should dislike him very much for his breath smells of brimstone he is very conceited and he is so strong and fierce that he would prove a dangerous foe  yes indeed returned quox who had listened to this speech with pleasure i suppose i am about as terrible as any living thing i am glad you find me conceited for that proves i know my good qualities as for my breath smelling of brimstone i really cant help it and i once met a man whose breath smelled of onions which i consider far worse  i dont said betsy i love onions  and i love brimstone declared the dragon so dont let us quarrel over one anothers peculiarities  saying this he breathed a long breath and shot a flame fifty feet from his mouth the brimstone made betsy cough but she remembered about the onions and said nothing  they had no idea how far they had gone through the center of the earth nor when to expect the trip to end at one time the little girl remarked  i wonder when well reach the bottom of this hole and isnt it funny shaggy man that what is the bottom to us now was the top when we fell the other way  what puzzles me said files is that we are able to fall both ways  that announced tiktok is because the world is round  exactly responded shaggy the machinery in your head is in fine working order tiktok you know betsy that there is such a thing as the attraction of gravitation which draws everything toward the center of the earth that is why we fall out of bed and why everything clings to the surface of the earth  then why doesnt everyone go on down to the center of the earth inquired the little girl  i was afraid you were going to ask me that replied shaggy in a sad tone the reason my dear is that the earth is so solid that other solid things cant get through it but when theres a hole as there is in this case we drop right down to the center of the world  why dont we stop there asked betsy  because we go so fast that we acquire speed enough to carry us right up to the other end  i dont understand that and it makes my head ache to try to figure it out she said after some thought one thing draws us to the center and another thing pushes us away from it but  dont ask me why please interrupted the shaggy man if you cant understand it let it go at that  do you understand it she inquired  all the magic isnt in fairyland he said gravely theres lots of magic in all nature and you may see it as well in the united states where you and i once lived as you can here  i never did she replied  because you were so used to it all that you didnt realize it was magic is anything more wonderful than to see a flower grow and blossom or to get light out of the electricity in the air the cows that manufacture milk for us must have machinery fully as remarkable as that in tiktoks copper body and perhaps youve noticed that  and then before shaggy could finish his speech the strong light of day suddenly broke upon them grew brighter and completely enveloped them the dragons claws no longer scraped against the metal tube for he shot into the open air a hundred feet or more and sailed so far away from the slanting hole that when he landed it was on the peak of a mountain and just over the entrance to the many underground caverns of the nome king  some of the officers tumbled off their seats when quox struck the ground but most of the dragons passengers only felt a slight jar all were glad to be on solid earth again and they at once dismounted and began to look about them queerly enough as soon as they had left the dragon the seats that were strapped to the monsters back disappeared and this probably happened because there was no further use for them and because quox looked far more dignified in just his silver scales of course he still wore the forty yards of ribbon around his neck as well as the great locket but these only made him look dressed up as betsy remarked  now the army of nomes had gathered thickly around the mouth of the tube in order to be ready to capture the band of invaders as soon as they popped out there were indeed hundreds of nomes assembled and they were led by guph their most famous general but they did not expect the dragon to fly so high and he shot out of the tube so suddenly that it took them by surprise when the nomes had rubbed the astonishment out of their eyes and regained their wits they discovered the dragon quietly seated on the mountainside far above their heads while the other strangers were standing in a group and calmly looking down upon them  general guph was very angry at the escape which was no ones fault but his own  come down here and be captured he shouted waving his sword at them  come up here and capture usif you dare replied queen ann who was winding up the clockwork of her private soldier so he could fight more briskly  guphs first answer was a roar of rage at the defiance then he turned and issued a command to his nomes these were all armed with sharp spears and with one accord they raised these spears and threw them straight at their foes so that they rushed through the air in a perfect cloud of flying weapons  some damage might have been done had not the dragon quickly crawled before the others his body being so big that it shielded every one of them including hank the spears rattled against the silver scales of quox and then fell harmlessly to the ground they were magic spears of course and all straightway bounded back into the hands of those who had thrown them but even guph could see that it was useless to repeat the attack  it was now queen anns turn to attack so the generals yelled forward march and the colonels and majors and captains repeated the command and the valiant army of oogaboo which seemed to be composed mainly of tiktok marched forward in single column toward the nomes while betsy and polychrome cheered and hank gave a loud heehaw and shaggy shouted hooray and queen ann screamed at em tiktokat em  the nomes did not await the clockwork mans attack but in a twinkling disappeared into the underground caverns they made a great mistake in being so hasty for tiktok had not taken a dozen steps before he stubbed his copper toe on a rock and fell flat to the ground where he cried pick me up pick me up pick me up until shaggy and files ran forward and raised him to his feet again  the dragon chuckled softly to himself as he scratched his left ear with his hind claw but no one was paying much attention to quox just then  it was evident to ann and her officers that there could be no fighting unless the enemy was present and in order to find the enemy they must boldly enter the underground kingdom of the nomes so bold a step demanded a council of war  dont you think id better drop in on ruggedo and obey the orders of the jinjin asked quox  by no means returned queen ann we have already put the army of nomes to flight and all that yet remains is to force our way into those caverns and conquer the nome king and all his people  that seems to me something of a job said the dragon closing his eyes sleepily but go ahead if you like and ill wait here for you dont be in any hurry on my account to one who lives thousands of years the delay of a few days means nothing at all and i shall probably sleep until the time comes for me to act  ann was provoked at this speech  you may as well go back to tititihoochoo now she said for the nome king is as good as conquered already  but quox shook his head no said he ill wait     chapter sixteen  the naughty nome   shaggy man had said nothing during the conversation between queen ann and quox for the simple reason that he did not consider the matter worth an argument safe within his pocket reposed the love magnet which had never failed to win every heart the nomes he knew were not like the heartless roses and therefore could be won to his side as soon as he exhibited the magic talisman  shaggys chief anxiety had been to reach ruggedos kingdom and now that the entrance lay before him he was confident he would be able to rescue his lost brother let ann and the dragon quarrel as to who should conquer the nomes if they liked shaggy would let them try and if they failed he had the means of conquest in his own pocket  but ann was positive she could not fail for she thought her army could do anything so she called the officers together and told them how to act and she also instructed tiktok what to do and what to say  please do not shoot your gun except as a last resort she added for i do not wish to be cruel or to shed any bloodunless it is absolutely necessary  all right replied tiktok but i do not think ruggedo would bleed if i filled him full of holes and put him in a cider press  then the officers fell in line the four generals abreast and then the four colonels and the four majors and the four captains they drew their glittering swords and commanded tiktok to march which he did twice he fell down being tripped by the rough rocks but when he struck the smooth path he got along better into the gloomy mouth of the cavern entrance he stepped without hesitation and after him proudly pranced the officers and queen ann the others held back a little waiting to see what would happen  of course the nome king knew they were coming and was prepared to receive them just within the rocky passage that led to the jeweled throneroom was a deep pit which was usually covered ruggedo had ordered the cover removed and it now stood open scarcely visible in the gloom  the pit was so large around that it nearly filled the passage and there was barely room for one to walk around it by pressing close to the rock walls this tiktok did for his copper eyes saw the pit clearly and he avoided it but the officers marched straight into the hole and tumbled in a heap on the bottom an instant later queen ann also walked into the pit for she had her chin in the air and was careless where she placed her feet then one of the nomes pulled a lever which replaced the cover on the pit and made the officers of oogaboo and their queen fast prisoners  as for tiktok he kept straight on to the cavern where ruggedo sat in his throne and there he faced the nome king and said  i hereby conquer you in the name of queen ann soforth of oogaboo whose army i am and i declare that you are her prisoner  ruggedo laughed at him  where is this famous queen he asked  shell be here in a minute said tiktok perhaps she stopped to tie her shoestring  now see here tiktok began the nome king in a stern voice ive had enough of this nonsense your queen and her officers are all prisoners having fallen into my power so perhaps youll tell me what you mean to do  my orders were to conquer you replied tiktok and my machinery has done the best it knows how to carry out those orders  ruggedo pounded on his gong and kaliko appeared followed closely by general guph  take this copper man into the shops and set him to work hammering gold commanded the king being run by machinery he ought to be a steady worker he ought never to have been made but since he exists i shall hereafter put him to good use  if you try to capture me said tiktok i shall fight  dont do that exclaimed general guph earnestly for it will be useless to resist and you might hurt some one  but tiktok raised his gun and took aim and not knowing what damage the gun might do the nomes were afraid to face it  while he was thus defying the nome king and his high officials betsy bobbin rode calmly into the royal cavern seated upon the back of hank the mule the little girl had grown tired of waiting for something to happen and so had come to see if ruggedo had been conquered  nails and nuggets roared the king how dare you bring that beast here and enter my presence unannounced  there wasnt anybody to announce me replied betsy i guess your folks were all busy are you conquered yet  no shouted the king almost beside himself with rage  then please give me something to eat for im awful hungry said the girl you see this conquering business is a good deal like waiting for a circus parade it takes a long time to get around and dont amount to much anyhow  the nomes were so much astonished at this speech that for a time they could only glare at her silently not finding words to reply the king finally recovered the use of his tongue and said  earthcrawler this insolence to my majesty shall be your deathwarrant you are an ordinary mortal and to stop a mortal from living is so easy a thing to do that i will not keep you waiting half so long as you did for my conquest  id rather you wouldnt stop me from living remarked betsy getting off hanks back and standing beside him and it would be a pretty cheap king who killed a visitor while she was hungry if youll give me something to eat ill talk this killing business over with you afterward only i warn you now that i dont approve of it and never will  her coolness and lack of fear impressed the nome king although he bore an intense hatred toward all mortals  what do you wish to eat he asked gruffly  oh a hamsandwich would do or perhaps a couple of hardboiled eggs  eggs shrieked the three nomes who were present shuddering till their teeth chattered  whats the matter asked betsy wonderingly are eggs as high here as they are at home  guph said the king in an agitated voice turning to his general let us destroy this rash mortal at once seize her and take her to the slimy cave and lock her in  guph glanced at tiktok whose gun was still pointed but just then kaliko stole softly behind the copper man and kicked his kneejoints so that they suddenly bent forward and tumbled tiktok to the floor his gun falling from his grasp  then guph seeing tiktok helpless made a grab at betsy at the same time hanks heels shot out and caught the general just where his belt was buckled he rose into the air swift as a cannonball struck the nome king fairly and flattened his majesty against the wall of rock on the opposite side of the cavern together they fell to the floor in a dazed and crumpled condition seeing which kaliko whispered to betsy  come with mequickand i will save you  she looked into kalikos face inquiringly and thought he seemed honest and goodnatured so she decided to follow him he led her and the mule through several passages and into a small cavern very nicely and comfortably furnished  this is my own room said he but you are quite welcome to use it wait here a minute and ill get you something to eat  when kaliko returned he brought a tray containing some broiled mushrooms a loaf of mineral bread and some petroleumbutter the butter betsy could not eat but the bread was good and the mushrooms delicious  heres the door key said kaliko and youd better lock yourself in  wont you let polychrome and the rose princess come here too she asked  ill see where are they  i dont know i left them outside said betsy  well if you hear three raps on the door open it said kaliko but dont let anyone in unless they give the three raps  all right promised betsy and when kaliko left the cosy cavern she closed and locked the door  in the meantime ann and her officers finding themselves prisoners in the pit had shouted and screamed until they were tired out but no one had come to their assistance it was very dark and damp in the pit and they could not climb out because the walls were higher than their heads and the cover was on the queen was first angry and then annoyed and then discouraged but the officers were only afraid every one of the poor fellows heartily wished he was back in oogaboo caring for his orchard and some were so unhappy that they began to reproach ann for causing them all this trouble and danger  finally the queen sat down on the bottom of the pit and leaned her back against the wall by good luck her sharp elbow touched a secret spring in the wall and a big flat rock swung inward ann fell over backward but the next instant she jumped up and cried to the others  a passage a passage follow me my brave men and we may yet escape  then she began to crawl through the passage which was as dark and dank as the pit and the officers followed her in single file they crawled and they crawled and they kept on crawling for the passage was not big enough to allow them to stand upright it turned this way and twisted that sometimes like a corkscrew and sometimes zigzag but seldom ran for long in a straight line  it will never endnever moaned the officers who were rubbing all the skin off their knees on the rough rocks  it must end retorted ann courageously or it never would have been made we dont know where it will lead us to but any place is better than that loathsome pit  so she crawled on and the officers crawled on and while they were crawling through this awful underground passage polychrome and shaggy and files and the rose princess who were standing outside the entrance to ruggedos domains were wondering what had become of them     chapter seventeen  a tragic transformation   dont let us worry said shaggy to his companions for it may take the queen some time to conquer the metal monarch as tiktok has to do everything in his slow mechanical way  do you suppose they are likely to fail asked the rose princess  i do indeed replied shaggy this nome king is really a powerful fellow and has a legion of nomes to assist him whereas our bold queen commands a clockwork man and a band of fainthearted officers  she ought to have let quox do the conquering said polychrome dancing lightly upon a point of rock and fluttering her beautiful draperies but perhaps the dragon was wise to let her go first for when she fails to conquer ruggedo she may become more modest in her ambitions  where is the dragon now inquired ozga  up there on the rocks replied files look my dear you may see him from here he said he would take a little nap while we were mixing up with ruggedo and he added that after we had gotten into trouble he would wake up and conquer the nome king in a jiffy as his master the jinjin has ordered him to do  quox means well said shaggy but i do not think we shall need his services for just as soon as i am satisfied that queen ann and her army have failed to conquer ruggedo i shall enter the caverns and show the king my love magnet that he cannot resist therefore the conquest will be made with ease  this speech of shaggy mans was overheard by the longeared hearer who was at that moment standing by ruggedos side for when the king and guph had recovered from hanks kick and had picked themselves up their first act was to turn tiktok on his back and put a heavy diamond on top of him so that he could not get up again then they carefully put his gun in a corner of the cavern and the king sent guph to fetch the longeared hearer  the hearer was still angry at ruggedo for breaking his ear but he acknowledged the nome king to be his master and was ready to obey his commands therefore he repeated shaggys speech to the king who at once realized that his kingdom was in grave danger for ruggedo knew of the love magnet and its powers and was horrified at the thought that shaggy might show him the magic talisman and turn all the hatred in his heart into love ruggedo was proud of his hatred and abhorred love of any sort   really said he id rather he conquered and lose my wealth and my kingdom than gaze at that awful love magnet what can i do to prevent the shaggy man from taking it out of his pocket  kaliko returned to the cavern in time to overhear this question and being a loyal nome and eager to serve his king he answered by saying  if we can manage to bind the shaggy mans arms tight to his body he could not get the love magnet out of his pocket  true cried the king in delight at this easy solution of the problem get at once a dozen nomes with ropes and place them in the passage where they can seize and bind shaggy as soon as he enters  this kaliko did and meanwhile the watchers outside the entrance were growing more and more uneasy about their friends  i dont worry so much about the oogaboo people said polychrome who had grown sober with waiting and perhaps a little nervous for they could not be killed even though ruggedo might cause them much suffering and perhaps destroy them utterly but we should not have allowed betsy and hank to go alone into the caverns the little girl is mortal and possesses no magic powers whatever so if ruggedo captures her she will be wholly at his mercy  that is indeed true replied shaggy i wouldnt like to have anything happen to dear little betsy so i believe ill go in right away and put an end to all this worry  we may as well go with you asserted files for by means of the love magnet you can soon bring the nome king to reason  so it was decided to wait no longer shaggy walked through the entrance first and after him came the others they had no thought of danger to themselves and shaggy who was going along with his hands thrust into his pockets was much surprised when a rope shot out from the darkness and twined around his body pinning down his arms so securely that he could not even withdraw his hands from the pockets then appeared several grinning nomes who speedily tied knots in the ropes and then led the prisoner along the passage to the cavern no attention was paid to the others but files and the princess followed on after shaggy determined not to desert their friend and hoping that an opportunity might arise to rescue him  as for polychrome as soon as she saw that trouble had overtaken shaggy she turned and ran lightly back through the passage and out of the entrance then she easily leaped from rock to rock until she paused beside the great dragon who lay fast asleep  wake up quox she cried it is time for you to act  but quox did not wake up he lay as one in a trance absolutely motionless with his enormous eyes tight closed the eyelids had big silver scales on them like all the rest of his body  polychrome might have thought quox was dead had she not known that dragons do not die easily or had she not observed his huge body swelling as he breathed she picked up a piece of rock and pounded against his eyelids with it saying  wake up quoxwake up but he would not waken  dear me how unfortunate sighed the lovely rainbows daughter i wonder what is the best and surest way to waken a dragon all our friends may be captured and destroyed while this great beast lies asleep  she walked around quox two or three times trying to discover some tender place on his body where a thump or a punch might be felt but he lay extended along the rocks with his chin flat upon the ground and his legs drawn underneath his body and all that one could see was his thick skyblue skinthicker than that of a rhinocerosand his silver scales  then despairing at last of wakening the beast and worried over the fate of her friends polychrome again ran down to the entrance and hurried along the passage into the nome kings cavern  here she found ruggedo lolling in his throne and smoking a long pipe beside him stood general guph and kaliko and ranged before the king were the rose princess files and the shaggy man tiktok still lay upon the floor weighted down by the big diamond  ruggedo was now in a more contented frame of mind one by one he had met the invaders and easily captured them the dreaded love magnet was indeed in shaggys pocket only a few feet away from the king but shaggy was powerless to show it and unless ruggedos eyes beheld the talisman it could not affect him as for betsy bobbin and her mule he believed kaliko had placed them in the slimy cave while ann and her officers he thought safely imprisoned in the pit ruggedo had no fear of files or ozga but to be on the safe side he had ordered golden handcuffs placed upon their wrists these did not cause them any great annoyance but prevented them from making an attack had they been inclined to do so  the nome king thinking himself wholly master of the situation was laughing and jeering at his prisoners when polychrome exquisitely beautiful and dancing like a ray of light entered the cavern  oho cried the king a rainbow under ground eh and then he stared hard at polychrome and still harder and then he sat up and pulled the wrinkles out of his robe and arranged his whiskers on my word said he you are a very captivating creature moreover i perceive you are a fairy  i am polychrome the rainbows daughter she said proudly  well replied ruggedo i like you the others i hate i hate everybodybut you wouldnt you like to live always in this beautiful cavern polychrome see the jewels that stud the walls have every tint and color of your rainbowand they are not so elusive ill have fresh dewdrops gathered for your feasting every day and you shall be queen of all my nomes and pull kalikos nose whenever you like  no thank you laughed polychrome my home is in the sky and im only on a visit to this solid sordid earth but tell me ruggedo why my friends have been wound with cords and bound with chains  they threatened me answered ruggedo the fools did not know how powerful i am  then since they are now helpless why not release them and send them back to the earths surface  because i hate em and mean to make em suffer for their invasion but ill make a bargain with you sweet polly remain here and live with me and ill set all these people free you shall be my daughter or my wife or my aunt or grandmotherwhichever you likeonly stay here to brighten my gloomy kingdom and make me happy  polychrome looked at him wonderingly then she turned to shaggy and asked  are you sure he hasnt seen the love magnet  im positive answered shaggy but you seem to be something of a love magnet yourself polychrome  she laughed again and said to ruggedo not even to rescue my friends would i live in your kingdom nor could i endure for long the society of such a wicked monster as you  you forget retorted the king scowling darkly that you also are in my power  not so ruggedo the rainbows daughter is beyond the reach of your spite or malice  seize her suddenly shouted the king and general guph sprang forward to obey polychrome stood quite still yet when guph attempted to clutch her his hands met in air and now the rainbows daughter was in another part of the room as smiling and composed as before  several times guph endeavored to capture her and ruggedo even came down from his throne to assist his general but never could they lay hands upon the lovely sky fairy who flitted here and there with the swiftness of light and constantly defied them with her merry laughter as she evaded their efforts  so after a time they abandoned the chase and ruggedo returned to his throne and wiped the perspiration from his face with a finelywoven handkerchief of clothofgold  well said polychrome what do you intend to do now  im going to have some fun to repay me for all my bother replied the nome king then he said to kaliko summon the executioners  kaliko at once withdrew and presently returned with a score of nomes all of whom were nearly as evil looking as their hated master they bore great golden pincers and prods of silver and clamps and chains and various wickedlooking instruments all made of precious metals and set with diamonds and rubies  now pang said ruggedo addressing the leader of the executioners fetch the army of oogaboo and their queen from the pit and torture them here in my presenceas well as in the presence of their friends it will be great sport  i hear your majesty and i obey your majesty answered pang and went with his nomes into the passage in a few minutes he returned and bowed to ruggedo  theyre all gone said he  gone exclaimed the nome king gone where  they left no address your majesty but they are not in the pit  picks and puddles roared the king who took the cover off  no one said pang the cover was there but the prisoners were not under it  in that case snarled the king trying to control his disappointment go to the slimy cave and fetch hither the girl and the donkey and while we are torturing them kaliko must take a hundred nomes and search for the escaped prisonersthe queen of oogaboo and her officers if he does not find them i will torture kaliko  kaliko went away looking sad and disturbed for he knew the king was cruel and unjust enough to carry out this threat pang and the executioners also went away in another direction but when they came back betsy bobbin was not with them nor was hank  there is no one in the slimy cave your majesty reported pang  jumping jellycakes screamed the king another escape are you sure you found the right cave  there is but one slimy cave and there is no one in it returned pang positively  ruggedo was beginning to be alarmed as well as angry however these disappointments but made him the more vindictive and he cast an evil look at the other prisoners and said  never mind the girl and the donkey here are four at least who cannot escape my vengeance let me see i believe ill change my mind about tiktok have the gold crucible heated to a white seething heat and then well dump the copper man into it and melt him up  but your majesty protested kaliko who had returned to the room after sending a hundred nomes to search for the oogaboo people you must remember that tiktok is a very curious and interesting machine it would be a shame to deprive the world of such a clever contrivance  say another word and youll go into the furnace with him roared the king im getting tired of you kaliko and the first thing you know ill turn you into a potato and make saratogachips of you the next to consider he added more mildly is the shaggy man as he owns the love magnet i think ill transform him into a dove and then we can practice shooting at him with tiktoks gun now this is a very interesting ceremony and i beg you all to watch me closely and see that ive nothing up my sleeve  he came out of his throne to stand before the shaggy man and then he waved his hands palms downward in seven semicircles over his victims head saying in a low but clear tone of voice the magic wugwa    adi edi idi odi udi ooioo   idu ido idi ide ida woo  the effect of this wellknown sorcery was instantaneous instead of the shaggy man a pretty dove lay fluttering upon the floor its wings confined by tiny cords wound around them ruggedo gave an order to pang who cut the cords with a pair of scissors being freed the dove quickly flew upward and alighted on the shoulder of the rose princess who stroked it tenderly  very good very good cried ruggedo rubbing his hands gleefully together one enemy is out of my way and now for the others  perhaps my readers should be warned not to attempt the above transformation for although the exact magical formula has been described it is unlawful in all civilized countries for anyone to transform a person into a dove by muttering the words ruggedo used there were no laws to prevent the nome king from performing this transformation but if it should be attempted in any other country and the magic worked the magician would be severely punished  when polychrome saw shaggy man transformed into a dove and realized that ruggedo was about do something as dreadful to the princess and files and that tiktok would soon be melted in a crucible she turned and ran from the cavern through the passage and back to the place where quox lay asleep     chapter eighteen  a clever conquest   the great dragon still had his eyes closed and was even snoring in a manner that resembled distant thunder but polychrome was now desperate because any further delay meant the destruction of her friends she seized the pearl necklace to which was attached the great locket and jerked it with all her strength  the result was encouraging quox stopped snoring and his eyelids flickered so polychrome jerked againand againtill slowly the great lids raised and the dragon looked at her steadily said he in a sleepy tone  whats the matter little rainbow  come quick exclaimed polychrome ruggedo has captured all our friends and is about to destroy them  well well said quox i suspected that would happen step a little out of my path my dear and ill make a rush for the nome kings cavern  she fell back a few steps and quox raised himself on his stout legs whisked his long tail and in an instant had slid down the rocks and made a dive through the entrance  along the passage he swept nearly filling it with his immense body and now he poked his head into the jeweled cavern of ruggedo  but the king had long since made arrangements to capture the dragon whenever he might appear no sooner did quox stick his head into the room than a thick chain fell from above and encircled his neck then the ends of the chain were drawn tightfor in an adjoining cavern a thousand nomes were pulling on themand so the dragon could advance no further toward the king he could not use his teeth or his claws and as his body was still in the passage he had not even room to strike his foes with his terrible tail  ruggedo was delighted with the success of his stratagem he had just transformed the rose princess into a fiddle and was about to transform files into a fiddle bow when the dragon appeared to interrupt him so he called out  welcome my dear quox to my royal entertainment since you are here you shall witness some very neat magic and after i have finished with files and tiktok i mean to transform you into a tiny lizardone of the chameleon sortand you shall live in my cavern and amuse me  pardon me for contradicting your majesty returned quox in a quiet voice but i dont believe youll perform any more magic  eh why not asked the king in surprise  theres a reason said quox do you see this ribbon around my neck  yes and im astonished that a dignified dragon should wear such a silly thing  do you see it plainly persisted the dragon with a little chuckle of amusement  i do declared ruggedo  then you no longer possess any magical powers and are as helpless as a clam asserted quox my great master tititihoochoo the jinjin enchanted this ribbon in such a way that whenever your majesty looked upon it all knowledge of magic would desert you instantly nor will any magical formula you can remember ever perform your bidding  pooh i dont believe a word of it cried ruggedo half frightened nevertheless then he turned toward files and tried to transform him into a fiddle bow but he could not remember the right words or the right pass of the hands and after several trials he finally gave up the attempt  by this time the nome king was so alarmed that he was secretly shaking in his shoes  i told you not to anger tititihoochoo grumbled kaliko and now you see the result of your disobedience  ruggedo promptly threw his sceptre at his royal chamberlain who dodged it with his usual cleverness and then he said with an attempt to swagger  never mind i dont need magic to enable me to destroy these invaders fire and the sword will do the business and i am still king of the nomes and lord and master of my underground kingdom  again i beg to differ with your majesty said quox the great jinjin commands you to depart instantly from this kingdom and seek the earths surface where you will wander for all time to come without a home or country without a friend or follower and without any more riches than you can carry with you in your pockets the great jinjin is so generous that he will allow you to fill your pockets with jewels or gold but you must take nothing more  ruggedo now stared at the dragon in amazement  does tititihoochoo condemn me to such a fate he asked in a hoarse voice  he does said quox  and just for throwing a few strangers down the forbidden tube  just for that repeated quox in a stern gruff voice  well i wont do it and your crazy old jinjin cant make me do it either declared ruggedo i intend to remain here king of the nomes until the end of the world and i defy your tititihoochoo and all his fairiesas well as his clumsy messenger whom i have been obliged to chain up  the dragon smiled again but it was not the sort of smile that made ruggedo feel very happy instead there was something so cold and merciless in the dragons expression that the condemned nome king trembled and was sick at heart  there was little comfort for ruggedo in the fact that the dragon was now chained although he had boasted of it he glared at the immense head of quox as if fascinated and there was fear in the old kings eyes as he watched his enemys movements  for the dragon was now moving not abruptly but as if he had something to do and was about to do it very deliberately he raised one claw touched the catch of the great jeweled locket that was suspended around his neck and at once it opened wide  nothing much happened at first half a dozen hens eggs rolled out upon the floor and then the locket closed with a sharp click but the effect upon the nomes of this simple thing was astounding general guph kaliko pang and his band of executioners were all standing close to the door that led to the vast series of underground caverns which constituted the dominions of the nomes and as soon as they saw the eggs they raised a chorus of frantic screams and rushed through the door slamming it in ruggedos face and placing a heavy bronze bar across it  ruggedo dancing with terror and uttering loud cries now leaped upon the seat of his throne to escape the eggs which had rolled steadily toward him perhaps these eggs sent by the wise and crafty tititihoochoo were in some way enchanted for they all rolled directly after ruggedo and when they reached the throne where he had taken refuge they began rolling up the legs to the seat  this was too much for the king to bear his horror of eggs was real and absolute and he made a leap from the throne to the center of the room and then ran to a far corner  the eggs followed rolling slowly but steadily in his direction ruggedo threw his sceptre at them and then his ruby crown and then he drew off his heavy golden sandals and hurled these at the advancing eggs but the eggs dodged every missile and continued to draw nearer the king stood trembling his eyes staring in terror until they were but half a yard distant then with an agile leap he jumped clear over them and made a rush for the passage that led to the outer entrance  of course the dragon was in his way being chained in the passage with his head in the cavern but when he saw the king making toward him he crouched as low as he could and dropped his chin to the floor leaving a small space between his body and the roof of the passage  ruggedo did not hesitate an instant impelled by fear he leaped to the dragons nose and then scrambled to his back where he succeeded in squeezing himself through the opening after the head was passed there was more room and he slid along the dragons scales to his tail and then ran as fast as his legs would carry him to the entrance not pausing here so great was his fright the king dashed on down the mountain path but before he had gone very far he stumbled and fell  when he picked himself up he observed that no one was following him and while he recovered his breath he happened to think of the decree of the jinjinthat he should be driven from his kingdom and made a wanderer on the face of the earth well here he was driven from his cavern in truth driven by those dreadful eggs but he would go back and defy them he would not submit to losing his precious kingdom and his tyrannical powers all because tititihoochoo had said he must  so although still afraid ruggedo nerved himself to creep back along the path to the entrance and when he arrived there he saw the six eggs lying in a row just before the arched opening  at first he paused a safe distance away to consider the case for the eggs were now motionless while he was wondering what could be done he remembered there was a magical charm which would destroy eggs and render them harmless to nomes there were nine passes to be made and six verses of incantation to be recited but ruggedo knew them all now that he had ample time to be exact he carefully went through the entire ceremony  but nothing happened the eggs did not disappear as he had expected so he repeated the charm a second time when that also failed he remembered with a moan of despair that his magic power had been taken away from him and in the future he could do no more than any common mortal  and there were the eggs forever barring him from the kingdom which he had ruled so long with absolute sway he threw rocks at them but could not hit a single egg he raved and scolded and tore his hair and beard and danced in helpless passion but that did nothing to avert the just judgment of the jinjin which ruggedos own evil deeds had brought upon him  from this time on he was an outcasta wanderer upon the face of the earthand he had even forgotten to fill his pockets with gold and jewels before he fled from his former kingdom     chapter nineteen  king kaliko   after the king had made good his escape files said to the dragon in a sad voice  alas why did you not come before because you were sleeping instead of conquering the lovely rose princess has become a fiddle without a bow while poor shaggy sits there a cooing dove  dont worry replied quox tititihoochoo knows his business and i have my orders from the great jinjin himself bring the fiddle here and touch it lightly to my pink ribbon  files obeyed and at the moment of contact with the ribbon the nome kings charm was broken and the rose princess herself stood before them as sweet and smiling as ever  the dove perched on the back of the throne had seen and heard all this so without being told what to do it flew straight to the dragon and alighted on the ribbon next instant shaggy was himself again and quox said to him grumblingly  please get off my left toe shaggy man and be more particular where you step  i beg your pardon replied shaggy very glad to resume his natural form then he ran to lift the heavy diamond off tiktoks chest and to assist the clockwork man to his feet  many thanks said tiktok where is the wicked king who wanted to melt me in a crucible  he has gone and gone for good answered polychrome who had managed to squeeze into the room beside the dragon and had witnessed the occurrences with much interest but i wonder where betsy bobbin and hank can be and if any harm has befallen them  we must search the cavern until we find them declared shaggy but when he went to the door leading to the other caverns he found it shut and barred  ive a pretty strong push in my forehead said quox and i believe i can break down that door even though its made of solid gold  but you are a prisoner and the chains that hold you are fastened in some other room so that we cannot release you files said anxiously  oh never mind that returned the dragon i have remained a prisoner only because i wished to be one and with this he stepped forward and burst the stout chains as easily as if they had been threads  but when he tried to push in the heavy metal door even his mighty strength failed and after several attempts he gave it up and squatted himself in a corner to think of a better way  ill open the door asserted tiktok and going to the kings big gong he pounded upon it until the noise was almost deafening  kaliko in the next cavern was wondering what had happened to ruggedo and if he had escaped the eggs and outwitted the dragon but when he heard the sound of the gong which had so often called him into the kings presence he decided that ruggedo had been victorious so he took away the bar threw open the door and entered the royal cavern  great was his astonishment to find the king gone and the enchantments removed from the princess and shaggy but the eggs were also gone and so kaliko advanced to the dragon whom he knew to be tititihoochoos messenger and bowed humbly before the beast  what is your will he inquired  where is betsy demanded the dragon  safe in my own private room said kaliko  go and get her commanded quox  so kaliko went to betsys room and gave three raps upon the door the little girl had been asleep but she heard the raps and opened the door  you may come out now said kaliko the king has fled in disgrace and your friends are asking for you  so betsy and hank returned with the royal chamberlain to the throne cavern where she was received with great joy by her friends they told her what had happened to ruggedo and she told them how kind kaliko had been to her quox did not have much to say until the conversation was ended but then he turned to kaliko and asked  do you suppose you could rule your nomes better than ruggedo has done  me stammered the chamberlain greatly surprised by the question well i couldnt be a worse king im sure  would the nomes obey you inquired the dragon  of course said kaliko they like me better than ever they did ruggedo  then hereafter you shall be the metal monarch king of the nomes and tititihoochoo expects you to rule your kingdom wisely and well said quox  hooray cried betsy im glad of that king kaliko i salute your majesty and wish you joy in your gloomy old kingdom  we all wish him joy said polychrome and then the others made haste to congratulate the new king  will you release my dear brother asked shaggy  the ugly one very willingly replied kaliko i begged ruggedo long ago to send him away but he would not do so i also offered to help your brother to escape but he would not go  hes so conscientious said shaggy highly pleased all of our family have noble natures but is my dear brother well he added anxiously  he eats and sleeps very steadily replied the new king  i hope he doesnt work too hard said shaggy  he doesnt work at all in fact there is nothing he can do in these dominions as well as our nomes whose numbers are so great that it worries us to keep them all busy so your brother has only to amuse himself  why its more like visiting than being a prisoner asserted betsy  not exactly returned kaliko a prisoner cannot go where or when he pleases and is not his own master  where is my brother now inquired shaggy  in the metal forest  where is that  the metal forest is in the great domed cavern the largest in all our dominions replied kaliko it is almost like being out of doors it is so big and ruggedo made the wonderful forest to amuse himself as well as to tire out his hardworking nomes all the trees are gold and silver and the ground is strewn with precious stones so it is a sort of treasury  let us go there at once and rescue my dear brother pleaded shaggy earnestly  kaliko hesitated  i dont believe i can find the way said he ruggedo made three secret passages to the metal forest but he changes the location of these passages every week so that no one can get to the metal forest without his permission however if we look sharp we may be able to discover one of these secret ways  that reminds me to ask what has become of queen ann and the officers of oogaboo said files  im sure i cant say replied kaliko  do you suppose ruggedo destroyed them  oh no im quite sure he didnt they fell into the big pit in the passage and we put the cover on to keep them there but when the executioners went to look for them they had all disappeared from the pit and we could find no trace of them  thats funny remarked betsy thoughtfully i dont believe ann knew any magic or shed have worked it before but to disappear like that seems like magic now doesnt it  they agreed that it did but no one could explain the mystery  however said shaggy they are gone that is certain so we cannot help them or be helped by them and the important thing just now is to rescue my dear brother from captivity  why do they call him the ugly one asked betsy  i do not know confessed shaggy i can not remember his looks very well it is so long since i have seen him but all of our family are noted for their handsome faces  betsy laughed and shaggy seemed rather hurt but polychrome relieved his embarrassment by saying softly one can be ugly in looks but lovely in disposition  our first task said shaggy a little comforted by this remark is to find one of those secret passages to the metal forest  true agreed kaliko so i think i will assemble the chief nomes of my kingdom in this throne room and tell them that i am their new king then i can ask them to assist us in searching for the secret passages  thats a good idea said the dragon who seemed to be getting sleepy again  kaliko went to the big gong and pounded on it just as ruggedo used to do but no one answered the summons  of course not said he jumping up from the throne where he had seated himself that is my call and i am still the royal chamberlain and will be until i appoint another in my place  so he ran out of the room and found guph and told him to answer the summons of the kings gong having returned to the royal cavern kaliko first pounded the gong and then sat in the throne wearing ruggedos discarded ruby crown and holding in his hand the sceptre which ruggedo had so often thrown at his head  when guph entered he was amazed  better get out of that throne before old ruggedo comes back he said warningly  he isnt coming back and i am now the king of the nomes in his stead announced kaliko  all of which is quite true asserted the dragon and all of those who stood around the throne bowed respectfully to the new king  seeing this guph also bowed for he was glad to be rid of such a hard master as ruggedo then kaliko in quite a kingly way informed guph that he was appointed the royal chamberlain and promised not to throw the sceptre at his head unless he deserved it  all this being pleasantly arranged the new chamberlain went away to tell the news to all the nomes of the underground kingdom every one of whom would be delighted with the change in kings     chapter twenty  quox quietly quits   when the chief nomes assembled before their new king they joyfully saluted him and promised to obey his commands but when kaliko questioned them none knew the way to the metal forest although all had assisted in its making so the king instructed them to search carefully for one of the passages and to bring him the news as soon as they had found it  meantime quox had managed to back out of the rocky corridor and so regain the open air and his old station on the mountainside and there he lay upon the rocks sound asleep until the next day the others of the party were all given as good rooms as the caverns of the nomes afforded for king kaliko felt that he was indebted to them for his promotion and was anxious to be as hospitable as he could  much wonderment had been caused by the absolute disappearance of the sixteen officers of oogaboo and their queen not a nome had seen them nor were they discovered during the search for the passages leading to the metal forest perhaps no one was unhappy over their loss but all were curious to know what had become of them  on the next day when our friends went to visit the dragon quox said to them i must now bid you goodbye for my mission here is finished and i must depart for the other side of the world where i belong  will you go through the tube again asked betsy  to be sure but it will be a lonely trip this time with no one to talk to and i cannot invite any of you to go with me therefore as soon as i slide into the hole i shall go to sleep and when i pop out at the other end i will wake up at home  they thanked the dragon for befriending them and wished him a pleasant journey also they sent their thanks to the great jinjin whose just condemnation of ruggedo had served their interests so well then quox yawned and stretched himself and ambled over to the tube into which he slid headforemost and disappeared  they really felt as if they had lost a friend for the dragon had been both kind and sociable during their brief acquaintance with him but they knew it was his duty to return to his own country so they went back to the caverns to renew the search for the hidden passages that led to the forest but for three days all efforts to find them proved in vain  it was polychromes custom to go every day to the mountain and watch for her father the rainbow for she was growing tired with wandering upon the earth and longed to rejoin her sisters in their sky palaces and on the third day while she sat motionless upon a point of rock whom should she see slyly creeping up the mountain but ruggedo  the former king looked very forlorn his clothes were soiled and torn and he had no sandals upon his feet or hat upon his head having left his crown and sceptre behind when he fled the old nome no longer seemed kingly but more like a beggerman  several times had ruggedo crept up to the mouth of the caverns only to find the six eggs still on guard he knew quite well that he must accept his fate and become a homeless wanderer but his chief regret now was that he had neglected to fill his pockets with gold and jewels he was aware that a wanderer with wealth at his command would fare much better than one who was a pauper so he still loitered around the caverns wherein he knew so much treasure was stored hoping for a chance to fill his pockets  that was how he came to recollect the metal forest  aha said he to himself i alone know the way to that forest and once there i can fill my pockets with the finest jewels in all the world  he glanced at his pockets and was grieved to find them so small perhaps they might be enlarged so that they would hold more he knew of a poor woman who lived in a cottage at the foot of the mountain so he went to her and begged her to sew pockets all over his robe paying her with the gift of a diamond ring which he had worn upon his finger the woman was delighted to possess so valuable a ring and she sewed as many pockets on ruggedos robe as she possibly could  then he returned up the mountain and after gazing cautiously around to make sure he was not observed he touched a spring in a rock and it swung slowly backward disclosing a broad passageway this he entered swinging the rock in place behind him  however ruggedo had failed to look as carefully as he might have done for polychrome was seated only a little distance off and her clear eyes marked exactly the manner in which ruggedo had released the hidden spring so she rose and hurried into the cavern where she told kaliko and her friends of her discovery  ive no doubt that that is a way to the metal forest exclaimed shaggy come let us follow ruggedo at once and rescue my poor brother  they agreed to this and king kaliko called together a band of nomes to assist them by carrying torches to light their way  the metal forest has a brilliant light of its own said he but the passage across the valley is likely to be dark  polychrome easily found the rock and touched the spring so in less than an hour after ruggedo had entered they were all in the passage and following swiftly after the former king  he means to rob the forest im sure said kaliko but he will find he is no longer of any account in this kingdom and i will have my nomes throw him out  then please throw him as hard as you can said betsy for he deserves it i dont mind an honest outanout enemy who fights square but changing girls into fiddles and ordering em put into slimy caves is mean and tricky and ruggedo doesnt deserve any sympathy but youll have to let him take as much treasure as he can get in his pockets kaliko  yes the jinjin said so but we wont miss it much there is more treasure in the metal forest than a million nomes could carry in their pockets  it was not difficult to walk through this passage especially when the torches lighted the way so they made good progress but it proved to be a long distance and betsy had tired herself with walking and was seated upon the back of the mule when the passage made a sharp turn and a wonderful and glorious light burst upon them the next moment they were all standing upon the edge of the marvelous metal forest  it lay under another mountain and occupied a great domed cavern the roof of which was higher than a church steeple in this space the industrious nomes had built during many years of labor the most beautiful forest in the world the treestrunks branches and leaveswere all of solid gold while the bushes and underbrush were formed of filigree silver virgin pure the trees towered as high as natural live oaks do and were of exquisite workmanship  on the ground were thickly strewn precious gems of every hue and size while here and there among the trees were paths pebbled with cut diamonds of the clearest water taken all together more treasure was gathered in this metal forest than is contained in all the rest of the worldif we except the land of oz where perhaps its value is equalled in the famous emerald city  our friends were so amazed at the sight that for a while they stood gazing in silent wonder then shaggy exclaimed  my brother my dear lost brother is he indeed a prisoner in this place  yes replied kaliko the ugly one has been here for two or three years to my positive knowledge  but what could he find to eat inquired betsy its an awfully swell place to live in but one cant breakfast on rubies and dimonds or even gold  one doesnt need to my dear kaliko assured her the metal forest does not fill all of this great cavern by any means beyond these gold and silver trees are other trees of the real sort which bear foods very nice to eat let us walk in that direction for i am quite sure we will find shaggys brother in that part of the cavern rather than in this  so they began to tramp over the diamondpebbled paths and at every step they were more and more bewildered by the wondrous beauty of the golden trees with their glittering foliage  suddenly they heard a scream jewels scattered in every direction as some one hidden among the bushes scampered away before them then a loud voice cried halt and there was the sound of a struggle     chapter twentyone  a bashful brother   with fast beating hearts they all rushed forward and beyond a group of stately metal trees came full upon a most astonishing scene  there was ruggedo in the hands of the officers of oogaboo a dozen of whom were clinging to the old nome and holding him fast in spite of his efforts to escape there also was queen ann looking grimly upon the scene of strife but when she observed her former companions approaching she turned away in a shamefaced manner  for ann and her officers were indeed a sight to behold her majestys clothing once so rich and gorgeous was now worn and torn into shreds by her long crawl through the tunnel which by the way had led her directly into the metal forest it was indeed one of the three secret passages and by far the most difficult of the three ann had not only torn her pretty skirt and jacket but her crown had become bent and battered and even her shoes were so cut and slashed that they were ready to fall from her feet  the officers had fared somewhat worse than their leader for holes were worn in the knees of their trousers while sharp points of rock in the roof and sides of the tunnel had made rags of every inch of their once brilliant uniforms a more tattered and woeful army never came out of a battle than these harmless victims of the rocky passage but it had seemed their only means of escape from the cruel nome king so they had crawled on regardless of their sufferings  when they reached the metal forest their eyes beheld more plunder than they had ever dreamed of yet they were prisoners in this huge dome and could not escape with the riches heaped about them perhaps a more unhappy and homesick lot of conquerors never existed than this band from oogaboo  after several days of wandering in their marvelous prison they were frightened by the discovery that ruggedo had come among them rendered desperate by their sad condition the officers exhibited courage for the first time since they left home and ignorant of the fact that ruggedo was no longer king of the nomes they threw themselves upon him and had just succeeded in capturing him when their fellow adventurers reached the spot  goodness gracious cried betsy what has happened to you all  ann came forward to greet them sorrowful and indignant  we were obliged to escape from the pit through a small tunnel which was lined with sharp and jagged rocks said she and not only was our clothing torn to rags but our flesh is so bruised and sore that we are stiff and lame in every joint to add to our troubles we find we are still prisoners but now that we have succeeded in capturing the wicked metal monarch we shall force him to grant us our liberty  ruggedo is no longer metal monarch or king of the nomes files informed her he has been deposed and cast out of his kingdom by quox but here is the new king whose name is kaliko and i am pleased to assure your majesty that he is our friend  glad to meet your majesty im sure said kaliko bowing as courteously as if the queen still wore splendid raiment  the officers having heard this explanation now set ruggedo free but as he had no place to go he stood by and faced his former servant who was now king in his place in a humble and pleading manner  what are you doing here asked kaliko sternly  why i was promised as much treasure as i could carry in my pockets replied ruggedo so i came here to get it not wishing to disturb your majesty  you were commanded to leave the country of the nomes forever declared kaliko  i know and ill go as soon as i have filled my pockets said ruggedo meekly  then fill them and be gone returned the new king  ruggedo obeyed stooping down he began gathering up jewels by the handful and stuffing them into his many pockets they were heavy things these diamonds and rubies and emeralds and amethysts and the like so before long ruggedo was staggering with the weight he bore while the pockets were not yet filled when he could no longer stoop over without falling betsy and polychrome and the rose princess came to his assistance picking up the finest gems and tucking them into his pockets  at last these were all filled and ruggedo presented a comical sight for surely no man ever before had so many pockets or any at all filled with such a choice collection of precious stones he neglected to thank the young ladies for their kindness but gave them a surly nod of farewell and staggered down the path by the way he had come they let him depart in silence for with all he had taken the masses of jewels upon the ground seemed scarcely to have been disturbed so numerous were they also they hoped they had seen the last of the degraded king  im awful glad hes gone said betsy sighing deeply if he doesnt get reckless and spend his wealth foolishly hes got enough to start a bank when he gets to oklahoma  but my brothermy dear brother where is he inquired shaggy anxiously have you seen him queen ann  what does your brother look like asked the queen  shaggy hesitated to reply but betsy said hes called the ugly one perhaps youll know him by that  the only person we have seen in this cavern said ann has run away from us whenever we approached him he hides over yonder among the trees that are not gold and we have never been able to catch sight of his face so i can not tell whether he is ugly or not  that must be my dear brother exclaimed shaggy  yes it must be assented kaliko no one else inhabits this splendid dome so there can be no mistake  but why does he hide among those green trees instead of enjoying all these glittery golden ones asked betsy  because he finds food among the natural trees replied kaliko and i remember that he has built a little house there to sleep in as for these glittery golden trees i will admit they are very pretty at first sight one cannot fail to admire them as well as the rich jewels scattered beneath them but if one has to look at them always they become pretty tame  i believe that is true declared shaggy my dear brother is very wise to prefer real trees to the imitation ones but come let us go there and find him  shaggy started for the green grove at once and the others followed him being curious to witness the final rescue of his longsought longlost brother  not far from the edge of the grove they came upon a small hut cleverly made of twigs and golden branches woven together as they approached the place they caught a glimpse of a form that darted into the hut and slammed the door tight shut after him  shaggy man ran to the door and cried aloud  brother brother  who calls demanded a sad hollow voice from within  it is shaggyyour own loving brotherwho has been searching for you a long time and has now come to rescue you  too late replied the gloomy voice no one can rescue me now  oh but you are mistaken about that said shaggy there is a new king of the nomes named kaliko in ruggedos place and he has promised you shall go free  free i dare not go free said the ugly one in a voice of despair  why not brother asked shaggy anxiously  do you know what they have done to me came the answer through the closed door  no tell me brother what have they done  when ruggedo first captured me i was very handsome dont you remember shaggy  not very well brother you were so young when i left home but i remember that mother thought you were beautiful  she was right i am sure she was right wailed the prisoner but ruggedo wanted to injure meto make me ugly in the eyes of all the worldso he performed a wicked enchantment i went to bed beautifulor you might say handsometo be very modest i will merely claim that i was goodlookingand i wakened the next morning the homeliest man in all the world i am so repulsive that when i look in a mirror i frighten myself  poor brother said shaggy softly and all the others were silent from sympathy  i was so ashamed of my looks continued the voice of shaggys brother that i tried to hide but the cruel king ruggedo forced me to appear before all the legion of nomes to whom he said behold the ugly one but when the nomes saw my face they all fell to laughing and jeering which prevented them from working at their tasks seeing this ruggedo became angry and pushed me into a tunnel closing the rock entrance so that i could not get out i followed the length of the tunnel until i reached this huge dome where the marvelous metal forest stands and here i have remained ever since  poor brother repeated shaggy but i beg you now to come forth and face us who are your friends none here will laugh or jeer however unhandsome you may be  no indeed they all added pleadingly  but the ugly one refused the invitation  i cannot said he indeed i cannot face strangers ugly as i am  shaggy man turned to the group surrounding him  what shall i do he asked in sorrowful tones i cannot leave my dear brother here and he refuses to come out of that house and face us  ill tell you replied betsy let him put on a mask  the very idea i was seeking exclaimed shaggy joyfully and then he called out brother put a mask over your face and then none of us can see what your features are like  i have no mask answered the ugly one  look here said betsy he can use my handkerchief  shaggy looked at the little square of cloth and shook his head  it isnt big enough he objected im sure it isnt big enough to hide a mans face but he can use mine  saying this he took from his pocket his own handkerchief and went to the door of the hut  here my brother he called take this handkerchief and make a mask of it i will also pass you my knife so that you may cut holes for the eyes and then you must tie it over your face  the door slowly opened just far enough for the ugly one to thrust out his hand and take the handkerchief and the knife then it closed again  dont forget a hole for your nose cried betsy you must breathe you know  for a time there was silence queen ann and her army sat down upon the ground to rest betsy sat on hanks back polychrome danced lightly up and down the jeweled paths while files and the princess wandered through the groves arm in arm tiktok who never tired stood motionless  by and by a noise sounded from within the hut  are you ready asked shaggy  yes brother came the reply and the door was thrown open to allow the ugly one to step forth  betsy might have laughed aloud had she not remembered how sensitive to ridicule shaggys brother was for the handkerchief with which he had masked his features was a red one covered with big white polka dots in this two holes had been cutin front of the eyeswhile two smaller ones before the nostrils allowed the man to breathe freely the cloth was then tightly drawn over the ugly ones face and knotted at the back of his neck  he was dressed in clothes that had once been good but now were sadly worn and frayed his silk stockings had holes in them and his shoes were stubtoed and needed blackening but what can you expect whispered betsy when the poor man has been a prisoner for so many years  shaggy had darted forward and embraced his newly found brother with both his arms the brother also embraced shaggy who then led him forward and introduced him to all the assembled company  this is the new nome king he said when he came to kaliko he is our friend and has granted you your freedom  that is a kindly deed replied ugly in a sad voice but i dread to go back to the world in this direful condition unless i remain forever masked my dreadful face would curdle all the milk and stop all the clocks  cant the enchantment be broken in some way inquired betsy  shaggy looked anxiously at kaliko who shook his head  i am sure i cant break the enchantment he said ruggedo was fond of magic and learned a good many enchantments that we nomes know nothing of  perhaps ruggedo himself might break his own enchantment suggested ann but unfortunately we have allowed the old king to escape  never mind my dear brother said shaggy consolingly i am very happy to have found you again although i may never see your face so let us make the most of this joyful reunion  the ugly one was affected to tears by this tender speech and the tears began to wet the red handkerchief so shaggy gently wiped them away with his coat sleeve     chapter twentytwo  kindly kisses   wont you be dreadful sorry to leave this lovely place betsy asked the ugly one  no indeed said he jewels and gold are cold and heartless things and i am sure i would presently have died of loneliness had i not found the natural forest at the edge of the artificial one anyhow without these real trees i should soon have starved to death  betsy looked around at the quaint trees  i dont just understand that she admitted what could you find to eat here  the best food in the world ugly answered do you see that grove at your left he added pointing it out well such trees as those do not grow in your country or in any other place but this cavern i have named them hotel trees because they bear a certain kind of table dhote fruit called threecourse nuts  thats funny said betsy what are the threecourse nuts like  something like cocoanuts to look at explained the ugly one all you have to do is to pick one of them and then sit down and eat your dinner you first unscrew the top part and find a cupfull of good soup after youve eaten that you unscrew the middle part and find a hollow filled with meat and potatoes vegetables and a fine salad eat that and unscrew the next section and you come to the dessert in the bottom of the nut that is pie and cake cheese and crackers and nuts and raisins the threecourse nuts are not all exactly alike in flavor or in contents but they are all good and in each one may be found a complete threecourse dinner  but how about breakfasts inquired betsy  why there are breakfast trees for that which grow over there at the right they bear nuts like the others only the nuts contain coffee or chocolate instead of soup oatmeal instead of meatandpotatoes and fruits instead of dessert sad as has been my life in this wonderful prison i must admit that no one could live more luxuriously in the best hotel in the world than i have lived here but i will be glad to get into the open air again and see the good old sun and the silvery moon and the soft green grass and the flowers that are kissed by the morning dew ah how much more lovely are those blessed things than the glitter of gems or the cold gleam of gold  of course said betsy i once knew a little boy who wanted to catch the measles because all the little boys in his neighborhood but him had em and he was really unhappy cause he couldnt catch em try as he would so im pretty certain that the things we want and cant have are not good for us isnt that true shaggy  not always my dear he gravely replied if we didnt want anything we would never get anything good or bad i think our longings are natural and if we act as nature prompts us we cant go far wrong  for my part said queen ann i think the world would be a dreary place without the gold and jewels  all things are good in their way said shaggy but we may have too much of any good thing and i have noticed that the value of anything depends upon how scarce it is and how difficult it is to obtain  pardon me for interrupting you said king kaliko coming to their side but now that we have rescued shaggys brother i would like to return to my royal cavern being the king of the nomes it is my duty to look after my restless subjects and see that they behave themselves  so they all turned and began walking through the metal forest to the other side of the great domed cave where they had first entered it shaggy and his brother walked side by side and both seemed rejoiced that they were together after their long separation betsy didnt dare look at the polka dot handkerchief for fear she would laugh aloud so she walked behind the two brothers and led hank by holding fast to his left ear  when at last they reached the place where the passage led to the outer world queen ann said in a hesitating way that was unusual with her  i have not conquered this nome country nor do i expect to do so but i would like to gather a few of these pretty jewels before i leave this place  help yourself maam said king kaliko and at once the officers of the army took advantage of his royal permission and began filling their pockets while ann tied a lot of diamonds in a big handkerchief  this accomplished they all entered the passage the nomes going first to light the way with their torches they had not proceeded far when betsy exclaimed  why there are jewels here too  all eyes were turned upon the ground and they found a regular trail of jewels strewn along the rock floor  this is queer said kaliko much surprised i must send some of my nomes to gather up these gems and replace them in the metal forest where they belong i wonder how they came to be here  all the way along the passage they found this trail of jewels but when they neared the end the mystery was explained for there squatted upon the floor with his back to the rock wall sat old ruggedo puffing and blowing as if he was all tired out then they realized it was he who had scattered the jewels from his many pockets which one by one had burst with the weight of their contents as he had stumbled along the passage  but i dont mind said ruggedo with a deep sigh i now realize that i could not have carried such a weighty load very far even had i managed to escape from this passage with it the woman who sewed the pockets on my robe used poor thread for which i shall thank her  have you any jewels left inquired betsy  he glanced into some of the remaining pockets  a few said he but they will be sufficient to supply my wants and i no longer have any desire to be rich if some of you will kindly help me to rise ill get out of here and leave you for i know you all despise me and prefer my room to my company  shaggy and kaliko raised the old king to his feet when he was confronted by shaggys brother whom he now noticed for the first time the queer and unexpected appearance of the ugly one so startled ruggedo that he gave a wild cry and began to tremble as if he had seen a ghost  whwhwho is this he faltered  i am that helpless prisoner whom your cruel magic transformed from a handsome man into an ugly one answered shaggys brother in a voice of stern reproach  really ruggedo said betsy you ought to be ashamed of that mean trick  i am my dear admitted ruggedo who was now as meek and humble as formerly he had been cruel and vindictive  then returned the girl youd better do some more magic and give the poor man his own face again  i wish i could answered the old king but you must remember that tititihoochoo has deprived me of all my magic powers however i never took the trouble to learn just how to break the charm i cast over shaggys brother for i intended he should always remain ugly  every charm remarked pretty polychrome has its antidote and if you knew this charm of ugliness ruggedo you must have known how to dispel it  he shook his head  if i did iive forgotten he stammered regretfully  try to think pleaded shaggy anxiously please try to think  ruggedo ruffled his hair with both hands sighed slapped his chest rubbed his ear and stared stupidly around the group  ive a faint recollection that there was one thing that would break the charm said he but misfortune has so addled my brain that i cant remember what it was  see here ruggedo said betsy sharply weve treated you pretty well so far but we wont stand for any nonsense and if you know whats good for yourself youll think of that charm  why he demanded turning to look wonderingly at the little girl  because it means so much to shaggys brother hes dreadfully ashamed of himself the way he is now and youre to blame for it fact is ruggedo youve done so much wickedness in your life that it wont hurt you to do a kind act now  ruggedo blinked at her and sighed again and then tried very hard to think  i seem to remember dimly said he that a certain kind of a kiss will break the charm of ugliness  what kind of a kiss  what kind why it wasit wasit was either the kiss of a mortal maid ororthe kiss of a mortal maid who had once been a fairy oror the kiss of one who is still a fairy i cant remember which but of course no maid mortal or fairy would ever consent to kiss a person so uglyso dreadfully fearfully terribly uglyas shaggys brother  im not so sure of that said betsy with admirable courage im a mortal maid and if it is my kiss that will break this awful charm iill do it  oh you really couldnt protested ugly i would be obliged to remove my mask and when you saw my face nothing could induce you to kiss me generous as you are  well as for that said the little girl i neednt see your face at all heres my plan you stay in this dark passage and well send away the nomes with their torches then youll take off the handkerchief and iill kiss you  this is awfully kind of you betsy said shaggy gratefully  well it surely wont kill me she replied and if it makes you and your brother happy im willing to take some chances  so kaliko ordered the torchbearers to leave the passage which they did by going through the rock opening queen ann and her army also went out but the others were so interested in betsys experiment that they remained grouped at the mouth of the passageway when the big rock swung into place closing tight the opening they were left in total darkness  now then called betsy in a cheerful voice have you got that handkerchief off your face ugly  yes he replied  well where are you then she asked reaching out her arms  here said he  youll have to stoop down you know  he found her hands and clasping them in his own stooped until his face was near to that of the little girl the others heard a clear smacking kiss and then betsy exclaimed  there ive done it and it didnt hurt a bit  tell me dear brother is the charm broken asked shaggy  i do not know was the reply it may be or it may not be i cannot tell  has anyone a match inquired betsy  i have several said shaggy  then let ruggedo strike one of them and look at your brothers face while we all turn our backs ruggedo made your brother ugly so i guess he can stand the horror of looking at him if the charm isnt broken  agreeing to this ruggedo took the match and lighted it he gave one look and then blew out the match  ugly as ever he said with a shudder so it wasnt the kiss of a mortal maid after all  let me try proposed the rose princess in her sweet voice i am a mortal maid who was once a fairy perhaps my kiss will break the charm  files did not wholly approve of this but he was too generous to interfere so the rose princess felt her way through the darkness to shaggys brother and kissed him  ruggedo struck another match while they all turned away  no announced the former king that didnt break the charm either it must be the kiss of a fairy that is requiredor else my memory has failed me altogether  polly said betsy pleadingly wont you try  of course i will answered polychrome with a merry laugh ive never kissed a mortal man in all the thousands of years i have existed but ill do it to please our faithful shaggy man whose unselfish affection for his ugly brother deserves to be rewarded  even as polychrome was speaking she tripped lightly to the side of the ugly one and quickly touched his cheek with her lips  oh thank youthank you he fervently cried ive changed this time i know i can feel it im different shaggydear shaggyi am myself again  files who was near the opening touched the spring that released the big rock and it suddenly swung backward and let in a flood of daylight  everyone stood motionless staring hard at shaggys brother who no longer masked by the polkadot handkerchief met their gaze with a glad smile  well said shaggy man breaking the silence at last and drawing a long deep breath of satisfaction you are no longer the ugly one my dear brother but to be entirely frank with you the face that belongs to you is no more handsome than it ought to be  i think hes rather good looking remarked betsy gazing at the man critically  in comparison with what he was said king kaliko he is really beautiful you who never beheld his ugliness may not understand that but it was my misfortune to look at the ugly one many times and i say again that in comparison with what he was the man is now beautiful  all right returned betsy briskly well take your word for it kaliko and now let us get out of this tunnel and into the world again     chapter twentythree  ruggedo reforms   it did not take them long to regain the royal cavern of the nome king where kaliko ordered served to them the nicest refreshments the place afforded  ruggedo had come trailing along after the rest of the party and while no one paid any attention to the old king they did not offer any objection to his presence or command him to leave them he looked fearfully to see if the eggs were still guarding the entrance but they had now disappeared so he crept into the cavern after the others and humbly squatted down in a corner of the room  there betsy discovered him all of the little girls companions were now so happy at the success of shaggys quest for his brother and the laughter and merriment seemed so general that betsys heart softened toward the friendless old man who had once been their bitter enemy and she carried to him some of the food and drink ruggedos eyes filled with tears at this unexpected kindness he took the childs hand in his own and pressed it gratefully  look here kaliko said betsy addressing the new king whats the use of being hard on ruggedo all his magic power is gone so he cant do any more harm and im sure hes sorry he acted so badly to everybody  are you asked kaliko looking down at his former master  i am said ruggedo the girl speaks truly im sorry and im harmless i dont want to wander through the wide world on top of the ground for im a nome no nome can ever be happy any place but underground  that being the case said kaliko i will let you stay here as long as you behave yourself but if you try to act badly again i shall drive you out as tititihoochoo has commanded and youll have to wander  never fear ill behave promised ruggedo it is hard work being a king and harder still to be a good king but now that i am a common nome i am sure i can lead a blameless life  they were all pleased to hear this and to know that ruggedo had really reformed  i hope hell keep his word whispered betsy to shaggy but if he gets bad again we will be far away from the nome kingdom and kaliko will have to tend to the old nome himself  polychrome had been a little restless during the last hour or two the lovely daughter of the rainbow knew that she had now done all in her power to assist her earth friends and so she began to long for her sky home  i think she said after listening intently that it is beginning to rain the rain king is my uncle you know and perhaps he has read my thoughts and is going to help me anyway i must take a look at the sky and make sure  so she jumped up and ran through the passage to the outer entrance and they all followed after her and grouped themselves on a ledge of the mountainside sure enough dark clouds had filled the sky and a slow drizzling rain had set in  it cant last for long said shaggy looking upward and when it stops we shall lose the sweet little fairy we have learned to love alas he continued after a moment the clouds are already breaking in the west andseeisnt that the rainbow coming  betsy didnt look at the sky she looked at polychrome whose happy smiling face surely foretold the coming of her father to take her to the cloud palaces a moment later a gleam of sunshine flooded the mountain and a gorgeous rainbow appeared  with a cry of gladness polychrome sprang upon a point of rock and held out her arms straightway the rainbow descended until its end was at her very feet when with a graceful leap she sprang upon it and was at once clasped in the arms of her radiant sisters the daughters of the rainbow but polychrome released herself to lean over the edge of the glowing arch and nod and smile and throw a dozen kisses to her late comrades  goodbye she called and they all shouted goodbye in return and waved their hands to their pretty friend  slowly the magnificent bow lifted and melted into the sky until the eyes of the earnest watchers saw only fleecy clouds flitting across the blue  im dreadful sorry to see polychrome go said betsy who felt like crying but i spose shell be a good deal happier with her sisters in the sky palaces  to be sure returned shaggy nodding gravely its her home you know and those poor wanderers who like ourselves have no home can realize what that means to her  once said betsy i too had a home now ive onlyonlydear old hank  she twined her arms around her shaggy friend who was not human and he said heehaw in a tone that showed he understood her mood and the shaggy friend who was human stroked the childs head tenderly and said youre wrong about that betsy dear i will never desert you  nor i exclaimed shaggys brother in earnest tones  the little girl looked up at them gratefully and her eyes smiled through their tears  all right she said its raining again so lets go back into the cavern  rather soberly for all loved polychrome and would miss her they reentered the dominions of the nome king     chapter twentyfour  dorothy is delighted   well said queen ann when all were again seated in kalikos royal cavern i wonder what we shall do next if i could find my way back to oogaboo id take my army home at once for im sick and tired of these dreadful hardships  dont you want to conquer the world asked betsy  no ive changed my mind about that admitted the queen the world is too big for one person to conquer and i was happier with my own people in oogaboo i wishoh how earnestly i wishthat i was back there this minute  so do i yelled every officer in a fervent tone  now it is time for the reader to know that in the faraway land of oz the lovely ruler ozma had been following the adventures of her shaggy man and tiktok and all the others they had met day by day ozma with the wonderful wizard of oz seated beside her had gazed upon a magic picture in a radium frame which occupied one side of the rulers cosy boudoir in the palace of the emerald city the singular thing about this magic picture was that it showed whatever scene ozma wished to see with the figures all in motion just as it was taking place so ozma and the wizard had watched every action of the adventurers from the time shaggy had met shipwrecked betsy and hank in the rose kingdom at which time the rose princess a distant cousin of ozma had been exiled by her heartless subjects  when ann and her people so earnestly wished to return to oogaboo ozma was sorry for them and remembered that oogaboo was a corner of the land of oz she turned to her attendant and asked  can not your magic take these unhappy people to their old home wizard  it can your highness replied the little wizard  i think the poor queen has suffered enough in her misguided effort to conquer the world said ozma smiling at the absurdity of the undertaking so no doubt she will hereafter be contented in her own little kingdom please send her there wizard and with her the officers and files  how about the rose princess asked the wizard  send her to oogaboo with files answered ozma they have become such good friends that i am sure it would make them unhappy to separate them  very well said the wizard and without any fuss or mystery whatever he performed a magical rite that was simple and effective therefore those seated in the nome kings cavern were both startled and amazed when all the people of oogaboo suddenly disappeared from the room and with them the rose princess at first they could not understand it at all but presently shaggy suspected the truth and believing that ozma was now taking an interest in the party he drew from his pocket a tiny instrument which he placed against his ear  ozma observing this action in her magic picture at once caught up a similar instrument from a table beside her and held it to her own ear the two instruments recorded the same delicate vibrations of sound and formed a wireless telephone an invention of the wizard those separated by any distance were thus enabled to converse together with perfect ease and without any wire connection  do you hear me shaggy man asked ozma  yes your highness he replied  i have sent the people of oogaboo back to their own little valley announced the ruler of oz so do not worry over their disappearance  that was very kind of you said shaggy but your highness must permit me to report that my own mission here is now ended i have found my lost brother and he is now beside me freed from the enchantment of ugliness which ruggedo cast upon him tiktok has served me and my comrades faithfully as you requested him to do and i hope you will now transport the clockwork man back to your fairyland of oz  i will do that replied ozma but how about yourself shaggy  i have been very happy in oz he said but my duty to others forces me to exile myself from that delightful land i must take care of my newfound brother for one thing and i have a new comrade in a dear little girl named betsy bobbin who has no home to go to and no other friends but me and a small donkey named hank i have promised betsy never to desert her as long as she needs a friend and so i must give up the delights of the land of oz forever  he said this with a sigh of regret and ozma made no reply but laid the tiny instrument on her table thus cutting off all further communication with the shaggy man but the lovely ruler of oz still watched her magic picture with a thoughtful expression upon her face and the little wizard of oz watched ozma and smiled softly to himself  in the cavern of the nome king shaggy replaced the wireless telephone in his pocket and turning to betsy said in as cheerful a voice as he could muster  well little comrade what shall we do next  i dont know im sure she answered with a puzzled face im kind of sorry our adventures are over for i enjoyed them and now that queen ann and her people are gone and polychrome is gone anddear mewheres tiktok shaggy  he also has disappeared said shaggy looking around the cavern and nodding wisely by this time he is in ozmas palace in the land of oz which is his home  isnt it your home too asked betsy  it used to be my dear but now my home is wherever you and my brother are we are wanderers you know but if we stick together i am sure we shall have a good time  then said the girl let us get out of this stuffy underground cavern and go in search of new adventures im sure it has stopped raining  im ready said shaggy and then they bade goodbye to king kaliko and thanked him for his assistance and went out to the mouth of the passage  the sky was now clear and a brilliant blue in color the sun shone brightly and even this rugged rocky country seemed delightful after their confinement underground there were but four of them nowbetsy and hank and shaggy and his brotherand the little party made their way down the mountain and followed a faint path that led toward the southwest  during this time ozma had been holding a conference with the wizard and later with tiktok whom the magic of the wizard had quickly transported to ozmas palace tiktok had only words of praise for betsy bobbin who he said is almost as nice as dorothy herself  let us send for dorothy said ozma and summoning her favorite maid who was named jellia jamb she asked her to request princess dorothy to attend her at once so a few moments later dorothy entered ozmas room and greeted her and the wizard and tiktok with the same gentle smile and simple manner that had won for the little girl the love of everyone she met  did you want to see me ozma she asked  yes dear i am puzzled how to act and i want your advice  i dont blieve its worth much replied dorothy but ill do the best i can what is it all about ozma  you all know said the girl ruler addressing her three friends what a serious thing it is to admit any mortals into this fairyland of oz it is true i have invited several mortals to make their home here and all of them have proved true and loyal subjects indeed no one of you three was a native of oz dorothy and the wizard came here from the united states and tiktok came from the land of ev but of course he is not a mortal shaggy is another american and he is the cause of all my worry for our dear shaggy will not return here and desert the new friends he has found in his recent adventures because he believes they need his services  shaggy man was always kindhearted remarked dorothy but who are these new friends he has found  one is his brother who for many years has been a prisoner of the nome king our old enemy ruggedo this brother seems a kindly honest fellow but he has done nothing to entitle him to a home in the land of oz  who else asked dorothy  i have told you about betsy bobbin the little girl who was shipwreckedin much the same way you once wereand has since been following the shaggy man in his search for his lost brother you remember her do you not  oh yes exclaimed dorothy ive often watched her and hank in the magic picture you know shes a dear little girl and old hank is a darling where are they now  look and see replied ozma with a smile at her friends enthusiasm  dorothy turned to the picture which showed betsy and hank with shaggy and his brother trudging along the rocky paths of a barren country  seems to me she said musingly that theyre a good way from any place to sleep or any nice things to eat  you are right said tiktok i have been in that country and it is a wilderness  it is the country of the nomes explained the wizard who are so mischievous that no one cares to live near them im afraid shaggy and his friends will endure many hardships before they get out of that rocky place unless  he turned to ozma and smiled  unless i ask you to transport them all here she asked  yes your highness  could your magic do that inquired dorothy  i think so said the wizard  well said dorothy as far as betsy and hank are concerned id like to have them here in oz it would be such fun to have a girl playmate of my own age you see and hank is such a dear little mule  ozma laughed at the wistful expression in the girls eyes and then she drew dorothy to her and kissed her  am i not your friend and playmate she asked  dorothy flushed  you know how dearly i love you ozma she cried but youre so busy ruling all this land of oz that we cant always be together  i know dear my first duty is to my subjects and i think it would be a delight to us all to have betsy with us theres a pretty suite of rooms just opposite your own where she can live and ill build a golden stall for hank in the stable where the sawhorse lives then well introduce the mule to the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger and im sure they will soon become firm friends but i cannot very well admit betsy and hank into oz unless i also admit shaggys brother  and unless you admit shaggys brother you will keep out poor shaggy whom we are all very fond of said the wizard  well why not admit him demanded tiktok  the land of oz is not a refuge for all mortals in distress explained ozma i do not wish to be unkind to shaggy man but his brother has no claim on me  the land of oz isnt crowded suggested dorothy  then you advise me to admit shaggys brother inquired ozma  well we cant afford to lose our shaggy man can we  no indeed returned ozma what do you say wizard  im getting my magic ready to transport them all  and you tiktok  shaggys brother is a good fellow and we cant spare shaggy  so then the question is settled decided ozma perform your magic wizard  he did so placing a silver plate upon a small standard and pouring upon the plate a small quantity of pink powder which was contained in a crystal vial then he muttered a rather difficult incantation which the sorceress glinda the good had taught him and it all ended in a puff of perfumed smoke from the silver plate this smoke was so pungent that it made both ozma and dorothy rub their eyes for a moment  you must pardon these disagreeable fumes said the wizard i assure you the smoke is a very necessary part of my wizardry  look cried dorothy pointing to the magic picture theyre gone all of them are gone  indeed the picture now showed the same rocky landscape as before but the three people and the mule had disappeared from it  they are gone said the wizard polishing the silver plate and wrapping it in a fine cloth because they are here  at that moment jellia jamb entered the room  your highness she said to ozma the shaggy man and another man are in the waiting room and ask to pay their respects to you shaggy is crying like a baby but he says they are tears of joy  send them here at once jellia commanded ozma  also continued the maid a girl and a smallsized mule have mysteriously arrived but they dont seem to know where they are or how they came here shall i send them here too  oh no exclaimed dorothy eagerly jumping up from her chair ill go to meet betsy myself for shell feel awful strange in this big palace  and she ran down the stairs two at a time to greet her new friend betsy bobbin     chapter twentyfive  the land of love   well is heehaw all you are able to say inquired the sawhorse as he examined hank with his knot eyes and slowly wagged the branch that served him for a tail  they were in a beautiful stable in the rear of ozmas palace where the wooden sawhorsevery much alivelived in a goldpaneled stall and where there were rooms for the cowardly lion and the hungry tiger which were filled with soft cushions for them to lie upon and golden troughs for them to eat from  beside the stall of the sawhorse had been placed another for hank the mule this was not quite so beautiful as the other for the sawhorse was ozmas favorite steed but hank had a supply of cushions for a bed which the sawhorse did not need because he never slept and all this luxury was so strange to the little mule that he could only stand still and regard his surroundings and his queer companions with wonder and amazement  the cowardly lion looking very dignified was stretched out upon the marble floor of the stable eyeing hank with a calm and critical gaze while near by crouched the huge hungry tiger who seemed equally interested in the new animal that had just arrived the sawhorse standing stiffly before hank repeated his question  is heehaw all you are able to say  hank moved his ears in an embarrassed manner  i have never said anything else until now he replied and then he began to tremble with fright to hear himself talk  i can well understand that remarked the lion wagging his great head with a swaying motion strange things happen in this land of oz as they do everywhere else i believe you came here from the cold civilized outside world did you not  i did replied hank one minute i was outside of ozand the next minute i was inside that was enough to give me a nervous shock as you may guess but to find myself able to talk as betsy does is a marvel that staggers me  that is because you are in the land of oz said the sawhorse all animals talk in this favored country and you must admit it is more sociable than to bray your dreadful heehaw which nobody can understand  mules understand it very well declared hank  oh indeed then there must be other mules in your outside world said the tiger yawning sleepily  there are a great many in america said hank are you the only tiger in oz  no acknowledged the tiger i have many relatives living in the jungle country but i am the only tiger living in the emerald city  there are other lions too said the sawhorse but i am the only horse of any description in this favored land  that is why this land is favored said the tiger you must understand friend hank that the sawhorse puts on airs because he is shod with plates of gold and because our beloved ruler ozma of oz likes to ride upon his back  betsy rides upon my back declared hank proudly  who is betsy  the dearest sweetest girl in all the world  the sawhorse gave an angry snort and stamped his golden feet the tiger crouched and growled slowly the great lion rose to his feet his mane bristling  friend hank said he either you are mistaken in judgment or you are willfully trying to deceive us the dearest sweetest girl in the world is our dorothy and i will fight anyoneanimal or humanwho dares to deny it  so will i snarled the tiger showing two rows of enormous white teeth  you are all wrong asserted the sawhorse in a voice of scorn no girl living can compare with my mistress ozma of oz  hank slowly turned around until his heels were toward the others then he said stubbornly  i am not mistaken in my statement nor will i admit there can be a sweeter girl alive than betsy bobbin if you want to fight come onim ready for you  while they hesitated eyeing hanks heels doubtfully a merry peal of laughter startled the animals and turning their heads they beheld three lovely girls standing just within the richly carved entrance to the stable in the center was ozma her arms encircling the waists of dorothy and betsy who stood on either side of her ozma was nearly half a head taller than the two other girls who were almost of one size unobserved they had listened to the talk of the animals which was a very strange experience indeed to little betsy bobbin  you foolish beasts exclaimed the ruler of oz in a gentle but chiding voice why should you fight to defend us who are all three loving friends and in no sense rivals answer me she continued as they bowed their heads sheepishly  i have the right to express my opinion your highness pleaded the lion  and so have the others replied ozma i am glad you and the hungry tiger love dorothy best for she was your first friend and companion also i am pleased that my sawhorse loves me best for together we have endured both joy and sorrow hank has proved his faith and loyalty by defending his own little mistress and so you are all right in one way but wrong in another our land of oz is a land of love and here friendship outranks every other quality unless you can all be friends you cannot retain our love  they accepted this rebuke very meekly  all right said the sawhorse quite cheerfully shake hoofs friend mule  hank touched his hoof to that of the wooden horse  let us be friends and rub noses said the tiger so hank modestly rubbed noses with the big beast  the lion merely nodded and said as he crouched before the mule  any friend of a friend of our beloved ruler is a friend of the cowardly lion that seems to cover your case if ever you need help or advice friend hank call on me  why this is as it should be said ozma highly pleased to see them so fully reconciled then she turned to her companions come my dears let us resume our walk  as they turned away betsy said wonderingly  do all the animals in oz talk as we do  almost all answered dorothy theres a yellow hen here and she can talk and so can her chickens and theres a pink kitten upstairs in my room who talks very nicely but ive a little fuzzy black dog named toto who has been with me in oz a long time and hes never said a single word but bowwow  do you know why asked ozma  why hes a kansas dog so i spose hes different from these fairy animals replied dorothy  hank isnt a fairy animal any more than toto said ozma yet as soon as he came under the spell of our fairyland he found he could talk it was the same way with billina the yellow hen whom you brought here at one time the same spell has affected toto i assure you but hes a wise little dog and while he knows everything that is said to him he prefers not to talk  goodness me exclaimed dorothy i never spected toto was fooling me all this time then she drew a small silver whistle from her pocket and blew a shrill note upon it a moment later there was a sound of scurrying footsteps and a shaggy black dog came running up the path  dorothy knelt down before him and shaking her finger just above his nose she said  toto havent i always been good to you  toto looked up at her with his bright black eyes and wagged his tail  bowwow he said and betsy knew at once that meant yes as well as dorothy and ozma knew it for there was no mistaking the tone of totos voice  thats a dog answer said dorothy how would you like it toto if i said nothing to you but bowwow  totos tail was wagging furiously now but otherwise he was silent  really dorothy said betsy he can talk with his bark and his tail just as well as we can dont you understand such dog language  of course i do replied dorothy but totos got to be more sociable see here sir she continued addressing the dog ive just learned for the first time that you can say wordsif you want to dont you want to toto  woof said toto and that meant no  not just one word toto to prove youre as any other animal in oz  woof  just one word totoand then you may run away  he looked at her steadily a moment  all right here i go he said and darted away as swift as an arrow  dorothy clapped her hands in delight while betsy and ozma both laughed heartily at her pleasure and the success of her experiment arm in arm they sauntered away through the beautiful gardens of the palace where magnificent flowers bloomed in abundance and fountains shot their silvery sprays far into the air and by and by as they turned a corner they came upon shaggy man and his brother who were seated together upon a golden bench  the two arose to bow respectfully as the ruler of oz approached them  how are you enjoying our land of oz ozma asked the stranger  i am very happy here your highness replied shaggys brother also i am very grateful to you for permitting me to live in this delightful place  you must thank shaggy for that said ozma being his brother i have made you welcome here  when you know brother better said shaggy earnestly you will be glad he has become one of your loyal subjects i am just getting acquainted with him myself and i find much in his character to admire  leaving the brothers ozma and the girls continued their walk presently betsy exclaimed  shaggys brother cant ever be as happy in oz as i am do you know dorothy i didnt believe any girl could ever have such a good timeanywhereas im having now  i know answered dorothy ive felt that way myself lots of times  i wish continued betsy dreamily that every little girl in the world could live in the land of oz and every little boy too  ozma laughed at this  it is quite fortunate for us betsy that your wish cannot be granted said she for all that army of girls and boys would crowd us so that we would have to move away  yes agreed betsy after a little thought i guess thats true  the end      the wonderful oz books by l frank baum    the wizard of oz   the land of oz   ozma of oz   dorothy and the wizard in oz   the road to oz   the emerald city of oz   the
