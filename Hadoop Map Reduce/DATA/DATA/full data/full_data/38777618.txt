38777618	echoes of the war  by j m barrie    1918    contents     the old lady shows her medals    the new word    barbaras wedding    a wellremembered voice       the old lady shows her medals   three nice old ladies and a criminal who is even nicer are discussing the war over a cup of tea the criminal who is the hostess calls it a dish of tea which shows that she comes from caledonia but that is not her crime  they are all london charwomen but three of them including the hostess are what are called professionally charwomen and or simply ands an and is also a caretaker when required her name is entered as such in ink in a registry book financial transactions take place across a counter between her and the registrar and altogether she is of a very different social status from one who like mrs haggerty is a charwoman but nothing else mrs haggerty though present is not at the party by invitation having seen mrs dowey buying the winkles she followed her downstairs so has shuffled into the play and sat down in it against our wish we would remove her by force or at least print her name in small letters were it not that she takes offence very readily and says that nobody respects her so as you have slipped in you sit there mrs haggerty but keep quiet  there is nothing doing at present in the caretaking way for mrs dowey our hostess but this does not damp her caretaking being only to such as she an extra financially and a halo socially if she had the honour of being served with an incometax paper she would probably fill in one of the nasty little compartments with the words tradecharring profession if anycaretaking this home of hers from which to look after your house she makes occasionally temporary departures in great style escorting a barrow is in one of those whatcarei streets that you discover only when you have lost your way on discovering them your duty is to report them to the authorities who immediately add them to the map of london that is why we are now reporting friday street we shall call it in the rough sketch drawn for tomorrows press street in which the criminal resided and you will find mrs doweys home therein marked with a x  her abode really consists of one room but she maintains that there are two so rather than argue let us say that there are two the other one has no window and she could not swish her old skirts in it without knocking something over its grandest display is of tin pans and crockery on top of a dresser which has a lid to it you have but to whip off the utensils and raise the lid and behold a bath with hot and cold mrs dowey is very proud of this possession and when she shows it off as she does perhaps too frequently she first signs to you with closed fist funny old thing that she is to approach softly she then tiptoes to the dresser and pops off the lid as if to take the bath unawares then she sucks her lips and is modest if you have the grace to do the exclamations  in the real room is a bed though that is putting the matter too briefly the fair way to begin if you love mrs dowey is to say to her that it is a pity she has no bed if she is in her best form she will chuckle and agree that the want of a bed tries her sore she will keep you on the hooks so to speak as long as she can and then with that mouselike movement again she will suddenly spring the bed on you you thought it was a wardrobe but she brings it down from the wall and lo a bed there is nothing else in her abode which we now see to contain four roomskitchen pantry bedroom and bathroom that is absolutely a surprise but it is full of bits every one of which has been paid ready money for and gloated over and tended until it has become part of its owner genuine doweys the dealers might call them though there is probably nothing in the place except the bed that would fetch halfacrown  her home is in the basement so that the view is restricted to the lower half of persons passing overhead beyond the area stairs here at the window mrs dowey sometimes sits of a summer evening gazing not sentimentally at a flowerpot which contains one poor bulb nor yearningly at some tiny speck of sky but with unholy relish at holes in stockings and the like which are revealed to her from her point of vantage you gentle reader may flaunt by thinking that your finery awes the street but mrs dowey can tell and does that your soles are in need of neat repair  also lower parts being as expressive as the face to those whose view is thus limited she could swear to scores of the passersby in a court of law  these four lively old codgers are having a good time at the teatable and wit is flowing free as you can see by their everyday garments and by their pails and mops which are having a little teaparty by themselves in the corner it is not a gathering by invitations stretching away into yesterday it is a purely informal affair so much more attractive dont you think than banquets elaborately prearranged you know how they come about especially in wartime very likely mrs dowey met mrs twymley and mrs mickleham quite casually in the street and meant to do no more than the time of day then naturally enough the word camouflage was mentioned and they got heated but in the end mrs twymley apologised then in the odd way in which one thing leads to another the winkle man appeared and mrs dowey remembered that she had that pot of jam and that mrs mickleham had stood treat last time and soon they were all three descending the area stairs followed cringingly by the haggerty woman  they have been extremely merry and never were four hardworked old ladies who deserved it better all a woman can do in wartime they do daily and cheerfully just as their menfolk are doing it at the front and now with the mops and pails laid aside they sprawl gracefully at ease there is no intention on their part to consider peace terms until a decisive victory has been gained in the field sarah ann dowey until the kaiser is put to the rightabout emma mickleham and singing very small amelia twymley  at this teaparty the lady who is to play the part of mrs dowey is sure to want to suggest that our heroine has a secret sorrow namely the crime but you should see us knocking that idea out of her head mrs dowey knows she is a criminal but unlike the actress she does not know that she is about to be found out and she is to put it bluntly in her own scotch way the merriest of the whole clanjamfry she presses more tea on her guests but they wave her away from them in the pretty manner of ladies who know that they have already had more than enough  mrs dowey just one more winkle mrs mickleham indeed there is only one more  but mrs mickleham indicates politely that if she took this one it would have to swim for it the haggerty woman takes it long afterwards when she thinks erroneously that no one is looking  mrs twymley is sulking evidently some one has contradicted her probably the haggerty woman  mrs twymley i say it is so  the haggerty woman i say it may be so  mrs twymley i suppose i ought to know me that has a son a prisoner in germany she has so obviously scored that all good feeling seems to call upon her to end here but she continues rather shabbily being the only lady present that has that proud misfortune the others are stung  mrs dowey my son is fighting in france  mrs mickleham mine is wounded in two places  the haggerty woman mine is at salonaiky  the absurd pronunciation of this uneducated person moves the others to mirth  mrs dowey youll excuse us mrs haggerty but the correct pronunciation is salonikky  the haggerty woman to cover her confusion i dont think she feels that even this does not prove her case and i speak as one that has war savings certificates  mrs twymley we all have them  the haggerty woman whimpers and the other guests regard her with unfeeling disdain  mrs dowey to restore cheerfulness oh its a terrible war  all brightening it is you may say so  mrs dowey encouraged what i say is the men is splendid but im none so easy about the staff thats your weak point mrs mickleham  mrs mickleham on the defence but determined to reveal nothing that might be of use to the enemy you may take it from me the staffs all right  mrs dowey and very relieved i am to hear you say it  it is here that the haggerty woman has the remaining winkle  mrs mickleham you dont understand properly about trench warfare if i had a map  mrs dowey wetting her finger to draw lines on the table thats the river sommy now if we had barrages here  mrs twymley very soon you would be enfilided wheres your supports my lady mrs dowey is damped  mrs mickleham what none of you grasps is that this is a artillery war  the haggerty woman strengthened by the winkle i say that the word is salonaiky  the others purse their lips  mrs twymley with terrible meaning well change the subject have you seen this weeks fashion chat she has evidently seen and devoured it herself and even licked up the crumbs the gabardine with accordion pleats has quite gone out  mrs dowey her old face sparkling my sakes you tell me  mrs twymley with the touch of haughtiness that comes of great topics the plain smock has come in again with silk lacing giving that charming chic effect  mrs dowey oho  mrs mickleham i must say i was always partial to the straight linethoughtfully regarding the want of line in mrs twymleys personthough trying to them as is of too friendly a figure  it is here that the haggerty womans fingers close unostentatiously upon a piece of sugar  mrs twymley sailing into the empyrean lady dolly kanister was seen conversing across the railings in a dainty de jou  mrs dowey fine would i have liked to see her  mrs twymley she is equally popular as maid wife and munitionworker her two children is inset lady pops babington was married in a tight tulle  mrs mickleham what was her goingaway dress  mrs twymley a champagny cream velvet with dreamy corsage shes married to colonel the hon chingfordsnubs they called him at eton  the haggerty woman having disposed of the sugar very likely hell be sent to salonaiky  mrs mickleham wherever he is sent shell have the same tremors as the rest of us shell be as keen to get the letters wrote with pencils as you or me  mrs twymley them pencil letters  mrs dowey in her sweet scotch voice timidly afraid she may be going too far and women in enemy lands gets those pencil letters and then stop getting them the same as ourselves lets occasionally think of that  she has gone too far chairs are pushed back  the haggerty woman i ask you  mrs mickleham thats hardly language mrs dowey  mrs dowey scared kindly excuse i swear to death im none of your pacifists  mrs mickleham freely granted  mrs twymley ive heard of females that have no male relations and so they have no manparty at the wars ive heard of them but i dont mix with them  mrs mickleham what can the likes of us have to say to them its not their war  mrs dowey wistfully they are to be pitied  mrs mickleham but the place for them mrs dowey is within doors with the blinds down  mrs dowey hurriedly thats the place for them  mrs mickleham i saw one of them today buying a flag i thought it was very impudent of her  mrs dowey meekly so it was  mrs mickleham trying to look modest with indifferent success i had a letter from my son percy yesterday  mrs twymley alfred sent me his photo  the haggerty woman letters from salonaiky is less common  three bosoms heave but not alas mrs doweys nevertheless she doggedly knits her lips  mrs dowey the criminal kenneth writes to me every week there are exclamations the dauntless old thing holds aloft a packet of letters look at this all his  the haggerty woman whimpers  mrs twymley alfred has little time for writing being a bombardier  mrs dowey relentlessly do your letters begin dear mother  mrs twymley generally  mrs mickleham invariable  the haggerty woman every time  mrs dowey delivering the knockout blow kenneths begin dearest mother  no one can think of the right reply  mrs twymley doing her best a short man i should say judging by yourself  she ought to have left it alone  mrs dowey six feet twoand a half  the gloom deepens  mrs mickleham against her better judgment a kilty did you tell me  mrs dowey most certainly hes in the famous black watch  the haggerty woman producing her handkerchief the surrey rifles is the famousest  mrs mickleham there you and the king disagrees mrs haggerty his choice is the buffs same as my percys  mrs twymley magnanimously give me the rha and you can keep all the rest  mrs dowey im sure i have nothing to say against the surreys and the rha and the buffs but they are just breeches regiments i understand  the haggerty woman we cant all be kilties  mrs dowey crushingly thats very true  mrs twymley it is foolish of her but she cant help saying it has your kenneth great hairy legs  mrs dowey tremendous  the wicked woman but let us also say poor sarah ann dowey for at this moment enter nemesis in other words the less important part of a clergyman appears upon the stair  mrs mickleham its the reverent gent  mrs dowey little knowing what he is bringing her i see he has had his boots heeled  it may be said of mr willings that his happy smile always walks in front of him this smile makes music of his life it means that once again he has been chosen in his opinion as the central figure in romance no one can well have led a more drab existence but he will never know it he will always think of himself humbly though elatedly as the chosen of the gods of him must it have been originally written that adventures are for the adventurous he meets them at every street corner for instance he assists an old lady off a bus and asks her if he can be of any further help she tells him that she wants to know the way to maddox the butchers then comes the kind triumphant smile it always comes first followed by its explanation i was there yesterday this is the merest sample of the adventures that keep mr willings up to the mark  since the war broke out his zest for life has become almost terrible he can scarcely lift a newspaper and read of a hero without remembering that he knows some one of the name the soldiers rest he is connected with was once a china emporium and mark my words he had bought his tea service at it such is life when you are in the thick of it sometimes he feels that he is part of a gigantic spy drama in the course of his extraordinary comings and goings he meets with great personages of course and is the confidential recipient of secret news before imparting the news he does not as you might expect first smile expansively on the contrary there comes over his face an awful solemnity which however means the same thing when divulging the names of the personages he first looks around to make sure that no suspicious character is about and then lowering his voice tells you i had that from mr farthing himselfhe is the secretary of the bethnal green branchhsh  there is a commotion about finding a worthy chair for the reverent and there is also some furtive pulling down of sleeves but he stands surveying the ladies through his triumphant smile this amazing man knows that he is about to score again  mr willings waving aside the chairs i thank you but not at all friends i have news  mrs mickleham news  the haggerty woman from the front  mrs twymley my alfred sir  they are all grown suddenly anxiousall except the hostess who knows that there can never be any news from the front for her  mr willings i tell you at once that all is well the news is for mrs dowey  she stares  mrs dowey news for me  mr willings your son mrs doweyhe has got five days leave she shakes her head slightly or perhaps it only trembles a little on its stem now now good news doesnt kill  mrs twymley were glad mrs dowey  mrs dowey youre sure  mr willings quite sure he has arrived  mrs dowey he is in london  mr willings he is i have spoken to him  mrs mickleham you lucky woman  they might see that she is not looking lucky but experience has told them how differently these things take people  mr willings marvelling more and more as he unfolds his tale ladies it is quite a romance i was in the he looks around cautiously but he knows that they are all to be trustedin the church army quarters in central street trying to get on the track of one or two of our missing men suddenly my eyesi cant account for itbut suddenly my eyes alighted on a highlander seated rather drearily on a bench with his kit at his feet  the haggerty woman a big man  mr willings a great brawny fellow the haggerty woman groans my friend i said at once welcome back to blighty i make a point of calling it blighty i wonder i said if there is anything i can do for you he shook his head what regiment i asked here mr willings very properly lowers his voice to a whisper black watch 5th battalion he said name i asked dowey he said  mrs mickleham i declare i do declare  mr willings showing how the thing was done with the help of a chair i put my hand on his shoulder as it might be thus kenneth dowey i said i know your mother  mrs dowey wetting her lips what did he say to that  mr willings he was incredulous indeed he seemed to think i was balmy but i offered to bring him straight to you i told him how much you had talked to me about him  mrs dowey bring him here  mrs mickleham i wonder he needed to be brought  mr willings he had just arrived and was bewildered by the great city he listened to me in the taciturn scotch way and then he gave a curious laugh  mrs twymley laugh  mr willings whose wild life has brought him into contact with the strangest people the scotch mrs twymley express their emotions differently from us with them tears signify a rollicking mood while merriment denotes that they are plunged in gloom when i had finished he said at once let us go and see the old lady  mrs dowey backing which is the first movement she has made since he began his tale is hecoming  mr willings gloriously he has come he is up there i told him i thought i had better break the joyful news to you  three women rush to the window mrs dowey looks at her pantry door but perhaps she remembers that it does not lock on the inside she stands rigid though her face has gone very grey  mrs dowey kindly get them to go away  mr willings ladies i think this happy occasion scarcely requires you he is not the man to ask of woman a sacrifice that he is not prepared to make himself i also am going instantly they all survey mrs dowey and understandor think they understand  mrs twymley pail and mop in hand i would thank none for their company if my alfred was at the door  mrs mickleham similarly burdened the same from me shall i send him down mrs dowey the old lady does not hear her she is listening terrified for a step on the stairs look at the poor joyous thing sir she has his letters in her hand  the three women go mr willings puts a kind hand on mrs doweys shoulder he thinks he so thoroughly understands the situation  mr willings a good son mrs dowey to have written to you so often  our old criminal quakes but she grips the letters more tightly private dowey descends  dowey my friend there she is waiting for you with your letters in her hand  dowey grimly thats great  mr willings ascends the stair without one backward glance like the good gentleman he is and the doweys are left together with nearly the whole room between them he is a great rough chunk of scotland howked out of her not so much neatly as liberally and in his black watch uniform all caked with mud his kit and nearly all his worldly possessions on his back he is an apparition scarcely less fearsome but so much less ragged than those ancestors of his who trotted with prince charlie to derby he stands silent scowling at the old lady daring her to raise her head and she would like very much to do it for she longs to have a first glimpse of her son when he does speak it is to jeer at her  do you recognise your loving son missis oh the fine scotch tang of him she thinks im pleased i wrote so often oh but hes raized she thinks he strides towards her and seizes the letters roughly lets see them  there is a string round the package and he unties it and examines the letters at his leisure with much curiosity the envelopes are in order all addressed in pencil to mrs dowey with the proud words opened by censor on them but the letter paper inside contains not a word of writing  nothing but blank paper is this your writing in pencil on the envelope she nods and he gives the matter further consideration  the covey told me you were a charwoman so i suppose you picked the envelopes out of wastepaper baskets or such like and then changed the addresses she nods again still she dare not look up but she is admiring his legs when however he would cast the letters into the fire she flames up with sudden spirit she clutches them  dont you burn them letters mister  theyre not real letters  theyre all i have  he returns to irony i thought you had a son  i never had a man nor a son nor anything i just call myself missis to give me a standing  well its past my seeing through  he turns to look for some explanation from the walls she gets a peep at him at last oh what a grandly setup man oh the stride of him oh the noble rage of him oh samson had been like this before that woman took him in hand  he whirls round on her what made you do it  it was everybodys war mister except mine she beats her arms i wanted it to be my war too  youll need to be plainer and yet im dd if i care to hear you you lying old trickster  the words are merely what were to be expected and so are endurable but he has moved towards the door  youre not going already mister  yes i just came to give you an ugly piece of my mind  she holds out her arms longingly you havent gave it to me yet  you have a cheek  she gives further proof of it you wouldnt drink some tea  me i tell you i came here for the one purpose of blazing away at you  it is such a roaring negative that it blows her into a chair but she is up again in a moment is this spirited old lady you could drink the tea while you was blazing away theres winkles  is there he turns interestedly towards the table but his proud scots character checks him which is just as well for what she should have said was that there had been winkles not me youre just a common rogue he seats himself far from the table now then out with it sit down she sits meekly there is nothing she would not do for him as you char i suppose you are on your feet all day  im more on my knees  thats where you should be to me  oh mister im willing  stop it go on you accomplished liar  its true that my name is dowey  its enough to make me change mine  ive been charring and charring and charring as far back as i mind ive been in london this twenty years  well skip your early days i have an appointment  and then when i was old the war broke out  how could it affect you  oh mister thats the thing it didnt affect me it affected everybody but me the neighbours looked down on me even the posters on the walls of the woman saying go my boy leered at me i sometimes cried by myself in the dark you wont have a cup of tea  no  sudden like the idea came to me to pretend i had a son  you depraved old limmer but what in the name of old nick made you choose me out of the whole british army  mrs dowey giggles there is little doubt that in her youth she was an accomplished flirt maybe mister it was because i liked you best  now now woman  i read one day in the papers in which he was assisted by private k dowey 5th battalion black watch  private k dowey is flattered did you now well i expect thats the only time i was ever in the papers  mrs dowey tries it on again i didnt choose you for that alone i read a history of the black watch first to make sure it was the best regiment in the world  anybody could have told you that he is moving about now in better humour and meeting the loaf in his stride he cuts a slice from it he is hardly aware of this but mrs dowey knows i like the scotch voice of you woman it drummles on like a hill burn  prosen water runs by where i was born flirting again may be it teached me to speak mister  canny woman canny  i read about the black watchs ghostly piper that plays proudly when the men of the black watch do well and prouder when they fall  theres some foolish story of that kind he has another careless slice off the loaf but you couldnt have been living here at that time or they would have guessed i suppose you flitted  yes it cost me eleven and sixpence  how did you guess the k in my name stood for kenneth  does it  umpha  an angel whispered it to me in my sleep  well thats the only angel in the whole black business he chuckles  you little thought i would turn up wheeling suddenly on her or did you  i was beginning to weary for a sight of you kenneth  what word was that  mister  he helps himself to butter and she holds out the jam pot to him but he haughtily rejects it do you think she gives in now not a bit of it  he returns to sarcasm i hope youre pleased with me now you see me  im very pleased does your folk live in scotland  glasgow  both living  ay  is your mother terrible proud of you  naturally  youll be going to them  after ive had a skite in london first  the old lady sniffs so she is in london  who  your young lady  are you jealyous  not me  you needna be shes a young thing  you surprises me a beauty no doubt  you may be sure he tries the jam shes a titled person she is equally popular as maid wife and munitionworker  mrs dowey remembers lady dolly kanister so familiar to readers of fashionable gossip and a very leery expression indeed comes into her face  tell me more about her man  she has sent me a lot of things especially cakes and a worsted waistcoat with a loving message on the enclosed card  the old lady is now in a quiver of excitement she loses control of her arms which jump excitedly this way and that  youll try one of my cakes mister  not me  theyre of my own making  no i thank you  but with a funny little run she is in the pantry and back again she planks down a cake before him at sight of which he gapes  whats the matter tell me oh tell me mister  thats exactly the kind of cake that her ladyship sends me  mrs dowey is now a very glorious old character indeed  is the waistcoat right mister i hope the black watch colours pleased you  what was it you  i daredna give my own name you see and i was always reading hers in the papers  the badgered man looms over her terrible for the last time  woman is there no getting rid of you  are you angry  he sits down with a groan  oh hell give me some tea  she rushes about preparing a meal for him every bit of her wanting to cry out to every other bit oh glory glory glory for a moment she hovers behind his chair kenneth she murmurs what he asks no longer aware that she is taking a liberty nothing she says just kenneth and is off gleefully for the teacaddy but when his tea is poured out and he has drunk a saucerful the instinct of selfpreservation returns to him between two bites  dont you be thinking missis for one minute that you have got me  no no  on that understanding he unbends  i have a theatre tonight followed by a randydandy  oho kenneth this is a queer first meeting  it is woman oh it is guardedly and its also a last meeting  yes yes  so heres to youyou old mop and pail

we could come back by paris  all the ladies slapping his knees likes to go to paris  oh kenneth kenneth if just once before i die i could be fitted for a paris gown with dreamy corsage  youre all alike old covey we have a song about it he sings    mrs gill is very ill      nothing can improve her    but to see the tuileries      and waddle through the louvre  no song ever had a greater success mrs dowey is doubled up with mirth when she comes to when they both come to for there are a pair of them she cries  you must learn me that and off she goes in song also    mrs doweys very ill      nothing can improve her   stop cries clever kenneth and finishes the verse    but dressed up in a paris gown     to waddle through the louvre   they fling back their heads she points at him he points at her she says ecstatically  hairy legs  a mad remark which brings him to his senses he remembers who and what she is  mind your manners rising well thank you for my tea i must be stepping  poor mrs dowey he is putting on his kit  where are you living  he sighs  thats the question but theres a place called the hut where some of the 2nd battalion are theyll take me in beggars bitterly cant be choosers  beggars  ive never been here before if you knewa shadow coming over himwhat it is to be in such a place without a friend i was crazy with glee when i got my leave at the thought of seeing london at last but after wandering its streets for four hours i would almost have been glad to be back in the trenches  if you knew he has said but indeed the old lady knows  thats my quandorum too kenneth  he nods sympathetically  im sorry for you you poor old body shouldering his kit but i see no way out for either of us  a cooing voice says do you not  are you at it again  she knows that it must be now or never she has left her biggest guns for the end in her excitement she is rising up and down on her toes  kenneth ive heard that the thing a man on leave longs for more than anything else is a bed with sheets and a bath  you never heard anything truer  go into that pantry kenneth dowey and lift the dressertop and tell me what you see  he goes there is an awful stillness he returns impressed  its a kind of a bath  you could do yourself there pretty half at a time  me  theres a woman through the wall that would be very willing to give me a shakedown till your leave is up  he snorts  oh is there  she has not got him yet but there is still one more gun  kenneth look  with these simple words she lets down the bed she says no more an effect like this would be spoilt by language fortunately he is not made of stone he thrills  my word thats the dodge we need in the trenches  thats your bed kenneth  mine he grins at her you queer old divert what can make you so keen to be burdened by a lump like me  he he he he  i tell you im the commonest kind of man  im just the commonest kind of old wifie myself  ive been a kickabout all my life and im no great shakes at the war  yes you are how many germans have you killed  just two for certain and there was no glory in it it was just because they wanted my shirt  your shirt  well they said it was their shirt  have you took prisoners  i once took half a dozen but that was a poor affair too  how could one man take half a dozen  just in the usual way i surrounded them  kenneth youre just my ideal  youre easily pleased  he turns again to the bed lets see how the thing works he kneads the mattress with his fist and the result is so satisfactory that he puts down his kit  old lady if you really want me ill bide  oh oh oh oh  her joy is so demonstrative that he has to drop a word of warning  but mind you i dont accept you as a relation for your personal glory you can go on pretending to the neighbours but the best i can say for you is that youre on your probation im a cautious character and we must see how youll turn out  yes kenneth  and now i think for that bath my theatre begins at sixthirty a cove i met on a bus is going with me  she is a little alarmed  youre sure youll come back  yes yes handsomely i leave my kit in pledge  you wont liquor up too freely kenneth  youre the first chuckling to care whether i do or not nothing she has said has pleased the lonely man so much as this i promise tod im beginning to look forward to being wakened in the morning by hearing you cry get up you lazy swine ive kind of envied men that had womenfolk with the right to say that  he is passing to the bathroom when a diverting notion strikes him  what is it kenneth  the theatre it would be showier if i took a lady  mrs dowey feels a thumping at her breast  kenneth tell me this instant what you mean dont keep me on the jumps  he turns her round  no it couldnt be done  was it me you were thinking of  just for the moment regretfully but you have no style  she catches hold of him by the sleeve  not in this of course but oh kenneth if you saw me in my merino its laced up the back in the very latest  hum doubtfully but lets see it  it is produced from a drawer to which the old lady runs with almost indecent haste the connoisseur examines it critically  looks none so bad have you a bit of chiffon for the neck its not bombs nor kaisers nor tipperary that men in the trenches think of its chiffon  i swear i have kenneth and i have a bangle and a muff and gloves  ay ay he considers do you think you could give your face less of a homely look  im sure i could  then you can have a try but mind you i promise nothing all will depend on the effect  he goes into the pantry and the old lady is left alone not alone for she is ringed round by entrancing hopes and dreadful fears they beam on her and jeer at her they pull her this way and that with difficulty she breaks through them and rushes to her pail hot water soap and a lookingglass our last glimpse of her for this evening shows her staring not discontentedly at her soft old face licking her palm and pressing it to her hair her eyes are sparkling                                       one evening a few days later mrs twymley and mrs mickleham are in mrs doweys house awaiting that ladys return from some fashionable dissipation they have undoubtedly been discussing the war for the first words we catch are  mrs mickleham i tell you flat amelia i bows no knee to junkerdom  mrs twymley sitting here by the fire you and me as one to another what do you think will happen after the war are we to go back to being as we were  mrs mickleham speaking for myself amelia not me the war has wakened me up to a understanding of my own importance that is really astonishing  mrs twymley same here instead of being the poor worms the like of you and me thought we was we turns out to be visible departments of a great and haughty empire  they are well under weigh and with a little luck we might now hear their views on various passing problems of the day such as the neglect of science in our public schools but in comes the haggerty woman and spoils everything she is attired like them in her best but the effect of her is that her clothes have gone out for a walk leaving her at home  mrs mickleham with deep distaste heres that submarine again  the haggerty woman cringes to them but gets no encouragement  the haggerty woman its a terrible war  mrs twymley is that so  the haggerty woman i wonder what will happen when it ends  mrs mickleham i have no idea  the intruder produces her handkerchief but does not use it after all she is in her best  the haggerty woman are they not back yet  perfect ladies must reply to a direct question  mrs mickleham no icily we have been waiting this half hour they are at the theatre again  the haggerty woman you tell me i just popped in with an insignificant present for him as his leave is up  mrs twymley the same errand brought us  the haggerty woman my present is cigarettes  they have no intention of telling her what their presents are but the secret leaps from them  mrs mickleham so is mine  mrs twymley mine too  triumph of the haggerty woman but it is shortlived  mrs mickleham mine has gold tips  mrs twymley so has mine  the haggerty woman need not say a word you have only to look at her to know that her cigarettes are not goldtipped she tries to brazen it out which is so often a mistake  the haggerty woman what care i mine is exquisytos  no wonder they titter  mrs mickleham excuse us mrs haggerty if thats your name but the word is exquiseetos  the haggerty woman much obliged weeps  mrs mickleham i think i heard a taxi  mrs twymley it will be her third this week  they peer through the blind they are so excited that rank is forgotten  the haggerty woman what is she in  mrs mickleham a new astrakhan jacket he gave her with venus sleeves  the haggerty woman has she sold her gabardine coat  mrs mickleham not her she has them both at the theatre warm night though it is shes wearing the astrakhan and carrying the gabardine flung carelesslike over her arm  the haggerty woman i saw her strutting about with him yesterday looking as if she thought the two of them made a procession  mrs twymley hsh peeping strike me dead if shes not coming mincing down the stair hooked on his arm  indeed it is thus that mrs dowey enters perhaps she had seen shadows lurking on the blind and at once hooked on to kenneth to impress the visitors she is quite capable of it  now we see what kenneth saw that afternoon five days ago when he emerged from the bathroom and found the old trembler awaiting his inspection here are the muff and the gloves and the chiffon and such a kind old bonnet that it makes you laugh at once i dont know how to describe it but it is trimmed with a kiss as bonnets should be when the wearer is old and frail we must take the merino for granted until she steps out of the astrakhan she is dressed up to the nines there is no doubt about it yes but is her face less homely above all has she style the answer is in a stout affirmative ask kenneth he knows many a time he has had to go behind a door to roar hilariously at the old lady he has thought of her as a lark to tell his mates about by and by but for some reason that he cannot fathom he knows now that he will never do that  mrs dowey kenneth affecting surprise we have visitors  dowey your servant ladies  he is no longer mudcaked and dour a very smart figure is this private dowey and he winks engagingly at the visitors like one who knows that for jolly company you cannot easily beat charwomen the pleasantries that he and they have exchanged this week the sauce he has given them the wit of mrs micklehams retorts the badinage of mrs twymley the neat giggles of the haggerty woman there has been nothing like it since you took the countess in to dinner  mrs twymley we should apologise were not meaning to stay  mrs dowey you are very welcome just waitthe ostentation of thistill i get out of my astrakhanand my muffand my glovesand it is the bonnets turn now my excelsior  at last we see her in the merino a triumph  mrs mickleham youve given her a glory time mr dowey  dowey its her that has given it to me missis  mrs dowey hey hey hey hey he just pampers me waggling her fists the lord forgive us but this being the last night we had a sitdown supper at a restaurant vehemently i swear by god that we had champagny wine there is a dead stillness and she knows very well what it means she has even prepared for it and to them as doubts my wordheres the cork  she places the cork in its lovely gold drapery upon the table  mrs mickleham im sure  mrs twymley i would thank you mrs dowey not to say a word against my alfred  mrs dowey me  dowey come come ladies in the masterful way that is so hard for women to resist if you say another word ill kiss the lot of you  there is a moment of pleased confusion  mrs mickleham really them sodgers  the haggerty woman the kilties is the worst  mrs twymley im sure heartily we dont grudge you your treats mrs dowey and sorry we are that this is the end  dowey yes its the end with a troubled look at his old lady i must be off in ten minutes  the little soul is too gallant to break down in company she hurries into the pantry and shuts the door  mrs mickleham poor thing but we must run for youll be having some last words to say to her  dowey i kept her out long on purpose so as to have less time to say them in  he more than half wishes that he could make a bolt to a publichouse  mrs twymley its the best way in the important affairs of life there is not much that any one can teach a charwoman just a mere nothing to wish you well mr dowey  all three present him with the cigarettes  mrs mickleham a scraping as one might say  the haggerty woman the heart enigmatically is warm though it may not be goldtipped  dowey you bricks  the ladies good luck cocky  dowey the same to you and if you see a sodger man up there in a kilt he is one that is going back with me tell him not to come down butbut to give me till the last minute and then to whistle  it is quite a grave man who is left alone thinking what to do next he tries a horse laugh but that proves of no help he says hell to himself but it is equally ineffective then he opens the pantry door and calls  old lady  she comes timidly to the door her hand up as if to ward off a blow  is it time  an encouraging voice answers her  no no not yet ive left word for dixon to whistle when go i must  all is ended  now then you promised to be gay we were to help one another  yes kenneth  its bad for me but its worse for you  the men have medals to win you see  the women have their medals too he knows she likes him to order her about so he tries it again  come here no ill come to you he stands gaping at her wonderingly he has no power of words nor does he quite know what he would like to say god  what is it kenneth  youre a woman  i had near forgot it  he wishes he was at the station with dixon dixon is sure to have a bottle in his pocket they will be roaring a song presently but in the meantimethere is that son business blethers the whole thing of courseor mostly blethers but its the way to please her  have you noticed you have never called me son  have i noticed it i was feared kenneth you said i was on probation  and so you were well the probations ended he laughs uncomfortably the like of me but if you want me you can have me  kenneth will i do  woman artfully gay dont be so forward wait till i have proposed  propose for a mother  what for no in the grand style mrs dowey you queer carl you spunky tiddy have i your permission to ask you the most important question a neglected orphan can ask of an old lady  she bubbles with mirth who could help it the man has such a way with him  none of your sauce kenneth  for a long time mrs dowey you cannot have been unaware of my sonnish feelings for you  wait till i get my mop to you  and if youre not willing to be my mother i swear ill never ask another  the old divert pulls him down to her and strokes his hair  was i a wellbehaved infant mother  not you sonny you were a rampaging rogue  was i slow in learning to walk  the quickest in our street he he he she starts up was that the whistle  no no see here in taking me over you have in a manner of speaking joined the black watch  i like to think that kenneth  then you must behave so that the ghost piper can be proud of you tion she stands bravely at attention thats the style now listen ive sent in your name as being my nearest of kin and your allowance will be coming to you weekly in the usual way  hey hey hey is it wicked kenneth  ill take the responsibility for it in both worlds you see i want you to be safeguarded in case anything hap  kenneth  tion have no fear ill come back covered with mud and medals mind you have that cup of tea waiting for me he is listening for the whistle he pulls her on to his knee  hey hey hey hey  what fun well have writing to one another real letters this time  yes  it would be a good plan if you began the first letter as soon as ive gone  i will  i hope lady dolly will go on sending me cakes  you may be sure  he ties his scarf round her neck  you must have been a bonny thing when you were young  away with you  that scarf sets you fine  blue was always my colour  the whistle sounds  old lady you are what blighty means to me now  she hides in the pantry again she is out of sight to us but she does something that makes private dowey take off his bonnet then he shoulders his equipment and departs that is he laughing coarsely with dixon  we have one last glimpse of the old ladya month or two after kenneths death in action it would be rosemary to us to see her in her black dress of which she is very proud but let us rather peep at her in the familiar garments that make a third to her mop and pail it is early morning and she is having a look at her medals before setting off on the daily round they are in a drawer with the scarf covering them and on the scarf a piece of lavender first the black frock which she carries in her arms like a baby then her war savings certificates kenneths bonnet a thin packet of real letters and the famous champagne cork she kisses the letters but she does not blub over them she strokes the dress and waggles her head over the certificates and presses the bonnet to her cheeks and rubs the tinsel of the cork carefully with her apron she is a tremulous old un yet she exults for she owns all these things and also the penny flag on her breast she puts them away in the drawer the scarf over them the lavender on the scarf her air of triumph well becomes her she lifts the pail and the mop and slouches off gamely to the days toil       the new word   any room nowadays must be the scene for any father and any son are the dramatis personae we could pick them up in mayfair in tooting on the veldt in rectories or in grocers back parlours dump them down on our toy stage and tell them to begin it is a great gathering to choose from but our needs are small let the company shake hands and all go away but two  the two who have remained it is discovered on inquiry are mr torrance and his boy so let us make use of them torrance did not linger in order to be chosen he was anxious like all of them to be off but we recognised him and sternly signed to him to stay not that we knew him personally but the fact is we remembered him we never forget a face as the legal person who reads out the names of the jury before the court opens and who brushes aside your reasons for wanting to be let off it pleases our humour to tell mr torrance that we cannot let him off  he does not look so formidable as when last we saw him and this is perhaps owing to our no longer being hunched with others on those unfeeling benches it is not because he is without a wig for we saw him on the occasion to which we are so guardedly referring both in a wig and out of it he passed behind a screen without it and immediately as quickly as we write popped out in it giving it a finishing touch rather like the butlers wriggle to his coat as he goes to the door there are the two kinds of learned brothers those who use the screen and those who so far as the jury knows sleep in their wigs the latter are the swells and include the judges whom however we have seen in the public thoroughfares without their wigs a horrible sight that has doubtless led many an onlooker to crime  mr torrance then is no great luminary indeed when we accompany him to his house as we must in order to set our scene properly we find that it is quite a suburban affair only one servant kept and her niece engaged twice a week to crawl about the floors there is no fire in the drawingroom so the family remain on after dinner in the diningroom which rather gives them away there is really no one in the room but roger that is the truth of it though to the unseeing eye all the family are there except roger they consist of mr mrs and miss torrance mr torrance is enjoying his evening paper and a cigar and every line of him is insisting stubbornly that nothing unusual is happening in the house in the home circle and now that we think of it even in court he has the reputation of being a somewhat sarcastic gentleman he must be dogged too otherwise he would have ceased long ago to be sarcastic to his wife on whom wit falls like pellets on sandbags all the dents they make are dimples  mrs torrance is at present exquisitely employed she is listening to rogers step overhead you know what a delightful step the boy has and what is more remarkable is that emma is listening to it too emma who is seventeen and who has been trying to keep roger in his place ever since he first compelled her to bowl to him things have come to a pass when a sister so openly admits that she is only number two in the house  remarks well worthy of being recorded fall from these two ladies as they gaze upward i thinkdidnt i emma is the mothers contribution while it is emma who replies in a whisper no not yet  mr torrance calmly reads or seems to read for it is not possible that there can be anything in the paper as good as this indeed he occasionally casts a humorous glance at his womenfolk perhaps he is trying to steady them let us hope he has some such good reason for breaking in from time to time on their entrancing occupation  listen to this dear it is very important the paper says upon apparently good authority that love laughs at locksmiths  his wife answers without lowering her eyes did you speak john i am listening  yes i was telling you that the hidden hand has at last been discovered in a tub in russell square  i hear john how thoughtful  and so they must have been made of margarine my love  i shouldnt wonder john  hence the name petrograd  oh was that the reason  you will be pleased to hear ellen that the honourable gentleman then resumed his seat  that was nice of him  as i goodnaturedly now resume mine having made my usual impression  yes john  emma slips upstairs to peep through a keyhole and it strikes her mother that john has been saying something they are on too good terms to make an apology necessary she observes blandly john i havent heard a word you said  im sure you havent woman  i cant help being like this john  go on being like yourself dear  am i foolish  um  oh but john how can you be so calmwith him up there  he has been up there a good deal you know since we presented him to an astounded world nineteen years ago  but hehe is not going to be up there much longer john she sits on the arm of his chair so openly to wheedle him that it is not worth his while to smile her voice is tremulous she is a woman who can conceal nothing you will be nice to himtonightwont you john  mr torrance is a little pained do i just begin tonight ellen  oh no no but i think he is rathershy of you at times  that he says a little wryly is because he is my son ellen  yesits strange butyes  with a twinkle that is not all humorous did it ever strike you ellen that i am a bitshy of him  she is indeed surprised of rogie  i suppose it is because i am his father  she presumes that this is his sarcasm again and lets it pass at that it reminds her of what she wants to say  you are so sarcastic she has never quite got the meaning of this word to rogie at times boys dont like that john  is that so ellen  of course i dont mind your being sarcastic to me  much good groaning my being sarcastic to you you are so seldom aware of it  i am not asking you to be a mother to him john  thank you my dear  she does not know that he is sarcastic again i quite understand that a man cant think all the time about his son as a mother does  cant he ellen what makes you so sure of that  i mean that a boy naturally goes to his mother with his troubles rather than to his father rogie tells me everything  mr torrance is stung i daresay he might tell me things he wouldnt tell you  she smiles at this it is very probably sarcasm  i want you to be serious just now why not show more warmth to him john  with an unspoken sigh it would terrify him ellen two men show warmth to each other shame woman  two men indignantly john he is only nineteen  thats all patting her hand ellen it is the great age to be today nineteen  emma darts in  mother he has unlocked the door he is taking a last look at himself in the mirror before coming down  having made the great announcement she is off again  you wont be sarcastic john  i give you my wordif you promise not to break down  rashly i promise she hurries to the door and back again john ill contrive to leave you and him alone together for a little  mr torrance is as alarmed as if the judge had looked over the bench and asked where he was for gods sake woman dont do that father and son hell bolt or if he doesnt i will  emma torrance flings open the door grandly and we learn what all the todo is about  emma allow me to introduce 2nd lieutenant torrance of the royal sussex fatheryour son 2nd lieutenant torranceyour father motheryour little rogie  roger in uniform walks in strung up for the occasion or the uniform comes forward with roger inside it he has been a very ordinary nice boy up to now dull at his books by an effort mr torrance had sent him to an obscure boardingschool but at sixteen it was evident that an office was the proper place for roger before the war broke out he was treasurer of the local lawn tennis club and his golf handicap was seven he carried his little bag daily to and from the city and his highest relaxation was giggling with girls or about them socially he had fallen from the standards of the home even now that he is in his uniform the hasty might say something clever about temporary gentlemen  but there are great ideas buzzing in rogers head which would never have been there save for the war at present he is chiefly conscious of his clothes his mother embraces him with cries of rapture while mr torrance surveys him quizzically over the paper and emma rushing to the piano which is of such an oldfashioned kind that it can also be used as a sideboard plays see the conquering hero comes  roger in an agony mater do stop that chit making an ass of me  he must be excused for his mater that was the sort of school and his mother is rather proud of the phrase though it sometimes makes his father wince  mrs torrance emma please dont but im sure you deserve it my darling doesnt he john  mr torrance missing his chance hardly yet you know cant be exactly a conquering hero the first night you put them on can you roger  roger hotly did i say i was  mrs torrance oh john do turn round rogie i never didi never did  emma isnt he a pet  roger shut up emma  mrs torrance challenging the world though i say it who shouldntand yet why shouldnt i  mr torrance in any case you willso go ahead mater  mrs torrance i knew he would look splendid but iof course i couldnt know that he would look quite so splendid as this  roger i know i look a bally ass that is why i was such a time in coming down  mr torrance we thought we heard you upstairs strutting about  mrs torrance john dont mind him rogie  roger haughtily i dont  mr torrance oh  roger but i wasnt strutting  mrs torrance that dreadful sword no i would prefer you not to draw it dearnot till necessity makes you  mr torrance come come ellen thats rather hard lines on the boy if he isnt to draw it here where is he to draw it  emma with pride at the front father  mr torrance i thought they left them at home nowadays roger  roger yes mater you see they are a bit in the way  mrs torrance foolishly not when you have got used to them  mr torrance that isnt what roger means his son glares  emma who though she has not formerly thought much of roger is now proud to trot by his side and will henceforth count the salutes i know what he means if you carry a sword the snipers know you are an officer and they try to pick you off  mrs torrance its no wonder they are called huns fancy a british sniper doing that roger you will be very careful wont you in the trenches  roger honour bright mater  mrs torrance above all dont look up  mr torrance the trenches ought to be so deep that they cant look up  mrs torrance what a good idea john  roger hes making game of you mater  mrs torrance unruffled is he my ownvery likely now about the question of provisions  roger oh lummy you talk as if i was going off tonight i maynt go for months and months  mrs torrance i knowand of course there is a chance that you may not be needed at all  roger poor boy none of that mater  mrs torrance there is something i want to ask you johnhow long do you think the war is likely to last her john resumes his paper rogie i know you will laugh at me but there are some things that i could not help getting for you  roger you know you have knitted enough things already to fit up my whole platoon  mrs torrance proud almost to tears his platoon  emma have you noticed how fine all the words in oon are platoon dragoon  mr torrance spitoon  emma colonel is good but rather papaish major is nosey admiral of the fleet is scrumptious but marechal de francethat is the best of all  mrs torrance i think there is nothing so nice as 2nd lieutenant gulping lot of little boys  roger mater  mrs torrance i mean just think of their cold feet she produces many parcels and displays their strange contents those are for putting inside your socks those are for outside your socks i am told that it is also advisable to have straw in your boots  mr torrance have you got him some straw  mrs torrance i thought john he could get it there but if you think  roger hes making fun of you again mater  mrs torrance i shouldnt wonder here are some overalls one is leather and one fur and this one is waterproof the worst of it is that they are from different shops and each says that the others keep the damp in or draw the feet they have such odd names too there are new names for everything nowadays vests are called cuirasses are you laughing at me rogie  mr torrance sharply if he is laughing he ought to be ashamed of himself  roger barking who was laughing  mrs torrance john  emma cuffs her father playfully  mr torrance all very well emma but its past your bedtime  emma indignantly you cant expect me to sleep on a night like this  mr torrance you can try  mrs torrance 2nd lieutenant 2nd lieutenant  mr torrance alarmed ellen dont break down you promised  mrs torrance i am not going to break down butbut there is a photograph of rogie when he was very small  mr torrance go to bed  mrs torrance i happento have it in my pocket  roger dont bring it out mater  mrs torrance if i break down john it wont be owing to the picture itself so much as because of what is written on the back  she produces it dolefully  mr torrance then dont look at the back  he takes it from her  mrs torrance not very hopeful of herself but i know what is written on the back roger john torrance aged two years four months and thirtythree pounds  mr torrance correct she weeps softly there there woman he signs imploringly to emma  emma kissing him im going to byby night mammy night rog she is about to offer him her cheek then salutes instead and rushes off with roger in pursuit  mrs torrance i shall leave you together john  mr torrance half liking it but nervous do you think its wise with a groan you know what i am  mrs torrance do be nice to him dear rogers return finds her very artful indeed i wonder where i put my glasses  roger ill look for them  mrs torrance no i remember now they are upstairs in such a funny place that i must go myself do you remember rogie that i hoped they would reject you on account of your eyes  roger i suppose you couldnt help it  mrs torrance beaming on her husband did you believe i really meant it john  mr torrance curious did you roger  roger of course didnt you father  mr torrance no i knew the old lady better  he takes her hand  mrs torrance sweetly i shouldnt have liked it rogie dear ill tell you something you know your brother harry died when he was seven to you i suppose it is as if he had never been you were barely five  roger i dont remember him mater  mrs torrance nono but i do rogie he would be twentyone now but though you and emma grew up i have always gone on seeing him as just seven always till the war broke out and now i see him a man of twentyone dressed in khaki fighting for his country same as you i wouldnt have had one of you stay at home though i had had a dozen that is if it is the noble war they all say it is im not clever rogie i have to take it on trust surely they wouldnt deceive mothers ill get my glasses  she goes away leaving the father and son somewhat moved it is mr torrance who speaks first gruffly  like to change your mother roger  the answer is also gruff what do you think  then silence falls these two are very conscious of being together without so much as the tick of a clock to help them the father clings to his cigar sticks his knife into it studies the leaf tries crossing his legs another way the son examines the pictures on the walls as if he had never seen them before and is all the time edging toward the door  mr torrance wets his lips it must be now or never not going roger  roger counts the chairs yes i thought  wont yousit down andhave a chat  roger is bowled over a what you and me  why not rather truculently  ohoh all right sitting uncomfortably  the cigar gets several more stabs  i suppose you catch an early train tomorrow  the 520 i have flagsignalling at halfpast six  phew hours before i shall be up  i suppose so  well you neednt dwell on it roger  indignantly i didnt he starts up goodnight father  goodnight damn come back my fault didnt i say i wanted to have a chat with you  i thought we had had it  gloomingly no such luck  there is another pause a frightened ember in the fire makes an appeal to some one to say something mr torrance rises it is now he who is casting eyes at the door he sits again ashamed of himself  i like your uniform roger he says pleasantly  roger wriggles havent you made fun of me enough  sharply im not making fun of you dont you see im trying to tell you that im proud of you  roger is at last aware of it with a sinking he appeals good lord father you are not going to begin now  the father restrains himself  do you remember roger my saying that i didnt want you to smoke till you were twenty  oh its that is it shutting his mouth tight i never promised  almost with a shout its not that then kindly have a cigar my boy  me  a rather shaky hand passes him a cigar case roger selects from it and lights up nervously he is now prepared for the worst  have you ever wondered roger what sort of a fellow i am  guardedly often  mr torrance casts all sense of decency to the winds such is one of the effects of war  i have often wondered what sort of fellow you are roger we have both been at it on the sly i suppose that is what makes a father and son so uncomfortable in each others presence  roger is not yet prepared to meet him halfway but he casts a line  do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me  mortally roger my first instinct is to slip away  so is mine with deep feeling  you dont say so with such surprise that the father undoubtedly goes up a step in the sons estimation i always seem to know what you are thinking roger  do you same here  as a consequence it is better it is right it is only decent that you and i should be very chary of confidences with each other  roger is relieved im dashed glad you see it in that way  oh quite and yet roger if you had to answer this question on oath whom do you think you are most like in this world i dont mean superficially but deep down in your vitals what would you say your mother your uncle one of your friends on the golf links  no  who  darkly you  just how i feel  there is such true sympathy in the manly avowal that roger cannot but be brought closer to his father  its pretty ghastly father  it is i dont know which it is worse for  they consider each other without bitterness  you are a bit of a wag at times roger  you soon shut me up  i have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence  they say the same about you  and now that you mention it i believe it is true and yet isnt it a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any other person  rogers eyes open wide how did you know that  because i am so bucked if i see you relishing mine  are you rogers hold on the certain things in life are slipping you dont show it  that is because of our awkward relationship  roger lapses into gloom we have got to go through with it  his father kicks the coals theres no way out  no  we have as it were signed a compact roger never to let on that we care for each other as gentlemen we must stick to it  yes what are you getting at father  there is a war on roger  that neednt make any difference  yes it does roger be ready i hate to hit you without warning im going to cast a grenade into the middle of you its this im fond of you my boy  roger squirms father if any one were to hear you  they wont the door is shut amy is gone to bed and all is quiet in our street wont youwont you say something civil to me in return roger  roger looks at him and away from him i sometimesbragged about you at school  mr torrance is absurdly pleased did you what sort of things roger  ii forget  come on roger  is this fair father  no i suppose it isnt mr torrance attacks the coals again you and your mother have lots of confidences havent you  i tell her a good deal somehow  yes somehow one can with the artfulness that comes of years im glad you tell her everything  roger looks down his cigar not everything father there are thingsabout oneself  arent there roger  best not to tell her  yesyes if there are any of them you would care to tell me insteadjust if you want to mindjust if you are in a hole or anything  no thanks very stiffly  any little debts for instance  thats all right now mother  she did  roger is ready to jump at him i was willing to speak to you about them but  she said not worth while bothering father  how did you know  oh i have met your mother before you see nothing else  no  havent been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort  good lord father  i shouldnt have said it in my young days we sometimesits all different now  i dont know i could tell you things that would surprise you  no not about yourself  no at least  just as you like roger  it blew over long ago  then theres no need  nooh no it was justyou knowthe old old story  he eyes his father suspiciously but not a muscle in mr torrances countenance is out of place  i see it hasntleft you bitter about the sex roger i hope  not now sheyou know what women are  yes yes  you neednt mention it to mother  i wont mr torrance is elated to share a secret with roger about which mother is not to know think your mother and i are an aged pair roger  i neverof course you are not young  how long have you known that i mean its truebut i didnt know it till quite lately  that youre old  hang it roger not so bad as thatelderly this will stagger you but i assure you that until the other day i jogged along thinking of myself as on the whole still one of the juveniles he makes a wry face i crossed the bridge roger without knowing it  what made you know  what makes us know all the new things rogerthe war ill tell you a secret when we realised in august of 1914 that myriads of us were to be needed my first thought wasnt that i had a son but that i must get fit myself  you  funny isnt it says mr torrance quite nastily but as i tell you i didnt know i had ceased to be young i went into regents park and tried to run a mile  lummy you might have killed yourself  i nearly didespecially as i had put a weight on my shoulders to represent my kit i kept at it for a week but i knew the game was up the discovery was pretty grim roger  dont you bother about that part of it you are doing your share taking care of mother and emma  mr torrance emits a laugh of selfcontempt i am not taking care of them it is you who are taking care of them my friend you are the head of the house now  father  yes we have come back to hard facts and the defender of the house is the head of it  me fudge  its true the thing that makes me wince most is that some of my contemporaries have managed to squeeze back back into youth roger though i guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile there is coxon he is in khaki now with his hair dyed and when he and i meet at the club we know that we belong to different generations im a decent old fellow but i dont really count any more while coxon lucky dog is being damned daily on parade  i hate your feeling it in that way father  i dont say it is a palatable draught but when the war is over we shall all shake down to the new conditions no fear of my being sarcastic to you then roger ill have to be jolly respectful  shut up father  youve begun you see dont worry roger any rawness i might feel in having missed the chance of seeing whether i was a manlike coxon confound himis swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to you im in a shiver about you butits all true roger what your mother said about 2nd lieutenants till the other day we were so little of a military nation that most of us didnt know there were 2nd lieutenants and now in thousands of homes we feel that there is nothing else 2nd lieutenant it is like a new word to usone i daresay of many that the war will add to our language we have taken to it roger if a son of mine were to tarnish it  ill try not to roger growls  if you did i should just know that there had been something wrong about me  gruffly youre all right  if i am you are it is a winning face that mr torrance turns on his son i suppose you have been asking yourself of late what if you were to turn out to be a funk  father how did you know  i know because you are me because ever since there was talk of this commission i have been thinking and thinking what were you thinkingso as to help you  this itself is a help rogers handbut he withdraws it hurriedly  they all seem to be so frightfully brave father he says wistfully  i expect roger that the best of them had the same qualms as you before their first engagement  ii kind of think father that i wont be a funk  i kind of think so too roger mr torrance forgets himself mind you dont be rash my boy and for gods sake keep your head down in the trenches  roger has caught him out he points a gay finger at his anxious father  you know you laughed at mother for saying that  did i roger your mother thinks that i have an unfortunate manner with you  the magnanimous roger says oh i dont know its just the fatherandson complication  that is really all it is but she thinks i should show my affection for you more openly  roger wriggles again earnestly i wouldnt do that nicely of course for this oncebut in a general way i wouldnt do that we know you and i  as long as we know its no one elses affair is it  thats the ticket father  still it is to be feared that mr torrance is now taking advantage of his superior slyness still before your motherto please hereh  faltering i suppose it would  well what do you say  i know she would like it  of course you and i know that display of that sort is all bunkumrepellent even to our natures  lord yes  but to gratify her  i should be so conscious  mr torrance is here quite as sincere as his son so should i  roger considers it how far would you go  oh not far suppose i called you old rogie theres not much in that  it all depends on the way one says these things  i should be quite casual  hum what would you like me to call you  severely it isnt what would i like but i daresay your mother would beam if you called me dear father  i dont think so  you know quite well that you think so roger  its so effeminate  not if you say it casually  with something very like a snort roger asks how does one say a thing like that casually  well for instance you could whistle while you said itor anything of that sort  hum of course youif we were tobe like that you wouldnt do anything  how do you mean  you wouldnt paw me  roger with some natural indignation you forget yourself but apparently it is for him to continue that reminds me of a story i heard the other day of a french general he had asked for volunteers from his airmen for some specially dangerous joband they all stepped forward pretty good that then three were chosen and got their orders and saluted and were starting off when he stopped them since when he said have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to embrace their father they did it then good story  roger lowers they were french  yes i said so dont you think its good  why do you tell it to me  because its a good story  you are sure father sternly that there is no other reason mr torrance tries to brazen it out but he looks guilty you know father that is barred  just because he knows that he has been playing it low mr torrance snaps angrily what is barred  you know says his monitor  mr torrance shouts  i know that you are a young ass  really father  hold your tongue  roger can shout also  i must say father  be quiet i tell you  it is in the middle of this competition that the lady who dotes on them both chooses to come back still without her spectacles  oh dear and i had hopedoh john  mr torrance would like to kick himself  my fault he says with a groan  but whatever is the matter  nothing mater the war is already making roger quite smart only father wouldnt do as i told him  mr torrance cannot keep pace with his sons growth he raps out why the dickens should i  roger is imperturbable this will be useful in france you see mater he said i was the head of the house  you rogie she goes to her husbands side what nonsense  roger grins do you like my joke father  the father smiles upon him and is at once uproariously happy he digs his boy boldly in the ribs  roger you scoundrel  thats better says mrs torrance at a venture  roger feels that things have perhaps gone far enough i think ill go to my room now you will come up mater  yes dear i shant be five minutes john  more like half an hour  she hesitates there is nothing wrong is there i thought i noticed aa  a certain liveliness my dear no we were only having a good talk  what about john wistfully  about the war roger breaks in hurriedly  about tactics and strategy wasnt it roger  yes  the fact is ellen i have been helping roger to take his first trench with a big breath and we took it too together didnt we roger  you bet says roger valiantly  though i suppose sighing it is one of those trenches that the enemy retake during the night  oh ii dont know father  the lady asks whatever are you two talking about  aha says mr torrance in high feather patting her but unable to resist a slight boast it is very private we dont tell you everything you know ellen  she beams though she does not understand  come on mater its only his beastly sarcasm again night father i wont see you in the morning  night says mr torrance  but roger has not gone yet he seems to be looking for somethinga book perhaps then he begins to whistlecasually  goodnight dear father  mr john torrance is left alone rubbing his hands       barbaras wedding   the colonel is in the sittingroom of his country cottage staring through the open windows at his pretty garden he is a very old man and is sometimes bewildered nowadays he calls to dering the gardener who is on a ladder pruning dering who comes to him is a rough capable young fellow with fingers that are already becoming stumpy because he so often uses his hands instead of a spade this is a sign that dering will never get on in the world his mind is in the same condition as his fingers working back to clods he will get a rise of one and sixpence in a year or two and marry on it and become duller and heavier and in short the clever ones could already write his epitaph                                       a beautiful morning dering  too much sun sir the roses be complaining and to make matters worse miss barbara has been watering of themin the heat of the day  the colonel is a very gentle knight nowadays has she she means well but that is not what is troubling him he approaches the subject diffidently dering you heard it didnt you he is longing to be told that dering heard it  what was that sir  the thunderstormearly this morning  there was no thunderstorm sir  dispirited that is what they all say the colonel is too courteous to contradict any one but he tries again there is about him the insistence of one who knows that he is right it was at four oclock i got up and looked out at the window the evening primroses were very beautiful  dering is equally dogged i dont hold much with evening primroses sir but i was out and about at four there was no thunderstorm  the colonel still thinks that there was a thunderstorm but he wants to placate dering i suppose i just thought there was one perhaps it was some thunderstorm of long ago that i heard they do come back you know  heavily do they sir  i am glad to see you moving about in the garden dering with everything just as usual  there is a cautious slyness about this as if the colonel was fishing for information but it is too clever for dering who is going with a thank you sir  no dont go the old man lowers his voice and makes a confession reluctantly i ama little troubled dering  dering knows that his master has a wandering mind and he answers nicely everything be all right sir  im glad of that the colonel says with relief it is pleasant to see that you have come back dering why did you go away for such a long time  me sir dering is a little aggrieved i havent had a day off since christmas  havent you i thought  the colonel tries to speak casually but there is a trembling eagerness in his voice is everything just as usual dering  yes sir there never were a place less changed than this  thats true the colonel is appeased thank you dering for saying that but next moment he has lowered his voice again dering there is nothing wrong is there is anything happening that i am not being told about  not that i know of sir  that is what they all say buti dont know he stares at his old sword which is hanging on the wall dering i feel as if i was needed somewhere i dont know where it is no one will tell me where is every one  theyre all about sir theres a cricket match on at the village green  is there  if the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices you were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself sir  the colonel sees himself standing up to fast ones he is gleeful over his reminiscences  ninetynine against mallowfield and then bowled off my pads biggest score i ever made mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred but i wouldnt let them i was pretty good at steering them through the slips dering do you remember my late cut it didnt matter where point stood i got past him you used to stand at point dering  that was my grandfather sir if he was to be believed he used to snap you regular at point  the colonel is crestfallen but he has a disarming smile did he i daresay he did i cant play now but i like to watch it still he becomes troubled again dering there is no cricket on the green today i have been down to look i dont understand it dering when i got there the green was all dotted with themits the prettiest sight and sound in england but as i watched them they began to go away one and two at a time they werent given out you know they went as if they had been called away some of the little shavers stayed onand then they went off as if they had been called away too the stumps were left lying about why is it  its just fancy sir dering says soothingly i saw master will oiling his bat yesterday  did you avidly i should have liked to see that i have often oiled their bats for them careless lads they always forget was that nice german boy with him  mr karl not far off sir he was sitting by the bank of the stream playing on his flute and miss barbara she had climbed one of my appletreesshe says they are your trees he lowers  they are you know dering the colonel says meekly  yes sir in a sense brushing the spurious argument aside but i dont like any of you to meddle with them and there she sat pelting the two of them with green apples  how like her the colonel shakes his head indulgently i dont know how we are to make a demure young lady of her  dering smirks they say in the village sir that master will would like to try  to the colonel this is wit of a high order  ha ha he is just a colt himself but the laughter breaks off he seems to think that he will get the truth if dering comes closer who are all here now dering in the house i mean i sometimes forget they grow old so quickly they go out at one door in the bloom of youth and come back by another tired and grey havent you noticed it  no sir the only visitors staying here are miss barbara and mr karl theres just them and yourselves sir you and the mistress and master will thats all  yes thats all his master says still unconvinced who is the soldier dering  soldier sir there is no soldier here except yourself  isnt there there was a nurse with him who is ill  no one sir theres no nurse dering backs away from the old man would you like me to call the mistress sir  no she has gone down to the village she told me why but i forget miss barbara is with her  miss barbara is down by the stream sir  is she i think they said they were going to a wedding with an old mans curiosity who is being married today dering  i have heard of no wedding sir but here is miss barbara  it is perhaps the first time that dering has been glad to see miss barbara who romps in a merry hoyden running over with animal spirits  heres the tomboy the colonel cries gaily  barbara looks suspiciously from one to the other  dering i believe you are complaining to the colonel about my watering the flowers at the wrong time of day  aha aha the colonel thinks she is even wittier than dering who is properly abashed  i did just mention it miss  you horrid barbara shakes her mop of hair at the gardener dear dont mind him and every time he says they are his flowers and his apples you tell me and i shall say to his face that they are yours  the courage of those young things says the happy colonel  derings underlip becomes very pronounced but he goes off into the garden barbara attempts to attend to the colonels needs  let me make you comfythe way granny does it  she arranges his cushions clumsily  that is not quite the way she does it the colonel says softly do you call her granny barbara  she asked me tofor practice barbara is curious dont you remember why  of course the colonel remembers  i know billy boy  you are quick today now wait till i get your cane  i dont need my cane while im sitting  you look so beauful sitting holding your cane she knocks over his cushions oh dear i am a clumsy  politely not at all but perhaps if i were to do it for myself he makes himself comfortable thats better thank you barbara very much  i didnt do it im all thumbs what a ghastly nurse i should make  nurse the colonels troubles return to him who is she barbara  who is who dear  that nurse  theres no nurse here  isnt there  barbara feels that she is of less use than ever today where is granny  she has gone down to the village to a wedding  theres no wedding who could be being married  i think its people i know but i cant remember who they are i thought you went too barbara  not i catch me missing it if there had been a wedding  you and the nurse  dear you have just been imagining things again shall i play to you or sing she knocks over a chair oh dear everything catches in me would you like me to robin adair dear  the colonel is polite but firm no thank you barbara for a few moments he forgets her his mind has gone wandering again barbara the house seems so empty where are billy and karl  billy is where karl is you may be sure  and where is karl  he is where billy boy is you may be sure  and where are they both  not far from where barbara is you bet she flutters to the window and waves her hand do you hear karls flute they have been down all the morning at the pool where the alder is trying to catch that bulltrout  they didnt get him ill swear  you can ask them  i spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bulltrout i tumbled in there sixty years ago  i tumbled in sixty minutes ago it cant be the same trout dear  same old rascal  billy and karl come in by the window leaving a fishingrod outside they are gay careless attractive youths  barbara with her nose in the air you muddy things  colonel gaily firing his dart did you get the bulltrout billy boy  billy hes a brute that  colonel he is you know  billy he came up several times and had a look at my fly didnt flick it or do anything as complimentary as that just yawned and went down  colonel yawned did he used to wink in my time did you and billy fish at heidelberg karl  karl we were more worthily employed sir but we did unbend at times billy do you remember he begins a gay dance  billy not i then he joins in  barbara young gentlemen how disgraceful she joins in  colonel harumscarums  karl does he know about you two  billy he often forgets ill tell him again grandfather barbara and i have something to say to you its this he puts his arm round barbara  colonel smiling i knowi know theres nothing like it im very glad barbara  barbara you see dear ive loved billy boy since the days when he tried to catch the bulltrout with a string and a bent pin and i held on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in we used to play at school at marrying and giving in marriage and the girl who was my bridegroom had always to take the name of billy do you woman take this man billy the clergyman in skirts began and before i could answer diffidently some other girl was sure to shout i should rather think she does  colonel in high good humour dont forget the ring billy you know when i was married i think i couldnt find the ring  karl were you married here sir  colonel yes at the village church  billy so were my father and mother  colonel as his eyes wander to the garden i remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window she kissed some of the furniture  billy i suppose you would like a grander affair barbara  barbara no just the same  billy i hoped you would say that  barbara but billy im to have such a dream of a wedding gown granny is going with me to london to choose itlaying her head on the colonels shoulderif you can do without her for a day dear  colonel gallantly i shall go with you i couldnt trust you and granny to choose the gown  karl you must often be pretty lonely sir when we are all out and about enjoying ourselves  colonel they all say that but that is the time when im not lonely karl its then i see things most clearlythe past i suppose it all comes crowding back to meindia the crimea india againand its so real especially the people they come and talk to me i seem to see them i dont know they havent been here billy till your granny tells me afterwards  billy yes i know i wonder where granny is  barbara it isnt often she leaves you for so long dear  colonel she told me she had to go out but i forget where oh yes she has gone down to the village to a wedding  billy a wedding  barbara its curious how he harps on that  colonel she said to me to listen and i would hear the wedding bells  barbara not today dear  billy best not to worry him  barbara but granny says we should try to make things clear to him  billy was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding  colonel like one begging her to admit it you were there barbara  barbara no dear he said that to me before and something about a nurse  colonel obstinately she was there too  billy any one else  colonel there was that soldier  barbara a soldier also  colonel just those three  billy but that makes four granny and barbara and a nurse and a soldier  colonel they were all there but there were only three  billy odd  barbara soothingly never mind dear granny will make it all right she is the one for you  colonel she is the one for me  karl if there had been a wedding wouldnt she have taken the colonel with her  barbara of course she would  karl you are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding sir  colonel wagging his head aha aha you know if i had gone very likely i should have kissed the bride brides look so pretty on their wedding day they are often not pretty at other times but they are all pretty on their wedding day  karl you have an eye for a pretty girl still sir  colonel yes i have yes i have  barbara i do believe i see it all granny has been talking to you about billy boy and me and you havent been able to wait you have hurried on the wedding  billy bravo barbara youve got it  colonel doubtfully that may be it because i am sure you were to be there barbara  barbara our wedding billy  karl it doesnt explain those other people though  the colonel moves about in agitation  barbara what is it dear  colonel i cant quite remember but i think that is why she didnt take me it is your wedding barbara but i dont think billy boy is to be there my love  barbara not at my wedding  billy grandfather  colonel theres something sad about it  barbara there cant be anything sad about a wedding dear granny didnt say it was a sad wedding did she  colonel she was smiling  barbara of course she was  colonel but i think that was only to please the nurse  barbara that nurse again dear dont think any more about it theres no wedding  colonel gently though he wonders why they can go on deceiving him is there not  the village wedding bells begin to ring  the colonel is triumphant i told you there is a wedding  the bells ring on gaily billy and barbara take a step nearer to each other but can go no closer the bells ring on and the three young people fade from the scene  when they are gone and he is alone the colonel still addresses them its barbaras wedding billy boy why are you not at barbaras wedding  soon the bells stop he knows that he is alone now but he does not understand it the sun is shining brightly but he sits very cold in his chair he shivers he is very glad to see his wife coming to him through the open window she is a dear old lady and is dressed brightly as becomes one who has been to a wedding her face beams to match her gown she is really quite a happy woman again for it is several years since any deep sorrow struck her and that is a long time no one you know understands the colonel as she does no one can soothe him and bring him out of his imaginings as she can he hastens to her he is no longer cold that is her great reward for all she does for him  i have come back john she says smiling tranquilly on him it hasnt seemed very long has it  no not long ellen had you a nice walk  she continues to smile but she is watching him closely i havent been for a walk dont you remember where i told you i was going john  yes it was to a wedding  rather tremulously you havent forgotten whose wedding have you  tell me ellen he is no longer troubled he knows that ellen will tell him  i have been seeing barbara married john  yes it was barbaras wedding they wouldntellen why wasnt i there  like one telling him amusing gossip i thought you might be a little troubled if you went john sometimes your mindnot often but sometimes if you are agitatedand then you think you seepeople who arent here any longer oh dear oh dear help me with these bonnet strings  yes i know im all right when you are with me ellen funny isnt it  she raises her shoulders in a laugh it is funny john i ran back to you john i was thinking of you all the timeeven more than of billy boy  the colonel is very gay tell me all about it ellen did billy boy lose the ring we always said he would lose the ring  she looks straight into his eyes you have forgotten again john barbara isnt married to billy boy  he draws himself up not marry billy ill see about that  she presses him into his chair sit down dear and ill tell you something again it is nothing to trouble you because your soldiering is done john and greatly done my dear there is war again and our old land is in it such a war as my soldier never knew  he rises he is a stern old man a war thats it is it so now i know why wasnt i told why havent i my marching orders im not too old yet  yes john you are too old and all you can do now is to sit here andand take care of me you knew all about it quite clearly this morning we stood together upstairs by the window listening to the aircraft guns  i remember i thought it was a thunderstorm dering told me he heard nothing  dering  our gardener you know his voice becomes husky havent i been talking with him ellen  it is a long time since we had a gardener john  is it so it is a war that is why there is no more cricket on the green  they have all gone to the war john  thats it even the little shavers he whispers why isnt billy boy fighting ellen  oh john  is billy boy dead she nods was he killed in action tell me tell me she nods again good for billy boy i knew billy boy was all right dont cry ellen ill take care of you alls well with billy boy  yes i know john  he hesitates before speaking again ellen who is the soldier he comes here he is a captain  he is a very gallant man john it is he who was married to barbara today  bitterly she has soon forgotten  his wife shakes her brave head she hasnt forgotten dear and its nearly three years now since billy died  so long we have a medal he got havent we  no john he died before he could win any medals  the colonel moves about karl will be sorry they were very fond of each other those two boys ellen  karl fought against us john he died in the same engagement they may even have killed each other  they hadnt known ellen  she with thin lips i daresay they knew  billy boy and karl  she tells him some more gossip john i had barbara married from here because she has no people of her own i think billy would have liked it  that was the thing to do ellen nice of you i remember everything now its dering she has married he was once my gardener  the world is all being remade dear he is worthy of her  he lets this pass he has remembered something almost as surprising ellen is barbara a nurse  yes john and one of the staidest and most serene who would have thought it of the merry madcap of other days they are coming here john to say goodbye to you they have only a few days leave she is in france too you know she was married in her nurses uniform  was she she told me today thatno it couldnt have been today  you have been fancying you saw them i suppose she grows tremulous again you will be nice to them john wont you and wish them luck they have their trials before them  he says eagerly tell me what to do ellen  dont say anything about billy boy john  no no lets pretend  and i wouldnt talk about the garden john just in case he is a little touchy about that  the colonel is beginning to fancy himself as a tactician not a word  she knows what is the way to put him on his mettle you see im sure i would make a mess of it so im trusting to you john  he is very pleased leave it all to me ellen ill be frightfully sly you just watch me  she goes to the window and calls to the married couple captain dering in khaki is a fine soldierly figure barbara in her red gross uniform is quiet and resourceful an artful old boy greets them congratulations barbara no no none of your handshaking you dont get past an old soldier in that way excuse me young man he kisses barbara and looks at his wife to make sure that she is admiring him and to you captain deringyou have won a prize  a gallant gentleman answers i know it ill try to show i know it  the colonel is perturbed i havent given barbara a wedding present ellen i should like  barbara breaks in indeed you have dear and a lovely one you havent forgotten  granny signs to the colonel and he immediately says with remarkable cunning ohthat i was just quizzing you barbara i hope you will be as happy dear staid barbara as if you had married he sees that he has nearly given away the situation he looks triumphantly at granny as much as to say observe me im not going to say a word about him  granny comes to his aid perhaps captain dering has some little things to do and you too barbara they are leaving in an hour john  for a moment the colonel is again in danger if you would like to take barbara into the garden captain dering he recovers himself instantly no not the garden you wouldnt know your way about in the garden  wouldnt i colonel the captain says smiling  the answer is quite decisive no certainly not ill show it you some day  he makes gleeful signs to granny but there is a nice meadow just beyond the shrubbery barbara knows the way she often went there with he checks himself granny signs to them to go and barbara kisses both the colonels hands the captain will be jealous you know he says twinkling  let me dear says barbara arranging his cushions professionally  granny nods she is much better at it than i am now john  the colonel has one last piece of advice to give i wouldnt go down by the stream barbaranot to the pool where the alder is therestheres not a good view there sir and a boya boy i knew he oftennobody in particularjust a boy who used to come about the househe is not here nowhe is on duty i dont think you should go to the alder pool barbara  we wont go there dear she and her husband go out and the colonel scarcely misses them he is so eager to hear what his wife thinks of him  did i do all right ellen  splendidly i was proud of you  he exults i put them completely off the scent they havent a notion i can be very sly you know at times ellen i think i should like to have that alder tree cut down there is no boy now you see  i would leave it alone john there will be boys again shall i read to you you like that dont you  yes read to mesomething funny if you please about sam weller no i expect sam has gone to the wars read about mr pickwick he is very amusing i feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bulltrout he would have fallen in just as barbara did this morning  barbara  she is down at the alder pool billy is there with that nice german boy the noise they make shouting and laughing  she gets from its shelf the best book for wartime which bit shall i read  about mr pickwick going into the ladys bedroom by mistake  yes dear though you almost know it by heart you see you have begun to laugh already  you are laughing too ellen i cant help it  she begins to read they are both chuckling       a wellremembered voice   out of the darkness comes the voice of a woman speaking to her dead son  but that was against your wish was it not was that against your wish would you prefer me not to ask that question  the room is so dark that we cannot see her all we know is that she is one of four shapes gathered round a small table beyond the darkness is a great inglenook in which is seated on a settle a man of fifty him we can discern fitfully by the light of the fire it is not sufficiently bright to enable him to read but an evening paper lies on his knee he seems wistful and meek he is paying no attention to the party round the table when he hears their voices it is only as empty sounds  the mother continues perhaps i am putting the question in the wrong way are you not able to tell us any more  a mans voice breaks in there was a distinct movement that time but it is so irregular  i thought so but please dont talk do you want to tell us more is it that you cant hear me distinctly he seems to want to tell us more but something prevents him  in any case mrs don it is extraordinary this is the first seance i have ever taken part in but i must believe now  of course major these are the simplest manifestations they are only the first step but if we are to go on the less we talk the better shall we go on it is not agitating you too much laura  a girl answers there was a moment when ibut i wish i was braver i think it is partly the darkness i suppose we cant have a little light  certainly we can dear darkness is quite unnecessary but i think it helps one to concentrate  the major lights a lamp and though it casts shadows we see now that the room is an artists studio the silent figure in the inglenook is the artist mrs don is his wife the two men are major armitage and an older friend mr rogers the girl is laura bell these four are sitting round the table their hands touching they are endeavouring to commune with one who has crossed the gulf  the major and mr rogers are but passing shadows in the play and even nice laura is only to flit across its few pages for a moment on her way to happier things we scarcely notice them in the presence of mrs don the gracious the beautiful the sympathetic whose magnetic force and charm are such that we wish to sit at her feet at once she is intellectual but with a disarming smile religious but so charitable masterful and yet loved of all none is perfect and there must be a flaw in her somewhere but to find it would necessitate such a rummage among her many adornments as there is now no time for perhaps we may come upon it accidentally in the course of the play  she is younger than mr don who despite her efforts for many years to cover his deficiencies is a man of no great account in a household where the bigger personality of his wife swallows him like an aarons rod mr dons deficiencies she used to try very hard or fairly hard to conceal them from dick but dick knew his mother was his chum all the lovely things which happened in that house in the days when dick was alive were between him and her those two shut the door softly on old don always anxious not to hurt his feelings and then ran into each others arms  in the better light mr don is now able to read his paper if he chooses if he has forgotten the party at the table they have equally forgotten him  mrs don you have not gone away have you we must be patient are you still there  rogers i think i felt a movement  mrs don dont talk please are you still there  the table moves  yes it is your mother who is speaking do you understand that  the table moves  yes what shall i ask him now  rogers we leave it to you mrs don  mrs don have you any message you want to send us yes is it important yes are we to spell it out in the usual way yes is the first letter of the first word a is it b  she continues through the alphabet to l when the table responds similarly she finds that the second letter is o  is the word love yes but i dont understand that movement you are not displeased with us are you no does the second word begin with awith b yes  the second word is spelt out bade and the third me  love bade meif it is a quotation i believe i know it is the fourth word welcome yes  laura love bade me welcome  mrs don that movement again dont you want me to go on  laura let us stop  mrs don not unless he wishes it why are those words so important does the message end there is any one working against you some one antagonistic yes not one of ourselves surely no is it any one we know yes can i get the name in the usual way yes is the first letter of this persons name ab  it proves to be f one begins to notice a quaint peculiarity of mrs dons she is so accustomed to homage that she expects a prompt response even from the shades  is the second letter a  the table moves  fa fa  she is suddenly enlightened  is the word father yes  they all turn and look for the first time at mr don he has heard and rises apologetically  mr don distressed i had no intentionshould i go away grace  she answers sweetly without a trace of the annoyance she must surely feel  mrs don perhaps you had better robert  rogers i suppose it is because he is an unbeliever he is not openly antagonistic is he  mrs don sadly enough i am afraid he is they tend to discuss the criminal as if he was not present  major but he must admit that we do get messages  mrs don reluctantly he says we think we do he says they would not want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say  rogers but we are only on the threshold don this is just a beginning  laura didnt you hear mr donlove bade me welcome  mr don does that strike you as important laura  laura he said it was  mrs don it might be very important to him though we dont understand why  she speaks gently but there is an obstinacy in him despite his meekness  mr don i didnt mean to be antagonistic grace i thought i wasnt thinking of it at all  mrs don not thinking of dick robert and it was only five months ago  mr don who is somehow without meaning it always in the wrong ill go  rogers a boy wouldnt turn his father out ask him  mr don forlornly as to thatas to that  mrs don i will ask him if you wish me to robert  mr don no dont  rogers it cant worry you as you are a disbeliever  mr don no buti shouldnt like you to think that he sent me away  rogers he wont will he mrs don  mr don knowing what her silence implies you see dick and i were not veryno quarrel or anything of that sortbut i i didnt much matter to dick im too old perhaps  mrs don gently i wont ask him robert if you would prefer me not to  mr don ill go  mrs don im afraid it is too late now she turns away from earthly things do you want me to break off  the table moves  yes do you send me your love dick yes and to laura yes she raises her eyes to don and hesitates shall i ask him  mr don no no dont  rogers it would be all right don  mr don i dont know  they leave the table  laura a little agitated may i go to my room mrs don i feel ishould like to be alone  mrs don yes yes laura dear i shall come in and see you  laura bids them goodnight and goes she likes mr don she strokes his hand when he holds it out to her but she cant help saying oh mr don how could you  rogers i think we must all want to be alone after such an evening i shall say goodnight mrs don  major same here i go your way rogers but you will find me a silent companion one doesnt want to talk ordinary things tonight rather not thanks awfully  rogers goodnight don its a pity you know a bit hard on your wife  mr don goodnight rogers goodnight major  the husband and wife left together have not much to say to each other he is depressed because he has spoilt things for her she is not angry she knows that he cant help being as he is and that there are fine spaces in her mind where his thoughts can never walk with her but she would forgive him seventy times seven because he is her husband she is standing looking at a case of fishingrods against the wall there is a jock scott still sticking in one of them mr don says as if somehow they were evidence against him  dicks fishingrods  she says forgivingly i hope you dont mind my keeping them in the studio robert they are sacred things to me  thats all right grace  i think i shall go to laura now  yes in his inexpressive way  poor child  im afraid i hurt her  dick wouldnt have liked itbut dicks gone she looks a little wonderingly at him after all these years she can sometimes wonder a little still i suppose you will resume your evening paper  he answers quietly but with the noble doggedness which is the reason why we write this chapter in his life why not grace  she considers for she is so sure that she must know the answer better than he i suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother than to a father  i daresay  a little gust of passion shakes her how you can read about the war nowadays  he says firmly to herhe has had to say it a good many times to himself im not going to give in but he adds i am so sorry i was in the way grace i wasnt scouting you or anything of that sort its just that i cant believe in it  ah robert you would believe if dick had been to you what he was to me  i dont know  in a sense you may be glad that you dont miss him in the way i do  yes perhaps  goodnight robert  goodnight dear  he is alone now he stands fingering the fishingrods tenderly then wanders back into the inglenook in the room we could scarcely see him for it has gone slowly dark there a grey darkness as if the lamp though still burning was becoming unable to shed light through the greyness we see him very well beyond it in the glow of the fire he sits on the settle and tries to read his paper he breaks down he is a pitiful lonely man  in the silence something happens a wellremembered voice says father mr don looks into the greyness from which this voice comes and he sees his son we see no one but we are to understand that to mr don dick is standing there in his habit as he lived he goes to his boy  dick  i have come to sit with you for a bit father  it is the gay young careless voice  its you dick its you  its me all right father i say dont be startled or anything of that kind we dont like that  my boy  evidently dick is the taller for mr don has to look up to him he puts his hands on the boys shoulders  how am i looking father  you havent altered dick  rather not its jolly to see the old studio again in a cajoling voice i say father dont fuss let us be our ordinary selves wont you  ill try ill try you didnt say you had come to sit with me dick not with me  rather  but your mother  its you i want  me  we can only come to one you see  then why me  thats the reason he is evidently moving about looking curiously at old acquaintances hello heres your old jacket greasier than ever  me but dick it is as if you had forgotten it was your mother who was everything to you it cant be you if you have forgotten that i used to feel so out of it but of course you didnt know  i didnt know it till lately father but heaps of things that i didnt know once are clear to me now i didnt know that you were the one who would miss me most but i know now  though the voice is as boyish as ever there is a new note in it of which his father is aware dick may not have grown much wiser but whatever he does know now he seems to know for certain  me miss you most dick i try to paint just as before i go to the club dick i have been to a dinnerparty i said i wouldnt give in  we like that  but my boy  mr dons arms have gone out to him again dick evidently wriggles away from them he speaks coaxingly  i say father lets get away from that sort of thing  that is so like you dick ill do anything you ask  then keep a bright face  ive tried to  good man i say put on your old greasy you are looking so beastly clean  the old greasy is the jacket and mr don obediently gets into it  anything you like no thats the wrong sleeve thanks dick  they are in the inglenook now and the mischievous boy catches his father by the shoulders  here let me shove you into your old seat  mr don is propelled on to the settle  hows that umpire  dick smiling thats just how you used to butt me into it long ago  dick is probably standing with his back to the fire chuckling  when i was a kid  with the palette in my hand  or sticking to your trousers  the mess we made of ourselves dick  i sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it  till you fell off  on top of you and the palette  it is good fun for a father and son and the crafty boy has succeeded in making the father laugh but soon  ah dick  the son frowns he is not going to stand any nonsense  now then behave what did i say about that face  mr don smiles at once obediently  thats better ill sit here  we see from his fathers face which is smiling with difficulty that dick has plopped into the big chair on the other side of the inglenook his legs are probably dangling over one of its arms  rather sharply got your pipe  i donti dont seem to care to smoke nowadays dick  rot just because i am dead you that pretend to be plucky i wont have it you know you get your pipe and look slippy about it  yes dick the old man says obediently he fills his pipe from a jar on the mantelshelf we may be sure that dick is watching closely to see that he lights it properly  now then burn your thumb with the matchyou always did you know thats the style youve forgotten to cock your head to the side not so bad thats you like it  its rather nice dick dick you and me by the fire  yes but sit still how often we might have been like this father and werent  ah  face how is fido  never a dog missed her master more  oh frowning she doesnt want to go and sit on my grave or any of that tosh does she as if i were there  no no hastily she goes ratting dick  good old fido  dick heres a good one we oughtnt to keep a dog at all because we are on rations now but what do you think fido ate yesterday  let me guess the joint  almost worse than that she ate all the cooks meat tickets  they laugh together but when dick says lightheartedly that dog will be the death of me his father shivers dick does not notice this his eyes have drawn him to the fishingrods  hullo  yes those are your old fishingrods  heres the little hickory do you remember father how i got the sevenpounder on a burntrout cast no you werent there that was a day it was really only six and threequarters i put a stone in its mouth the second time we weighed it  you loved fishing dick  didnt i why werent you oftener with me ill tell you a funny thing when i went a soldiering i used to prayjust standing up you knowthat i shouldnt lose my right arm because it would be so awkward for casting he cogitates as he returns to the inglenook somehow i never thought i should be killed lots of fellows thought that about themselves but i never did it was quite a surprise to me  oh dick  whats the matter oh i forgot face he is apparently looking down at his father wonderingly havent you got over it yet father i got over it so long ago i wish you people would understand what a little thing it is  tell me very humbly tell me dick  all right he is in the chair again  mind i cant tell you where i was killed its against the regulations  i know where  curiously you got a wire i suppose  yes  theres always a wire for officers even for 2nd lieutenants its jolly decent of them  tell me dick about thethe veil i mean the veil that is drawn between the living and the  the dead funny how you jib at that word  i suppose the veil is like a mist  the veils a rummy thing father yes like a mist but when one has been at the front for a bit you cant think how thin the veil seems to get just one layer of it i suppose it seems thin to you out there because one step takes you through it we sometimes mix up those who have gone through with those who havent i daresay if i were to go back to my old battalion the living chaps would just nod to me  dick  wheres that pipe death well to me before my day came it was like some part of the line i had heard a lot about but never been in i mean never been in to stay because of course one often popped in and out  dick the day that you  my day i dont remember being hit you know i dont remember anything till the quietness came when you have been killed it suddenly becomes very quiet quieter even than you have ever known it at home sunday used to be a pretty quiet day at my tutors when trotter and i flattened out on the first shady spot up the river but it is quieter than that i am not boring you am i  my boy  when i came to the veil was so thin that i couldnt see it at all and my first thought was which side of it have i come out on the living ones lying on the ground were asking that about themselves too there we were all sitting up and asking whether we were alive or dead and some were one and some were the other sort of fluke you know  iioh dick  as soon as each had found out about himself he wondered how it had gone with his chums i hallood to johnny randall and he hallood back that he was dead but that trotter was living thats the way of it a good deal of chaff of course by that time the veil was there and getting thicker and we lined up on our right sides then i could only see the living ones in shadow and hear their voices from a distance they sang out to us for a while but just at first father it was rather lonely when we couldnt hear their tread any longer what are you fidgeting about you neednt worry that didnt last long we were heaps more interested in ourselves than in them you should have heard the gabbling it was all so frightfully novel you see and no one quite knew what to do next whether all to start off together or wait for some one to come for us i say what a lot im talking  what happened dick  oh a proud ring coming into the voice ockley came for us he used to be alive you knowthe ockley who was keeper of the fives in my first half i once pointed him out to mother i was jolly glad he was the one who came for us as soon as i saw it was ockley i knew we should be all right  dick i like that ockley  rather i wish i could remember something funny to tell you though there are lots of jokes but i am such a one for forgetting them  he laughs boisterously we may be sure that he flings back his head you remember how dick used to fling back his head when he laughedno you didnt know him  father do you remember little wantage who was at my private and came on to ridleys house in my third half his mother was the one you called emily  emily wantages boy  thats the card we used to call him jemima because he and his mother were both caught crying when lockup struck and she had to clear out  she was very fond of him dick  oh i expect no end tell her hes killed  she knows  she had got a wire that isnt the joke though you see he got into a hopeless muddle about which side of the veil he had come out on and he went off with the other ones and they wouldnt have him and he got lost in the veil running up and down it calling to us and just for the lark we didnt answer he chuckles i expect he has become a ghost with sudden consideration best not tell his mother that  mr don rises wincing and dick also is at once on his feet full of compunction  was that shabby of me sorry father we are all pretty young you know and we cant help having our fun still  im glad you still have your fun the father says once more putting his hands on dicks shoulders let me look at you again dick there is such a serenity about you now  serenity thats the word none of us could remember what the word was its a ripping good thing to have i should be awfully bucked if you would have it too  ill try  i say how my tongue runs on but after all it was my show now you tell me some things  what about dick the war  no almost in a shout we have a fine for speaking about the war and you know those fellows we were fightingi forget who they were  the germans  oh yes some of them were on the same side of the veil with us and they were rather decent so we chummed up in the end and ockley took us all away together they were jolly lucky in getting ockley there i go again come on its your turn has the bathroom tap been mended yet  im afraid it isjust tied up with that string still dick it works all right  it only needs two screwnails you know  ill see to it  do you know whether any one at my tutors got his fives choice this half  im sorry dick but  or who is the captain of the boats  no i  whatever have you been doing he is moving about the room hullo heres mothers workbox is mother all right  very sad about you dick  oh i say that isnt fair why doesnt she cheer up  it isnt so easy my boy  its pretty hard lines on me you know  how is that  if you are sad i have to be sad thats how we have got to work it off you cant think how we want to be bright  ill always remember that and ill tell your mother ah but she wont believe me dick you will have to tell her yourself  i cant do that father i can only come to one  she should have been the one she loved you best dick  oh i dont know do you ever with a slight hesitation see laura now  she is staying with us at present  is she i think i should like to see her  if laura were to see you  oh she wouldnt see me she is not dressed in black is she  no in white  good girl i suppose mother is in black  surely dick  its too bad you know  you werent exactlyengaged to laura were you dick a bold question from a father but the circumstances were unusual apologetically i never rightly knew  no dick has flung back his head again confidentially father i sometimes thought of it but it rather scared me i expect that is about how it was with her too  she is very broken about you now  irritated oh hang  would you like her to forget you dick  rather not but she might help a fellow a bit hullo  what calls forth this exclamation is the little table at which the seance had taken place the four chairs are still standing round it as if they were guarding something  heres something new father this table  yes it is usually in the drawingroom  of course i remember  mr don sets his teeth does that table suggest anything to you dick  to me let me think yes i used to play backgammon on it what is it doing here  your mother brought it in  to play games on mother  i dontknow that it was a game dick  but to play anything im precious glad she can do that was laura playing with her  she was helping her  good for laura he is looking at some slips of paper on the table are those pieces of paper used in the game there is writing on them the first letter is hthe second letter is athe third letter is r what does it mean  does it convey no meaning to you dick  to me no why should it  mr don is enjoying no triumph let us go back to the fire my boy  dick follows him into the inglenook but why should it convey a meaning to me i was never much of a hand at indoor games brightly i bet you ockley would be good at it after a joyous ramble ockleys nickname still sticks to him  i dont think i know it  he was a frightful swell you know keeper of the field and played against harrow the same year i suppose it did go just a little to his head  they are back in their old seats and mr don leans forward in gleeful anticipation probably dick is leaning forward in the same way and this old father is merely copying him  what did you nickname him dick  it was his fags that did it  i should like to know it i say do tell me dick  he is pretty touchy about it now you know  i wont tell any one come on dick  his fags called him kcmg  meaning meaning dick  meaning kindly call me god  mr don flings back his head so we know what dick is doing they are a hilarious pair perhaps too noisy for suddenly mr don looks at the door  i think i heard some one dick  perhaps its mother  she may nervously have heard the row  dicks eyes must be twinkling i say father youll catch it  i cant believe dick gazing wistfully into the chair that she wont see you  it is a sadder voice than his own for the moment that answers only one may see me  you will speak to her dick let her hear your voice  only one may hear me i could make her the one but it would mean your losing me  i cant give you up dick  mrs don comes in as beautiful as ever but a little aggrieved  i called to you robert  yes i thoughti was just going to  he has come from the inglenook to meet her he looks from her to dick whom he sees so clearly standing now by the fire an awe falls upon mr don he says her name meaning see grace who is with us  her eyes follow his but she sees nothing not even two arms outstretched to her what is it robert what is the matter  she does not hear a voice say mother  i heard you laughing robert what on earth at  the father cannot speak  now youre in a hole father says a mischievous voice  can i not be told robert  something in the paper the voice whispers  mr don lifts the paper feebly and his wife understands oh a newspaper joke please i dont want to hear it  was it my laughing that brought you back grace  no that would only have made me shut my door if dick thought you could laugh she goes to the little table i came back for these slips of paper she lifts them and presses them to her breast these precious slips of paper  dick was always a curious boy and forgetting that she cannot hear him he blurts out how do you mean mother why are they precious  mr don forgets also and looks to her for an answer  what is it robert  didnt youhear anything grace  no perhaps laura was calling i left her on the stair  i wish mr don is fighting for dick now i wish laura would come back and say goodnight to me  i daresay she will  and valiantly if she could berather brighter grace  robert  i think dick would like it  her fine eyes reproach him mutely but she says ever forgiving is that how you look at it robert very well laugh your fillif you can but if dick were to appear before me tonight  in his distress mr don cries aloud to the figure by the fire dick if you can appear to your mother do it  there is a pause in which anything may happen but nothing happens yes something happened dick has stuck to his father  really robert mrs don says and without a word of reproach she goes away evidently dick comes to his father who has sank into a chair and puts a loving hand on him mr don clasps it without looking up  father that was tophole of you poor mother i should have liked to hug her but i cant  you should have gone to her dick you shouldnt have minded me  the wiser boy says mothers a darling but she doesnt need me as much as you do  i dont know  thats all right im glad shes so keen about that game though  he has returned to the inglenook when laura comes in eager to make amends to dicks father if she hurt him when she went out  softly i have come to say goodnight mr don  its nice of you laura taking both her hands  dick speaks i want her to come nearer to the fire i cant see her very well there  for a moment mr don is caught out again but laura has heard nothing he becomes quite cunning in dicks interests  your hands are cold laura go over to the fire i want to look at you  she sits on the hearthstone by dicks feet  shyly am i all right  it is dick who answers youre awfully pretty laura you are even prettier than i thought i remember i used to think she cant be quite as pretty as i think her and then when you came you were just a little prettier  she has been warming her hands why dont you say anything she asks mr don  i was thinking of you and dick laura  what a pretty soul she has father says the boy i can see right down into it now  if dick had lived laura do you think that you and he  with shining eyes i thinkif he had wanted it very much  i expect he would my dear  there is an odd candour about dicks contribution i think so too but i never was quite sure they are a very young pair  laura is trembling a little mr don  yes laura  i think there is something wicked about me i sometimes feel quite lightheartedthough dick has gone  perhaps nowadays the fruit trees have that sort of shame when they blossom laura but they cant help doing it i hope you are yet to be a happy woman a happy wife  it seems so heartless to dick  not a bit its what i should like dick says  its what he would like laura  do you remember laura dick goes on i kissed you once it was under a lilac in the loudon woods i knew at the time that you were angry and i should have apologised im sorry laura  his sweetheart has risen tasting something bittersweet what is it laura mr don asks  somehowi dont know howbut for a moment i seemed to feel the smell of lilac dick was oncenice to me under a lilac oh mr don she goes to him like a child and he soothes and pets her  there there that will be all right quite all right he takes her to the door goodnight my dear  goodnight mr don  goodbye laura says the third voice  mr don is looking so glum that the moment they are alone dick has to cry warningly face he is probably looking glum himself for he says candidly pretty awful things these partings father dont feel hurt though i dodge the goodbye business when i leave you  thats so like you dick  ill have to go soon  oh dick cant you  theres something i want not to miss you see  im glad of that  im not going yet but i mean that when i do ill just slip away  what i am afraid of is that you wont come back  i willhonest injunif you keep bright  but if i do that dick you might think i wasnt missing you so much  we know better than that you see if youre bright ill get a good mark for it  ill be bright  dick pops him into the settle again  remember your pipe  yes dick  do you still go to that swimmingbath and do your dumbbell exercises  no i  you must  all right dick i will  and i want you to be smarter next time your hairs awful  ill get it cut dick  are you hard at work over your picture of those three graces  no i put that away im just doing little things nowadays i cant  look here sonny youve got to go on with it you dont seem to know how interested i am in your future  very well dick ill bring it out again  mr don hesitates  dick there is something i have wanted to ask you all the time  some fear seems to come into the boys voice dont ask it father  i shall go on worrying about it if i dontbut just as you like dick  go ahead father ask me  it is this would you rather beherethan there  after a pause the boy says not always  what is the great difference dick  well down here one knows he has risks to run  and you miss that  it must be rather jolly  did you know that was what i was to ask  yes but remember im young at it  and your gaiety dick is it all real or only put on to help me  itsits half and half father  face he cries next moment then cajolingly father kcmg  when will you come again dick  theres no saying one cant always get through they keep changing the password his voice grows troubled its awfully difficult to get the password  what was it tonight  love bade me welcome  mr don rises he stares at his son  how did you get it dick  im not sure dick seems to go closer to his father as if for protection there are lots of things i dont understand yet  there are things i dont understand either dick did you ever try to send messagesfrom thereto us  me no  or get messages from us  no how could we  is there anything in it  mr don is not speaking to his son he goes to the little table and looks long at it has it taken on a sinister aspect those chairs are they guarding a secret  dick this tableyour motherhow could they  he turns to find that dick has gone  dick my boy dick  the wellremembered voice leaves a message behind it  be bright father  mr don sits down by the fire to think it all out
