character and with andalusia the attempt is especially fascinating for it is a land of contrasts in which work upon one another diversely a hundred influences  in london now as i write the rain of an english april pours down the sky is leaden and cold the houses in front of me are almost terrible in their monotonous greyness the slate roofs are shining with the wet now and again people pass a woman of the slums in a dirty apron her head wrapped in a grey shawl two girls in waterproofs trim and alert notwithstanding the inclement weather one with a musiccase under her arm a train arrives at an underground station and a score of city folk cross my window sheltered behind their umbrellas and two or three groups of workmen silently smoking short pipes they walk with a dull heavy tramp with the gait of strong men who are very tired still the rain pours down unceasing  and i think of andalusia my mind is suddenly ablaze with its sunshine with its opulent colour luminous and soft i think of the cities the white cities bathed in light of the desolate wastes of sand with their dwarf palms the broom in flower and in my ears i hear the twang of the guitar the rhythmical clapping of hands and the castanets as two girls dance in the sunlight on a holiday i see the crowds going to the bullfight intensely living manycoloured and a thousand scents are wafted across my memory i remember the cloudless nights the silence of sleeping towns and the silence of desert country i remember old whitewashed taverns and the perfumed wines of malaga of jerez and of manzanilla the rain pours down without stay in oblique long lines the light is quickly failing the street is sad and very cheerless i feel on my shoulder the touch of dainty hands of little hands with tapering fingers and on my mouth the kisses of red lips and i hear a joyous laugh i remember the voice that bade me farewell that last night in seville and the gleam of dark eyes and dark hair at the foot of the stairs as i looked back from the gate feliz viage mi inglesito  it was not love i felt for you rosarito i wish it had been but now far away in the rain i fancy oh no not that i am at last in love but perhaps that i am just faintly enamouredof your recollection      but these are all spanish things and more than half ones impressions of andalusia are connected with the moors not only did they make exquisite buildings they moulded a whole people to their likeness the andalusian character is rich with oriental traits the houses the mode of life the very atmosphere is moorish rather than christian to this day the peasant at his plough sings the same quavering lament that sang the moor and it is to the invaders that spain as a country owes the magnificence of its golden age it was contact with them that gave the spaniards cultivation it was the conflict of seven hundred years that made them the best soldiers in europe and masters of half the world the long struggle caused that tension of spirit which led to the adventurous descent upon america teaching recklessness of life and the fascination of unknown dangers and it caused their downfall as it had caused their rise for the religious element in the racial war occasioned the most cruel bigotry that has existed on the face of the earth so that the victors suffered as terribly as the vanquished the moors hounded out of spain took with them their arts and handicraftsas the huguenots from france after the revocation of the edict of nantesand though for a while the light of spain burnt very brightly the light borrowed from moordom the oil jar was broken and the lamp flickered out      in most countries there is one person in particular who seems to typify the race whose works are the synthesis as it were of an entire people bernini expressed in this manner a whole age of italian society and even now his spirit haunts you as you read the gorgeous sins of roman noblemen in the pages of gabriele dannunzio and murillo though the expert not unjustly from their special point of view see in him but a mediocre artist in the same way is the very quintessence of southern spain wielders of the brush occupied chiefly with technique are apt to discern little in an old master save the craftsman yet art is no more than a link in the chain of life and cannot be sharply sundered from the civilisation of which it is an outcome even velasquez sans peer sans parallel throws a curious light on the world of his day and the cleverest painters would find their knowledge and understanding of that great genius the fuller if they were acquainted with the plays of lope de la vega and the satires of quevedo notwithstanding murillos obvious faults as you walk through the museum at seville all andalusia appears before you nothing could be more characteristic than the religious feeling of the many pictures than the exuberant fancy and utter lack of idealisation in the contrast between a holy family by murillo and one by perugino is all the difference between spain and italy murillos virgin is a peasant girl such as you may see in any village round seville on a feastday her emotions are purely human and in her face is nothing more than the intense love of a mother for her child but the italian shows a creature not of earth an angelic maid with almond eyes oval of face she has a strange air of unrealness for her body is not of human flesh and blood and she is linked with mankind only by an infinite sadness she seems to see already the dolorous way and her eyes are heavy with countless unwept tears  one picture especially that which the painter himself thought his best work saint thomas of villanueva distributing alms to my mind offers the entire impression of that full life of andalusia in the splendour of mitre and of pastoral staff in the sober magnificence of architecture is all the opulence of the catholic church in the worn patient ascetic face of the saint is the mystic fervid piety which distinguished so wonderfully the warlike and barbarous spain of the sixteenth century and lastly in the beggars covered with sores pale starving with their malodorous rags you feel strangely the swarming poverty of the vast population downtrodden and vivacious which you read of in the picaresque novels of a later day and these same characteristics the deep religious feeling the splendour the poverty the extreme sense of vigorous life the discerning may find even now among the andalusians for all the modern modes with which as with coats of london and bonnets of paris they have sought to liken themselves to the rest of europe  and the colours of murillos palette are the typical colours of andalusia rich hot and deepagain contrasting with the enamelled brilliance of the umbrians he seems to have charged his brush with the very light and atmosphere of seville the country bathed in the splendour of an august sun has just the luminous character the haziness of contour which characterise the paintings of murillos latest manner they say he adopted the style termed vaporoso for greater rapidity of execution but he cannot have lived all his life in that radiant atmosphere without being impregnated with it in andalusia there is a quality of the air which gives all things a limpid brilliant softness the sea of gold poured out upon them voluptuously rounds away their outlines and one can well imagine that the master deemed it the culmination of his art when he painted with the same aureate effulgence when he put on canvas those gorgeous tints and that exquisite mellowness     ii  sidenote the churches of ronda   that necessity of realism which is perhaps the most conspicuous of spanish traits shows itself nowhere more obviously than in matters religious it is a very listless emotion that is satisfied with the shadow of the ideal and the belief of the andaluz is an intensely living thing into which he throws himself with a vehemence that requires the nude and brutal fact his saints must be fashioned after his own likeness for he has small power of makebelieve and needs all manner of substantial accessories to establish his faith but then he treats the images as living persons and it never occurs to him to pray to the saint in paradise while kneeling before his presentment upon earth the spanish girl at the altar of mater dolorosa prays to a veritable woman able to speak if so she wills able to descend from the golden shrine to comfort the devout worshipper to her nothing is more real than these madonnas with their dark eyes and their abundant hair maria del pilar who is mary of the fountain maria del rosario who is mary of the rosary maria de los dolores maria del carmen maria de los angeles and they wear magnificent gowns of brocade and of clothofgold mantles heavily embroidered shoes rings on their fingers rich jewels about their necks  in a little town like ronda so entirely apart from the world povertystricken this desire for realism makes a curiously strong impression the churches coated with whitewash are squalid cold and depressing and at first sight the row of images looks nothing more than a somewhat vulgar exhibition of waxwork but presently as i lingered the very poverty of it all touched me and forgetting the grotesqueness i perceived that some of the saints in their elaborate dresses were quite charming and graceful in the church of santa maria la mayor was a saint catherine in rich habiliments of red brocade with a white mantilla arranged as only a spanish woman could arrange it she might have been a young gentlewoman of fifty years back when costume was gayer than nowadays arrayed for a fashionable wedding or for a bullfight and in another church i saw a youthful saint in priests robes a cassock of black silk and a short surplice of exquisite lace he held a bunch of lilies in his hand and looked very gently his lips almost trembling to a smile one can imagine that not to them would come the suppliant with a heavy despair they would be merely pained at their helplessness before the tears of the grief that kills and the woe of mothers sorrowing for their sons but when the blackeyed maiden knelt before the priest courtly and debonair begging him to send a husband quickly his lips surely would control themselves no longer and his smile would set the damsels cheek ablushing and if a youth knelt before saint catherine in her dainty mantilla and vowed his heart was breaking because his love gave him stony glances she would look very graciously upon him so that his courage was restored and he promised her a silver heart as lovers in greece made votive offerings to aphrodite  at the church of the espirito santo in a little chapel behind one of the transept altars i saw through a huge rococo frame of gilded wood a maria de los dolores that was almost terrifying in poignant realism she wore a robe of black damask which stood as if it were cast of bronze in heavy austere folds a velvet cloak decorated with the old lace known as rose point despagne and on her head a massive imperial diadem and a golden aureole seven candles burned before her and at vespers when the church was nearly dark they threw a cold sharp light upon her countenance her eyes were in deep shadow strangely mysterious and they made the face so small beneath the pompous crown horribly lifelike you could not see the tears but you felt they were eyes which would never cease from weeping  i suppose it was all tawdry and vulgar and common but a woman knelt in front of the mother of sorrows praying a poor woman in a ragged shawl i heard a sob and saw that she was weeping she sought to restrain herself and in the effort a tremor passed through her body and she drew the shawl more closely round her  i walked away and came presently to the most cruel of all these images it was a pietà the mother held on her knees the dead son looking in his face and it was a ghastly contrast between her royal array and his naked body she too wore the imperial crown with its golden aureole and her cloak was of damask embroidered with heavy gold her hair fell in curling abundance about her breast and the sacristan told me it was the hair of a lady who had lost her husband and her only son but the dead christ was terrible his face half hidden by the long straight hair long as a womans and his body thin and all discoloured from the wounds thick blood poured out and their edges were swollen and red the broken knees the feet and hands were purple and green with the beginning of putrefaction     iii  sidenote ronda   ronda is set deep among the mountains between algeciras and seville they hem it in on all sides and it straggles up and down little hills timidly as though its presence were an affront to the wild rocks around it the houses are huddled against the churches which look like portly hens squatting with ruffled feathers while their chicks for warmth press up against them it is very cold in ronda i saw it first quite early over the town hung a grey mist shining in the sunlight and the mountains opalescent in the morning glow were so luminous that they seemed hardly solid they looked as if one could walk through them the people covering their mouths in dread of a pulmonia hastened by closely muffled in long cloaks as i passed the open doors i saw them standing round the brasero warming themselves for fireplaces are unknown to andalusia the only means of heat being the copa a round brass dish in which is placed burning charcoal  the height and the cold give ronda a character which reminds one of northern spain the roofs are quite steep the houses low and small built for warmth rather than as in the rest of andalusia for coolness  but the whitewash and the barred windows with their wooden latticework remind you that you are in moorish country in the very heart of it and ronda indeed figures in chronicles and in old ballads as a stronghold of the invaders the temperature affects the habits of the people even their appearance there is no lounging about the squares or at the doors of wineshops the streets are deserted and their great breadth makes the emptiness more apparent the first setters out of the town had no need to make the ways narrow for the sake of shade and they are in fact so broad that the houses on either side might be laid on their faces and there would still be room for the rapid stream which hurries down the middle  the conformation of a spanish town even though it lack museums and fine buildings gives it an interest beyond that of most european places the moorish design is always evident that wise people laid out the streets as was most convenient tortuous and narrow at cordova or broad as a kings highway in ronda the moors stayed their time and their hour struck and they went the houses had fallen to decay and been more than once rebuilt the christians returned and mahomet fled before the saints it was no shame since they grossly outnumbered him the mosque was made a church and the houses as they fell were built again but on the same foundations and in the same way the streets have remained as the moors left them the houses still are built round little courtyardsthe patioas the moors built them and the windows are barred and latticed as of old the better to protect beauty whose dark eyes flash too meaningly at wandering strangers whose red lips are over ready to break into a smile for the peace of an absent husband      after the busy clamour of gibraltar that antnest of a hundred nationalities ronda impresses you by its peculiar silence the lack of sound is the more noticeable in the frosty clearness of the atmosphere and is only emphasised by an occasional cry that floats from some vast distance along the air the coldness too has pinched the features of the people and they seem to grow old even earlier than in the rest of andalusia strapping fellows of thirty with slim figures and a youthful air have the faces of elderly men and their skin is hard stained and furrowed the women ageing as rapidly have no gaiety if spanish girls have frequently a beautiful youth their age too often is atrocious it is inconceivable that a handsome woman should become so fearful a hag the luxuriant hair is lost and she takes no pains to conceal her grey baldness the eye loses its light the enchanting down of the upper lip turns to a bristly moustache the features harden grow coarse and vulgar and the countenance assumes a rapacious expression so that she appears a bird of prey and her strident voice is like the shriek of vultures it is easily comprehensible that the spanish stage should have taken the old woman as one of its most constant characteristic types but in ronda even the girls have a weary look as though life were not so easy a matter as in warmer places or as the good god intended and they seem to suffer from the brevity of youth which is no sooner come than gone they walk inertly clothed in sombre colours their hair not elaborately arranged as would have it the poorest cigarettegirl but merely knotted without the flower which the sevillan is popularly said to insist upon even at the cost of a dinner and when they go out the grey shawls they wrap about their heads add to their unattractiveness     iv  sidenote the swineherd   but if ronda itself is a somewhat dull and unsympathetic place with nothing more for the edification of the visitor than a melodramatic chasm the surrounding country is worthy the most extravagant epithets the mountains have the gloomy barrenness the slategrey colour of volcanic ranges they encircle the town in a gigantic amphitheatre rugged and overbearing like titans turned to stone they seem indeed to wear a sombre insolence of demeanour as though the aspect of human kind moved them to lofty contempt and in their magnificent desolation they offer a fit environment for the exploits of byronic heroes the handsome villain of romance seductive by the complexity of his emotions by the persistence of his mysterious grief would find himself in that theatrical scene most thoroughly at home nor did prosper mérimée fail to seize the opportunity for the mountains of ronda were the very huntingground of don josè who lost his soul for carmen but as a matter of history they were likewise the haunts of brigands in flesh and bloodmalefactors in the past had that sense of the picturesque which now is vested in the amateur photographerand this particular district was as dangerous to the travelling merchant as any in spain  the environs of ronda are barren and unfertile the olive groves bear little fruit i wandered through the lonely country towards the mountains the day was overcast and the clouds hung sluggishly overhead as i walked suddenly i heard a melancholy voice singing a peasant song a malagueña i paused to listen but the sadness was almost unendurable and it went on interminably wailing through the air with the insistent monotony of its moorish origin i struck into the olives to find the singer and met a swineherd guarding a dozen brown pigs a youth thin of face with dark eyes clothed in undressed sheepskins and the brown wool gave him a singular appearance of community with the earth about him he stood among the trees like a wild creature more beast than man and the lank busy pigs burrowed around him running to and fro with little squeals he ceased his song when i approached and looked up timidly i spoke to him but he made no answer i offered a cigarette but he shook his head  i went my way and at first the road was not quite solitary two men passed me on donkeys vaya usted con dios they criedgo you with god it is the commonest greeting in spain and the most charming the roughest peasant calls it as you meet him a dozen grey asses went towards ronda one after the other their panniers filled with stones they walked with hanging heads resigned to all their pain but when at last i came into the mountains the loneliness was terrible not even the olive grew on those dark masses of rock windswept and sterile there was not a hut nor a cottage to testify of mans existence not even a path such as the wild things of the heights might use all life indeed appeared incongruous with that overwhelming solitude  daylight was waning as i returned but when i passed the olivegrove where many hours before i had heard the malagueña the same monotonous song still moaned along the air carrying back my thoughts to the swineherd i wondered what he thought of while he sang whether the sad words brought him some dim emotion how curious was the life he led i suppose he had never travelled further than his native town he could neither write nor read madrid to him was a city where the streets were paved with silver and the kings palace was of fine gold he was born and grew to manhood and tended his swine and some day he would marry and beget children and at length die and return to the mother of all things it seemed to me that nowadays when civilisation has become the mainstay of our lives it is only with such beings as these that it is possible to realise the closeness of the tie between mankind and nature to the poor herdsman still clung the soil he was no foreign element in the scene but as much part of it as the stunted olives belonging to the earth intimately as the trees among which he stood as the beasts he tended      when i came near the town the sun was setting in the west tempestuous clouds were massed upon one another and the sun shone bloodred above them but as it sank they were riven asunder and i saw a great furnace that lit up the whole sky the mountains were purple unreal as the painted mountains of a picture the light was gone from the east and there everything was chill and grey the barren rocks looked so desolate that one shuddered with horror of the cold but the sun fell gold and red and the rift in the clouds was a kingdom of gorgeous light the earth and its petty inhabitants died away and in the crimson flame i could almost see lucifer standing in his glory godlike and young lucifer in all majesty surrounded by his court of archangels beelzebub belial moloch abaddon      i had discovered in the morning from the steeple of santa maria a queer ruined church and was oddly impressed by the bare façade with the yawning apertures of empty windows i went to it but every entrance was bricked up save one which had a door of rough boards fastened by a padlock and in a neighbouring house i found an old man with a key it was a spot of utter desolation the roof had gone or had never been the custodian could not tell whether the church was the wreck of an old building or a framework that had never been completed the walls were falling to decay along the nave and in the chapels trees were growing shrubs and rank weeds it was curious the utter ruin in the midst of the populous town pigs ran hither and thither feeding with noisy grunts as they burrowed about the crumbling altar  the old man inquired whether i wished to buy the absolute uselessness of the place fascinated me i asked the price he looked me up and down and seeing i was foreign suggested a ridiculous sum and while i amused myself with bargaining i wondered what on earth one could do with a ruined church in ronda half a dozen fantastic notions passed through my mind but they were really too melodramatic  and now when the sun had set i returned notwithstanding his suspicions i induced the keeper to give me his key he could not understand what i desired at such an hour in that solitary place and asked if i wished to sleep there but i calmed his fears with a pesetamoney goes a long way in spainand went in alone the pigs had been removed and all was silent a few bats flitted to and fro quickly the light fell away greyly the cold descended on the ruin and it became very strange and mysterious presently the roofless chapels seemed to grow alive with weird invisible things the rank weeds exhaled chill odours and in the lonely silence a mass began at the ruined altar ghostly priests officiated passing quietly from side to side with bows and genuflections the bell tinkled as they raised an invisible host soon it became quite dark and the moon shone through the great empty windows of the façade     v  sidenote medinat azzahra   in what you divine rather than in what you see lies half the charm of andalusia in the suggestion of all manner of delicate antique things in the vivid memory of past grandeur the moors have gone but still they inhabit the land in spirit and not seldom in a spectral way seem to regain their old dominion often towards evening as i rode through the desolate country i thought i saw an halfnaked moor ploughing his field urging the lazy oxen with a long goad often the spaniard on his horse vanished and i saw a muslim knight riding in pride and glory his velvet cloak bespattered with the gold initial of his lady and her favour fluttering from his lance once near granada standing on a hill i watched the bloodred sun set tempestuously over the plain and presently in the distance the gnarled olivetrees seemed living beings and i saw contending hosts two ghostly armies silently battling with one another i saw the flash of scimitars and the gleam of standards the whiteness of the turbans they fought with horrible carnage and the land was crimson with their blood then the sun fell below the horizon and all again was still and lifeless  and what can be more fascinating than that magic city of azzahra the wonder of its age of which now not a stone remains it was made to satisfy the whim of a concubine by a sultan whose flamboyant passion moved him to displace mountains for the sake of his beloved and the memory thereof is lost so completely that even its situation till lately was uncertain azzahra the fairest said to abderrahman her lord raise me a city that shall take my name and be mine the khalif built at the foot of the mountain which is called the hill of the bride but when at last the lady from the great hall of the palace gazed at the snowwhite city contrasting with the dark mountain she remarked see o master how beautiful this girl looks in the arms of yonder ethiopian the jealous khalif immediately commanded the removal of the offending hill and when he was convinced the task was impossible ordered that the oaks and other mountain trees which grew upon it should be uprooted and figtrees and almonds planted in their stead  imagine the hall of the khalif with walls of transparent and manycoloured marble with roof of gold on each side were eight doors fixed upon arches of ivory and ebony ornamented with precious metals and with precious stones and when the sun penetrated them the reflection of its rays upon the roof and walls was sufficient to deprive the beholders of sight in the centre was a great basin filled with quicksilver and the sultan wishing to terrify a courtier would cause the metal to be set in motion whereupon the apartment would seem traversed by flashes of lightning and all the company would fall atrembling  the old author tells of running streams and of limpid water of stately buildings for the household guards and magnificent palaces for the reception of high functionaries of state of the thronging soldiers pages eunuchs slaves of all nations and of all religions in sumptuous habiliments of silk and of brocade of judges theologians and poets walking with becoming gravity in the ample courts alas that poets now should rush through fleet street with unseemly haste attired uncouthly in bowler hats and in preposterous tweeds      from the celebrated legend of roderick the goth to that last scene when boabdil handed the keys of granada to king ferdinand the history of the moorish occupation reads far more like romance than like sober fact it is rich with every kind of passionate incident it has all the strange vicissitudes of oriental history what career could be more wonderful than that of almanzor who began life as a professional letterwriter a calling which you may still see exercised in the public places of madrid or seville and ended it as absolute ruler of an empire his charm of manner his skill in flattery the military genius which he developed when occasion called his generosity and sense of justice his love of literature and art make him a figure to be contemplated with admiration and when you add his utter lack of scruple his selfishness his ingratitude his perfidy you have a character complex enough to satisfy the most exacting  those who would read of these things may find an admirable account in mr lanepooles moors in spain but i cannot renounce the pleasure of giving one characteristic detail after the death of abderrahman the builder of that magnificent city of azzahra a paper was found in his own handwriting upon which he had noted those days in his long reign which had been free from all sorrow they numbered fourteen sovereign lord of a country than which there is on earth none more delightful his life had been of uninterrupted prosperity success in peace and war attended him always he possessed everything that it was possible for man to have these are the observations of al makkary the arabic historian when he narrates the incident  o man of understanding wonder and observe the small portion of real happiness the world affords even in the most enviable position praise be given to him the lord of eternal glory and everlasting empire there is no god but he the almighty the giver of empire to whomsoever he pleases     vi  sidenote the mosque   but cordova from which azzahra was about four miles distant has visible delights that can vie with its neighbours vanished pomp i know nothing that can give a more poignant emotion than the interior of the mosque at cordova and yet i remember well the splendour of barbaric and oriental magnificence which was my first sight of st marks at venice as i came abruptly from the darkness of an alley into the golden light of the piazza but to me at least the famous things of italy known from childhood in picture and in description afford more than anything a joyful sense of recognition a feeling as it were of homecoming such as may hope to experience the devout christian on entering upon his heritage in the kingdom of heaven the mosque of cordova is oriental and barbaric too but i had never seen nor imagined anything in the least resembling it there was no disillusionment possible as too often in italy for the accounts i had read prepared me not at all for that overwhelming impression it was so weird and strange i felt myself transported suddenly to another world  they were singing vespers when i entered and i heard the shrill voices of choristers crying the responses it did not sound like christian music the mosque was dimly lit the air heavy with incense and i saw this forest of pillars extending every way as far as the eye could reach it was mysterious and aweinspiring as those enchanted forests of ones childhood in which huge trees grew in serried masses and where in cavernous darkness goblins and giants of the fairytales wild beasts and monstrous shapes lay in wait for the terrified traveller who had lost his way i wandered keeping the christian chapels out of sight trying to lose myself among the columns and now and then gained views of horseshoe arches interlacing decorated with moorish tracery  at length i came to the mihrab which is the holy of holies the most exquisite as well as the most sacred part of the mosque it is approached by a vestibule of which the roof is a miracle of grace with mosaics that glow like precious stones ultramarine scarlet emerald and gold the arch between the chambers is ornamented with four pillars of coloured marble and again with mosaic the gold letters of an arabic inscription forming on the deep sapphire of the background a decorative pattern the mihrab itself which contained the famous koran of othman has seven sides of white marble and the roof is a huge shell cut from a single block  i tried to picture to myself the mosque before the christians laid their desecrating hands upon it the floor was of coloured tiles tiles such as may still be seen in the alhambra of granada and in the alcazar at seville the columns are of marble of porphyry and jasper tradition says they came from carthage from pagan temples in france and christian churches in spain they are slender and unadorned they must have contrasted astonishingly with the roof of larch wood all ablaze with gold and with vermilion  there were three hundred chandeliers and eight thousand lampscast of christian bellshung from the roof the arab writer tells of gold shining from the ceiling like fire blazing like lightning when it darts across the clouds the pulpit wherein was kept the koran was of ivory and of exquisite woods of ebony and sandal of plantain citron and aloe fastened together with gold and silver nails and encrusted with priceless gems it needed six khalifs and almanzor the great vizier to complete the mosque of which arab writers with somewhat prosaic enthusiasm said that in all the lands of islam there was none of equal size none more admirable in its workmanship in its construction and durability      then the christians conquered cordova and the charming civilisation of the moors was driven out by monks and priests and soldiers first they built only chapels in the outermost aisles but in a little while to make room for a choir they destroyed six rows of columns and at last when master martin luther had rekindled catholic piety they set up a great church in the very middle of the mosque the story of this vandalism is somewhat quaint and one detail at least affords a suggestion that might prove useful in the present time for the town council of cordova menaced with death all who should assist in the work one imagines that a similar threat from the lord mayor of london might have a salutary effect upon the restorers of westminster abbey or the decorators of st pauls how very much more entertaining must have been the world when absolutism was the fashion and the preposterous method of universal suffrage had never been considered but the chapter as those in power always are was bent upon restoring and induced charles v to give the necessary authority the king however had not understood what they wished to do and when later he visited cordova and saw what had happened he turned to the dignitaries who were pointing out the improvements and said you have built what you or others might have built anywhere but you have destroyed something that was unique in the world the words show a fine scorn but as a warning to later generations it would have been more to the purpose to cut off a dozen priestly heads  yet oddly enough the christian additions are not so utterly discordant as one would expect hernan ruiz did the work well even though it was work he might conveniently have been drawn and quartered for doing typically spanish in its fine proportion in its exuberance of fantastic decoration his church is a masterpiece of plateresque architecture nor are the priests entirely out of harmony with the building wherein they worship for an hour they had sung vespers and the deep voices of the canons chaunting monotonously rang weird and long among the columns but they finished and left the choir one by one walking silently across the church to the sacristy the black cassock and the scarlet hood made a fine contrast while the short cambric surplice added to the costume a most delicate grace one of them paused to speak with two ladies in mantillas and the three made a picturesque group suggesting all manner of old spanish romance     vii  sidenote the court of oranges   i went into the cathedral from the side and issuing by another door found myself in the court of oranges the setting sun touched it with warm light and overhead the sky was wonderfully blue in moorish times the mosque was separated from the court by no dividingwall so that the arrangement of pillars within was continued by the even lines of orangetrees these are of great age and size laden with fruit and in their copious foliage stand with a trim selfassurance that is quite imposing  in the centre round a fountain into which poured water from jets at the four corners stood a number of persons with jars of earthenware and bright copper cans one girl held herself with the fine erectness of a caryatid while her jar propped against the side filled itself with the cold sparkling water a youth some vessel in his hand leaned over in an attitude of easy grace and looking into her eyes appeared to pay compliments which she heard with superb indifference a little boy ran up and the girl held aside her jar while he put his mouth to the spout and drank then as it overflowed she lifted it with comely motion to her head and slowly walked away  by now the canons had unrobed and several strolled about the court in the sun smoking cigarettes the acolytes with the removal of their scarlet cassocks were become somewhat ragged urchins playing pitch and toss with much gesture and vociferation two of them quarrelled fiercely because one player would not yield the halfpenny he had certainly lost and the altercation must have ended in blows if a corpulent elderly cleric had not indignantly reproved them and boxed their ears a row of tattered beggars very well contented in the sunshine were seated on a step likewise smoking cigarettes and obviously they did not consider their walk of life unduly hard  and the thought impressed itself upon me while i lingered in that peaceful spot that there was far more to be said for the simple pleasures of sense than northern folk would have us believe the english have still much of that ancient puritanism which finds a vague sinfulness in the uncostly delights of sunshine and colour and ease of mind it is well occasionally to leave the eager turmoil of great cities for such a place as this where one may learn that there are other more natural ways of living that it is possible still to spend long days undisturbed by restless passion without regret or longing content in the various show that nature offers asking only that the sun should shine and the happy seasons run their course  an english engineer whom i had seen at the hotel approaching me expressed the idea in his own graphic manner down here there are a good sight more beer and skittles in life than up in sheffield  one canon especially interested me a little thin man bent and wrinkled apparently of fabulous age but still something of a dandy for he wore his clothes with a certain air as though half a century before byronically he had been quite a devil with the ladies the silver buckle on his shoes was most elegant and he protruded his foot as though the violet silk of his stocking gave him a discreet pleasure to the very backbone he was an optimist finding existence evidently so delightful that it did not even need rosecoloured spectacles he was an amiable old man perhaps a little narrow but very indulgent to the follies of others he had committed no sin himselffor many years a suspicion of personal vanity is in itself proof of a pure and gentle mind and as for the sins of othersthey were probably not heinous and at all events would gain forgiveness the important thing surely was to be sound in dogma the day wore on and the sun now shone only in a narrow space and this the canon perambulated smoking the end of a cigarette the delectable frivolity of which contrasted pleasantly with his great age he nodded affably to other priests as they passed a pair of young men and one obese old creature with white hair and an expression of comfortable selfesteem he removed his hat with a great and courteous sweep when a lady of his acquaintance crossed his path the priests basking in the warmth were like four great black cats it was indeed a pleasant spot and contentment oozed into one by every pore the canon rolled himself another cigarette smiling as he inhaled the first sweet whiffs and one could not but think the sovereign herb must greatly ease the journey along the steep and narrow way which leads to paradise the smoke rose into the air lazily and the old cleric paused now and again to look at it the little smile of selfsatisfaction breaking on his lips  up in the north under the cold grey sky god almighty may be a hard taskmaster and the kingdom of heaven is attained only by much endeavour but in cordova these things come more easily the aged priest walks in the sun and smokes his cigarillo heaven is not such an inaccessible place after all evidently he feels that he has done his dutywith the help of havana tobaccoin that state of life wherein it has pleased a merciful providence to place him and st peter would never be so churlish as to close the golden gates in the face of an ancient canon who sauntered to them jauntily with the fag end of a cigarette in the corner of his mouth let us cultivate our cabbages in the best of all possible worlds and afterwardsdieu pardonnera cest son métier      three months later in the porvenir under the heading suicide of a priest i read that one of these very canons of the cathedral at cordova had shot himself a report was heard said the journal and the civil guard arriving found the man prostrate with blood pouring from his ear a revolver by his side he was transported to the hospital the sacrament administered and he died in his pockets they found a letter a pawnticket a womans bracelet and some peppermint lozenges he was thirtyfive years old the newspaper moralised as follows when even the illustrious order to which the defunct belonged is tainted with such a crime it is well to ask whither tends the incredulity of society which finds an end to its sufferings in the barrel of a revolver let moralists and philosophers combat with all their might this dreadful tendency let them make even the despairing comprehend that death is not the highest good but the passage to an unknown world where according to christian belief the ill deeds of this existence are punished and the virtuous rewarded     viii  sidenote cordova   ronda owing its peculiarities to the surrounding mountains was not really very characteristic of the country and might equally well have been an highland townlet in any part of southern europe but cordova offers immediately the full sensation of andalusia it is absolutely a moorish city white and taciturn so that you are astonished to meet people in european dress rather than arabs in shuffling yellow slippers the streets are curiously silent for the carriage as in tangiers is done by mules and donkeys which walk so quietly that you never hear them sometimes you are warned by a deepvoiced cuidado but more often a pannier brushing you against the wall brings the first knowledge of their presence on looking up you are again surprised to see not a great shining negro in a burnouse but a spaniard in tight trousers with a broadbrimmed hat  and cordova has that sweet exhilarating perfume of andalusia than which nothing gives more vividly the complete feeling of the country those travellers must be obtuse of nostril who do not recognise different smells grateful or offensive in different places no other peculiarity is more distinctive so that an odour crossing by chance ones sense is able to recall suddenly all the complicated impressions of a strange land when i return from england it is always that subtle fragrance which first strikes me a mingling in warm sunlight of orangeblossom incense and cigarette smoke and two whiffs of a certain brand of tobacco are sufficient to bring back to me seville the most enchanting of all my memories i suppose that nowhere else are cigarettes consumed so incessantly for in andalusia it is not only certain classes who use them but every one without distinction of age or stationfrom the ragamuffin selling lotterytickets in the street to the portly solemn priest to the burly countryman the shopkeeper the soldier after all no better means of killing time have ever been devised and consequently to smoke them affords an occupation which most thoroughly suits the spaniard      i looked at cordova from the belltower of the cathedral the roofs very lovely in their diversity of colour were of rounded tiles fading with every variety of delicate shade from russet and brown to yellow and the tenderest green from the courtyards here and there rose a tall palm or an orangetree like a dash of jade against the brilliant sun the houses plainly whitewashed have from the outside so mean a look that it is surprising to find them handsome and spacious within they are built moorish fashion round a patio which in cordova at least is always gay with flowers when you pass the iron gates and note the contrast between the snowy gleaming of the street and that southern greenery the suggestion is inevitable of charming people who must rest there in the burning heat of summer with those surroundings and in such a country passion grows surely like a poisonous plant at night in the starry darkness how irresistible must be the flashing eyes of love how eloquent the pleading of whispered sighs but woe to the maid who admits the ardent lover among the orangetrees her head reeling with the sweet intoxication of the blossom for the spanish gallant is fickle quick to forget the vows he spoke so earnestly he soon grows tired of kissing and mounting his horse rides fast away  the uniformity of limewashed houses makes cordova the most difficult place in the world wherein to find your way the streets are exactly alike so narrow that a carriage could hardly pass paved with rough cobbles and tortuous their intricacy is amazing labyrinthine they wind in and out of one another leading nowhither they meander on for half a mile and stop suddenly or turn back so that you are forced to go in the direction you came you may wander for hours trying to find some point that from the steeple appeared quite close sometimes you think they are interminable     ix  sidenote the bridge of calahorra   the bridge that the moors built over the guadalquivir straggles across the water with easy arches somewhat dilapidated and very beautiful it has not the strenuous look of such things in england and the mere sight of it fills you with comfort the clustered houses with an added softness from the light burning mellow on their roofs and on their white walls increase the happy impression that the world is not necessarily hurried and toilful and the town separated from the river by no formal embankment lounges at the waters edge like a giant prone on the grass and lazy stretching his limbs after the midday sleep  there is no precipitation in such a place as cordova life is quite long enough for all that it is really needful to do to him who waits come all things and a little waiting more or less can be of no great consequence let everything be taken very leisurely for there is ample time yet in other parts of andalusia they say the cordovese are the greatest liars and the biggest thieves in spain which points to considerable industry the traveller hearing this will doubtless ask what business has the pot to call the kettle black and it is true that the standard of veracity throughout the country is by no means high but this can scarcely be termed a vice for the andalusians see in it nothing discreditable and it can be proved as exactly as a proposition of euclid that vice and virtue are solely matters of opinion in southern spain bosom friends lie to one another with complete freedom no man would take his wifes word but would believe only what he thought true and think no worse of her when he caught her fibbing mendacity is a thing so perfectly understood that no one is abashed by detection in england most men equivocate and nearly all women but they are ashamed to be discovered they blush and stammer and hesitate or fly into a passion the wiser spaniard laughs shrugging his shoulders and utters a dozen rapid falsehoods to make up for the first it is always said that a good liar needs an excellent memory but he wants more qualities than thatunblushing countenance the readiest wit a manner to beget confidence in fact it is so difficult to lie systematically and well that the ardour of the andalusians in that pursuit can be ascribed only to an innate characteristic their imaginations indeed are so exuberant that the bald fact is to them grotesque and painful they are like writers in love with words for their own sake who cannot make the plainest statement without a gay parade of epithet and metaphor they embroider and decorate they colour and enhance the trivial details of circumstance they must see themselves perpetually in an attitude they must never fail to be effective they lie for arts sake without reason or rhyme from mere devilry often when it can only harm them mendacity then becomes an intellectual exercise such as the poets sonneteering to an imaginary ladylove  but the cordovan very naturally holds himself in no such unflattering estimation the motto of his town avers that he is a warlike person and a wise one      cordoba casa de guerrera gente     y de sabiduria clara fuente  and the history thereof with its university and its khalifs bears him out art and science flourished there when the rest of europe was enveloped in mediæval darkness when our saxon ancestors lived in dirty hovels barbaric brutes who knew only how to kill to eat and to propagate their species the moors of cordova cultivated all the elegancies of life from versemaking to cleanliness      i was standing on the bridge the river flowed tortuously through the fertile plain broad and shallow and in it the blue sky and the white houses of the city were brightly mirrored in the distance like a vapour of amethyst rose the mountains while at my feet in midstream there were two mills which might have been untouched since moorish days there had been no rain for months the water stood very low and here and there were little islands of dry yellow sand on which grew reeds and sedge in such a spot might easily have wandered the halfnaked fisherman of the oriental tale bewailing in melodious verse the hardness of his lot since to his net came no fish seeking a broken pot or a piece of iron wherewith to buy himself a dinner there might he find a ring halfburied in the sand which when he rubbed to see if it were silver a smoke would surely rise from the water increasing till the light of day was obscured and half dead with fear he would perceive at last a gigantic body towering above him and a voice more terrible than the thunder of allah crying what wishest thou from thy slave o king know that i am of the jin and suleyman whose name be exalted enslaved me to the ring that thou hast found  in cordova recollections of the arabian nights haunt you till the commonest sights assume a fantastic character and the frankly impossible becomes mere matter of fact you wonder whether your life is real or whether you have somehow reverted to the days when scheherazade with her singular air of veracity recited such enthralling stories to her lord as to save her own life and that of many other maidens i looked along the river and saw three slender trees bending over it reflecting in the placid water their leafless branches and under them knelt three women washing clothes were they three beautiful princesses whose fathers had been killed and they expelled from their kingdom and thus reduced to menial occupations who knows indeed i thought it very probable for so many royal persons have come down in the world of late but i did not approach them since kings daughters under these circumstances have often lost one eye and their morals are nearly always of the worst description     x  sidenote puerta del puente   i went back to the old gate which led to the bridge close by in the little place was the hut of the consumo the local customhouse with officials lounging at the door or sitting straddlelegged on chairs lazily smoking opposite was a tobacconists with the gaudy red and yellow sign campañia arrendataria de tabacos and a dramshop where three hardy spaniards from the mountains stood drinking aguardiente than this by the way there is in the world no more insidious liquor for at first you think its taste of aniseed and peppermint very disagreeable but perseverance here as in other human affairs has its reward and presently you develop for it a liking which time increases to enthusiasm in spain the land of custom and usage everything is done in a certain way and there is a proper manner to drink aguardiente to sip it would show a lamentable want of decorum a spaniard lifts the little glass to his lips and with a comic abrupt motion tosses the contents into his mouth immediately afterwards drinking water a tumbler of which is always given with the spirit it is really the most epicurean of intoxicants because the charm lies in the aftertaste the water is so cool and refreshing after the fieriness it gives without the gasconnade the emotion keats experienced when he peppered his mouth with cayenne for the greater enjoyment of iced claret  but the men wiped their mouths with their hands and came out of the wine shop mounting their horses which stood outsideshaggy longhaired beasts with high saddles and great boxstirrups they rode slowly through the gate one after the other in the easy slouching way of men who have been used to the saddle all their lives and in the course of the week are accustomed to go a good many miles in an easy jogtrot to and from the town it seems to me that the spaniards resolve themselves into types more distinctly than is usual in northern countries while between individuals there is less difference these three cleanshaven and uniformly dressed of middle size stout with heavy strong features and small eyes certainly resembled one another very strikingly they were the typical innkeepers of goyas pictures but obviously could not all keep inns doubtless they were farmers horsedealers or foragemerchants shrewd men of business with keen eyes for the main chance that class is the most trustworthy in spain kind hospitable and honest they are oldfashioned people with many antique customs and preserve much of the courteous dignity which made their fathers famous  a string of grey donkeys came along the bridge their panniers earthladen poor miserable things that plodded slowly and painfully with heads bent down placing one foot before the other with the donkeys peculiar motion patiently doing a thing they had patiently done ever since they could bear a load they seemed to have a dull feeling that it was no use to make a fuss or to complain it would just go on till they dropped down dead and their carcases were sold for leather and glue there was a spanish note in the red trappings braided and betasselled but all worn discoloured and stained  inside the gate they stopped waiting in a huddled group with the same heavy patience for the examination of the consumo an officer of the customhouse went round with a long steel prong which he ran into the baskets one by one to see that there was nothing dutiable hidden in the earth then sparing of his words he made a sign to the driver and sat down again straddlewise on his chair arre burra the first donkey walked slowly on and as they heard the tinkling of the leaders bell the rest stepped forward in the long line their heads hanging down with that hopeless movement of the feet      in the night wandering at random through the streets their silent whiteness filled me again with that intoxicating sensation of the arabian nights i looked through the iron gateways as i passed into the patios with their dark foliage and once i heard the melancholy twang of a guitar i was sure that in one of those houses the three princesses had thrown off their disguise and sat radiant in queenly beauty their raven tresses falling in a hundred plaits over their shoulders their fingers stained with henna and their long eyelashes darkened with kohl but alas though i lost my way i found them not  yet many an amorous spaniard too passionate to be admitted within his mistress house stood at her window this method of philandering surely most conducive to the ideal is variously known as comer hierro to eat iron and pelar la pava to pluck the turkey one imagines that the cold air of a winters night must render the most ardent lover platonic it is a significant fact that in spanish novels if the hero is left for two minutes alone with the heroine there are invariably asterisks and some hundred pages later a baby so it is doubtless wise to separate true love by iron bars and perchance beautys eyes flash more darkly to the gallant standing without the gate illusions the magic flower of passion arise more willingly but in spain the blood of youth is very hot love laughs at most restraints and notwithstanding these precautions often enough there is a catastrophe the spaniard who will seduce any girl he can is pitiless under like circumstances to his own womenkind so there is much weeping the girl is turned out of doors and falls readily into the hands of the procuress in the brothels of seville or of madrid she finds at least a roof and bread to eat and the fickle swain goes his way rejoicing  i found myself at last near the puerta del puente and i stood again on the moorish bridge the town was still and mysterious in the night and the moon shone down on the water with a hard and brilliant coldness the three trees with their bare branches looked yet more slender naked and alone like preraphaelite trees in a landscape of pélléas et mélisande the broad river almost stagnant was extraordinarily calm and silent i wondered what strange things the placid guadalquivir had seen through the centuries on its bosom many a body had been borne towards the sea it recalled those mysterious waters of the eastern tales which brought to the marble steps of palaces great chests in which lay a fair youths headless corpse or a sleeping beautiful maid     xi  sidenote seville   the impression left by strange towns and cities is often a matter of circumstance depending upon events in the immediate past or on the chance which during his earliest visit there befell the traveller after a stormy passage across the channel newhaven from the mere fact of its situation on solid earth may gain a fascination which closer acquaintance can never entirely destroy and even birmingham first seen by a lurid sunset may so affect the imagination as to appear for ever like some infernal splendid city restless with the hurried toil of gnomes and goblins so to myself seville means ten times more than it can mean to others i came to it after weary years in london heartsick with much hoping my mind dull with drudgery and it seemed a land of freedom there i became at last conscious of my youth and it seemed a belvedere upon a new life how can i forget the delight of wandering in the sierpes released at length from all imprisoning ties watching the various movement as though it were a stageplay yet half afraid that the falling curtain would bring back reality the songs the dances the happy idleness of orangegardens the gay turbulence of seville by night ah there at least i seized life eagerly with both hands forgetting everything but that time was short and existence full of joy i sat in the warm sunshine inhaling the pleasant odours reminding myself that i had no duty to do then or the morrow or the day after i lay abed thinking how happy effortless and free would be my day mounting my horse i clattered through the narrow streets over the cobbles till i came to the country the air was fresh and sweet and aguador loved the spring mornings when he put his feet to the springy turf he gave a little shake of pleasure and without a sign from me broke into a gallop to the amazement of shepherds guarding their wild flocks to the confusion of herds of brown pigs scampering hastily as we approached he and i excited by the wind singing in our ears we pelted madly through the country and the whole land laughed with the joy of living  but i love also the recollection of seville in the grey days of december when the falling rain offered a grateful contrast to the unvarying sunshine then new sights delighted the eye new perfumes the nostril in the decay of that long southern autumn a more sombre opulence was added to the gay colours a different spirit filled the air so that i realised suddenly that old romantic spain of ferdinand and isabella it lay adying still gorgeous in corruption sober yet flamboyant rich and povertystricken squalid magnificent the white streets the dripping trees the clouds gravid with rain gave to all things an adorable melancholy a sad poetic charm looking back i cannot dismiss the suspicion that my passionate emotions were somewhat ridiculous but at twentythree one can afford to lack a sense of humour      but seville at first is full of disillusion it has offered abundant material to the idealist who as might be expected has drawn of it a picture which is at once common and pretentious your idealist can see no beauty in sober fact but must array it in all the theatrical properties of a vulgar imagination he must give to things more imposing proportions he colours gaudily nature for him is ever posturing in the full glare of footlights really he stands on no higher level than the housemaid who sees in every woman a duchess in black velvet an aubrey plantagenet in plain john smith so i in common with many another traveller expected to find in the guadalquivir a river of transparent green with orangegroves along its banks where wandered oxeyed youths and maidens beautiful palmtrees i thought rose towards heaven like passionate souls longing for release from earthly bondage spanish women fullbreasted and sinuous danced boleros fandangos while the air rang with the joyous sound of castanets and toreadors in picturesque habiliments twanged the light guitar  alas the guadalquivir is like yellow mud and moored to the busy quays lie cargoboats lading fruit or grain or mineral there no perfume scents the heavy air the nights indeed are calm and clear and the stars shine brightly but the river banks see no amours more romantic than those of stokers from liverpool or glasgow and their ladyloves have neither youth nor beauty  yet seville has many a real charm to counterbalance these lost illusions he that really knows it like an ardent lover with his mistress imperfections would have no difference even the guadalquivir so matteroffact really so prosaic has an unimagined attractiveness the crowded shipping the hurrying porters add to that sensation of vivacity which is of seville the most fascinating characteristic and seville is an epitome of andalusia with its life and death with its colour and vivid contrasts with its boyish gaiety  it is a city of delightful ease of freedom and sunshine of torrid heat there it does not matter what you do nor when nor how you do it there is none to hinder you none to watch each takes his ease and is content that his neighbour should do the like doubtless people are lazy in seville but good heavens why should one be so terribly strenuous go into the plaza nueva and you will see it filled with men of all ages of all classes taking the sun they promenade slowly untroubled by any mental activity or sit on benches between the palmtrees smoking cigarettes perhaps the more energetic read the bullfighting news in the paper they are not ambitious and they do not greatly care to make their fortunes so long as they have enough to eat and drinkfood is very cheapand cigarettes to smoke they are quite happy the corporation provides seats and the sun shines down for nothingso let them sit in it and warm themselves i daresay it is as good a way of getting through life as most others  a southern city never reveals its true charm till the summer and few english know what seville is under the burning sun of july it was built for the great heat and it is only then that the refreshing coolness of the patio can be appreciated in the streets the white glare is mitigated by awnings that stretch from house to house and the half light in the sierpes the high street has a curious effect the people in their summer garb walk noiselessly as though the warmth made sound impossible towards evening the sailcloths are withdrawn and a breath of cold air sinks down the population bestirs itself and along the sierpes the cafés become suddenly crowded and noisy  then for it was too hot to ride earlier i would mount my horse and cross the river the guadalquivir had lost its winter russet and under the blue sky gained varied tints of liquid gold of emerald and of sapphire i lingered in triana the gipsyquarter watching the people beautiful girls stood at the windows so that the whole way was lined with them and their lips were not unwilling to break into charming smiles one especially i remember who was used to sit on a balcony at a streetcorner her hair was irreproachable in its elaborate arrangement and the red carnation in it gleamed like fire against the night her face was long fairercomplexioned than is common with regular and delicate features she sat at her balcony with a huge book open on her knee which she read with studied disregard of the passersby but when i looked back sometimes i saw that she had lifted her eyes lustrous and dark and they met mine gravely  and in the country i passed through long fields of golden corn which reached as far as i could see i remembered the spring when it had all been new soft fresh green and presently i turned round to look at seville in the distance bathed in brilliant light glowing as though its walls were built of yellow flame the giralda arose in its wonderful grace like an arrow so slim so comely it reminded one of an arab youth with long thin limbs with the setting sun gradually the city turned rosyred and seemed to lose all substantiality till it became a manyshaped mist that was dissolved in the tenderness of the sky  late in the night i stood at my window looking at the cloudless heaven from the earth ascended like incense the mellow odours of summertime the belfry of the neighbouring church stood boldly outlined against the darkness and the storks that had built their nest upon it were motionless not stirring even as the bells rang out the hours the city slept and it seemed that i alone watched in the silence the sky still was blue and the stars shone in their countless millions i thought of the city that never rested of london with its unceasing roar the endless streets the greyness and all around me was a quiet serenity a tranquillity such as the christian may hope shall reward him in paradise for the troublous pilgrimage of life but that is long ago and passed for ever     xii  sidenote the alcazar   arriving at seville the recollection of cordova took me quickly to the alcazar but i was a little disappointed it has been ill and tawdrily restored with crude pigments with gold that is too bright and too clean but even before that charles v and his successors had made additions out of harmony with moorish feeling of the palace where lived the mussulman kings nothing indeed remains but pedro the cruel with whom the edifice now standing is more especially connected was no less oriental than his predecessors and he employed morisco architects to rebuild it parts are said to be exact reproductions of the older structure while many of the beautiful tiles were taken from moorish houses  the atmosphere then is but half arabic the rest belongs to that flaunting multicoloured barbarism which is characteristic of northern spain before the union of arragon and castile wandering in the deserted courts looking through horseshoe windows of exquisite design at the wild garden pedro the cruel and maria de padilla are the figures that occupy the mind  seville teems with anecdotes of the monarch who according to the point of view has been called the cruel and the just he was an amorist for whom platonic dalliance had no charm and there are gruesome tales of ladies burned alive because they would not quench the flame of his desires of others fiercely virtuous who poured boiling oil on face and bosom to make themselves unattractive in his sight but the head that wears a crown apparently has fascinations which few women can resist and legend tells more frequently of pedros conquests than of his rebuffs he was an ardent lover to whom marriage vows were of no importance that he committed bigamy is certainand pardonable but some historians are inclined to think that he had at one and the same time no less than three wives he was oriental in his tastes  in imitation of the paynim sovereigns pedro loved to wander in the streets of seville at night alone and disguised to seek adventure or to see for himself the humour of his subjects and like them also it pleased him to administer justice seated in the porch of his palace if he was often hard and proud towards the nobles with the people he was always very gracious to them he was the redressor of wrongs and a protector of the oppressed his justice was that of the mussulman rulers rapid terrible and passionate often quaint for instance a rich priest had done some injury to a cobbler who brought him before the ecclesiastical tribunals where he was for a year suspended from his clerical functions the tradesman thought the punishment inadequate and taking the law into his own hands gave the priest a drubbing he was promptly seized tried condemned to death but he appealed to the king who with a witty parody of the rival court changed the punishment to suspension from his trade and ordered the cobbler for twelve months to make no boots  on the other hand the alcazar itself has been the scene of pedros vilest crimes in the whole list of which is none more insolent none more treacherous than that whereby he secured the priceless ruby which graces still the royal crown of england there is a school of historians which insists on finding a baptist minister in every herothink what a poorblooded creature they wish to make of the glorious nelsonbut no casuistry avails to cleanse the memory of pedro of castille even for his own ruthless age he was a monster of cruelty and lust indeed the indignation with which his biographers have felt bound to charge their pens has somewhat obscured their judgment they have so eagerly insisted on the censure with which themselves regard their heros villainies that they have found little opportunity to explain a complex character yet the story of his early life affords a simple key to his maturity till the age of fifteen he lived in prisons suffering with his mother every insult and humiliation while his fathers mistress kept queenly state and her children received the honours of royal princes when he came to the throne he found himself a catspaw between his natural brothers and ambitious nobles his nearest relatives were ever his bitterest enemies and he was continually betrayed by those he trusted even his mother delivered to the rebellious peers the strongholds and the treasures he had left in her charge and caused him to be taken prisoner as a boy he had been violent and impetuous yet always loyal but before he was twenty he became suspicious and mistrustful in his weakness he made craft and perfidy his weapons practising to compose his face to feign forgetfulness of injury till the moment of vengeance he learned to dissemble so that none could tell his mind and treated no courtiers with greater favour than those upon whose death he had already determined  intermingled with this career of vice and perfidy and bloodshed is the love of maria de padilla whom the king met when he was eighteen and till her death loved passionatelywith brief inconstancies for fidelity has never been a royal virtue and she figures with gentle pathos in that grim history like wild perfumed flowers on a stormbeaten coast after the assassination of the unfortunate blanche the french queen whom he loathed with an extraordinary physical repulsion pedro acknowledged a secret marriage with maria de padilla which legitimised her children but for ten years before she had been treated with royal rights the historian says that she was very beautiful but her especial charm seems to have been that voluptuous grace which is characteristic of andalusian women she was simple and pious with a nature of great sweetness and she never abused her power her influence as runs the hackneyed phrase was always for good and untiringly she did her utmost to incline her despot lover to mercy she alone sheds a ray of light on pedros memory only her love can save him from the execration of posterity when she died rich and poor alike mourned her and the king was inconsolable he honoured her with pompous obsequies and throughout the kingdom ordered masses to be sung for the rest of her soul      the guardians of the alcazar show you the chambers in which dwelt this gracious lady and the gardenfountain wherein she bathed in summer moralists anxious to prove that the way of righteousness is hard say that beauty dies but they err for beauty is immortal the habitations of a lovely woman never lose the enchantment she has cast over them her comeliness lingers in their empty chambers like a subtle odour and centuries after her very bones have crumbled to dust it is her presence alone that is felt her footfall that is heard on the marble floors  garish colours alas have driven the tender spirit of maria de padilla from the royal palace but it has betaken itself to the old garden and there wanders sadly it is a charming place of rare plants and exotic odours cypress and tall palm trees rise towards the blue sky with their irresistible melancholy their faraway suggestion of burning deserts and at their feet the ground is carpeted with violets yet to me the wild roses brought strangely recollections of england of long summer days when the air was sweet and balmy the birds sang heavenly songs the same songs as they sing in june in the fat kentish fields the gorgeous palace had only suggested the long past days of history and seville the joy of life and the love of sunshine but the old quiet garden took me far away from spain so that i longed to be again in england in thought i wandered through a garden that i knew in years gone by filled also with flowers but with hollyhocks and jasmine the breeze carried the sweet scent of the honeysuckle to my nostrils and i looked at the green lawns with the broad straight lines of the grassmower the low of cattle reached my ears and wandering to the fence i looked into the fields beyond yellow cows grazed idly or lay still chewing the cud they stared at me with listless sleepy eyes  but i glanced up and saw a flock of wild geese flying northwards in long lines that met making two sides of a huge triangle they flew quickly in the cloudless sky far above me and presently were lost to view about me was the tall boxwood of the southern garden and tropical plants with rich flowers of yellow and red and purple a dark firtree stood out ragged and uneven like a spirit of the north erect as a life without reproach but the foliage of the palms hung down with a sad adorable grace     xiii  sidenote calle de las sierpes   in seville the andalusian character thrives in its finest flower and nowhere can it be more conveniently studied than in the narrow sinuous crowded thoroughfare which is the oddest street in europe the calle de las sierpes is merely a pavement hardly broader than that of piccadilly without a carriageway the houses on either side are very irregular some are tall fourstoreyed others quite tiny some are well kept and freshly painted others dilapidated it is one of the curiosities of seville that there is no particularly fashionable quarter and as though some moralising ruler had wished to place before his people a continual reminder of the uncertainty of human greatness by the side of a magnificent palace you will find a hovel  at no hour of the day does the calle de las sierpes lack animation but to see it at its best you must go towards evening at seven oclock for then there is scarcely room to move fine gentlemen stand at the club doors or sit within looking out of the huge windows the merchants and the students smoking cigarettes saunter wrapped magnificently in their capos cigarettegirls pass with roving eyes they suffer from no false modesty and smile with pleasure when a compliment reaches their ears admirers do not speak in too low a tone and the fair sevillan is never hard of hearing  newspaper boys with shrill cries announce evening editions porvenir noticiero vendors of lotterytickets wander up and down audaciously offering the first prize quien quiere el premio gardo beggars follow you with piteous tales of fasts improbably extended but most striking is the gente flamenca the bullfighter with his numerous hangerson the torerostoreador is an unknown word good for comic opera and persons who write novels of spanish life and cannot be bothered to go to spainthe toreros sit in their especial cafe the cerveceria national or stand in little groups talking to one another they are distinguishable by the coleta which is a little plait of hair used to attach the chignon of fulldress it is the dearest ambition of the aspirant to the bullring to possess this ornament he grows it as soon as he is fullfledged and it is solemnly cut off when the weight of years and the responsibility of landed estates induce him to retire from the profession the bullfighter dresses peculiarly and the gente flamenca imitates him so far as its means allow a famous matador is as well paid as in england a cabinet minister or a musichall artiste this is his costume a broadbrimmed hat with a low crown which is something like a topper absurdly flattened down with brims preposterously broadened out the front of his shirt is befrilled and embroidered and his studs are the largest diamonds not even financiers in england wear such important stones he wears a low collar without a necktie but ties a silk handkerchief round his neck like an english navvy an eton jacket fitting very tightly brown black or grey with elaborate frogs and much braiding the trousers skintight above loosen below and show off the lower extremities when like the heroes of feminine romance the wearer has a fine leg indeed it is a mode of dress which exhibits the figure to great advantage and many of these young men have admirable forms  in their strong picturesque way they are often very handsome they have a careless grace of gesture a manner of actors perfectly at ease in an effective part a brutal healthiness there is a flamboyance in their bearing a melodramatic swagger which is most diverting and their faces so contrasted are the colours so strongly marked the features are full of interest clean shaven the beard shows violet through the olive skin they have high cheek bones and thin almost hollow cheeks with eyes set far back in the sockets dark and lustrous under heavy brows the black hair admirably attached to the head is cut short shaved on the temples and over the ears brushed forward as in other countries is fashionable with gentlemen of the box it fits the skull like a second tighter skin the lips are red and sensual the teeth white regular and well shaped the bullfighter is remarkable also for the diamond rings which decorate his fingers and the massive gold the ponderous seals of his watchchain  who can wonder then that maidens fair their hearts turning to thoughts of love should cast favourable glances upon this hero of a hundred fights the conquests of tenors and granddukes and fiddlers are insignificant beside those of a bullfighter and the certainty of feminine smiles is another inducement for youth to exchange the drudgery of menial occupations for the varied excitement of the ring      at night the sierpes is different again little by little the people scatter to their various homes the shops are closed the clubs put out their lights and by one the loiterers are few the contrast is vivid between the noisy throng of daytime and this sudden stillness the emptiness of the winding street seems almost unnatural the houses losing all variety are intensely black and above the sinuous line of sky is brilliant with clustering stars a drunken roysterer reels from a taverndoor his footfall echoing noisily along the pavement but quickly he sways round a corner and the silence more impressive for the interruption returns the nightwatchman huddled in a cloak of many folds is sleeping in a doorway dimly outlined by the yellow gleam of his lantern  then i a lover of late hours returning seek the guardia sevillan houses are locked at midnight by this individual who keeps the latchkeys of a whole street and is supposed to be on the lookout for tardy comers i clap my hands such being the spanish way to attract attention and shout but he does not appear he is a goodnatured round man bibulous with grey hair and a benevolent manner i know his habits and resign myself to inquiring for him in the neighbouring dramshops i find him at last and assail him with all the abuse at my command he is too tipsy to answer or to care and follows me jangling his keys he fumbles with them at the door blaspheming because they are so much alike and finally lets me in  buena noche descanse v bien     xiv  sidenote characteristics   it is a hazardous thing to attempt the analysis of national character for after all however careful the traveller may be in his inquiries it is from the few individuals himself has known that his most definite impressions are drawn of course he can control his observations by asking the opinion of foreigners long resident in the country but curiously enough in andalusia precisely the opposite occurs from what elsewhere is usual aliens in england france or italy with increasing comprehension acquire also affection and esteem for the people among whom they live but i have seldom found in southern spain a foreignerand there are many merchants engineers and the like with intimate knowledge of the inhabitantswho had a good word to say for the andalusians  but perhaps it is in the behaviour of crowds that the most accurate picture of national character can be obtained like composite photographs which give the appearance of a dozen people together but a recognisable portrait of none the multitude offers as it were a likeness in the rough without precision of detail yet with certain marked features more obviously indicated the crowd is an individual without responsibility unoppressed by the usual ties of prudence and decorum who betrays himself because he lacks entirely selfconsciousness and the desire to pose in spain the crowd is above all things goodhumoured fond of a joke so long as it is none too subtle excitable of course and prone to rodomontade yet practical eager to make the best of things and especially to get its moneys worth if below the surface there are a somewhat brutal savagery a cruel fickleness these are traits common with all human beings together assembled they are merely evidence of mans close relationship to ape and tiger  from contemporary novels more or less the same picture appears and also from the newspapers though in these somewhat idealised for the press bound to flatter for its living represents its patrons as do some portraitpainters not as they are but as they would like to be in the eyes of andalusian journalists their compatriots are for ever making a magnificent gesture and the condition would be absurd if a hornets nest of comic papers tempering vanity with a lively sense of the ridiculous did not save the situation by abundantly coarse caricatures  it is vanity then which emerges as the most distinct of national traits a vanity so egregious so childish so grotesque that the onlooker is astounded the andalusians have a passion for gorgeous raiment and for jewellery they must see themselves continually in the brightest light standing for ever on some alpine eminence of vice or virtue in full view of their fellow men like schoolboys they will make themselves out desperate sinners to arouse your horror and if that does not impress you accomplished actors ready to suit your every mood they will pose as saints than whom none more truly pious have existed on the earth they are the gascons of spain but beside them the bordelais is a truthful unimaginative creature  next comes laziness there is in europe no richer soil than that of andalusia and the arabs with an elaborate system of irrigation obtained three crops a year but now half the land lies uncultivated and immense tracts are planted only with olives which comparatively entail small labour but the inhabitants of this fruitful country are happy in this that boredom is unknown to them content to lie in the sun for hours neither talking thinking nor reading they are never tired of idleness two men will sit for half a day in a cafe with a glass of water before them not exchanging three remarks in an hour i fancy it is this stolidness which has given travellers an impression of dignity in their quieter moments they remind one of very placid sheep for they have not half the energy of pigs which in spain at least are restless and spirited creatures but a trifle will rouse them and then quite unable to restrain themselves pallid with rage they hurl abuse at their enemyspanish they say is richer in invective than any other european tongueand quickly long knives are whipped out to avenge the affront  universal opinion has given its verdict in an epithet and just as many people speak of the volatile frenchman the stolid dutchman the amatory italian they talk of the proud spaniard but it is pride of a peculiar sort a sevillian with only the smallest claims to respectability would rather die than carry a parcel through the street however poor some one must perform for him so menial an office and he would consider it vastly beneath his dignity to accept charity though if he had the chance would not hesitate to swindle you out of sixpence but in matters of honesty these good people show a certain discrimination your servants for example would hesitate to steal money especially if liable to detection but not to take wine and sugar and oil which is proved by the freedom with which they discuss the theft among themselves and the calmness with which they acknowledge it when a wrathful master takes them in the act the reasoning is if youre such a fool as not to keep your things under lock and key you deserve to be robbed and if dismissed for such a peccadillo they consider themselves very hardly used  uncharitable persons saying that a spaniard will live for a week on bread and water duly to prepare himself for a meal at anothers expense accuse them of gluttony but i have always found the andalusians abstemious eaters nor have i wondered at this since spanish food is abominable but drunkards they often are i should think as many people in proportion get drunk in seville as in london though it is only fair to add that their heads are not strong and very little alcohol will produce in them an indecent exhilaration  but if the reader because the andalusians are slothful truthless but moderately honest vain concludes that they are an unattractive people he will grossly err his reasoning that moral qualities make pleasant companions is quite false on the contrary it is rigid principles and unbending character strength of will and a decided sense of right and wrong which make intercourse difficult a sensitive conscience is no addition to the amenities of the dinnertable but when a man is willing to counter a deadly sin with a shrug of the shoulders when between white and black he can discover no insupportable contrast the probabilities are that he will at least humour your whims and respect your prejudices and so it is that the andalusians make very agreeable acquaintance they are free and amiable in their conversation and will always say the thing that pleases rather than the brutal thing that is they miss no opportunity to make compliments which they do so well that at the moment you are assured these flattering remarks come from the bottom of their hearts very reasonably they cannot understand why you should be disagreeable to a man merely because you rob him to injury unless their minds are clouded by passion they have not the bad taste to add insult compare with these manners the british abhorrence of polite and complimentary speeches especially if they happen to be true the englishman may hold you in the highest estimation but wild horses will not drag from him an acknowledgment of the fact whereby humanism and the general stock of selfesteem are notably diminished  nothing can be more graceful than their mode of speech for the very construction of the language conduces to courtesy the spaniards have also an oriental way of offering you things placing themselves and their houses entirely at your disposal if you remark on anything of theirs they beg you at once to take it if you go into a pothouse where a peasant is dining on a plate of ham a few olives and a glass of wine he will ask le gusta will you have some with a little motion of handing you his meal of course it would be an outrage to decorum to accept these generous offers but that is beside the question for good manners are not an affair of the heart but a complicated game to be learned and played on either side with due attention to the rules it may be argued that such details are not serious but surely for the common round of life politeness is more necessary than any heroic qualities we need our friends selfsacrifice once in a blue moon but their courtesy every day and for my own part i would choose the companions of my leisure rather for their good breeding than for the excellence of their dispositions  beside this however the andalusians are much attached to children and it is pleasant to see the real fondness which exists between various members of a family one singular point i have noted that although the spanish marry for love rather than from convenience a wife puts kindred before husband her affection remaining chiefly where it was before marriage but if the moralist desires yet more solid virtues he need only inquire of the first sevillan he meets who will give at shortest notice in choice and fluent language a far more impressive list than i could ever produce     xv  sidenote don juan tenorio   on its own behalf each country seems to choose one man historical or imaginary to stand for the race making as it were an incarnation of all the virtues and all the vices wherewith it is pleased to charge itself and nothing really better explains the character of a people than their choice of a national hero fifty years ago john bull was the typical englishman stout rubicund and healthy with a loud voice and a somewhat aggressive manner he belonged distinctly to the middle classes he had a precise idea of his rights and a flattering opinion of his merits he was peaceable but ready enough to fight for commercial advantages or if roused for conscience sake and when this took place he possessed always the comforting assurance that the almighty was on his side he put his faith without hesitation on the bible and on the superiority of the english nation for foreigners he had a magnificent contempt and distinguished between them and monkeys only by a certain mental effort art he thought nasty literature womanish he was a tory middleaged and welltodo  but nowadays all that is changed john bull having amassed great wealth has been gathered to his fathers and now disports himself in an early victorian paradise furnished with horsehair sofas and mahogany sideboards his son reigns in his stead and though perhaps not officially recognised as englands archetype his appearance in novel and in drama in the illustrated papers in countless advertisements proves the reality of his sway it is his image that rests in the heart of british maidens his the example that british youths industriously follow  but john bull junior has added his mothers maiden name to his own and remembers with pleasure that he belongs to a good old county family he has changed his address from bedford square to south kensington and has been educated at a public school and at a university young tall and fairhaired there is nothing to suggest that he will ever have that inelegant paunch which prevented the father even in his loftiest moments of moral indignation from being dignified of course he is a soldier for the army is still the only profession for a gentleman and englands hero is that above all things his morals are unexceptional since to the ten commandments of moses he has added the decalogue of good form his clothes whether he wears a norfolk jacket or a frock coat fit to perfection he is a good shot a daring rider a serviceable cricketer his heart beats with simple emotions he will ever cheer at the sight of the union jack and the strains of rule britannia bring patriotic tears to his eyes of late like myself he has become an imperialist his intentions are always strictly honourable and he would not kiss the tip of a womans fingers except hymen gave him the strictest rights to do so if he became enamoured of a lady with whom such tender sentiments should not be harboured he would invariably remember his duty at the psychological moment and with many moving expressions renounce her in fact he is a devil at renouncing women i wonder it flatters them  contrast with this pattern of excellence eminently praiseworthy if somewhat dull don juan tenorio who stands in exactly the same relation to the andalusians as does john bull to the english he is a worthless heartless creature given over to the pursuit of emotion the main lines of the story are well known the legend so far as seville is concerned industrious persons have found analogues throughout the world appears to be founded on fact there actually lived a comendador de calatrava who was killed by don juan after the abduction of his daughter the perfect amorist according to the cronica de sevilla was then inveigled into the church where lay his enemy and assassinated by the franciscans who spread the pious fiction that the image of his victim descending from its pedestal had itself exacted vengeance it was an unfortunate invention for the catastrophe has proved a stumblingblock to all that have dealt with the subject the spaniards of molinas day may not have minded the clumsy deus ex machina but later writers have been able to make nothing of it in molières play for instance the grotesque statue is absurdly inapposite for his don juan is a wit and a cynic a courtier of louis xiv with whose sins avenging gods are out of all proportion love for him is an intellectual exercise and a pastime constancy he says is only good for fools we owe ourselves to pretty women in general and the mere fact of having met one does not absolve us from our duty to others the birth of passion has an inexplicable charm and the pleasure of love is in variety and zorilla whose version is the most poetic of them all has succeeded in giving only a ridiculous exhibition of waxworks  but the monk tirso de molina who was the first to apply literary form to the legend alone gives the character in its primitive simplicity he drew the men of his time and his compatriots recognising themselves have made the work immortal for spain at all events the type has been irrevocably fixed don juan tenorio was indeed a spaniard of his age a man of turbulent instincts with a love of adventure and a fine contempt for danger of an overwhelming pride careful of his own honour and careless of that of others he looked upon every woman as lawful prey and hesitated at neither perjury nor violence to gain his ends despair and tears left him indifferent love for him was purely carnal with nothing of the timid flame of pastoral romance nor of the chivalrous and metaphysic passion of provence it was a fierce consuming fire which quickly burnt itself out he was a vulgar and unoriginal seducer who stole favours in the dark by pretending to be the ladys chosen lover or induced guileless maids to trust him under promise of marriage then rode away as fast as his horse could carry him the monotony of his methods and their success are an outrage to the intelligence of the sex but for all his scoffing he remained a true catholic devoutly believing that the day would come when he must account for his acts and he proposed when too old to commit more sins to repent and make his peace with the almighty  it is significant that the andalusians have thus chosen don juan tenorio for he is an abstract with the lines somewhat subdued by the advance of civilisation of the national character for them his vices his treachery his heartlessness have nothing repellent nor does his inconstancy rob him of feminine sympathy he is indeed a far greater favourite with the ladies than john bull the englishman they respect they know he will make a good husband and a model father but he is too monogamous to arouse enthusiasm     xvi  sidenote women of andalusia   it is meet and just that the traveller who desires a closer acquaintance with the country wherein he sojourns than is obtained by the cockney tripper should fall in love the advantages of this proceeding are manifold and obvious he will acquire the language with a more rapid facility he will look upon the land with greater sympathy and hence with sharper insight and little particularities of life will become known to him which to the dreary creature who surveys a strange world from the portico of an expensive hotel must necessarily lie hid if i personally did not arrive at that delectable condition the fault is with the immortal gods rather than with myself for in my eagerness to learn the gorgeous tongue of calderon and of cervantes i placed myself purposely in circumstances where i thought the darts of young cupid could never fail to miss me but finally i was reduced to ollendorfs grammar however these are biographical details of interest to none but myself they are merely to serve as preface for certain observations upon the women whom the traveller in the evening sees hurrying through the sierpes on their way home  human beauty is the most arbitrary of things and the englishman accustomed to the classic type of his own countrywomen will at first perhaps be somewhat disappointed with the excellence of spain it consists but seldom in any regularity of feature for their appeal is to the amorist rather than to the sculptor in marble their red lips carry suggestions of burning kisses so that his heart must be hard indeed who does not feel some flutterings at their aspect the teeth are small very white regular face and body indeed are but the expression of a passionate nature  but when i write of spanish women i think of you rosarito i find suddenly that it is no impersonal creature that fills my mind but youyou when i state solemnly that their greatest beauty lies in their hair and eyes it is of you i think it is your dark eyes that were lustrous soft as velvet caressing sometimes and sometimes sparkling with fiery glances alas that i can find but hackneyed phrases to describe those heartdisturbers and when i say that the eyebrows of a spanish woman are not often so delicately pencilled as with many an english girl i remember that yours were thick and the luxuriance gave you a certain tropical and savage charm and your hair was plentiful and curling intensely black i believe it was your greatest care in life dont you remember how often you explained to me that nothing was so harmful as to brush it and how proud you were that it hung in glorious locks to your very knees  hardly any girl in seville is too poor to have a peinadora to do her hair and these women go from house to house combing and arranging the coiffure for such infinitesimal sums as half a real which is little more than a penny  again i try to be impersonal the complexion ranges through every quality from dark olive to pearly white but yours rosarito was like the very finest ivory a perfect miracle of delicacy and brilliance and the blood in the cheeks shone through with a rich soft red i used to think it was a colour by itself not to be found on palettes the carnation of your cheeks rosarito and none could walk with such graceful dignity as you it was a pleasure to watch your perfect ease your selfcommand your feet i think were somewhat long but your hands were wonderful very small admirably modelled with little tapering fingers and the most adorable filbert nails dont you remember how i used to look at them and turn them over and discuss them point by point and if ever i kissed their soft warm palms i think it possible though i have no vivid recollections remember that i was twentythree and it was certainly an appropriate gesture in the little comedy which to our mutual entertainment we played so gravely  now as i write my heart goes pitapat thinking of you rosarito and im sure that if we had over again that charming time i should fall head over ears in love oh you know we were both fibbing when we vowed we adored one another i am a romancer by profession and you by nature we parted joyously and you had the grace not to force a tear and neither of our hearts was broken where are you now i wonder and do you ever think of me      the whole chapter of andalusian beauty is unfolded in the tobacco factory at seville six thousand women work there at little tables placed by the columns which uphold the roof they are of all ages of all types plain pretty commonplace beautiful and ten perhaps are lovely the gipsies are disappointing not so comely as the pure spaniards and they attract only by the sphinxlike mystery of their coppercoloured skin by their hard unfathomable eyes  the sevillans are perhaps inclined to stoutness but that is a charm in their lovers sight and often have a little down on the upper lip than which when it amounts to no more than a shadow nothing can be more enchanting they look with malicious eyes as you saunter through room after room in the factory it is quite an experience to run the gauntlet of their numerous tongues making uncomplimentary remarks about your person sometimes to your embarrassment offering you the carnation from their hair or other things their clothes are suspended to the pillars and their costume in summer is more adapted for coolness than for the inspection of decorous foreigners they may bring with them babies and many a girl will have a cradle by her side which she rocks with one foot as her fingers work nimbly at the cigarettes  they are very oriental these women with voluptuous forms they have no education and with all their charm are unutterably stupid they do not read and find even newspapers tiresome those whose circumstances do not force them to work for their living love nothing better than to lie for long hours on a sofa neither talking nor thinking in easy gowns untrammelled by tightfitting things in the morning they put on a mantilla and go to mass and besides except to pay a polite visit on a friend or to drive in the paseo hardly leave the house they are content with the simplest life they adore their children and willingly devote themselves entirely to them they seem never to be bored  for them the days must come and go without distinction their fleeting beauty leaves them imperceptibly they grow fat they grow thin wrinkled and gaunt the years pass and their life proceeds without change they do not think they do not live they merely exist and they die and that is the end of it i suppose they are as happy as any one else after all taking it from one point of view it matters very little what sort of life one leads there are so many people in the world such millions have come and gone such millions will come and go if an individual makes no use of his hour what does it signify he is only one among countless hordes in the existence of these handsome creatures so passionate and yet so apathetic there are no particular pleasures beside the simple joys of sense but on the other hand beyond the inevitable separations of death there are no outstanding griefs they propagate their species and that perhaps is the only quite certain duty that human beings have     xvii  sidenote the dance   cervantes said that there was never born a spanish woman but she was made to dance and he might have added that in the south at all events most men share the enviable faculty the dance is one of the most characteristic features of andalusia and as an amusement rivals in popularity even the bullfight the sevillans dance on every possible occasion and nothing pleases them more than the dexterity of professionals before a company has been assembled half an hour some one is bound to suggest that a couple should show their skill room is quickly made the table pushed against the wall the chairs drawn back and they begin even when men are alone in a tavern drinking wine two of them will often enough stand up to tread a seguidilla on a rainy day it is the entertainment that naturally recommends itself  riding through the villages round seville on sundays it delighted me to see little groups making a circle about the house doors in the middle of which were dancing two girls in brightcoloured clothes with roses in their hair a man seated on a broken chair was twanging a guitar the surrounders beat their hands in time and the dancers made music with their castanets sometimes on a feastday i came across a little band arrayed in all its best that had come into the country for an afternoons diversion and sat on the grass in the shade of summer or in the wintry sun whenever andalusians mean to make merry some one will certainly bring a guitar or if not the girls have their castanets and though even these are wanting and no one can be induced to sing a rhythmical clapping of hands will be sufficient accompaniment and the performers will snap their fingers in lieu of castanets  it is charming then to see the girls urge one another to dance each vows with much dramatic gesture that she cannot calling the blessed virgin to witness that she has strained her ankle and has a shocking cold but some youth springs up and volunteers inviting a particular damsel to join him she is pushed forward and the couple take their places the man carefully puts down his cigarette jams his broadbrimmed hat on his head buttons his short coat and arches his back the spectators cry ole the girl passes an arranging hand over her hair the measure begins the pair stand opposite one another a yard or so distant and foot it in accordance with one anothers motions it is not a thing of complicated steps but as one might expect from its moorish origin of movements of the body with much graceful swaying from side to side the executants approach and retire and at the middle of the dance change positions it finishes with a great clapping of hands the maiden sinks down among her friends and begins violently to fan herself while her partner with a great affectation of nonchalance takes a seat and relights his cigarette  and in the musichalls the national dances are with the national songs the principal attraction seville possesses but one of these establishments it is a queer place merely the patio of a private house with a stage at one end in which chairs and tables have been placed on holiday nights it is crammed with students with countrymen and artisans with the general riffraff of the town and with women of no particular reputation now and then appears a gang of soldiers giving a peculiar note with the uniformity of their brown holland suits and occasionally a couple of british sailors come sauntering in with fine selfassurance their fair hair and red cheeks contrasting with the general swartness you pay no entrance money but your refreshment costs a realwhich is twopence hapenny and for that you may enjoy not only a cup of coffee or a glass of manzanilla but an evenings entertainment as the night wears on the heat is ovenlike and the air is thick and grey with the smoke of countless cigarettes  the performance consists of three turns only and these are repeated every hour the company boasts generally of a male singer a female singer and of the corps de ballet which is made up of six persons spain is the stronghold of the outofdate and i suppose it alone preserves the stiff muslin balletskirts which delighted our fathers to see halfadozen dancers thus attired in a remote andalusian musichall is so entirely unexpected that it quite takes the breath away but by the time the traveller reaches seville he must be used to disillusion and he must be ingenuous indeed if he expects the spaniards to have preserved their national costume for the most national of their pastimes yet the dances are still spanish and even if the pianoforte has ousted the guitar the castanets give notwithstanding a characteristic note which the aggressive muslin and the pink illfitting tights cannot entirely destroy      but i remember one dancer who was really a great artist she was illfavoured of middle age thin but every part of her was imbued with grace expressive from the tips of her toes to the tips of her fingers the demands of the public sometimes forced upon her odious balletskirts sometimes she wasted her talent on the futilities of skirtdancing but chiefly she loved the national measures and her phenomenal leanness made her only comfortable in the national dress she travelled from place to place in spain with another woman whom she had taught to dance and whose beauty she used cleverly as a foil to her own uncomeliness and so wasted herself in these low resorts earning hardly sufficient to keep body and soul together i wish i could remember her name  when she began to dance you forgot her ugliness her gaunt arms gained shape her face was transfigured her dark eyes flashed and her mouth and smile said a thousand eloquent things even the nape of her neck which in most women has no significance with her was expressive a consummate actress she exhibited all her skill in the bolero which represents a courtship she threw aside the castanets and wrapped herself in a mantilla while her companion dressed as a man was hidden in a capa the two passed one another he trying to see the ladys face which she averted but not too strenuously he pursued she fled but not too rapidly dropping his cloak the lover attacked with greater warmth while alternately she repelled and lured him on at last she too cast away the mantilla they seized the castanets and danced round one another with all manner of graceful and complicated evolutions making love quarrelling pouting exhibiting every variety of emotion the dance grew more passionate the steps flew faster till at last with the music both stopped suddenly dead still this abrupt cessation is one of the points most appreciated by a spanish audience ole they crybien parado  but when unhampered by a partner this nameless exquisite dancer gave full play to her imagination there was no end to the wildness of her fancy to the intricacy and elaboration of her measures to the gay audacity of her movements she performed a hundred feats each more difficult than the otherand all impossible to describe      then between christmas and lent at midnight on saturdays and sundays the tables and the chairs are cleared away for the masked ball and you will see the latest mode of spanish dance the women are of the lowest possible class some with a kind of savage irony disguised as nuns others in grotesque dominos of their own devising but most wear everyday clothes with great shawls draped about them the men are of a corresponding station and through the evening wear their broadbrimmed hats on the stage is a brass band which plays one single tune till daybreak and to that one single measure is dancedthe habanera  in this alone may people take part as in any round dance the couples hold one another in the very tightest embrace the lady clasping her arms round her partners neck while he places both his about her waist they go round the room very slowly immediately behind one another it is a kind of straight polka with a peculiar rhythmic swaying of the body the feet are not lifted off the floor and you do not turn at all the highest gravity is preserved throughout and the whole performance iswell very oriental     xviii  sidenote a feast day   i arrived in seville on the eve of the immaculate conception all day people had been preparing to celebrate the feast decorating their houses with great banners of blue and white and at night the silent narrow streets had a strange appearance for in every window were lighted candles throwing around them a white unusual glare they looked a little like the souls of infants dead all day the bells of a hundred churches had been ringing half drowned by the rolling peals of the giralda  it had been announced that the archbishop would himself officiate at the high mass in the blessed virgins honour and early in the morning the cathedral steps were crowded with blackrobed women making their way to the great sacristy where was to be held the service i joined the throng and entering through the darkness of the porch was almost blinded by the brilliant altar upon which stood a lifesized image of the virgin surrounded by a huge aureole with great bishops all of silver on either side it was ablaze with the light of many candles so that the nave was thrown into deep shadow and the kneeling women were scarcely visible  the canons in the choir listlessly droned their prayers at last the organ burst forth and a long procession slowly came into the chapel priests in white and blue the colours of the virgin four bishops in mitres the archbishop with his golden crozier and preceding them all in odd contrast the beadle in black with a dark periwig bearing a silver staff from the choir in due order they returned to the altar headed this time by three pairs of acolytes bearing great silver candlesticks and by incenseburners that filled the church with rich perfume  when the mass was finished a young dark man in copious robes of violet ascended the pulpit and muttered a text he waited an instant to collect himself looking at the congregation then turning to the altar began a passionate song of praise to the blessed virgin unsoiled by original sin he described her as in a hundred pictures the great painter of the immaculate conception has portrayed hera young and graceful maid clothed in a snowy gown of ample folds with an azure cloak a maid mysteriously pure her hair floating on the shoulders in luxurious ringlets was an aureole more glorious than the silver rays which surrounded the great image her dark eyes with their languid lashes her mouth with the red lips expressed a beautiful and immaculate virtue it might have been some earthly woman of whom the priest spoke one of those andalusians that knelt below him flashing quick glances at the gallant who negligently leaned against a pillar  the archbishop sat on his golden thronea thin small man with a wrinkled face with dead and listless eyes in his gorgeous vestments he looked hardly human he seemed a puppet sitting stilly at the end of the sermon he went back to the altar and in his low broken voice read the prayers and then turning towards the great congregation he gave the plenary absolution for which the popes bull had been read from the pulpit steps      in the afternoon when the sun was going down behind the guadalquivir over the plain i went again to the cathedral the canons in the choir still droned their chant in praise of the blessed virgin and in the greater darkness the altar shone more magnificently the same procession filed through the nave some priests were in black some in violet some in the virgins colours but this time the archbishop wore gorgeous robes of scarlet and as he knelt at the altar his train spread to the chancel steps from the side appeared ten boys and knelt before the altar and stood in two lines facing one another they were dressed like pages of the seventeenth century with white stockings and breeches and a doublet of blue and silver holding in their hands hats with long feathers the archbishop kneeling in front of the throne buried his face in his hands  a soft melody played by violins and cellos broke the silence and presently the ten pages began to sing      los cielos y la tierra alaben al señor     con imnos de alabanza que inflamen al señor  it was a curious oldfashioned music reminding one a little of the quiet harmonies of gluck then putting on their hats the pages danced continuing their song they wound in and out of one another gravely footing it swaying to and fro with the music very slowly the measure was performed with the utmost reverence now and then the chorus came and the fresh boys voices singing in unison filled the church with delightful melody and still the old archbishop prayed his face buried in his hands  the boys ceased to sing but continued the dance marking the time now with castanets and the mundane instrument contrasted strangely with the glittering altar and with the kneeling priests i wondered of what the archbishop thought kneeling so humblyof the boys dancing before the altar fresh and young was he thinking of their white souls darkening with the sins of the world or of the troubles the disillusionments of life and the decrepitude or was it of himselfdid he think of his own youth so long past so hopelessly gone or did he think that he was old and worn and of the dark journey before him and of the light that seemed so distant did he regret his beautiful seville with the blue sky and the orangetrees bowed down with their golden fruit he seemed so small and weak overwhelmed in his gorgeous robes  again the ten boys repeated their song and dance and their castanets and with a rapid genuflection disappeared  the archbishop rose painfully from his knees and ascended to the altar a priest held open a book before him and another lighted the printed page with a candle he read out a prayer then kneeling down he bent very low as though he felt himself unworthy to behold the magnificence of the queen of heaven the people fell to their knees and a mans voice burst forthave maria gratia plena waves of passionate sound floated over the worshippers upwards towards heaven and from the giralda the moorish tower the christian bells rang joyfully the archbishop turned towards the people and when in his thin broken voice he gave the benediction one thought that no man in his heart felt such humility as the magnificent prince of the church don marcelo spinola y maestre archbishop of seville  the people flocked out quickly and soon only a few devout penitents remained a priest came waving censers before the altar and thick volumes of perfume ascended to the blessed virgin he disappeared and one by one the candles were extinguished the night crept silently along the church and the silver image sank into the darkness at last two candles only were left on the altar high up shining dimly  outside the sky was still blue bespattered with countless stars       notei believe there is no definite explanation of this ceremony      and the legend told me by an ancient priest that it was invented      during the moorish dominion so that christian services might be      held under cover of a social gatheringintruding muslims would be      told merely that people were there assembled to see boys dance and      to listen to their singingis more picturesque than probable      rather does it seem analogous with the leaping of david the king      before the ark of jehovah when he danced before the lord with all      his might girt with a linen ephod and this if i may hazard an      opinion was with a view to amuse a deity apt to be bored or      languid just as nautch girls dance to this day before the idols of      the hindus and tops are spun before krishna to divert him     xix  sidenote the giralda   the christian bells rang joyfully from the moorish tower the great old bells christened with holy oil el cantor the singer la gorda the great san miguel i climbed the winding passage till i came to the terrace where stood the ringers and as they pulled their ropes the bells swung round on their axles completing a circle with deafening clamour the din was terrific so that the solid masonry appeared to shake and i felt the vibrations of the surrounding air it was a strange sensation to shout as loud as possible and hear no sound issue from my mouth  the giralda with its moorish base and its christian belfry is a symbol of andalusia there is in the ayuntamiento an old picture of the minaret built by djâbir the moor nearly one hundred feet shorter than the completed tower but surmounted by a battlemented platform on which are huge brazen balls and an iron standard these were overthrown by an earthquake and later when the discoveries of christopher columbus had poured unmeasured riches into seville the chapter commissioned hernan ruiz to add a belfry to the moorish base hernan ruiz nearly ruined the mosque at cordova but here he was entirely successful indeed it is extraordinary that the two parts should be joined in such admirable harmony it is impossible to give in words an idea of the slender grace of the giralda it does not look a thing of bricks and mortar it is so straight and light that it reminds one vaguely of some beautiful human thing the great height is astonishing there is no buttress or projection to break the very long straight line as it rises with a kind of breathless speed to the belfry platform and then the renaissance building begins ascending still more a sort of filigree work excessively rich and elegant beyond all praise it is surmounted by a female figure of bronze representing faith and veering with every breeze and the artist has surrounded his work with the motto nomen domini fortissima turris  but the older portion gains another charm from the moorish windows that pierce it one above the other with horseshoe arches and from the arabesque network with which the upper part is diapered a brick trelliswork against the brick walls of the most graceful and delicate intricacy the giralda is almost toylike in the daintiness of its decoration notwithstanding its great size it is a masterpiece of exquisite proportion at night it stands out with strong lines against the bespangled sky and the lights of the watchers give it a magic appearance of some lacelike tower of imagination but on high festivals it is lit with countless lamps and then as richard ford puts it hangs from the dark vault of heaven like a brilliant chandelier  i looked down at seville from above a spanish town wears always its most picturesque appearance thus seen but it is never different the patios glaring with whitewash the roofs of brown and yellow tiles and the narrow streets winding in unexpected directions narrower than ever from such a height and dark with shade so that they seem black rivulets gliding stealthily through the whiteness looking at a northern city from a tall church tower all things are confused with one another the slate roofs join together till it is like a huge uneven sea of grey but in seville the atmosphere is so limpid the colour so brilliant that every house is clearly separated from its neighbour and sometimes there appears to be between them a preternatural distinctness each stands independently of any other you might suppose yourself in a strange city of the arabian nights where a great population lived in houses crowded together but invisibly so that each person fancied himself in isolation  immediately below was the cathedral and to remind you of cordova the court of oranges but here was no sunny restfulness nor oldworld quiet the court is gloomy and dark and the trim rows of orangetrees contrast oddly with the grey stone of the cathedral its huge porches and the flamboyant exuberance of its decoration the sun never shines in it and no fruit splash the dark foliage with gold you do not think of the generations of priests who have wandered in it on the summer evenings basking away their peaceful lives in the sunshine but rather of the busy merchants who met there in the old days when it was still the exchange of seville before the lonja was built to discuss the war with england or the fate of ships bringing gold from america at one end of the court is an old stone pulpit from which preached st francis of borga and st vincent ferrer and many an unknown monk besides then it was thronged with multicoloured crowds with townsmen soldiers and great noblemen when the faith was living and strong and the preacher with all the gesture and the impassioned rhetoric of a spaniard poured out burning words of hate for jew and moor and heretic so that the listeners panted and a veil of blood passed before their eyes or else uttered so eloquent a song in praise of the blessed virgin immaculately conceived that strong men burst into tears at the recital of her perfect beauty     xx  sidenote the cathedral of seville   your first impression when you walk round the cathedral of seville noting with dismay the crushed cupolas and unsightly excrescences the dinginess of colour is not enthusiastic it was built by german architects without a thought for the surrounding houses brilliantly whitewashed and the blue sky and it proves the incongruity of northern art in a southern country but even lowering clouds and mist could lend no charm to the late gothic of santa maria de la sede  the interior fortunately is very different notwithstanding the gothic groining as you enter from the splendid heat of noonday in the plaza del triunfo the sun beats down and the houses are more dazzling than snow the effect is thoroughly and delightfully spanish light is very fatal to devotion and the spaniards have been so wise as to make their churches extremely dark at first you can see nothing incense floats heavily about you filling the air and the coolness is like a draught of fresh perfumed water but gradually the church detaches itself from the obscurity and you see great columns immensely lofty the spaces are large and simple giving an impression of vast room and the choir walled up on three sides in the middle of the nave as in all spanish cathedrals by obstructing the view gives an appearance of almost unlimited extent to me it seems that in such a place it is easier to comprehend the majesty wherewith man has equipped himself science offers only thoughts of human insignificance the vastness of the sea the terror of the mountains emphasise the fact that man is of no account ephemeral as the leaves of summer but in those bold aisles by the pillars rising with such a confident pride towards heaven it is almost impossible not to feel that man indeed is godlike lord of the earth and that the great array of nature is builded for his purpose  typically spanish also is the decoration and very rich the choirstalls are of carved wood florid and exuberant like the spanish imagination the altars gleam with gold pictures of saints are framed by golden pillars carved with huge bunches of grapes and fruit and fantastic leaves i was astounded at the opulence of the treasure there were gorgeous altars of precious metal great saints of silver caskets of gold monstrances studded with rare stones crosses and crucifixes the vestments were of unimaginable splendour there were two hundred copes of all ages and of every variety fifty of each colour white for christmas and easter red for corpus christi blue for the immaculate conception violet for holy week there were the special copes of the primate copes for officiating bishops copes for dignitaries from other countries and dioceses they were of the richest velvet and satin heavily embroidered with gold many with saints worked in silk so heavy that it seemed hardly possible for a man to bear them  in the baptistery filling it with warm light is the san antonio of murillo than which no picture gives more intensely the religious emotion the saint tall and meagre beautiful of face looks at the divine child hovering in a golden mist with an ecstasy that is no longer human  it is interesting to consider whether an artist need feel the sentiment he desires to convey certainly many pictures have been painted under the influence of profound feeling which leave the spectator entirely cold and it is probable enough that the early italians felt few of the emotions which their pictures call forth we know that the masterpieces of perugino so moving so instinct with religious tenderness were very much a matter of pounds shillings and pence but luis de vargas on the other hand daily humbled himself by scourging and by wearing a hair shirt and vicente joanes prepared himself for a new picture by communion and confession so that it is impossible to wonder at the rude and savage ardour of their work and the impression that may be gathered of murillo from his pictures is borne out by the study of his grave and simple life he had not the turbulent piety of the other two but a calm and sweet devotion which led him to spend long hours in church meditating he at any rate felt all that he expressed  i do not know a church that gives the religious sentiment more completely than seville cathedral the worship of the spaniards is sombre fullblooded a thing of dark rich colours it requires the heaviness of incense and that overloading of rococo decoration it is curious that notwithstanding their extreme similarity to the neapolitans the andalusians should in their faith differ so entirely of course in southern italy religion is as full of superstitionan adoration of images in which all symbolism is lost and only the gross idol remains but it is a gayer and a lighter thing than in spain most characteristic of this is the difference between the churches and with santa maria de la sede may well be contrasted the neapolitan santa chiara with its great windows so airy and spacious sparkling with white and gold the paintings are almost frolicsome it is like a ballroom a typical place of worship for a generation that had no desire to pray but strutted in gaudy silks and ogled over pretty fans pretending to discuss the latest audacity of monsieur arouet de voltaire     xxi  sidenote the hospital of charity   the spaniards possess to the fullest degree the art of evoking devout emotions and in their various churches may be experienced every phase of religious feeling after the majestic size and the solemn mystery of the cathedral nothing can come as a greater contrast than the church of the hermandad de la caredad it was built by don miguel de mañara who rests in the chancel with the inscription over him aqui jacen los huesos y ceñizas del peor hombre que ha habido en el mundo ruegan por elhere lie the bones and ashes of the worst man that has ever been in the world pray for him but like all andalusians he was a braggart for a love of chocolate which appears to have been his besetting sin is insufficient foundation for such a vaunt a vice of that order is adequately punished by the corpulence it must occasion however legend representing don miguel as the most dissolute of libertines is more friendly the grave sister who escorts the visitor relates that one day in church don miguel saw a beautiful nun and undaunted by her habit made amorous proposals she did not speak but turned to look at him whereupon he saw the side of her face which had been hidden from his gaze and it was eaten away by a foul and loathsome disease so that it seemed more horrible than the face of death the gallant was so terrified that he fainted and afterwards the face haunted him the face of matchless beauty and of revolting decay so that he turned from the world he devoted his fortune to rebuilding the hospital and church of the brotherhood of charity whose chief office it was to administer the sacraments to those condemned to death and provide for their burial and was eventually received into their order  it was in the seventeenth century that mañara built his church and consequently rococo holds sway with all its fantasies it is small without aisles or chapels and the morbid opulence of the decoration gives it a peculiar character the walls are lined with red damask and the floor carpeted with a heavy crimson carpet it gives the sensation of a hothouse or with its close odours of a bedchamber transformed into a chapel for the administration of the last sacrament the atmosphere is unhealthy one pants for breath  at one end taking up the entire wall is a reredos by pedro roldan of which the centrepiece is an elaborate deposition in the tomb with numerous figures coloured to the life it is very fine in its mingling of soft rich hues and flamboyant realism the artist has revelled in the opportunity for anguish of expression that his subject afforded but has treated it with such a passionate seriousness that in his grim fierce way he does not fail to be impressive the frame is of twisted golden pillars supported by little naked angels and decorated with grapes and vineleaves above and at the sides are great saints in carved wood and angels with floating drapery  murillo was on terms of intimacy with don miguel de mañara and like him a member of the hermandad for his friend he painted some of his most famous pictures which by the subdued ardour of their colour by their opulent tones harmonise most exquisitely with the church marshal soult with a fine love of art that was profitable carried off several of them and their empty frames stare at one still but before that when they were all in place the effect must have been of unique magnificence  it must be an extraordinary religion that flourishes in such a place an artificial faith that needs heat like tropical plants that desires unnatural vows it breathes of neurotic emotions with its damaskcovered walls with its carpet that deadens the footfall its sombre gorgeous pictures the sweet breeze of heaven never enters there nor the sunlight the air is languid with incense one is oppressed by a strange heavy silence in such a church sins must be fostered for the morbid pleasure of confession one can imagine that the worshippers in that overloaded atmosphere would see strange visions voluptuous and mystical the blessed mary and the saints might gain visible and palpable flesh and the devil would not be far off there the gruesome imaginings of valdes leal are a fitting decoration every one knows that grim picture of a bishop in episcopal robes eaten by worms his flesh putrefying which led murillo to say leal you make me hold my nose and the other answered you have taken all the flesh and left me nought but the bones elsewhere by the same master there is a painting that suggests with greater poignancy to my mind because less brutally the thoughts evoked by the more celebrated work and since it seems to complete the ideas awakened by this curious chapel i mention it here  it represents a priest at the altar saying his mass and the altar after the spanish fashion is sumptuous with gilt and florid carving he wears a magnificent cope and a surplice of exquisite lace but he wears them as though their weight were more than he could bear and in the meagre trembling hands and in the white ashen face in the dark hollowness of the eyes and in the sunken cheeks there is a bodily corruption that is terrifying the priest seems to hold together with difficulty the bonds of the flesh but with no eager yearning of the soul to burst its prison only with despair it is as if the lord almighty had forsaken him and the high heavens were empty of their solace all the beauty of life appears forgotten and there is nothing in the world but decay a ghastly putrefaction has attacked already the living man the worms of the grave the piteous horror of mortality and the darkness before him offer nought but fear and what soul is there to rise again beyond dark night is seen and a turbulent sea the dark night of the soul of which the mystics write and the troublous sea of life whereon there is no refuge for the weary and the sick at heart      then if you would study yet another phase of the religious sentiment go to the museo where are the fine pictures that murillo painted for the capuchin monastery you will see all the sombreness of spanish piety the savage faith dissolved into ineffable love religion has become a wonderful tenderness in which passionate human affection is inextricably mingled with godlike adoration murillo these sensual forms quivering with life brought the eternal down to earth and gave terrestrial ardour to the apathy of an impersonal devotion that perhaps is why to women he has always been the most fascinating of painters in the madonna de la servilletapainted on a napkin for the cook of the monasterythe child is a simple earthly infant fresh and rosy with wideopen wondering eyes and not a trace of immortality i myself saw a common woman of the streets stand before this picture with tears running down her cheeks  corazon de mi alma she said heart of my soul i could cover his little body with kisses  she smiled but could hardly restrain her sobs the engrossing love of a mother for her child seemed joined in miraculous union with the worship of a mortal for his god  murillo had neither the power nor the desire to idealise his models the saints of these great pictures st francis of assisi st felix of cantalicio st thomas of villanueva are monks and beggars such as may to this day be seen in the streets of seville st felix is merely an old man with hollow cheeks and a grey ragged beard but yet as he clasps the child in his arms with eager tenderness he is transfigured by a divine ecstasy his face is radiant with the most touching emotion and st antony of padua in another picture worships the infant god with a mystic adoration which notwithstanding the realism of the presentment lifts him far far above the earth     xxii  sidenote gaol   i was curious to see the prison in seville gruesome tales had been told me of its filth and horror and the wretched condition of the prisoners i had even heard that from the street you might see them pressing against the barred windows with arms thrust through begging the passerby for money or bread mediæval stories recurred to my mind and the clank of chains trailed through my imagination  i arranged to be conducted by the prison doctor and one morning soon after five set out to meet him my guide informed me by a significant gesture that his tendencies werebibulous and our meetingplace was a tavern but when we arrived they told us that don felipesuch was his namehad been taken his morning dram and gone however if we went to another inn we should doubtless find him but there we heard he had not yet arrived he was not due till halfpast five to pass the time we drank a mouthful of aguardiente and smoked a cigarette and eventually the medico was espied in the distance we went towards hima round fat person with a red face and a redder nose somewhat shabbily dressed  he looked at me pointedly and said  im dry vengo seco  it was a hint not to be neglected and we returned to the tavern where don felipe had his nip  its very good for the stomach he assured me  we sallied forth together and as we walked he told me the number of prisoners the sort of crimes for which they were detainedranging from manslaughter to petty larcenyand finally details of his own career he was an intelligent man and when we came to the prison door insisted on drinking my health  the prison is an old convent and it is a little startling to see the church façade with a statue of the madonna over the central porch at the steps a number of women stood waiting with pots and jars and handkerchiefs full of food for their relatives within and when the doctor appeared several rushed up to ask about a father or a son that lay sick we went in and there was a melodramatic tinkling of keys and an unlocking of heavy doors  the male prisoners the adults were in the patio of the convent where in olden days the nuns had wandered on summer evenings watering their roses the iron door was opened and shut behind us there was a movement of curiosity at the sight of a stranger and many turned to look at me such as had illnesses came to the doctor and he looked at their tongues and felt their pulse giving directions to an assistant who stood beside him with a notebook don felipe was on excellent terms with his patients laughing and joking a malingerer asked if he could not have a little wine because his throat was sore the doctor jeered and the man began to laugh they bandied repartees with one another  there were about two hundred in the patio and really they did not seem to have so bad a time there was one large group gathered round a man who read a newspaper aloud it was monday morning and all listened intently to the account of a bullfight on the previous day bursting into a little cry of surprise and admiration on hearing that the matador had been caught and tossed others lay by a pillar playing draughts for matches while half a dozen more eagerly watched giving unsolicited advice with much gesticulation the draughtboard consisted of little squares drawn on the pavement with chalk and the pieces were scraps of white and yellow paper one man sat crosslegged by a column busily rolling cigarettes he had piles of them by his side arranged in packets which he sold at one penny each it was certainly an illegal offence because the sale of tobacco is a government monopoly but if you cannot break the laws in prison where can you break them others occupied themselves by making baskets or nets but the majority did nothing at all standing about sitting when they could with the eternal cigarette between their lips and the more energetic watched the blue smoke curl into the air altogether a very happy family  nor did they seem really very criminal more especially as they wore no prison uniform but their own clothes i saw no difference between them and the people i met casually in the street they were just very ordinary citizens countrymen smelling of the soil labouring men artisans their misfortune had been only to make too free a use of their long curved knives or to be discovered taking something over which another had prior claims but in andalusia every one is potentially as criminal which is the same as saying that these jailbirds were estimable persons whom an unkind fate and a mistaken idea of justice had separated for a little while from their wives and families  i saw two only whose aspect was distinctly vicious one was a tall fellow with shifty eyes a hard thin mouth a cruel smile and his face was really horrible i asked the doctor why he was there don felipe without speaking made the peculiar motion of the fingers which signifies robbery and the man seeing him repeated it with a leer i have seldom seen a face that was so utterly repellent so depraved and wicked i could not get it out of my head and for a long time saw before me the crafty eyes and the grinning mouth obviously the man was a criminal born who would start thieving as soon as he was out of prison hopelessly and utterly corrupt but it was curious that his character should be marked so plainly on his face it was a dangersignal to his fellows and one would have thought the suspicion it aroused must necessarily keep him virtuous it was a countenance that would make a man instinctively clap his hand to his pocket  the other was a turk a huge creature with dark scowling face and prominent brows he made a singular figure in his bright fez and baggy breeches looking at his fellow prisoners with a frown of hate  but the doctor had finished seeing his patients and the iron door was opened for us to go out we went upstairs to the hospital a long bare ward terribly cheerless six men perhaps lay in bed guarded by two warders one old fellow with rheumatism groaning in agony two others dazed and very still with high fever we walked round quickly don felipe as before mechanically looking at their tongues and feeling their pulse speaking a word to the assistant and moving on the windows were shut and there was a horrid stench of illness and drugs and antiseptics  we went through long corridors to the female side and meanwhile the assistant told the doctor that during the night a woman had been confined don felipe sat down in an office to write a certificate  what a nuisance these women are he said why cant they wait till they get out of prison how is it  it was stillborn  pero hombre said the doctor crossly why didnt you tell me that before now i shall have to write another certificate this ones no good  he tore it up and painfully made out a second with the slow laborious writing of a man unused to holding a pen  then we marched on and came to another smaller patio where the females were they were comparatively few not more than twenty or thirty and when we entered a dark innerroom to see the woman who was ill they all trooped in after usall but one they stood round eagerly telling us of the occurrence  dont make such a noise por dios i cant hear myself speak said the doctor  the woman was lying on her back with flushed cheeks her eyes staring glassily the doctor asked a question but she did not answer she began to cry sobbing from utter weakness in a silent unrestrained way on a table near her hidden by a cloth lay the dead child  we went out again into the patio the sun was higher now and it was very warm the blue sky shone above us without a cloud the prisoners returned to their occupations one old hag was doing a younger womans hair i noticed that even for spain it was beautiful very thick curling and black as night the girl held a carnation in her hand to put in front of the comb when the operation was completed another woman suckled a baby and several tiny children were playing about happily while their mothers chatted to one another knitting  but there was one markedly different from the others who sat alone taking no notice of the scene it was she who remained in the patio when the rest followed us into the sick room a gipsy tall and gaunt with a skin of the darkest yellow her hair was not elaborately arranged as that of her companions but plainly done drawn back stiffly from the forehead she sat there erect and motionless looking at the ground with an unnatural stare silent they told me she never spoke a word nor paid attention to the women in the court she might have been entirely alone she never altered her position but sat there sphinxlike in that attitude of stony grief she was a stranger among the rest and her bronzed face her silence gave a weird impression she seemed to recall the burning deserts of the east and an endless past  at last we came out and the heavy iron door was closed behind us what a relief it was to be in the street again to see the sun and the trees and to breathe the free air a cart went by with a great racket drawn by three mules and the cries of the driver as he cracked his whip were almost musical a train of donkeys passed a man trotted by on a brown shaggy cob his huge panniers filled with glowing vegetables green and red and in a corner was a great bunch of roses i took long breaths of the free air i shook myself to get rid of those prison odours  i offered don felipe refreshment and we repaired to a dramshop immediately opposite two women were standing there  ole said the doctor to an old toothless hag with a vicious leer what are you doing here youve not been in for some time  she laughed and explained that she was come to fetch her friend a young woman who had been released that morning the doctor nodded to her asking how long she had been in gaol  two years and nine months she said  and she began to laugh hysterically with tears streaming down her cheeks  i dont know what im doing she cried i cant understand it  she looked into the street with wild yearning eyes everything seemed to her strange and new  i havent seen a tree for nearly three years she sobbed  but the hag was pressing the doctor to drink with her he accepted without much hesitation and gallantly proposed her health  what are you going to do he said to the younger woman she was hardly more than a girl youd better not hang about in seville or youll get into trouble again  oh no she said im going to my villagemi pueblothis afternoon i want to see my husband and my child  don felipe turned to me and asked what i thought of the seville prison i made some complimentary reply  are english prisons like that he asked  i said i did not think so  are they better  i shrugged my shoulders  im told he said that two years hard labour in an english prison kills a man  the english are a great nation i replied  and a humane one he added with a bow and a smile  i bade him goodmorning     xxiii  sidenote before the bullfight   if all andalusians are potential gaolbirds they are also potential bullfighters it is impossible for foreigners to realise how firmly the love of that pastime is engrained in all classes in other countries the gift that children love best is a box of soldiers but in spain it is a miniature ring with tin bulls picadors on horseback and toreros from their earliest youth boys play at bullfighting one of them taking the bulls part and charging with the movements peculiar to that animal while the rest make passes with their coats or handkerchiefs often to increase the excitement of the game they have two horns fixed on a piece of wood you will see them playing it at every street corner all day long and no amusement can rival it with the result that by the time a boy is fifteen he has acquired considerable skill in the exercise and a favourite entertainment then is to hire a bullcalf for an afternoon and practise with it every urchin in andalusia knows the names of the most prominent champions and can tell you their merits  the bullfight is the national spectacle it excites spaniards as nothing else can and the death of a famous torero is more tragic than the loss of a colony seville looks upon itself as the very home and centre of the art the good king ferdinand viias precious a rascal as ever graced a thronefounded in seville the first academy for the cultivation of tauromachy and bullfighters swagger through the sierpes in great numbers and the most faultless costume  there are only five great bullfights in a year at seville namely on easter day on the three days of the fair and on corpus christi but during the summer novilladas are held every sunday with bulls of three years old and young fighters long before an important corrida there is quite an excitement in the town gaudy bills are posted on the walls with the names of the performers and the proprietor of the bulls crowds stand round reading them breathlessly discussing with one another the chances of the fray the papers give details and forecasts as in england they do for the better cause of horseracing and the journeyings of the matador are announced as exactly as with us the doings of the nobility and gentry  the great matador mazzantini or guerrita arrives the day before the fight and perhaps takes a walk in the sierpes people turn to look at him and acquaintances shake his hand pleased that all the world may know how friendly they are with so great a man the hero himself is calm and gracious he feels himself a person of merit and cannot be unconscious that he has a fortune of several million pesetas bringing in a reasonable interest he talks with ease and assurance often condescends to joke and elegantly waves his hand sparkling with diamonds of great value      many persons have described a bullfight but generally their emotions have overwhelmed them so that they have seen only part of one performance and consequently have been obliged to use an indignant imagination to help out a very faulty recollection this is my excuse for giving one more account of an entertainment which can in no way be defended it is doubtless vicious and degrading but with the constant danger the skill displayed the courage the hairbreadth escapes the catastrophes it is foolish to deny that any pastime can be more exciting  the english humanity to animals is one of the best traits of a great people and they justly thank god they are not as others are can anything more horrid be imagined than to kill a horse in the bullring and can any decent hack ask for a better end when he is broken down than to be driven to death in london streets or to stand for hours on cab ranks in the rain and snow of an english winter the spaniards are certainly cruel to animals on the other hand they never beat their wives nor kick their children from the dogs point of view i would ten times sooner be english but from the womansi have my doubts some while ago certain papers anxious perhaps to taste the comfortable joys of selfrighteousness turned their attention to the brutality of spaniards and a score of journalists wrote indignantly of bullfights at the same time by a singular chance a prizefighter was killed in london and the spanish papers printed long tirades against the gross barbaric english the two sets of writers were equally vehement inaccurate and flowery but what seemed most remarkable was that each side evidently felt quite unaffected horror and disgust for the proceedings of the other like persons of doubtful character inveighing against the vices of the age both were so carried away by moral enthusiasm as to forget that there was anything in their own histories which made this virtuous fury a little absurd there is really a good deal in the point of view     xxiv  sidenote corrida de torosi   on the day before a bullfight all the world goes down to tablada to see the bulls youth and beauty drive for every one in seville of the least pretension to gentility keeps a carriage the sevillans characteristically may live in houses void of every necessity and comfort eating bread and water but they will have a carriage to drive in the paseo you see vehicles of all kinds from the new landau with a pair of magnificent andalusian horses or the strange omnibus drawn by mules typical of southern spain to the shabby victoria with a brokendown hack and a decrepit coachman  tablada is a vast common without the town running along the river side and here all manner of cattle are kept throughout the year but the fighting bulls are brought from their respective farms the morning before the day of battle and each is put in an enclosure with its attendant oxen the crowd looks eagerly admiring the length of horn forecasting the fight  the handsome brutes remain there till midnight when they are brought to the ring and shut in little separate boxes till the morrow the encierro as it is called is an interesting sight the road has been palisaded and the bulls are driven along by oxen it is very curious to wait in the darkness in the silence under the myriad stars of the southern night your ear is astrung to hear the distant tramp the waiting seems endless a sound is heard and every one runs to the side but nothing follows and the waiting continues suddenly the stillness is broken by tinkling bells the oxen and immediately there is a tramp of rushing hoofs three men on horseback gallop through the entrance and on their heels the cattle the riders turn sharply round a door is swung to behind them and the oxen with the bulls in their midst pound through the ring      the doors are opened two hours before the performance through the morning the multitude has trooped to the plaza san fernando to buy tickets and in the afternoon all seville wends its way towards the ring the road is thronged with people they walk in dense crowds pushing one another to get out of the way of brokendown shays that roll along filled with enthusiasts the drivers crack their whips shouting un real un real a los torosa the sun beats down and the sky is intensely blue it is very hot already people are blowing and panting boys sell fans at a halfpenny each abanicos a perra chicab  when you come near the ring the din is tremendous the many vendors shout their wares middlemen offer tickets at double the usual price friends call to one another now and then is a quarrel a quick exchange of abuse as one pushes or treads upon his neighbour but as a rule all are astonishingly goodnatured a man after a narrow escape from being run over will shout a joke to the driver who is always ready with a repartee and they surge on towards the entrance every one is expectant and thrilled the very air seems to give a sense of exhilaration the people crowd in like ants all things are gay and full of colour and life  a picador passes on horseback in his uncouth clothes and all turn to look at him  and in the ring itself the scene is marvellous on one side the sun beats down with burning rays and there the seats being cheaper notwithstanding the terrific heat people are closely packed there is a perpetual irregular movement of thousands of womens fans fluttering to and fro opposite in the shade are nearly as many persons but of better class above in the boxes sit ladies in mantillas and when a beautiful woman appears she is often greeted with a burst of applause which she takes most unconcernedly when at last the ring is full tier above tier crammed so that not a place is vacant it gives quite an extraordinary emotion the serried masses cease then to be a collection of individuals but gain somehow a corporate unity you realise with a kind of indeterminate fear the manyheaded beast of savage instincts and of ruthless might no crowd is more picturesque than the spanish and the dark masculine costume vividly contrasts with the bright colours of the women with flowers in their hair and mantillas of white lace  but also the tremendous vitality of it all strikes you late arrivals walk along looking for room gesticulating laughing

suddenly there is a great clapping of hands and looking up you find the president has come he is supported by two friends and all three with comic solemnity wear tall hats and frock coats they bow to the public bullfighting is the only punctual thing in spain and the president arrives precisely as the clock strikes halfpast four he waves a handkerchief the band strikes up a door is opened and the fighters enter first come the three matadors the eldest in the middle the next on his right and the youngest on the left they are followed by their respective cuadrillas the banderilleros the capeadors the picadors on horseback and finally the chulos whose duty it is to unsaddle dead horses attach the slaughtered bull to the team of mules and perform other minor offices they advance gorgeous in their coloured satin and gold embroidery bearing a cloak peculiarly folded over the arm they walk with a kind of swinging motion as ordained by the convention of a century they bow to the president very solemnly the applause is renewed they retire to the side three picadors take up their places at some distance from one another on the right of the door from which issues the bull the alguaciles in black velvet with peaked and feathered hats on horseback come forward and the key of the bulls den is thrown to them they disappear the fighters meanwhile exchange their satin cloaks for others of less value there is another flourish of trumpets the gates are opened for the bull  then comes a moment of expectation every one is trembling with excitement there is perfect silence all eyes are fixed on the open gate  notes  a twopencehalfpenny to the bulls  b fans one halfpenny each  c water who wants water water  d the first prize who wants the first prize  e one halfpenny two papers for one halfpenny     xxv  sidenote corrida de torosii   one or two shouts are heard a murmur passes through the people and the bull emergesshining black with massive shoulders and fine horns it advances a little a splendid beast conscious of its strength and suddenly stops dead looking round the toreros wave their capes and the picadors flourish their lances long wooden spikes with an iron point the bull catches sight of a horse and lowering his head bears down swiftly upon it the picador takes firmer hold of his lance and when the brute reaches him plants the pointed end between its shoulders at the same moment the senior matador dashes forward and with his cloak distracts the bulls attention it wheels round and charges he makes a pass it goes by almost under his arm but quickly turns and again attacks this time the skilful fighter receives it backwards looking over his shoulder and again it passes there are shouts of enthusiasm from the public the bulls glossy coat is stained with red  a second picador comes forward and the bull charges again but furiously now exerting its full might the horse is thrown to the ground and the rider by an evil chance falls at the bulls very feet  it cannot help seeing him and lowers its head the people catch their breath many spring instinctively to their feet here and there is a womans frightened cry but immediately a matador draws the cape over its eyes and passionately the bull turns on him others spring forward and lift the picador his trappings are so heavy that he cannot rise alone he is dragged to safety and the steed brought back for him one more horseman advances and the bull with an angry snort bounds at him the picador does his best but is no match for the giant strength the bull digs its horns deep into the horses side and lifts man and beast right off the ground they fall with a heavy thud and as the raging brute is drawn off blood spurts from the horses flank the chulos try to get it up they drag on the reins with shouts and curses and beat it with sticks but the wretched creature wounded to the death helplessly lifts its head they see it is useless and quickly remove saddle and bridle a man comes with a short dagger called the puntilla which he drives into its head the horse falls on its side a quiver passes through its body and it is dead the people are shouting with pleasure the bull is a good one the first picador comes up again and the bull attacks for the fourth time but it has lost much strength and the man drives it off it has made a horrible gash in the horses belly and the entrails protrude dragging along the ground the horse is taken out  the president waves his handkerchief the trumpets sound and the first act of the drama is over  the picadors leave the ring and the banderilleros take their darts about three feet long gay with decorations of coloured paper while they make ready others play with the bull gradually tiring it one throws aside his cape and awaits the charge with folded arms the bull rushes at him and the man without moving his feet twists his body away and the savage brute passes on there is a great burst of applause for a daring feat well done  each matador has two banderilleros and it is proper that three pairs of these darts should be placed one of them steps to within speaking distance of the animal and holding a banderilla in each hand lifted above his head stamps his foot and shouts insulting words the bull does not know what this new thing is but charges blindly at the same moment the man runs forward and passing plants the two darts between the shoulders if they are well placed there is plentiful handclapping no audience is so liberal of applause for skill or courage none so intolerant of cowardice or stupidity and with equal readiness it will yell with delight or hiss and hoot and whistle the second banderillero comes forward to plant his pair a third is inserted and the trumpets sound for the final scene  this is the great duel between the single man and the bull the matador advances sword in hand with the muleta the red cloth for the passes over his arm under the presidents box he takes off his hat and with fine gesture makes a grandiloquent speech wherein he vows either to conquer or to die the harangue is finished with a wheel round and a dramatic flinging of his hat to attendants on the other side of the barrier he pensively walks forward all eyes are upon himand he knows it he motions his companions to stand back and goes close to the bull he is quite alone with his life in his handsa slender figure very handsome in the gorgeous costume glittering with fine gold he arranges the muleta over a little stick so that it hangs down like a flag and conceals his sword then quite solemnly he walks up to the bull holding the red rag in his left hand the bull watches suspiciously suddenly charges and the muleta is passed over its head the matador does not move a muscle the bull turns and stands quite motionless another charge another pass and so he continues making seven or eight of various sorts to the growing approbation of the public at last it is time to kill with great caution he withdraws the sword the bull looks warily he makes two or three passes more and walks round till he gets the animal into proper position the forefeet must be set squarely on the ground ora ora cry the people now now the bull is well placed the matador draws the sword back a little and takes careful aim the bull rushes and at the same moment the man makes one bound forward and buries the sword to the hilt between the brutes shoulders it falls to its knees and rolls over  then is a perfect storm of applause and it is worth while to see fourteen thousand people wild with delight the band bursts into joyous strains and the mules come galloping in gaily caparisoned a rope is passed round the dead beast and they drag it away the matador advances to the presidents box and bows while the shouting grows more frantic he walks round bowing and smiling and the public in its enthusiasm throws down hats and cigars and sticks  but there are no intervals to a bullfight and the picadors immediately reappear and take their places the doors are flung open and a second bull rushes forth the matador still goes round bowing to the applause elaborately unmindful of the angry beast  six animals are killed in an afternoon within two hours and then the mighty audience troop out with flushed cheeks the smell of blood strong in their nostrils     xxvi  sidenote on horseback   i had a desire to see something of the very heart of andalusia of that part of the country which had preserved its antique character where railway trains were not and the horse the mule the donkey were still the only means of transit after much scrutiny of local maps and conversation with horsedealers and others i determined from seville to go circuitously to ecija and thence return by another route as best i could the district i meant to traverse in olden times was notorious for its brigands even thirty years ago the prosperous tradesman voyaging on his mule from town to town was liable to be seized by unromantic outlaws and detained till his friends forwarded ransom while ears and fingers were playfully sent to prove identity in southern spain brigandage necessarily flourished for not only were the countryfolk in collusion with the bandits but the very magistrates united with them to share the profits of lawless undertakings drastic measures were needful to put down the evil and in a truly spanish way drastic measures were employed the civil guard whose duty it was to see to the safety of the country side had no confidence in the justice of madrid whither captured highwaymen were sent for trial once there for a few hundred dollars the most murderous ruffian could prove his babelike innocence forthwith return to the scene of his former exploits and begin again so they hit upon an expedient the civil guards set out for the capital with their prisoner handcuffed between them but curiously enough in every single case the brigand had scarcely marched a couple of miles before he incautiously tried to escape whereupon he was of course promptly shot through the back people noticed two things first that the clothes of the dead man were often singed as if he had not escaped very far before he was shot down that only proved his guardians zeal but the other was stranger the two civil guards when after a couple of hours they returned to the town as though by a mysterious premonition they had known the bandit would make some rash attempt invariably had waiting for them an excellent hot dinner  the only robber of importance who avoided such violent death was the chief of a celebrated band who when captured signed a declaration that he had not the remotest idea of escaping and insisted on taking with him to madrid his solicitor and a witness he reached the capital alive and having settled his little affairs with benevolent judges turned to a different means of livelihood and eventually it is said occupied a responsible post in the government it is satisfactory to think that his felonious talents were not in afterlife entirely wasted      it was the beginning of march when i started according to the old proverb the dog was already seeking the shade en marzo busca la sombra el perro the chilly spaniard loosening the folds of his capa acknowledged that at midday in the sun it was almost warm the winter rains appeared to have ceased the sky over seville was cloudless not with the intense azure of midsummer but with a blue that seemed mixed with silver and in the sun the brown water of the guadalquivir glittered like the scales on a fishs back or like the burnished gold of old moorish pottery  i set out in the morning early with saddlebags fixed on either side and poncho strapped to my pommel a loaded revolver though of course i never had a chance to use it made me feel pleasantly adventurous i walked cautiously over the slippery cobbles of the streets disturbing the silence with the clatter of my horses shoes now and then a mule or a donkey trotted by with panniers full of vegetables of charcoal or of bread between which on the beasts neck sat perched a man in a short blouse i came to the old rampart of the town now a promenade and at the gate groups of idlers with cigarettes between their lips stood talking  an hospitable friend had offered lodging for the night and food after which my ideas of the probable accommodation being vague i expected to sleep upon straw for victuals depending on the wayside inns i arrived at the campo de la cruz a tiny chapel which marks the same distance from the cathedral as jesus christ walked to the cross it is the final boundary of seville  immediately afterwards i left the highroad striking across country to carmona the land was already wild on either side of the bridlepath were great wastes of sand covered only by palmetto the air was cool and fresh like the air of english country in june when it has rained through the night and aguador snorting with pleasure cantered over the uneven ground nimbly avoiding holes and deep ruts with the surefootedness of his arab blood an andalusian horse cares nothing for the ground on which he goes though it be hard and unyielding as iron and he clambers up and down steep rocky precipices as happily as he trots along a cinderpath  i passed a shepherd in a ragged cloak and a broadbrimmed hat holding a crook he stared at me his flock of brown sheep clustered about him as i scampered by and his dog rushed after barking  vaya usted con dios  i came to little woods of pinetrees with long thin trunks and the foliage spreading umbrellawise round them circled innumerable hawks whose nests i saw among the branches two ravens crossed my path their wings heavily flapping  the great charm of the andalusian country is that you seize romance as it were in the act in northern lands it is only by a mental effort that you can realise the picturesque value of the life that surrounds you and for my part i can perceive it only by putting it mentally in black and white and reading it as though between the covers of a book once i remember in brittany in a distant corner of that rockbound coast i sat at midnight in a fishermans cottage playing cards by the light of two tallow candles next door with only a wall between us a very old sailor lay dying in the great cupboardbed which had belonged to his fathers before him and he fought for life with the remains of that strenuous vigour with which in other years he had battled against the storms of the atlantic in the stillness of the night the waves with the murmur of a lullaby washed gently upon the shingle and the stars shone down from a clear sky i looked at the yellow light on the faces of the players gathered in that desolate spot from the four corners of the earth and cried out by jove this is romance i had never before caught that impression in the very making and i was delighted with my good fortune  the answer came quickly from the american dont talk bosh its your deal  but for all that it was romance seized fugitively and life at that moment threw itself into a decorative pattern fit to be remembered it is the same effect which you get more constantly in spain so that the commonest things are transfigured into beauty for in the cactus and the aloe and the broad fields of grain in the mules with their wide panniers and the peasants in the shepherds huts and the straggling farmhouses the romantic is there needing no subtlety to be discovered and the least imaginative may feel a certain thrill when he understands that the life he leads is not without its æsthetic meaning      i rode for a long way in complete solitude through many miles of this sandy desert then the country changed and olivegroves in endless succession followed one another the trees with curiously decorative effect were planted in long even lines the earth was a vivid red contrasting with the blue sky and the sombre olives gnarled and fantastically twisted like evil spirits metamorphosed in places they had sown corn and the young green enhanced the shrill diversity of colour with its clear brilliant outlines and its lack of shadow the scene reminded one of a prim pattern such as in jane austens day young gentlewomen worked in worsted sometimes i saw women among the trees perched like monkeys on the branches or standing below with large baskets they were extraordinarily quaint in the trousers which modesty bade them wear for the concealment of their limbs when olivepicking the costume was so masculine their faces so red and weatherbeaten that the yellow handkerchief on their heads was really the only means of distinguishing their sex  but the path became more precipitous hewn from the sandstone and so polished by the numberless shoes of donkeys and of mules that i hardly dared walk upon it and suddenly i saw carmona in front of mequite close     xxvii  sidenote by the roadi   the approach to carmona is a very broad white street much too wide for the cottages which line it deserted and the young trees planted on either side are too small to give shade the sun beat down with a fierce glare and the dust rose in clouds as i passed presently i came to a great moorish gateway a dark mass of stone battlemented with a lofty horseshoe arch people were gathered about it in manycoloured groups i found it was a holiday in carmona and the animation was unwonted in a corner stood the hut of the consumo and the men advanced to examine my saddlebags i passed through into the town looking right and left for a parador an hostelry whereat to leave my horse i bargained for the price of food and saw aguador comfortably stalled then made my way to the nekropolis where lived my host there are many churches in carmona and into one of these i entered it had nothing of great interest but to a certain degree it was rich rich in its gilded woodwork and in the brocade that adorned the pillars and i felt that these spanish churches lent a certain dignity to life for all the careless flippancy of andalusia they still remained to strike a nobler note i forgot willingly that the land was priestridden and superstitious so that a spaniard could tell me bitterly that there were but two professions open to his countrymen the priesthood and the bullring it was pleasant to rest in that cool and fragrant darkness  my host was an archæologist and we ate surrounded by broken earthenware fragmentary mosaics and grinning skulls it was curious afterwards to wander in the graveyard which with indefatigable zeal he had excavated among the tombs of forgotten races letting oneself down to explore the subterranean cells the paths he had made in the giant cemetery were lined with a vast number of square sandstone boxes which had contained human ashes and now when the lid was lifted a green lizard or a scorpion darted out from the hill i saw stretched before me the great valley of the guadalquivir with the squares of olive and of ploughed field and the various greens of the corn it was like a vast multicoloured carpet but later with the sunset black clouds arose splendidly piled upon one another and the twilight air was chill and grey a certain sternness came over the olivegroves and they might well have served as a reproach to the facile andaluz for their cold passionless green seemed to offer a warning to his folly  at night my host left me to sleep in the village and i lay in bed alone in the little house among the tombs it was very silent the wind sprang up and blew about me whistling through the windows whistling weirdly and i felt as though the multitudes that had been buried in that old cemetery filled the air with their serried numbers a vast silent congregation waiting motionless for they knew not what i recalled a gruesome fact that my friend had told me not far from there in tombs that he had disinterred the skeletons lay huddled spasmodically with broken skulls and a great stone by the side for when a man he said lay sick unto death his people took him and placed him in his grave and with the stone killed him      in the morning i set out again it was fiveandthirty miles to ecija but a new high road stretched from place to place and i expected easy riding carmona stands on the top of a precipitous hill round which winds the beginning of the road below after many zigzags i saw its continuation a straight white line reaching as far as i could see in andalusia till a few years ago there were practically no high roads and even now they are few and bad the chief communication from town to town is usually an uneven track which none attempts to keep up with deep ruts and palmetto growing on either side and occasional pools of water a days rain makes it a quagmire impassable for anything beside the surefooted mule  i went on meeting now and then a string of asses their panniers filled with stones or with wood for carmona the drivers sat on the rump of the hindmost animal for that is the only comfortable way to ride a donkey a peasant trotted briskly by on his mule his wife behind him with her arms about his waist i saw a row of ploughs in a field to each were attached two oxen and they went along heavily one behind the other in regular line by the side of every pair a man walked bearing a long goad and one of them sang a malagueña its monotonous notes rising and falling slowly from time to time i passed a white farm a little way from the road invitingly cool in the heat the sun began to beat down fiercely the inevitable storks were perched on a chimney by their big nest and when they flew in front of me with their broad white wings and their red legs against the blue sky they gave a quaint impression of a japanese screen  a farmhouse such as this seems to me always a type of the spanish impenetrability i have been over many of them and know the manner of their rooms and the furniture the round of duties there performed and how the day is portioned out but the real life of the inhabitants escapes me my knowledge is merely external i am conscious that it is the same of the andalusians generally and am dismayed because i know practically nothing more after a good many years than i learnt in the first months of my acquaintance with them below the superficial similarity with the rest of europe which of late they have acquired there is a difference which makes it impossible to get at the bottom of their hearts they have no openness as have the french and the italians with whom a good deal of intimacy is possible even to an englishman but on the contrary an eastern reserve which continually baffles me i cannot realise their thoughts nor their outlook i feel always below the grace of their behaviour the instinctive primeval hatred of the stranger  gradually the cultivation ceased and i saw no further sign of human beings i returned to the desert of the previous day but the land was more dreary the little groves of pinetrees had disappeared there were no olives no cornfields not even the aloe nor the wilder cactus but on either side as far as the horizon desert wastes littered with stones and with rough boulders grown over only by palmetto for many miles i went dismounting now and then to stretch my legs and sauntering a while with the reins over my shoulder towards midday i rested by the wayside and let aguador eat what grass he could  presently continuing my journey i caught sight of a little hovel where the firbranch over the door told me wine was to be obtained i fastened my horse to a ring in the wall and going in found an aged crone who gave me a glass of that thin white wine produce of the last years vintage which is called vino de la hoja wine of the leaf she looked at me incuriously as though she saw so many people and they were so much alike that none repaid particular scrutiny i tried to talk with her for it seemed a curious life that she must lead alone in that hut many miles from the nearest hamlet with never a house in sight but she was taciturn and eyed me now with something like suspicion i asked for food but with a sullen frown she answered that she had none to spare i inquired the distance to luisiana a village on the way to ecija where i had proposed to lunch and shrugging her shoulders she replied how should i know i was about to go when i heard a great clattering and a horseman galloped up he dismounted and walked in a fine example of the andalusian countryman handsome and tall wellshaved with closecropped hair he wore elaborately decorated gaiters the usual short closefitting jacket and a broadbrimmed hat in his belt were a knife and a revolver and slung across his back a long gun he would have made an admirable brigand of comicopera but was in point of fact a farmer riding as he told me to see his novia or ladylove at a neighbouring farm  i found him more communicative and in the politest fashion we discussed the weather and the crops he had been to seville  che maravilla he cried waving his fine strong hands what a marvel but i cannot bear the townfolk what thieves and liars  townfolk should stick to the towns muttered the old woman looking at me somewhat pointedly  the remark drew the farmers attention more closely to me  and what are you doing here he asked  riding to ecija  ah youre a commercial traveller he cried with fine scorn you foreigners bleed the country of all its money you and the government  rogues and vagabonds muttered the old woman  notwithstanding the farmer with much condescension accepted one of my cigars and made me drink with him a glass of aguardiente  we went off together the mare he rode was really magnificent rather large holding her head beautifully with a tail that almost swept the ground she carried as if it were nothing the heavy spanish saddle covered with a white sheepskin its high triangular pommel of polished wood our ways however quickly diverged i inquired again how far it was to the nearest village  eh said the farmer with a vague gesture two leagues three leagues quien sabe who knows adios  he put the spurs to his mare and galloped down a bridletrack i whom no fair maiden awaited trotted on soberly     xxviii  sidenote by the roadii   the endless desert grew rocky and less sandy the colours duller even the palmetto found scanty sustenance and huge boulders strewn as though some vast torrent had passed through the plain alone broke the desolate flatness the dusty road pursued its way invariably straight neither turning to one side nor to the other but continually in front of me a long white line  finally in the distance i saw a group of white buildings and a cluster of trees i thought it was luisiana but luisiana they had said was a populous hamlet and here were only two or three houses and not a soul i rode up and found among the trees a tall white church and a pool of murky water further back a low new edifice which was evidently a monastery and a posada presently a franciscan monk in his brown cowl came out of the church and he told me that luisiana was a full league off but that food could be obtained at the neighbouring inn  the posada was merely a long barn with an open roof of wood on one side of which were half a dozen mangers and in a corner two mules against another wall were rough benches for travellers to sleep on i dismounted and walked to the huge fireplace at one end where i saw three very old women seated like witches round a brasero the great brass dish of burning cinders with true spanish stolidity they did not rise as i approached but waited for me to speak looking at me indifferently i asked whether i could have anything to eat  fried eggs  anything else  the hostess a tall creature haggard and grim shrugged her shoulders her jaws were toothless and when she spoke it was difficult to understand i tied aguador to a manger and took off his saddle the old women stirred themselves at last and one brought a portion of chopped straw and a little barley another with the bellows blew on the cinders and the third taking eggs from a basket fried them on the brasero besides they gave me coarse brown bread and red wine which was coarser still for dessert the hostess went to the door and from a neighbouring tree plucked oranges  when i had finishedit was not a very substantial meali drew my chair to the brasero and handed round my cigarettecase the old women helped themselves and a smile of thanks made the face of my gaunt hostess somewhat less repellent we smoked a while in silence  are you all alone here i asked at length  the hostess made a movement of her head towards the country my son is out shooting she said and two others are in cuba fighting the rebels  god protect them muttered another  all our sons go to cuba now said the first oh i dont blame the cubans but the government  an angry light filled her eyes and she lifted her clenched hand cursing the rulers at madrid who took her children theyre robbers and fools why cant they let cuba go it isnt worth the money we pay in taxes  she spoke so vehemently mumbling the words between her toothless gums that i could scarcely make them out  in madrid they dont care if the country goes to rack and ruin so long as they fill their purses listen she put one hand on my arm my boy came back with fever and dysentery he was ill for monthsat deaths doorand i nursed him day and night and almost before he could walk they sent him out again to that accursed country  the tears rolled heavily down her wrinkled cheeks      luisiana is a curious place it was a colony formed by charles iii of spain with germans whom he brought to people the desolate land and i fancied the teuton ancestry was apparent in the smaller civility of the inhabitants they looked sullenly as i passed and none gave the friendly andalusian greeting i saw a woman hanging clothes on the line outside her house she had blue eyes and flaxen hair a healthy red face and a solidity of build which proved the purity of her northern blood the houses too had a certain exotic quaintness notwithstanding the universal whitewash of the south there was about them still a northern character they were prim and regularly built with little plots of garden the fences and the shutters were bright green i almost expected to see german words on the postoffice and on the tobaccoshop and the grandiloquent spanish seemed out of place i thought the spanish clothes of the men sat upon them uneasily  the day was drawing to a close and i pushed on to reach ecija before night but aguador was tired and i was obliged mostly to walk now the highway turned and twisted among little hills and it was a strange relief to leave the dead level of the plains on each side the land was barren and desolate and in the distance were dark mountains the sky had clouded over and the evening was grey and very cold the solitude was awful at last i overtook a pedlar plodding along by his donkey the panniers filled to overflowing with china and glass which he was taking to sell in ecija he wished to talk but he was going too slowly and i left him i had hills to climb now and at the top of each expected to see the town but every time was disappointed the traces of man surrounded me at last again i rode among olivegroves and cornfields the highway now was bordered with straggling aloes and with hedges of cactus  at last i reached the brink of another hill and then absolutely at my feet so that i could have thrown a stone on its roofs lay ecija with its numberless steeples     xxix  sidenote ecija   the central square where are the government offices the taverns and a little inn is a charming place quiet and lackadaisical its pale browns and greys very restful in the twilight and harmonious the houses with their queer windows and their balconies of wrought iron are built upon arcades which give a pleasant feeling of intimacy in summer cool and dark they must be the promenade of all the gossips and the loungers one can imagine the uneventful life the monotonous round of existence and yet the andalusian blood runs in the peoples veins to my writers fantasy ecija seemed a fit background for some tragic story of passion or of crime  i dined unromantically enough with a pair of commercial travellers a postoffice clerk and two stout elderly men who appeared to be retired officers spanish victuals are terrible and strange food is even more an affair of birth than religion since a man may change his faith but hardly his manner of eating the stomach used to roast meat and yorkshire pudding rebels against eastern cookery and a christian may sooner become a buddhist than a beefeater a guzzler of olla podrida the spaniards without weariness eat the same dinner day after day year in year out it is always the same white thin oily soup a dish of haricot beans and maize swimming in a revolting sauce a nameless entrée fried in oilandalusians have a passion for other animals insides a thin steak tough as leather and grilled to utter dryness raisins and oranges you rise from table feeling that you have been soaked in rancid oil  my tablecompanions were disposed to be sociable the travellers desired to know whether i was there to sell anything and one drew from his pocket for my inspection a case of watchchains the officers surmised that i had come from gibraltar to spy the land and to terrify me spoke of the invincible strength of the spanish forces  are you aware said the elder whose adiposity prevented his outward appearance from corresponding with his warlike heart are you aware that in the course of history our army has never once been defeated and our fleet but twice  he mentioned the catastrophes but i had never heard of them and trafalgar was certainly not included i hazarded a discreet inquiry whereupon with much emphasis both explained how on that occasion the spanish had soundly thrashed old nelson although he had discomfited the french  it is odd i observed that british historians should be so inaccurate  it is discreditable retorted my acquaintance with a certain severity  how long did the english take to conquer the soudan remarked the other somewhat aggressively picking his teeth twenty years we conquered morocco in three months  and the moors are devils said the commercial traveller i know because i once went to tangiers for my firm  after dinner i wandered about the streets past the great old houses of the nobles in the calle de los caballeros empty now and dilapidated for every gentleman that can put a penny in his pocket goes to madrid to spend it down to the river which flowed swiftly between high banks below the bridge two moorish mills irregular masses of blackness stood finely against the night near at hand they were still working at a forge and i watched the flying sparks as the smith hammered a horseshoe the workers were like silhouettes in front of the leaping flames  at many windows to my envy couples were philandering the night was cold and corydon stood huddled in his cape but the murmuring as i passed was like the flow of a rapid brook and i imagined i am sure far more passionate and romantic speeches than ever the lovers made i might have uttered them to the moon but i should have felt ridiculous and it was more practical to jot them down afterwards in a notebook in some of the surrounding villages they have so far preserved the moorish style as to have no windows within reach of the ground and lovers then must take advantage of the aperture at the bottom of the door made for the domestic cats particular convenience stretched full length on the ground on opposite sides of the impenetrable barrier they can still whisper amorous commonplaces to one another but imagine the confusion of a polite spaniard on a dark night stumbling over a recumbent swain  my dear sir i beg your pardon i had no idea  in old days the disturbance would have been sufficient cause for a duel but now manners are more peaceful the gallant turning a little removes his hat and politely answers  it is of no consequence vaya usted con dios  goodnight  the intruder passes and the beau endeavours passionately to catch sight of his mistress black eyes      next day was sunday and i walked by the river till i found a plot of grass sheltered from the wind by a bristly hedge of cactus i lay down in the sun lazily watching two oxen that ploughed a neighbouring field  i felt it my duty in the morning to buy a chapbook relating the adventures of the famous brigands who were called the seven children of ecija and this somewhat sleepily i began to read it required a byronic stomach for the very first chapter led me to a monastery where mass proceeded in memory of some victim of undiscovered crime seven handsome men appeared most splendidly arrayed but armed to the teeth each one was every inch a brigand pitiless yet great of heart saturnine yet gentlemanly and their peculiarity was that though six were killed one day seven would invariably be seen the next the most gorgeously apparelled of them all entering the sacristy flung a purse of gold to the superior while a scalding tear coursed down his sunburnt cheek and this he dried with a noble gesture and a richly embroidered handkerchief in a whirlwind of romantic properties i read of a wicked miser who refused to support his brothers widow of the widow herself brought at birth to a gardener in the dead of night by a mysterious mulatto and of this ladys lovely offspring my own feelings can never be harrowed on behalf of a widow with a marriageable daughter but i am aware that habitual readers of romance like ostriches will swallow anything i was hurried to a subterranean chamber where the seven children in still more elaborate garments performed various dark deeds smoked expensive havanas and seated on silken cushions partook like freemasons of a succulent cold collation  the sun shone down with comfortable warmth and i stretched my legs my pipe was out and i refilled it a meditative snail crawled up and observed me with flattering interest  i grew somewhat confused a stolen will was of course inevitable and so were prison dungeons but the characters had an irritating trick of revealing at critical moments that they were longlost relatives it must have been a tedious age when poor relations were never safely buried however youth and beauty were at last triumphant and villainy confounded virtue was crowned with orange blossom and vice died a miserable death rejoicing in duty performed i went to sleep     xxx  sidenote wind and storm   but next morning the sky was dark with clouds people looked up dubiously when i asked the way and distance to marchena prophesying rain fetching my horse the owner of the stable robbed me with peculiar callousness for he had bound my hands the day before when i went to see how aguador was treated by giving me with most courteous ceremony a glass of aguardiente and his urbanity was then so captivating that now i lacked assurance to protest i paid the scandalous overcharge with a good grace finding some solace in the reflection that he was at least a picturesque blackguard tall and spare greyheaded with fine features sharpened by age to the strongest lines for i am always grateful to the dishonest when they add a certain æsthetic charm to their crooked ways there is a proverb which says that in ecija every man is a thief and every womanno better than she should be i was not disinclined to believe it  i set out guided by a signpost and the good road seemed to promise an easy day they had told me that the distance was only six leagues and i expected to arrive before luncheon aguador fresh after his days rest broke into a canter when i put him on the green plot which the old spanish law orders to be left for cattle by the side of the highway but after three miles without warning the road suddenly stopped i found myself in an olivegrove with only a narrow path in front of me it looked doubtful but there was no one in sight and i wandered on trusting to luck  presently in a clearing i caught sight of three men on donkeys walking slowly one after the other and i galloped after to ask my way the beasts were laden with undressed skins which they were taking to fuentes and each man squatted crosslegged on the top of his load the hindermost turned right round when i asked my question and sat unconcernedly with his back to the donkeys head he looked about him vaguely as though expecting the information i sought to be written on the trunk of an olivetree and scratched his head  well he said i should think it was a matter of seven leagues but it will rain before you get there  this is the right way isnt it  it may be if it doesnt lead to marchena it must lead somewhere else  there was a philosophic ring about the answer which made up for the uncertainty the skinner was a fat goodhumoured creature like all spaniards intensely curious and to prepare the way for inquiries offered a cigarette  but why do you come to ecija by so roundabout a way as carmona and why should you return to seville by such a route as marchena  his opinion was evidently that the shortest way between two places was also the best he received my explanation with incredulity and asked more insistently why i went to ecija on horseback when i might go by train to madrid  for pleasure said i  my good sir you must have come on some errand  oh yes i answered hoping to satisfy him on the search for emotion  at this he bellowed with laughter and turned round to tell his fellows  usted es muy guason he said at length which may be translated youre a mighty funny fellow  i expressed my pleasure at having provided the skinners with amusement and bidding them farewell trotted on  i went for a long time among the interminable olives grey and sad beneath the sullen clouds and at last the rain began to fall i saw a farm not very far away and cantered up to ask for shelter an old woman and a labourer came to the door and looked at me very doubtfully they said it was not a posada but my soft words turned their hearts and they allowed me to come in the rain poured down in heavy oblique lines  the labourer took aguador to the stable and i went into the parlour a long low airy chamber like the refectory of a monastery with windows reaching to the ground two girls were sitting round the brasero sewing they offered me a chair by their side and as the rain fell steadily we began to talk the old woman discreetly remained away they asked about my journey and as is the spanish mode about my country myself and my belongings it was a regular volley of questions i had to answer but they sounded pleasanter in the mouth of a pretty girl than in that of an obese old skinner and the rippling laughter which greeted my replies made me feel quite witty when they smiled they showed the whitest teeth then came my turn for questioning the girl on my right prettier than her sister was very spanish with black expressive eyes an olive skin and a bunch of violets in her abundant hair i asked whether she had a novio or lover and the question set her laughing immoderately what was her name soledadsolitude  i looked somewhat anxiously at the weather i feared the shower would cease and in a minute alas the rain passed away and i was forced to notice it for the sunrays came dancing through the window importunately making patterns of light upon the floor i had no further excuse to stay and said goodbye but i begged for the bunch of violets in soledads dark hair and she gave it with a pretty smile i plunged again into the endless olivegroves  it was a little strange the momentary irruption into other peoples lives the friendly gossip with persons of a different tongue and country whom i had never seen before whom i should never see again and were i not strictly truthful i might here lighten my narrative by the invention of a charming and romantic adventure but if chance brings us often for a moment into other existences it takes us out with equal suddenness so that we scarcely know whether they were real or mere imaginings of an idle hour the fates have a passion for the unfinished sketch and seldom trouble to unravel the threads which they have so laboriously entangled the little scene brought another to my mind when i was on accident duty at st thomass hospital a man brought his son with a broken leg it was hard luck on the little chap for he was seated peacefully on the ground when another boy climbing a wall fell on him and did the damage when i returned him duly bandaged to his fathers arms the child bent forward and put out his lips for a kiss saying goodnight with babyish pronunciation the father and the attendant nurse laughed and i being young was confused and blushed profusely they went away and somehow or other i never saw them again i wonder if the pretty child he must be eight or ten now remembers kissing a very weary medical student who had not slept much for several days and was dead tired probably he has quite forgotten that he ever broke his leg and i suppose no recollection remains with the pretty girl in the farm of a foreigner riding mysteriously through the olivegroves to whom she gave shelter and a bunch of violets      i came at last to the end of the trees and found then that a mighty wind had risen which blew straight in my teeth it was hard work to ride against it but i saw a white town in the distance on a hill and made for it rejoicing in the prospect presently i met some men shooting and to make sure asked whether the houses i saw really were marchena  oh no said one youve come quite out of the way that is fuentes marchena is over there beyond the hill  my heart sank for i was growing very hungry and i asked whether i could not get shelter at fuentes they shrugged their shoulders and advised me to go to marchena which had a small inn i went on for several hours battling against the wind bent down in order to expose myself as little as possible over a huge expanse of pasture land a desert of green i reached the crest of the hill but there was no sign of marchena unless that was a tower which i saw very far away its summit just rising above the horizon  i was ravenous my saddlebags contained spaces for a bottle and for food and i cursed my folly in stuffing them with such useless refinements of civilisation as hairbrushes and soap it is possible that one could allay the pangs of hunger with soap but under no imaginable circumstances with hairbrushes  it was a tower in the distance but it seemed to grow neither nearer nor larger the wind blew without pity and miserably aguador tramped on i no longer felt very hungry but dreadfully bored in that waste of greenery the only living things beside myself were a troop of swallows that had accompanied me for miles they flew close to the ground in front of me circling round and the wind was so high that they could scarcely advance against it  i remembered the skinners question why i rode through the country when i could go by train i thought of the cheshire cheese in fleet street where persons more fortunate than i had that day eaten hearty luncheons i imagined to myself a wellgrilled steak with boiled potatoes and a pint of old ale stilton the smoke rose to my nostrils  but at last the saints be praised i found a real bridlepath signs of civilisation ploughed fields and i came in sight of marchena perched on a hilltop surrounded by its walls when i arrived the sun was setting finely behind the town     xxxi  sidenote two villages   marchena was all white and on the cold windy evening i spent there deserted of inhabitants quite rarely a man sidled past wrapped to the eyes in his cloak or a woman with a black shawl over her head i saw in the town nothing characteristic but the wickerwork frame in front of each window so that people within could not possibly be seen it was evidently a moorish survival at night men came into the eatingroom of the inn ate their dinner silently and muffling themselves quickly went out the cold seemed to have killed all life in them i slept in a little windowless cellar on a straw bed which was somewhat verminous  but next morning as i looked back the view of marchena was charming it stood on the crest of a green hill surrounded by old battlements and the sun shone down upon it the wind had fallen and in the early hour the air was pleasant and balmy there was no road whatever not even a bridletrack this time and i made straight for seville i proposed to rest my horse and lunch at mairena on one side was a great plain of young corn stretching to the horizon and on the other with the same mantle of green little hills round which i slowly wound the sun gave all manner of varied tints to the verduresometimes it was all emerald and gold and at others it was like dark green velvet  but the clouds in the direction of seville were very black and coming nearer i saw that it rained upon the hills the water fell on the earth like a transparent sheet of grey soon i felt an occasional drop and i put on my poncho  the rain began in earnest no northern drizzle but a streaming downpour that soaked me to the skin the path became marshlike and aguador splashed along at a walk it was impossible to go faster the rain pelted down blinding me then oddly enough for the occasion hardly warranted such highflown thoughts i felt suddenly the utter helplessness of man i had never before realised with such completeness his insignificance beside the might of nature alone with not a soul in sight i felt strangely powerless the plain flaunted itself insolently in face of my distress and the hills raised their heads with a scornful pride they met the rain as equals but me it crushed i felt as though it would beat me down into the mire i fell into a passion with the elements and was seized with a desire to strike out but the white sheet of water was senseless and impalpable and i relieved myself by raging inwardly at the fools who complain of civilisation and of railwaytrains they have never walked for hours footdeep in mud terrified lest their horse should slip with the rain falling as though it would never cease  the path led me to a river there was a ford but the water was very high and rushed and foamed like a torrent ignorant of the depth and mistrustful i trotted upstream a little seeking shallower parts but none could be seen and it was no use to look for a bridge i was bound to cross and i had to risk it my only consolation was that even if aguador could not stand i was already so wet that i could hardly get wetter the good horse required some persuasion before he would enter the water rushed and bubbled and rapidly became deeper he stopped and tried to turn back but i urged him on my feet went under water and soon it was up to my knees then absurdly it struck me as rather funny and i began to laugh i could not help thinking how foolish i should look and feel on arriving at the other side if i had to swim for it but immediately it grew shallower all my adventures tailed off thus unheroically just when they began to grow exciting and in a minute i was on comparatively dry land  i went on still with no view of mairena but i was coming nearer i met a group of women walking with their petticoats over their heads i passed a labourer sheltered behind a hedge while his oxen stood in a field looking miserably at the rain still it fell still it fell  and when i reached mairena it was the most cheerless place i had come across on my journey merely a povertystricken hamlet that did not even boast a bad inn i was directed from place to place before i could find a stable i was soaked to the skin and there seemed no shelter at last i discovered a wretched wineshop but the woman who kept it said there was no fire and no food then i grew very cross i explained with heat that i had money it is true i was bedraggled and disreputable but when i showed some coins to prove that i could pay for what i bought she asked unwillingly what i required i ordered a brasero and dried my clothes as best i could by the burning cinders i ate a scanty meal of eggs and comforted myself with the thin wine of the leaf sufficiently alcoholic to be exhilarating and finally with aguardiente regained my equilibrium  but the elements were against me the rain had ceased while i lunched but no sooner had i left mairena than it began again and seville was sixteen miles away it poured steadily i tramped up the hills covered with nuttrees i wound down into valleys the way seemed interminable i tramped on at last from the brow of a hill i saw in the distance the giralda and the clustering houses of seville but all grey in the wet above it heavy clouds were lowering on and on  the day was declining and seville now was almost hidden in the mist but i reached a road i came to the first tavern of the environs after a while to the first houses then the road gave way to slippery cobbles and i was in seville the saints be praised     xxxii  sidenote granada   to go from seville to granada is like coming out of the sunshine into deep shadow i arrived my mind full of moorish pictures expecting to find a vivid tumultuous life and i was ready with a prodigal hand to dash on the colours of my admiration but granada is a sad town grey and empty its people meander melancholy through the streets unoccupied it is a tradeless place living on the monuments which attract strangers and like many a city famous for stirring history seems utterly exhausted granada gave me an impression that it wished merely to be left alone to drag out its remaining days in peace away from the advance of civilisation and the fervid hurrying of progress it seemed like a great adventuress retired from the world after a life of vicissitude anxious only to be forgotten and after so much storm and stress to be nothing more than pious there must be many descendants of the moors but the present population is wan and lifeless they are taciturn sombre folk with nothing in them of the chattering and vivacious creatures of arab history indeed as i wandered through the streets it was not the moors that engaged my mind but rather ferdinand of arragon and isabella of castille their grim strength overpowered the more graceful shadows of moordom and it was only by an effort that i recalled gazul and musa most gallant and amorous of paynim knights tilting in the square displaying incredible valour in the slaughter of savage bulls i thought of the catholic kings in full armour riding with clank of steel through the captured streets and the snowy summits of the sierra nevada dazzling sometimes under the sun and the blue sky but more often veiled with mist and capped by heavy clouds grim and terrifying lent a sort of tragic interest to the scene so that i felt those grey masses with their cloak of white they seemed near enough to overwhelm one made it impossible for the town built at their very feet to give itself over altogether to flippancy  and for a while i found little of interest in granada but the alhambra the gipsy quarter with neither beauty colour nor even a touch of barbarism is a squalid brutal place consisting of little dens built in the rock of the mountain which stands opposite the alhambra worse than hovels they are the lairs of wild beasts foetid and oppressive inhabited by debased creatures with the low forehead the copper skin and the shifty cruel look of the spanish gipsy they surround the visitor in their rags and tatters clamouring for alms and for exorbitant sums proposing to dance even in the slums of great cities i have not seen a life more bestial i tried to imagine what sort of existence these people led in the old days the rockdwellings among the cactus served the gipsies for winter quarters only and when the spring came they set off scouring the country for something to earn or steal but that is long ago for two generations they have remained in these hovelsyear in year outemployed in shoeing horses shearing and the like menial occupations which the spaniard thinks beneath his dignity the women tell fortunes or dance for the foreigner or worse it is a mere struggle for daily bread i wondered whether in the springtime the young men loved the maidens or if they only coupled like the beasts i saw one pair who seemed quite newly wed for their scanty furniture was new and they were young the man short and squat sat scowling crosslegged on a chair a cigarette between his lips the woman was taller and not illmade a slattern her hair fell dishevelled on her back and over her forehead her dress was open displaying the bosom her apron was filthy but when she smiled asking for money her teeth were white and regular and her eyes flashed darkly she was attractive in a heavy sensual fashion attractive and at the same time horribly repellant she was the sort of woman who might fetter a man to herself by some degrading insuperable passion the true carmen of the famous story whom a man might at once love and hate so that though she dragged him to hell in shame and in despair he would never find the strength to free himself but where among that bastard race was the splendid desire for freedom of their fathers the love of the fresh air of heaven and the untrammeled life of the fields  at first glance also the cathedral seemed devoid of charm i suppose travellers seek emotions in the things they see and often the more beautiful objects do not give the most vivid sensations painters complain that men of letters have written chiefly of secondrate pictures but the literary sentiment is different from the artistic and a masterpiece of perugino may excite it less than a mediocre work of guido reni  the cathedral of granada is said by the excellent fergusson to be the most noteworthy example in europe of early renaissance architecture its proportions are evidently admirable and it is designed and carried out according to all the canons of the art looking at its plan only he says this is certainly one of the finest churches in europe it would be difficult to point out any other in which the central aisle leads up to the dome so well proportioned to its dimensions and to the dignity of the high altar which stands under it but though i vaguely recognised these perfections though the spacing appeared fine and simple and the columns had a certain majesty i was left more than a little cold the whitewash with which the interior is coated gives an unsympathetic impression and the abundant light destroys that mystery which the poorest gaudiest spanish church almost invariably possesses in the capilla de los reyes are the elaborate monuments of the catholic kings of their daughter joan the mad and of philip her husband below in the crypt are four simple coffins in which after so much grandeur so much joy and sorrow they rest indeed for the two poor women who loved without requite it was a life of pain almost unrelieved it is a pitiful story for all its magnificence of joan with her fiery passion for the handsome faithless worthless husband and her mad jealousy and of isabella with patient strength bearing every cross always devoted to the man who tired of her quickly and repaid her deep affection with naught but coldness and distrust  queen isabellas sword and sceptre are shown in the sacristry and in contrast with the implement of war a beautiful cope worked with her royal hands and her crown also may be seen one of the few i have come across which might really become the wearer of silver a masterpiece of delicate craftsmanship  but presently returning to the cathedral and sitting in front of the high altar i became at last conscious of its airy restful grace the chancel is very lofty the base is a huge arcade which gives an effect of great lightness and above are two rows of pictures and still higher two rows of painted windows the coloured glass throws the softest lights upon the altar and on the marble floor rendering even quieter the low tints of the pictures these are a series of illustrations of the life of the blessed virgin painted by alonzo cano a native of valladolid who killed his wife and came to granada whereupon those in power made him a prebendary in the obscurity i could not see the paintings but divined soft and pleasant things after the style of murillo and doubtless that was better than actually to see them the pulpits are gorgeously carved in wood and from the walls fly great angels with fine turbulence of golden drapery and in the contrast of the soft white stone with the gold which not even the most critical taste could complain was too richly spread there is a delicate fascinating lightness the chancel has almost an italian gaiety which comes upon one oddly in the gloomy town here the decoration the gilded virgins the elaborate carving do not oppress as elsewhere the effect is too debonair and too refreshing it is one colour more one more distinction in the complexity of the religious sentiment      but if what i have said of granada seems cold it is because i did not easily catch the spirit of the place for when you merely observe and admire some view and if industrious make a note of your impression and then go home to luncheon you are but a vulgar tripper scum of the earth deserving the ridicule with which the natives treat you the romantic spirit is your only justification when by the comeliness of your life or the beauty of your emotion you have attained that shelley when he visited paestum had it but théophile gautier flaunting his red waistcoat tras los montes was perhaps no better than a cooks tourist then you are no longer unworthy of the loveliness which it is your privilege to see when the old red brick and the green trees say to you hidden things and the vega and the mountains are stretched before you with a new significance when at last the white houses with their brown tiles and the labouring donkey and the peasant at his plough appeal to you so as to make as it were an exquisite pattern on your soul then you may begin to find excuses for yourself but you may see places long and often before they are thus magically revealed to you and for myself i caught the real emotion of granada but once when from the generalife i looked over the valley the generalife in which are mingled perhaps more admirably than anywhere else in andalusia all the charm of arabic architecture of running water and of cypress trees of purple flags and dark red roses it is a spot indeed fit for the plaintive creatures of poets to sing their loves for paolo and francesca for juliet and romeo and i am glad that there i enjoyed such an exquisite moment     xxxiii  sidenote the alhambra   from the church of san nicolas on the other side of the valley the alhambra like all moorish buildings externally very plain with its red walls and low tiled roofs looks like some old charterhouse encircled by the fresh green of the springtime it lies along the summit of the hill with an infinite most simple grace dun and brown and deep red and from the sultry wall on which i sat the elmtrees and the poplars seemed very cool thirstily after the long drought the darro the arab stream which ran scarlet with the blood of moorish strife wound its way over its stony bed among the hills and beyond in strange contrast with all the fertility was the grey and silent grandeur of the sierra nevada few places can be more charming than the green wood in which stands the stronghold of the moorish kings the wind sighs among the topmost branches and all about is the sweet sound of running water in spring the ground is carpeted with violets and the heavy foliage gives an enchanting coldness a massive gateway flanked by watchtowers forms the approach but the actual entrance offering no hint of the incredible magnificence within is an insignificant door  but then then you are immediately transported to a magic palace existing in some uncertain age of fancy which does not seem the work of human hands but rather of jin an enchanted dwelling of seven lovely damsels it is barely conceivable that historical persons inhabited such a place at the same time it explains the wonderful civilisation of the moors in spain with their fantastic battles their songs and strange histories and it brings the arabian nights into the bounds of sober reality after he has seen the alhambra none can doubt the literal truth of the stories of sinbad the sailor and of hasan of bassorah      from the terrace that overlooks the city you enter the court of myrtlesa long pool of water with goldfish swimming to and fro enclosed by myrtle hedges at the ends are arcades borne by marble columns with capitals of surpassing beauty it is very quiet and very restful the placid water gives an indescribable sensation of delight and at the end mirrors the slender columns and the decorated arches so that in reflection you see the entrance to a second palace which is filled with mysterious beautiful things but in the alhambra the imagination finds itself at last out of its depth it cannot conjure up chambers more beautiful than the reality presents it serves only to recall the old inhabitants to the deserted halls  the moors continually used inscriptions with great effect and there is one in this court which surpasses all others in its oriental imagery in praise of mohammed v thou givest safety from the breeze to the blades of grass and inspirest terror in the very stars of heaven when the shining stars quiver it is through dread of thee and when the grass of the field bends down it is to give thee thanks  but it is the hall of the ambassadors which shows most fully the unparalleled splendour of moorish decoration it is a square room very lofty with alcoves on three sides at the bottom of which are windows and the walls are covered from the dado of tiles to the roof with the richest and most varied ornamentation the moorish workmen did not spare themselves nor economise their exuberant invention one pattern follows another with infinite diversity even the alcoves and there are nine are covered each with different designs so that the mind is bewildered by their graceful ingenuity all kinds of geometrical figures are used enlacing with graceful intricacy intersecting combining and dissolving conventional foliage and fruit arabic inscriptions an industrious person has counted more than one hundred and fifty patterns in the hall of the ambassadors impressed with iron moulds on the moist plaster of the walls the roof is a low dome of larch wood intricately carved and inlaid with ivory and with motherofpearl it has been likened to the faceted surface of an elaborately cut gem the effect is so gorgeous that you are oppressed you long for some perfectly plain space whereon to rest the eye but every inch is covered  now the walls have preserved only delicate tints of red and blue pale wedgwood blues and faded terracottas that make with the ivory of the plaster most exquisite harmonies but to accord with the tiles their brilliancy still undiminished the colours must have been very bright the complicated patterns and the gay hues reproduce the oriental carpets of the nomads tent for from the tent it is said i know not with what justification all oriental architecture is derived the fragile columns upon which rest masses of masonry are therefore direct imitations of tentpoles and the stalactite borders of the arches represent the fringe of the woven hangings the moorish architect paid no attention to the rules of architecture and it has been well said that if they existed for him at all it was only that he might elaborately disregard them his columns generally support nothing his arcades so delicately worked that they seem like carved ivory are of the lightest wood and plaster  and it is curious that there should be such durability in those dainty materials they express well the fatalism of the luxurious moor to whom the past and future were as nothing and the transient hour all in all yet they have outlasted him and his conqueror the spaniard inglorious and decayed is now but the showman to this magnificence time has seen his greatness come and go as came and went the greatness of the moor but still for all its fragility the alhambra stands hardly less beautiful travellers have always been astonished at the small size of the alhambra especially of the court of lions for here though the proportion is admirable the scale is tiny and many have supposed that the moors were of less imposing physique than modern europeans the court is surrounded by exquisite little columns singly in twos in threes supporting horseshoe arches and in the centre is that beautiful fountain borne by twelve lions with bristly manes standing very stiffly whereon is the inscription o thou who beholdest these lions crouching fear not life is wanting to enable them to show their fury  indeed their surroundings have such a delicate and playful grace that it is hard to believe the moors had any of our strenuous latterday passions life must have been to them a masque rather than a tragicomedy and whether they belong to sober history or no those contests of which the curious may read in the lively pages of gines perez de hita accord excellently with the fanciful environment in the alhambra nothing seems more reasonable than those neverending duels in which for a ladys favour gallant knights gave one another such blows that the air rang with them such wounds that the ground was red with blood but at sunset they separated and bound up their wounds and returned to the palace and the king at the relation of the adventure was filled with amazement and with great content      yet notwithstanding i find in the alhambra something unsatisfying for many an inferior piece of architecture has set my mind aworking so that i have dreamed charming dreams or seen vividly the life of other times but here i know not why my imagination helps me scarcely at all the existence led within these gorgeous walls is too remote there is but little to indicate the thoughts the feelings of these people and one can take the alhambra only as a thing of beauty and despair to understand  i know that it is useless to attempt with words to give an idea of these numerous chambers and courts a string of superlatives can do no more than tire the reader an exact description can only confuse nor is the painter able to give more than a suggestion of the bewildering charm the effect is too emotional to be conveyed from man to man and each must feel it for himself charles v called him unhappy who had lost such treasuredesgraciado el que tal perdioand showed his own appreciation by demolishing a part to build a renaissance palace for himself it appears that kings have not received from heaven with their right divine to govern wrong the inestimable gift of good taste and for them possibly it is fortunate since when perchance a sovereign has the artistic temperament a discerning peoplecuts off his head     xxxiv  sidenote boabdil the unlucky   he was indeed unhappy who lost such treasure the plain of granada smiles with luxuriant crops a beautiful country gay with a hundred colours and in summer when the corn is ripe it burns with vivid gold the sun shines with fiery rays from the blue sky and from the snowcapped mountains cool breezes temper the heat  but from his cradle boabdil was unfortunate soothsayers prophesied that his reign would see the downfall of the moorish power and his every step tended to that end never in human existence was more evident the mysterious power of the three sisters the daughters of night the fates had spun his destiny they placed the pitfalls before his feet and closed his eyes that he might not see they hid from him the way of escape allah achbar it was destiny in no other way can be explained the madness which sped the victims of that tragedy to their ruin for with the enemy at their very gates the muslims set up and displaced kings plotted and counterplotted boabdil was twice deposed and twice regained the throne even when the christian kingdoms had united to consume the remnant of moorish sovereignty the moors could not cease their quarrelling boabdil looked on with satisfaction while the territory of the rival claimant to his crown was wrested from him and did not understand that his turn must inevitably follow verily the gods wishing to destroy him had deranged his mind it is a pitiful history of treachery and folly that was enacted while the catholic sovereigns devoured the pomegranate seed by seed  to me history with its hopes bound to be frustrated and its useless efforts sometimes is so terrible that i can hardly read i feel myself like one who lives knowing the inevitable future and yet is powerless to help i see the acts of the poor human puppets and know the disaster that must follow i wonder if the calvinists ever realised the agony of that dark god of theirs omniscient and yet so strangely weak to whom the eternal majesty of heaven was insufficient to save the predestined from everlasting death      on march 22 1491 began the last siege of granada  ferdinand marched his army into the plain and began to destroy the crops taking one by one the surrounding towns he made no attempt upon the city itself and hostilities were confined to skirmishes beneath the walls and single combats between christian knights and muslim cavaliers wherein on either side prodigies of valour were performed through the summer the moors were able to get provisions from the sierra nevada but when with winter the produce of the earth grew less and its conveyance more difficult famine began to make itself felt the moors consoled themselves with the hope that the besieging army would retire with the cold weather for such in those days was the rule of warfare but ferdinand was in earnest when an accidental fire burned his camp he built him a town of solid stone and mortar which he named santa fè it stands still the only town in spain wherein a moorish foot has never trod then the muslims understood at last that the spaniard would never again leave that fruitful land  and presently they began to talk of surrender spanish gold worked its way with boabdils councillors and before winter was out the capitulation was signed  on the second day of the new year the final scene of the tragedy was acted early in the morning before break of day boabdil had sent his mother and his wife with the treasure to precede him to the alpuxarras in which district by the conditions of the treaty ferdinand had assigned him a little kingdom himself had one more duty to perform and at the prearranged hour he sallied forth with a wretched escort of fifty knights on the spanish side the night had been spent in joy and feasting but how must boabdil have spent his thinking of the inevitable morrow to him the hours must have sped like minutes what must have been the agony of his last look at the alhambra that jewel of incalculable price mendoza the cardinal had been sent forward to occupy the palace and boabdil passed him on the hill  soon he reached ferdinand who was stationed near a mosque surrounded by all the glory of his court pennons flying and knights in their magnificent array boabdil would have thrown himself from his horse in sign of homage to kiss the hand of the king of arragon but ferdinand prevented him then boabdil delivered the keys of the alhambra to the victor saying they are thine o king since allah so decrees it use thy success with clemency and moderation moving on sadly he saluted isabella and passed to rejoin his family the christians processioned to the city with psalmsinging  but when boabdil was crossing the mountains he turned to look at the city he had lost and burst into tears  you do well said his mother to weep like a woman for what you could not defend like a man  alas he cried when were woes ever equal to mine  it was not to be expected that the pious kings of castille and arragon would keep their word and means were soon invented to hound the wretched boabdil from the principality they had granted he crossed to africa and settled in fez of which the sultan was his kinsman it is pathetic to learn that there he built himself a palace in imitation of the alhambra at last after many years he was killed in an obscure battle fighting against the sultans rebels and the arab historian finishes the account of him with these words wretched man who could lose his life in anothers cause though he dared not die in his own such was the immutable decree of destiny blessed be allah who exalteth and abaseth the kings of the earth according to his divine will in the fulfilment of which consists that eternal justice which regulates all human affairs  in the day of el makkary the historian of the moorish empire boabdils descendants had so fallen that they were nothing but common beggars subsisting upon the charitable allowances made to the poor from the funds of the mosques  one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever     xxxv  sidenote los pobres   people say that in granada the beggars are more importunate than in any other spanish town but throughout andalusia their pertinacity and number are amazing they are licensed by the state and the brass badge they wear makes them demand alms almost as a right it is curious to find that the spaniard who is by no means a charitable being gives very often to beggarsperhaps from superstitious motives thinking their prayers will be of service or fearing the evil eye which may punish a refusal begging is quite an honourable profession in spain mendicants are charitably termed the poor and not besmirched as in england with an opprobrious name  i have never seen so many beggars as in andalusia at every church door there will be a dozen and they stand or sit at each street corner halt lame and blind every possible deformity is paraded to arouse charity some look as though their eyes had been torn out and they glare at you with horrible bleeding sockets most indeed are blind and you seldom fail to hear their monotonous cry sometimes naming the saints day to attract particular persons alms for the love of god for a poor blind man on this the day of st john they stand from morning till night motionless with hand extended repeating the words as the sound of footsteps tells them some one is approaching and then as a coin is put in their hands say gracefully dios se lo pagara god will repay you  in spain you do not pass silently when a beggar demands alms but pray his mercy for gods love to excuse you perdone usted por el amor de dios or else you beseech god to protect him dios le ampare and the mendicant coming to your gate sometimes invokes the immaculate virgin  ave maria purissima he calls  and you tired of giving reply y por siempre and for ever  he passes on satisfied with your answer and rings at the next door  it is not only in burgos that théophile gautier might have admired the beggars divine rags everywhere they wrap their cloaks about them in the same magnificent fashion the capa i suppose is the most graceful of all the garments of civilised man and never more so than when it barely holds together a mass of rags and patches stained by the rain and bleached by the sun and wind it hangs straight from the neck in big simple lines or else is flung over one shoulder with a pompous wealth of folds  there is a strange immobility about andalusian beggars which recalls their moorish ancestry they remain for hours in the same attitude without moving a muscle and one i knew in seville stood day after day from early morning till midnight with hand outstretched in the same rather crooked position never saying a word but merely trusting to the passerby to notice the variety is amazing men and women and children and seville at fairtime or when the foreigners are coming for holy week is like an enormous hospital mendicants assail you on all sides the legless dragging themselves on their hands the halt running towards you with a crutch the blind led by wife or child the deaf and dumb the idiotic i remember a woman with dead eyes and a huge hydrocephalic head who sat in a bathchair by one of the cathedral doors and whenever people passed cried shrilly for money in a high unnatural voice sometimes they protrude maimed limbs feetless legs or arms without hands they display loathsome wounds horribly inflamed every variety of disease is shown to extort a copper and so much is it a recognised trade that they have their properties as it were one old man whose legs had been shot away trotted through the narrow streets of seville on a diminutive ass driving it into the shopdoors to demand his mite then there are the children the little boys and girls that murillo painted barely covered by filthy rags cherubs with black hair and shining eyes the most importunate of all the tribe the refusal of a halfpenny is followed impudently by demands for a cigarette and as a last resort for a match they wander about with keen eyes for cigarends and no shred of a smoked leaf is too diminutive for them to get no further use from it  and beside all these are the blind fiddlers scraping out oldfashioned tunes that were popular thirty years ago the guitarists singing the flamenco songs which have been sung in spain ever since the moorish days the buffoons who extract tunes from a broomstick the owners of performing dogs  they are a picturesque lot neither vicious nor illhumoured begging is a fairly profitable trade and not a very hard one in winter el pobre can always find a little sunshine and in summer a little shade it is no hardship for him to sit still all day he would probably do little else if he were a millionaire he looks upon life without bitterness fate has not been very kind but it is certainly better to be a live beggar than a dead king and things might have been ten thousand times worse for instance he might not have been born a spaniard and every man in his senses knows that spain is the greatest nation on earth while to be born a citizen of some other country is the most dreadful misfortune that can befall him he has his licence from the state and a charitable public sees that he does not absolutely starve he has cigarettes to smoketo say that a blind man cannot enjoy tobacco is evidently absurdand therefore all these things being so why should he think life such a woeful matter while it lasts the sun is there to shine equally on rich and poor and afterwards will not a paternal government find a grave in the public cemetery it is true that the beggar shares it with quite a number of worthy persons doubtless most estimable corpses and his coffin even is but a temporary conveniencebut still what does it matter     xxxvi  sidenote the song   but the moorish influence is nowhere more apparent than in the spanish singing there is nothing european in that quavering lament in those longdrawn and monotonous notes in those weird trills the sounds are strange to the ear accustomed to less barbarous harmonies and at first no melody is perceived it is custom alone which teaches the sad and passionate charm of these things a malagueña is the particular complaint of the maid sorrowing for an absent lover of the peasant who ploughs his field in the declining day the long notes of such a song floating across the silence of the night are like a new melody on the great harpsichord of human sorrow no emotion is more poignant than that given by the faint sad sounds of a spanish song as one wanders through the deserted streets in the dead of night or far in the country with the sun setting red in the cloudless sky when the stillness is broken only by the melancholy chanting of a shepherd among the olivetrees  an heritage of moordom is the spanish love for the improvisation of wellturned couplets in olden days a skilful verse might procure the poet a dress of clothofgold and it did on one occasion actually raise a beggarmaid to a royal throne even now it has power to secure the lover his ladys most tender smiles or at the worst a glass of manzanilla the richness of the language helps him with his rhymes and his southern imagination gives him manifold subjects but being the result of improvisationno lady fair would consider the suit of a gallant who could not address her in couplets of his own devisingthe spanish song has a peculiar character the various stanzas have no bearing upon one another they consist of four or seven lines but in either case each contains its definite sentiment so that one verse may be a complete song or the singer may continue as long as the muse prompts and his subjects charms occasion the spanish song is like a barbaric necklace in which all manner of different stones are strung upon a single cord without thought for their mutual congruity  naturally the vast majority of the innumerable couplets thus invented are forgotten as soon as sung but now and then the fortuitous excellence of one impresses it on the makers recollection and it may be preserved here is an example which has been agreeably translated by mr j w crombie but neither original nor english rendering can give an adequate idea of the charm which depends on the oriental melancholy of the music      dos besos tengo en el alma     que no se apartan de mí     el ultimo de mi madre     y el primero que te di      deep in my soul two kisses rest     forgot they neer shall be     the last my mothers lips impressed     the first i stole from thee  here is another the survival of which testifies to the spanish extreme love of a compliment and the somewhat hackneyed sentiment can only have made it more pleasant to the feminine ear      salga el sol si ha de salir     y si no que nunca salga     que para alumbrarme á mí     la luz de tus ojos basta      if the sun care to rise let him rise     but if not let him ever lie hid     for the light from my ladyloves eyes     shines forth as the sun never did  it is a diverting spectacle to watch a professional improviser in the throes of inspiration this is one of the stock turns of the spanish musichall and one of the most popular i saw a woman in granada who was quite a celebrity and the barbaric wildness of her performance with its accompaniment of handclapping discordant cries and twanging of guitar harmonised well with my impression of the sombre and mediæval city  she threaded her way to the stage among the crowded tables through the auditorium a sallowfaced creature obese and largeboned with coarse features and singularly ropy hair she was accompanied by a fat small man with a guitar and a woman of mature age and ample proportions it appeared that the cultivation of the muse evidently more profitable than in england conduced to adiposity they stepped on the stage taking chairs with them for in spain you do not stand to sing and were greeted with plentiful applause the little fat man began to play the long prelude to the couplet the old woman clapped her hands and occasionally uttered a raucous cry the poetess gazed into the air for inspiration the guitarist twanged on and in the audience there were scattered cries of ole her companions began to look at the singer anxiously for the muse was somewhat slow and she patted her knee and groaned at last she gave a little start and smiled ole ole the inspiration had come she gave a moan which lengthened into the characteristic trill and then began the couplet beating time with her hands such an one as this  suspires que de mí salgan y otros que de tí saldran si en el camino se encuentran que de cosas se diran  if all the sighs thy lips now shape could meet upon the way with those that from mine own escape what things theyd have to say  she finished and all three rose from their chairs and withdrew them but it was only a false exit immediately the applause grew clamorous they sat down again and the little fat man repeated his introduction  but this time there was no waiting the singer had noticed a wellknown bullfighter and quickly rolled off a couplet in his praise the subject beamed with delight and the general enthusiasm knew no bounds the people excitedly threw their hats on the stage and these were followed by a shower of coppers which the performers more heedful to the compensation of art than to its dignity grovelled to picked up      here is a lovers praise of the whiteness of his ladys skin      la neve por tu cara       paso diciendo     en donde no hago falta       no me detengo      before thy brow the snowflakes       hurry past and say     where we are not needed       wherefore should we stay  and this last like the preceding translated by mr crombie shows once more how characteristic are murillos holy families of the popular sentiment      la virgen lava la ropa     san josé la esta tendiendo     santa ana entretiene el niño     y el agua se va riendo      the virgin is washing the clothes at the brook     and saint joseph hangs them to dry     saint anna plays with the holy babe     and the water flows smiling by     xxxvii  sidenote jerez   jerez is the andalusian sunshine again after the dark clouds of granada it is a little town in the middle of a fertile plain clean and comfortable and spacious it is one of the richest places in spain the houses have an opulent look and without the help of baedeker you may guess that they contain respectable persons with incomes and carriages and horses with frockcoats and gold watchchains i like the people of jerez their habitual expression suggests a consciousness that the almighty is pleased with them and they without doubt are well content with the almighty the main street with its trim shops and its cafés has the air of a french provincial townan appearance of agreeable ease and dulness  every building in jerez is washed with lime and in the sunlight the brilliancy is dazzling you realise then that in seville the houses are not whitealthough the general impression is of a white townbut on the contrary tinted with various colours from faintest pink to pale blue pale green they remind you of the summer dresses of women the soft tones are all mingled with the sunlight and very restful but jerez is like a white banner floating under the cloudless sky the pure white banner of bacchus raised defiantly against the gaudy dyes of teetotalism and its shrieking trumpets  jerez the white is of course the home of sherry and the whole town is given over to the preparation of the grateful juice the air is impregnated with a rich smell the sun shines down on jerez and its cleanliness its prosperity are a rebuke to harshvoiced contemners of the grape  you pass bodega after bodega caskfactories bottlefactories a bottlefactory is a curious interesting place an immense barn sombre so that the eye loses itself in the shadows of the roof and the scanty light is red and lurid from the furnaces which roar hoarsely and long against the glow the figures of men halfnaked move silently performing the actions of their craft with a monotonous regularity which is strange and solemn they move to and fro carrying an iron instrument on which is the molten mass of redhot glass and it gleams with an extraordinary warm brilliancy it twists hither and thither in obedience to the artisans deft movements it coils and writhes into odd shapes like a firesnake curling in the torture of its own unearthly ardour the men pass so regularly with such a silent and exact precision that it seems a weird and mystic measure they performa rhythmic dance of unimaginable intricacy whose meaning you cannot gather and whose harmony escapes you the flames leap and soar in a thousand savage forms and their dull thunder fills your ears with a confusion of sound your eyes become accustomed to the dimness and you discern more clearly the features of those swarthy men bearded and gnomelike but the molten mass has been put into the mould you watch it withdrawn the bottom indented the mouth cut and shaped and now it is complete but still redhot and glowing with an infernal transparency gemlike and wonderful it is a bottle fit now for the juice of satanic vineyards and the miraculous potions of eternal youth for which men in the old days bartered their immortal souls  and the effect of a bodega is picturesque too though in a different way it is a bright and cheerful spot a huge shed with whitewashed walls and an open roof supported by dark beams great casks are piled up impressing you in their vast rotundity with a sort of aldermanic stateliness the whole place is fragrant with clean vinous perfumes your guide carries a glass and a long filler you taste wine after wine in different shades of brown light wines to drink with your dinner older wines to drink before your coffee wines more than a century old of which the odour is more delicate than violets new wines of the preceding year strong and rough amontillados with the softest flavour in the world manzanillas for the gouty marsalas heavy and sweet wines that smell of wildflowers cheap wines and expensive wines then the brandiesthe distiller tells you proudly that spanish brandy is made from wine and contemptuously that french brandy is notold brandies for which a toper would sell his soul new brandies like fuseloil brandies mellow and mild and rich it is a drunkards paradise  and why should not the drinker have his paradise the teetotallers have slapped their bosoms and vowed that liquor was the devils own invention note by the way that liquor is a noble word that should not be applied to those weakkneed abominations that insolently flaunt their lack of alcohol let them be called liquids or fluids or beverages or what you will liquor is a word for heroes for the british tar who has built up british gloryimperialism is quite the fashion now and for a hundred years none has dared lift his voice in refutation of these dyspeptic slanders the toper did not care he nursed his bottle and let the world say what it would but the moderate drinker was abashed who will venture to say that a glass of beer gives savour to the humblest crust and comforts corydon lamenting the inconstancy of phyllis who will come forward and strike an attitude and prove the benefits of the grape the attitude is essential for without it you cannot hope to impress your fellow men rise up in your might ye lovers of hop and grape and ryerise up and slay the egyptians be honest and thank your stars for the cup that cheers bacchus was not a potbellied old sot but a beautiful youth with vineleaves in his hair bacchus the lover of flowers and ariadne was charming      the country about jerez undulates in just such an easy comfortable fashion as you would expect it is scenery of the gentlest and pleasantest type sinuous little hills rising with rounded lines and fertile valleys the vines cover the whole land creeping over the brown soil fantastically black stumps shrivelled and gnarled tortured into uncouth shapes they remind you of the creeping things in a naturalists museum of giant spiders and great dried centipedes and scorpions but imagine the vineyards later when the spring has stirred the earth with fecundity the green shoots tenderly forth at first it is all too delicate for a colour it is but a mist of indescribable tenuity and gradually the leaves burst out and trail along the ground with everincreasing luxuriance and then it is a rippling sea of passionate verdure  but i liked jerez best towards evening when the sun had set and the twilight glided through the tortuous alleys like a woman dressed in white then as i walked in the silent streets narrow and steep with their cobblepaving the white houses gained a new aspect there seemed not a soul in the world and the loneliness was more intoxicating than all their wines the shining sun was gone and the sky lost its blue richness it became so pale that you felt it like a face of deathand the houses looked like long rows of tombs we walked through the deserted streets i and the woman dressed in white side by side silently our footsteps made no sound upon the stones and jerez was wrapped in a ghostly shroud ah the beautiful things i have seen which other men have not     xxxviii  sidenote cadiz   i admire the strenuous tourist who sets out in the morning with his wellthumbed baedeker to examine the curiosities of a foreign town but i do not follow in his steps his eagerness after knowledge his devotion to duty compel my respect but excite me to no imitation i prefer to wander in old streets at random without a guidebook trusting that fortune will bring me across things worth seeing and if occasionally i miss some monument that is worldfamous more often i discover some little dainty piece of architecture some scrap of decoration that repays me for all else i lose and in this fashion the less pretentious beauties of a town delight me which if i sought under the guidance of the industrious german would seem perhaps scarcely worth the trouble nor do i know that there is in cadiz much to attract the traveller beyond the grace with which it lies along the blue sea and the unstudied charm of its gardens streets and marketplace the echo in the cathedral to which the gaping tripper listens with astonishment leaves me unmoved and in the church of santa catalina which contains the last work of murillo upon which he was engaged at his death i am more interested in the tall stout priest unctuous and astute who shows me his treasure than in the picture itself i am relieved now and again to visit a place that has no obvious claims on my admiration it throws me back on the peculiarities of the people on the stray incidents of the street on the contents of the shops  cadiz is said to be the gayest town in andalusia spaniards have always a certain gravity they are not very talkative and like the english take their pleasures a little sadly but here lightness of heart is thought to reign supreme and the inhabitants have not even the apparent seriousness with which the sevillan cloaks a somewhat vacant mind they are great theatregoers and as dancers of course have been famous since the world began but i doubt whether cadiz deserves its reputation for it always seems to me a little prim the streets are wellkept and spacious the houses taller than is usual in andalusia have almost as caredfor an appearance as those in a prosperous suburb of london and it is only quite occasionally when you catch a glimpse of tawny rock and of white breakwater against the blue sea that by a reminiscence of naples you can persuade yourself it is as immoral as they say for not unlike the syren city cadiz lies white and cool along the bay with gardens at the waters edge but it has not the magic colour of its rival it is quieter smaller more restful and on the whole lacks that agreeable air of wickedness which the italian town possesses to perfection it is impossible to be a day in naples without discovering that it is the most depraved city in europe there is something in the atmosphere which relaxes the moral fibre and the churchwarden who keeps guard in the bosom of every englishman falls asleep so that you feel capable of committing far more than the seven deadly sins of course you dont but still it is comfortable to have them within reach      i came across while examining the wares of a vendor of antiquities a contemporary narrative from the spanish side of the attack made on cadiz by sir francis drake when he set out to singe the beard of philip ii and this induced me afterwards to look into the english story it is far from me to wish to inform the reader but the account is not undiverting and shows besides a frame of mind which the anglosaxon has not ceased to cultivate but the almighty god says the historian knowing and seeing his the spanish kings wicked intent to punish molest and trouble his little flock the children of israel hath raised up a faithful moses for the defence of his chosen and will not suffer his people utterly to fall into the hands of their enemies drake set sail from plymouth with four of her majestys ships two pinnaces and some twenty merchantmen a vessel was sent after charging him not to show hostilities but the messenger owing to contrary winds could never come near the admiral and vastly to the annoyance of the virgin queen as she solemnly assured the ambassadors of foreign powers had to sail home under the circumstances it was perhaps hardly discreet of her to take so large a share of the booty  faithful moses arrived in cadiz spreading horrid consternation and the spanish pamphlet shows very vividly the confusion of the enemy it appears that had he boldly landed he might have sacked the town but he imagined the preparations much greater than they were however he was not idle the same night our general having by gods good favour and sufferance opportunity to punish the enemy of gods true gospel and our daily adversary and further willing to discharge his expected duty towards god his peace and country began to sink and fire divers of their ships  the english fleet burned thirty sail of great burden and captured vast quantities of the bread wheat wine and oil which had been prepared for the descent upon england sir francis drake himself remarks that the sight of the terrible fires were to us very pleasant and mitigated the burden of our continual travail wherein we were busied for two nights and one day in discharging firing and lading of provisions      it is a curious thing to see entirely deserted a place of entertainment where great numbers of people are in the habit of assembling a theatre by day without a soul in it gives me always a sensation of the ridiculous futility of things and a public garden towards evening offers the same emotion on the morrow i was starting for africa i watched the sunset from the quays of cadiz the vapours of the twilight rise and envelop the ships in greyness and i walked by the alamadas that stretch along the bay till i came to the park the light was rapidly failing and i found myself alone it had quaint avenues of short palms evidently not long planted and between them rows of yellow iron chairs arranged with great neatness and precision it was there that on sunday i had seen the populace disport itself and it was full of life then gay and insouciant the fair ladies drove in their carriages and the fine gentlemen proud of their english clothes lounged idly the chairs were taken by all the lesser fry by stout mothers dragons attendant on darkeyed girls and their lovers in broad hats in all the gala array of the flamenco there was a joyous clamour of speech and laughter the voices of spanish women are harsh and unrestrained the park sparkled with colour and the sun caught the fluttering of countless fans  for those blithe people it seemed that there was no morrow the present was there to be enjoyed divine and various and the world was full of beauty and of sunshine merely to live was happiness enough if there was pain or sorrow it served but to enhance the gladness the hurrying hours for a while had ceased their journey life was a cup of red wine and they were willing to drink its very dregs a brimming cup in which there was no bitterness but a joy more thrilling than the gods could give in all their paradise  but now i walked alone between the even rows of chairs the little palms were so precise with their careful foliage that they did not look like real trees the flowerbeds were very stiff and neat and now and then a pine stood out erect and formal as if it were a cardboard tree from a noahs ark the scene was so artificial that it brought to my mind the setting of a pantomime i stopped almost expecting a thousand balletgirls to appear from the wings scantily clad and go through a measure to the playing of some sudden band and retire and come forward till the stage was filled and a great tableau formed  but the day grew quite dim and the vast stage remained empty the painted scene became still more unreal and presently the park was filled with the ghostly shapes of all the lighthearted people who had lived their hour and exhibited their youth in the empty garden i heard the whispered compliments and the soft laughter of the ladies there was a peculiar little snap as gaily they closed their fans     xxxix  sidenote el genero chico   in the evening i wandered again along the quay my thoughts part occupied with the novel things i expected from morocco part sorrowful because i must leave the scented land of spain i seemed never before to have enjoyed so intensely the exquisite softness of the air and there was all about me a sense of spaciousness which gave a curious feeling of power in the harbour on the ships the lights of the masts twinkled like the stars above and looking over the stony parapet i heard the waves lap against the granite like a long murmur of regret i tried to pierce the darkness straining my eyes to see some deeper obscurity which i might imagine to be the massive coasts of africa but at last i could bear the solitude no longer and i dived into the labyrinth of streets  at first in unfrequented ways i passed people only one by one some woman walking rapidly with averted face or a pair of chattering students but as i came near the centre of the town the passersby grew more frequent and suddenly i found myself in the midst of a thronging noisy crowd i looked up and saw that i was opposite a theatre the people had just come from the second funcion i had heard that the natives of cadiz were eager theatregoers and was curious to see how they took this pleasure i saw also that the next piece was las borrachos a play of seville life that i had often seen and i felt that i could not spend my last evening better than in living again some of those scenes which pattered across my heart now like little sorrowful feet      the theatre in spain is the only thing that has developed further than in the rest of europein fact it has nearly developed clean away the spaniards were the first to confess that dramatic art bored them to death and their habits rendered impossible the long play which took an evening to produce eating late they did not wish to go to the theatre till past nine being somewhat frivolous they could not sit for more than an hour without going outside and talking to their friends and they were poor to satisfy their needs the genero chico or little style sprang into existence and quickly every theatre in spain was given over to the system of four houses a night each function is different and the stall costs little more than sixpence  we english are idealists and on the stage especially reality stinks in our nostrils the poor are vulgar and in our franker moments we confess our wish to have nothing to do with them the middle classes are sordid we have enough of them in real life and no desire to observe their doings at the theatre particularly when we wear our evening clothes but when a dramatist presents duchesses to our admiring eyes we feel at last in our element we watch the acts of persons whom we would willingly meet at dinner and our craving for the ideal is satisfied  but in spain nobles are common and excite no overwhelming awe the spaniard most democratic of europeans clamours for realism and nothing pleases him more than a literal transcript of the life about him the manners and customs of good society do not entertain him and the genero chico concerns itself almost exclusively with the lower classes the bullfighter is of course one of the most usual figures and round him are gathered the lovers of the ring innkeepers cobblers and carpenters policemen workmen flowersellers streetsingers cigarette girls country maidens the little pieces are innumerable and together form a compend of low life in spain the best are full of gaiety and high spirits with a delicate feeling for character and often enough are touched by a breath of poetry songs and dances are introduced and these come in the more naturally since the action generally takes place on a holiday the result is a musical comedy in one act but with nothing in it of the entertainment which is a joy to the british public an andalusian audience would never stand that representation of an impossible and vulgar world in which the women are all trollops and the men rips nincompoops and bounders they would never suffer the coarse humour and the shoddy patriotism  unfortunately these oneact plays have destroyed the legitimate drama whereas maria guerrero that charming actress will have a run of twenty nights in a new play by echegaray a popular zarzuela will be acted hundreds of times in every town in spain but none can regret that the spaniards have evolved these very national little pieces and little has been lost in the nonexistence of an indefinite number of imitations from the french the zarzuela i should add lasts about an hour and for the most part is divided into three scenes  such a play as los borrachos is nothing less than a genre picture of seville life it reminds one of a painting by teniers and i should like to give some idea of it since it is really one of the best examples of the class witty varied and vivacious but an obstacle presents itself in the fact that i can find no vestige of a plot the authors set out to characterise the various lovers of the vine nowhere in andalusia are the devotees of the yellow manzanilla more numerous than in seville and with telling strokes have drawn the goodnatured tippler the surly tippler the religious tippler to these they have added other types which every andalusian can recognise as old friendsthe sharptongued harridan the improviser of couplets with his ridiculous vanity the flowerseller and the prenticeboy of fifteen who notwithstanding his tender years is afflicted with love for the darkeyed heroine the action takes place first in a street then in a courtyard lastly in a carpenters shop there are dainty lovescenes between soledad the distressed maiden and juanillo the flowerseller and one very spanish where the witty and precocious apprentice offers her his diminutive hand and heart numerous people come and go the drunkards drink and quarrel and make peace the whole thing if somewhat confused is very lifelike and runs with admirable lightness and ease it is true that the play has neither beginning nor end but perhaps that only makes it seem the truer and if the scenes have no obvious connection they are all amusing and characteristic it is acted with extraordinary spirit the players indeed are not acting but living their ordinary lives and it is pleasant to see the zest with which they throw themselves into the performance when the hero presses the heroine in his arms smiles and passionate glances pass between them which suggest that even the lovemaking is not entirely makebelieve  i wish i could translate the song which juanillo sings when he passes his ladys window bearing his basket of flowers      carnations for pretty girls that are true     muskroses for pretty girls that are coy     rosebuds as small as thy mouth my dearest     and roses as fair as thy cheeks  i cannot indeed resist the temptation of giving one verse in that andalusian dialect from which all harsh consonants and unmusical sounds have been worn awaythe most complete and perfect language in the world for lovers and the passion of love        sal morena á tu ventana     mira las flores que traigo     sal y di si son bastantes     pa arfombrita de tu cuarto       que yo te quiero       y a ti te doy     tos los tesoros der mundo entero     to le que vargo to lo que soy     xl  sidenote adios   and then the morrow was come getting up at five to catch my boat i went down to the harbour a grey mist hung over the sea and the sun had barely risen a pallid yellow circle the fishingboats lolled on the smooth dim water and fishermen in little groups blew on their fingers  and from cadiz i saw the shores of spain sink into the sea i saw my last of andalusia who when he leaves a place that he has loved can help wondering when he will see it again i asked the wind and it sighed back the spanish answer quien sabe who knows the traveller makes up his mind to return quickly but all manner of things happen and one accident or another prevents him time passes till the desire is lost and when at last he comes back himself has altered or changes have occurred in the old places and all seems different he looks quite coldly at what had given an intense emotion and though he may see new things the others hardly move him it is not thus he imagined them in the years of waiting and how can he tell what the future may have in store perhaps notwithstanding all his passionate desires he will indeed never return  of course the intention of this book is not to induce people to go to spain railway journeys are long and tedious the trains crawl and the hotels are bad experienced globetrotters have told me that all mountains are very much alike and that pictures when you have seen a great many offer no vast difference it is much better to read books of travel than to travel oneself he really enjoys foreign lands who never goes abroad and the man who stays at home preserving his illusions has certainly the best of it how delightful is the anticipation as he looks over timetables and books of photographs forming delightful images of future pleasure but the reality is full of disappointment and the more famous the monument the bitterer the disillusion has any one seen st peters without asking himself is that all and the truest enjoyment arises from things that come unexpectedly that one had never heard of then living in a strange land one loses all impression of its strangeness it is only afterwards in england that one realises the charm and longs to return and a hundred pictures rise to fill the mind with delight why can one not be strong enough to leave it at that and never tempt the fates again  the wisest thing is to leave unvisited in every country some place that one wants very much to see in italy i have never been to siena and in andalusia i have taken pains to avoid malaga the guidebooks tell me there is nothing whatever to see there and according to them it is merely a prosperous seaport with a good climate but to me who have never seen it malaga is something very different it is the very cream of andalusia where every trait and characteristic is refined to perfect expression  i imagine malaga to be the most smiling town on the seaboard and it lies along the shore ten times more charmingly than cadiz the houses are white whiter than in jerez the patios are beautiful with oranges and palmtrees and the dark green of the luxuriant foliage contrasts with the snowy walls in malaga the sky is always blue and the sun shines but the narrow arab streets are cool and shady the passionate odours of andalusia float in the air the perfume of a myriad cigarettes and the fresh scent of fruit and flower the blue sea lazily kisses the beach and fishingboats bask on its bosom  in malaga for me there are dark churches with massive tall pillars the light falls softly through the painted glass regilding the golden woodwork the angels and the saints and the bishops in their mitres the air is heavy with incense and women in mantillas kneel in the halflight praying silently now and then i come across an old house with a fragment of moorish work reminding me that here again the moors have left their mark  and in malaga for me the women are more lovely than in seville for their dark eyes glitter marvellously and their lips so red and soft are ever trembling with a halfformed smile they are more graceful than the daffodils their hands are lovers sighs and their voice is a caressing song what was your voice like rosarito alas it is so long ago that i forget the men are tall and slender with strong clear features and shining eyes deep sunken in their sockets  in malaga for me life is a holiday in which there are no dullards and no bores all the world is strong and young and full of health and there is nothing to remind one of horrible things malaga i know is the most delightful place in andalusia oh how refreshing it is to get away from sober fact but what a fool i should be ever to go there      the steamer plods on against the wind slowly and as the land sinks away unsatisfied to leave the impressions hovering vaguely through my mind i try to find the moral the englishman ever somewhat sententiously inclined asks what a place can teach him the churchwarden in his bosom gives no constant enduring peace and after all though he may be often ridiculous it is the churchwarden who has made good part of englands greatness  and most obviously andalusia suggests that it might not be ill to take things a little more easily we english look upon life so very seriously so much without humour is it worth while to be quite so strenuous at the stations on the line between jerez and cadiz i noticed again how calmly they took things people lounged idly talking to one another the officials of the railway smoked their cigarettes no one was in a hurry time was long and whether the train arrived late or punctual could really matter much to no one a beggar came to the window a cigaretteend between his lips  caballero alms for the love of god for a poor old man god will repay you  he passed slowly down the train it waited for no reason the passengers stared idly at the loungers on the platform and they stared idly back no one moved except to roll himself a cigarette the sky was blue and the air warm and comforting life seemed good enough and above all things easy there was no particular cause to trouble what is the use of hurrying to pile up money when one can live on so little what is the use of reading these endless books why not let things slide a little and just take what comes our way it is only for a little while and then the great antique mother receives us once more in her bosom and there are so many people in the world think again of all the countless hordes who have come and gone and who will come and go the immense sea of time covers them and what matters the life they led what odds is it that they ever existed at all let us do our best to be happy the earth is good and sweetsmelling there is sunshine and colour and youth and loveliness and afterwardswell let us shrug our shoulders and not think of it  and then in bitter irony contradicting my moral a train came in with a number of cuban soldiers there were above fifty of them and they had to change at the junction they reached out to open the carriage doors and crawled down to the platform some of them seemed at deaths door they could not walk and chairs were brought that they might be carried others leaned heavily on their companions and they were dishevelled with stubbly beards but what struck me most was the deathly colour for their faces were almost green while round their sunken eyes were great white rings and the white was ghastly corpselike they trooped along in a dazed and listless fashion wasted with fever and now and then one stopped shaken with a racking cough he leaned against the wall and put his hand to his heart as if the pain were unendurable it was a pitiful sight they were stunted and undersized they ceased to develop when they went to the cruel island and they were puny creatures with hollow chests and thin powerless limbs often strangely enough their faces had remained quite boyish they were twenty or twentytwo and they looked sixteen and then by the sight of those boys who had never known youth with its joyful flowers doomed to a hopeless life i was forced against my will to another moral perhaps some would recover but the majority must drag on with ruined health feverstricken dying one by one falling like the unripe fruit of a rotten tree they had no chance poor wretches they would return to their miserable homes they could not work and their people were too poor to keep themso they must starve their lives were even shorter than those of the rest and what pleasure had they had  and that is the result of the spanish insouciancedeath and corruption loss of power and land and honour the ruin of countless lives and absolute decay it is rather a bitter irony isnt it and now all they have left is their sunshine and the equanimity which nothing can disturb  printed by ballantyne hanson  co london  edinburgh                                       castilian days by hon j hay illustrated by joseph
