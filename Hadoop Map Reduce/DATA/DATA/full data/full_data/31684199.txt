beauty and prudence col town she is so indeed and loveless being too careless and insensible of the treasure he possesses my lodging in the same house has given me a thousand opportunities of making

me this one conclusive trial of him i resolve to make    succeed or fail still victory is my lot   if i subdue his hearttis wellif not   i will subdue my conscience to my plot  exeunt     act ii  scene ilovelesss lodgings enter loveless and amanda love how do you like these lodgings my dear for my part i am so pleased with them i shall hardly remove whilst we stay here if you are satisfied aman i am satisfied with everything that pleases you else i had not come to scarborough at all love oh a little of the noise and folly of this place will sweeten the pleasures of our retreat we shall find the charms of our retirement doubled when we return to it aman that pleasing prospect will be my chiefest entertainment whilst much against my will i engage in those empty pleasures which tis so much the fashion to be fond of love i own most of them are indeed but empty yet there are delights of which a private life is destitute which may divert an honest man and be a harmless entertainment to a virtuous woman good music is one and truly with some small allowance the plays i think may be esteemed another aman plays i must confess have some small charms what do you think of that you saw last night love to say truth i did not mind it muchmy attention was for some time taken off to admire the workmanship of nature in the face of a young lady who sat at some distance from me she was so exquisitely handsome aman so exquisitely handsome love why do you repeat my words my dear aman because you seemed to speak them with such pleasure i thought i might oblige you with their echo love then you are alarmed amanda aman it is my duty to be so when you are in danger love you are too quick in apprehending for me i viewed her with a world of admiration but not one glance of love aman take heed of trusting to such nice distinctions but were your eyes the only things that were inquisitive had i been in your place my tongue i fancy had been curious too i should have asked her where she livedyet still without designwho was she pray love indeed i cannot tell aman you will not tell love upon my honour then i did not ask aman nor do you know what company was with her love i do not but why are you so earnest aman i thought i had cause love but you thought wrong amanda for turn the case and let it be your story should you come home and tell me you had seen a handsome man should i grow jealous because you had eyes aman but should i tell you he was exquisitely so and that i had gazed on him with admiration should you not think twere possible i might go one step further and inquire his name love aside she has reason on her side i have talked too much but i must turn off another way aloud will you then make no difference amanda between the language of our sex and yours there is a modesty restrains your tongues which makes you speak by halves when you commend but roving flattery gives a loose to ours which makes us still speak double what we think enter servant ser madam there is a lady at the door in a chair desires to know whether your ladyship sees company her name is berinthia aman oh dear tis a relation i have not seen these five years pray her to walk inexit servant heres another beauty for you she was when i saw her last reckoned extremely handsome love dont be jealous now for i shall gaze upon her too enter berinthia ha by heavens the very woman

speak of madam for tis impossible to be quiet without thinking now thinking is to me the greatest fatigue in the world aman does not your lordship love reading then lord fop oh passionately madam but i never think of what i read for example madam my life is a perpetual stream of pleasure that glides through with such a variety of entertainments i believe the wisest of our ancestors never had the least conception of any of em i rise madam when in town about twelve oclock i dont rise sooner because it is the worst thing in the world for the complexion not that i pretend to be a beau but a man must endeavour to look decent lest he makes so odious a figure in the sidebax the ladies should be compelled to turn their eyes upon the play so at twelve oclock i say i rise naw if i find it is a good day i resalve to take the exercise of riding so drink my chocolate and draw on my boots by two on my return i dress and after dinner lounge perhaps to the opera ber your lordship i suppose is

time tied up from losing above five thousand paunds at a sitting love but isnt your lordship sometimes obliged to attend the weighty affairs of the nation lord fop sir as to weighty affairs i leave

his title an authentic passport to every womans heart below the degree of a peeress col town hes coxcomb enough to think anything but i would not have you brought into trouble for him i hope theres no danger of his life love none at all hes fallen into the hands of a roguish surgeon who i perceive designs to frighten a little money out of him but i saw his woundtis nothing he may go to the ball

contriving with an old acquaintance of yours love explain col town his brother tom fashion is come down here and we have it in contemplation to save him the trouble of his intended wedding but we want your assistance tom would have called but he is preparing for his enterprise so i promised to bring you to himso sir if these ladies can spare you love ill go with you with all my heartaside though i

the provocation he pretends from me aside aman for heavens sake berinthia tell me what way i shall take to persuade you to come and live with me ber why one way in the world there is and but one aman and pray what is that ber it is to assure mei shall be very welcome aman if that be all you shall een sleep here tonight ber tonight aman yes tonight ber why the people where i lodge will think me mad

widow aman youll hardly make me think so ber poh because you are in love with your husband aman pray tis with a world of innocence i would inquire whether you think those we call women of reputation do really escape all other men as they do those shadows of beaux ber oh no amanda there are a sort of men make dreadful work amongst em men that may be called the beaus antipathy for they agree in nothing but walking upon two legs these have brains the beau has none these are in love with their mistress the beau with himself they take care of their reputation the beau is industrious to destroy

exit     act v  scene ithe garden behind lovelesss lodgings enter loveless love now does she mean to make a fool of me or not i shant wait much longer for my wife will soon be inquiring for me to set out on our supping party suspense is at all times the devil but of all modes of suspense the watching for a loitering mistress is the worstbut let me accuse her no longer she approaches with one smile to oerpay the anxieties of a year enter berinthia o berinthia what a world of kindness are you in my debt had you stayed five minutes longer ber you would have gone i suppose love egad shes right enough aside ber and i assure you twas ten to one that i came at all in short i begin to think you are too dangerous a being to trifle with and as i shall probably only make a fool of you at last i believe we had better let matters rest as they are love you cannot mean it sure ber what more would you have me give to a married man love how doubly cruel to remind me of my misfortunes ber a misfortune to be married to so charming a woman as amanda love i grant her all her merit butsdeath now see what you have done by talking of hershes here by all thats unlucky and townly with herill observe them ber o gad we had better get out of the way for i should feel as awkward to meet her as you love ay if i mistake not i see townly coming this way also i must see a little into this matter steps aside ber oh if thats your intention i am no woman if i suffer myself to be outdone in curiosity goes on the other side enter amanda aman mr loveless come home and walking on the lawn i will not suffer him to walk so late though perhaps it is to show his neglect of memr loveless i must speak with youha townly againhow i am persecuted enter colonel townly col town madam you seem disturbed aman sir i have reason col town whatever be the cause i would to heaven it were in my power to bear the pain or to remove the malady aman your interference can only add to my distress col town ah madam if it be the sting of unrequited love you suffer from seek for your remedy in revenge weigh well the strength and beauty of your charms and rouse up that spirit a woman ought to bear disdain the false embraces of a husband see at your feet a real lover his zeal may give him title to your pity although his merit cannot claim your love love so so very fine ifaith aside aman why do you presume to talk to me thus is this your friendship to mr loveless i perceive you will compel me at last to acquaint him with your treachery col town he could not upbraid me if you werehe deserves it from me for he has not been more false to you than faithless to me aman to you col town yes madam the lady for whom he now deserts those charms which he was never worthy of was mine by right and i imagine too by inclination yes madam berinthia who now aman berinthia impossible col town tis true or may i never merit your attention she is the deceitful sorceress who now holds your husbands heart in bondage aman i will not believe it col town by the faith of a true lover i speak from conviction this very day i saw them together and overheard aman peace sir i will not even listen to such slander this is a poor device to work on my resentment to listen to your insidious addresses no sir though mr loveless may be capable of error i am convinced i cannot be deceived so grossly in him as to believe what you now report and for berinthia you should have fixed on some more probable person for my rival than her who is my relation and my friend for while i am myself free from guilt i will never believe that love can beget injury or confidence create ingratitude col town if i do not prove to you aman you never shall have an opportunity from the artful manner in which you first showed yourself to me i might have been led as far as virtue permitted to have thought you less criminal than unhappy but this last unmanly artifice merits at once my resentment and contempt exit col town sure theres divinity about her and she has dispensed some portion of honours light to me yet can i bear to lose berinthia without revenge or compensation perhaps she is not so culpable as i thought her i was mistaken when i began to think lightly of amandas virtue and may be in my censure of my berinthia surely i love her still for i feel i should be happy to find myself in the wrong exit reenter loveless and berinthia ber your servant mr loveless love your servant madam ber pray what do you think of this love truly i dont know what to say ber dont you think we steal forth two contemptible creatures love why tolerably so i must confess ber and do you conceive it possible for you ever to give amanda the least uneasiness again love no i think we never should indeed ber we why monster you dont pretend that i ever entertained a thought love why then sincerely and honestly berinthia there is something in my wifes conduct which strikes me so forcibly that if it were not for shame and the fear of hurting you in her opinion i swear i would follow her confess my error and trust to her generosity for forgiveness ber nay prythee dont let your respect for me prevent you for as my object in trifling with you was nothing more than to pique townly and as i perceive he has been actuated by a similar motive you may depend ont i shall make no mystery of the matter to him love by no means inform him for though i may choose to pass by his conduct without resentment how will he presume to look me in the face again ber how will you presume to look him in the face again love he who has dared to attempt the honour of my wife ber you who have dared to attempt the honour of his mistress come come be ruled by me who affect more levity than i have and dont think of anger in this cause a readiness to resent injuries is a virtue only in those who are slow to injure love then i will be ruled by you and when you think proper to undeceive townly may your good qualities make as sincere a convert of him as amandas have of mewhen truths extorted from us then we own the robe of virtue is a sacred habit    could women but our secret counsel scan   could they but reach the deep reserve of man   to keep our

in three acts to mrs greville madamin requesting your permission to address the following pages to you which as they aim themselves to be critical require every protection and allowance that approving taste or friendly prejudice can give them i yet ventured to mention no other motive than the gratification of private friendship and esteem  had i suggested a hope that your implied approbation would give a sanction to their defects your particular reserve and dislike to the reputation of critical taste as well as of poetical talent would have made you refuse the protection of your name to such a purpose however i am not so ungrateful as now to attempt to combat this disposition in you i shall not here presume to argue that the present state of poetry claims and expects every assistance that taste and example can afford it nor endeavour to prove that a fastidious concealment of the most elegant productions of judgment and fancy is an ill return for the possession of those endowments

wellknown in the theatrical world if we may allow ourselves to give credit to the report of the performers who truth to say are in general but indifferent judges this piece abounds with the most striking and received beauties of modern compositionso i am very glad my friend puffs tragedy is in such forwardnessmrs dangle my dear you will be very glad to hear that puffs tragedy mrs dang lord mr dangle why will you plague me about such nonsensenow the plays are begun i shall have no peace isnt it sufficient to make yourself ridiculous by your passion for the theatre without continually teasing me to join you why cant you ride your hobbyhorse without desiring to place me on a pillion behind you mr dangle dang nay my dear i was only going to read mrs dang no no you will never read anything thats worth listening to you hate to hear about your country there are letters every day with roman signatures demonstrating the certainty of an invasion and proving that the nation is utterly undone but you never will read anything to entertain one dang what has a woman to do with politics mrs dangle mrs dang and what have you to do with the theatre mr dangle why should you affect the character of a critic i have no patience with youhavent you made yourself the jest of all your acquaintance by your interference in matters where you have no business are you not called a theatrical quidnunc and a mock maecenas to secondhand authors dang true my power with the managers is pretty notorious but is it no credit to have applications from all quarters for my interestfrom lords to recommend fiddlers from ladies to get boxes from authors to get answers and from actors to get engagements mrs dang yes truly you have contrived to get a share in all the plague and trouble of theatrical property without the profit or even the credit of the abuse that attends it dang i am sure mrs dangle you are no loser by it however you have all the advantages of it mightnt you last winter have had the reading of the new pantomime a fortnight previous to its performance and doesnt mr fosbrook let you take places for a play before it is advertised and set you down for a box for every new piece through the season and didnt my friend mr smatter dedicate his last farce to you at my particular request mrs dangle mrs dang yes but wasnt the farce damned mr dangle and to be sure it is extremely pleasant to have ones house made the motley rendezvous of all the lackeys of literature the very high change of trading authors and jobbing criticsyes my drawingroom is an absolute registeroffice for candidate actors and poets without characterthen to be continually alarmed with misses and maams piping hysteric changes on juliets and dorindas pollys and ophelias and the very furniture trembling at the probationary starts and unprovoked rants of wouldbe richards and hamletsand what is worse than all now that the manager has monopolized the opera house havent we the signors and signoras calling here sliding their smooth semibreves and gargling glib divisions in their outlandish throatswith foreign emissaries and french spies for aught i know disguised like fiddlers and figure dancers dang mercy mrs dangle mrs dang and to employ yourself so idly at such an alarming crisis as this toowhen if you had the least spirit you would have been at the head of one of the westminster associationsor trailing a volunteer pike in the artillery ground but youo my conscience i believe if the french were landed tomorrow your first inquiry would be whether they had brought a theatrical troop with them dang mrs dangle it does not signifyi say the stage is the mirror of nature and the actors are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time and pray what can a man of sense study betterbesides you will not easily persuade me that there is no credit or importance in being at the head of a band of critics who take upon them to decide for the whole town whose opinion and patronage all writers solicit and whose recommendation no manager dares refuse mrs dang ridiculousboth managers and authors of the least merit laugh at your pretensionsthe public is their criticwithout whose fair approbation they know no play can rest on the stage and with whose applause they welcome such attacks as yours and laugh at the malice of them where they cant at the wit dang very well madamvery well enter servant ser mr sneer sir to wait on you dang oh show mr sneer upexit servant plague ont now we must appear loving and affectionate or sneer will hitch us into a story

to you sir dang mrs dangle and i have been diverting ourselves with the papers pray sneer wont you go to drury lane theatre the first night of puffs tragedy sneer yes but i suppose one shant be able to get in for on the first night of a new piece they always fill the house with orders to support it but here dangle i have brought you two pieces one of which you must exert yourself to make the managers accept i can tell you that fortis written by a person of consequence dang so now my plagues are beginning sneer ay i am glad of it for now youll be happy why my dear dangle it is a pleasure to see how you enjoy your volunteer fatigue and your solicited solicitations dang its a great troubleyet egad its pleasant too why sometimes of a morning i have a dozen people call on me at breakfasttime whose faces i never saw before nor ever desire to see again sneer that must be very pleasant indeed dang and not a week but i receive fifty letters and not a line in them about any business of my own sneer an amusing correspondence dang reading bursts into tears and exitwhat is this a tragedy sneer no thats a genteel comedy not a translation only taken from the french it is written in a style which they have lately tried to run down the true sentimental and nothing ridiculous in it from the beginning to the end mrs dang well if they had kept to that i should not have been such an enemy to the stage there was some edification to be got from those pieces mr sneer sneer i am quite of your opinion mrs dangle the theatre in proper hands might certainly be made the school of morality but now i am sorry to say it people seem to go there principally for their entertainment mrs dang it would have been more to the credit of the managers to have kept it in the other line sneer undoubtedly madam and hereafter perhaps to have had it recorded that in the midst of a luxurious and dissipated age they preserved two houses in the capital where the conversation was always moral at least if not entertaining dang now egad i think the worst alteration is in the nicety of the audienceno doubleentendre no smart innuendo admitted even vanbrugh and congreve obliged to undergo a bungling reformation sneer yes and our prudery in this respect is just on a par with the artificial bashfulness of a courtesan who increases the blush upon her cheek in an exact proportion to the diminution of her modesty dang sneer cant even give the public a good word but what have we herethis seems a very odd sneer oh thats a comedy on a very new plan replete with wit and mirth yet of a most serious moral you see it is called the reformed housebreaker where by the mere force of humour housebreaking is put in so ridiculous a light that if the piece has its proper run i have no doubt but that bolts and bars will be entirely useless by the end of the season dang egad this is new indeed sneer yes it is written by a particular friend of mine who has discovered that the follies and foibles of society are subjects unworthy the notice of the comic muse who should be taught to stoop only to the greater vices and blacker crimes of humanitygibbeting capital offences in five acts and pillorying petty larcenies in twoin short his idea is to dramatize the penal laws and make the stage a court of ease to the old bailey dang it is truly moral reenter servant ser sir fretful plagiary sir dang beg him to walk upexit servant now mrs dangle sir fretful plagiary is an author to your own taste mrs dang i confess he is a favourite of mine because everybody else abuses him sneer very much to the credit of your charity madam if not of your judgment dang but egad he allows no merit to any author but himself thats the truth ontthough hes my friend sneer neverhe is as envious as an old maid verging on the desperation of six and thirty and then the insidious humility with which he seduces you to give a free opinion on any of his works can be exceeded only by the petulant arrogance with which he is sure to reject your observations dang very true egadthough hes my friend sneer then his affected contempt of all newspaper strictures though at the same time he is the sorest man alive and shrinks like scorched parchment from the fiery ordeal of true criticism yet he is so covetous of popularity that he had rather be abused than not mentioned at all dang theres no denying itthough he is my friend sneer you have read the tragedy he has just finished havent you dang oh yes he sent it to me yesterday sneer well and you think it execrable dont you dang why between

wonder how he came by it aside mrs dang because his jest is always at the expense of his friend aside dang but sir fretful have you sent your play to the managers yetor can i be of any service to you sir fret no no i thank you i believe the piece had sufficient recommendation with iti thank you thoughi sent it to the manager of covent garden theatre this morning sneer i should have thought now that it might have been cast as the actors call it better at drury lane sir fret o lud nonever send a play there while i liveharkee whispers sneer sneer writes himselfi know he does sir fret i say nothingi take away from no mans meritam hurt at no mans good fortunei say nothingbut this i will saythrough all my knowledge of life i have observedthat there is not a passion so strongly rooted in the human heart as envy sneer i believe you have reason for what you say indeed sir fret besidesi can tell you it is not always so safe to leave a play in the hands of those who write themselves sneer what they may steal from them hey my dear plagiary sir fret stealto be sure they may and egad serve your best thoughts as gypsies do stolen children disfigure them to make em pass for their own sneer but your present work is a sacrifice to melpomene and he you know never sir fret thats no security a dexterous plagiarist may do anything why sir for aught i know he might take out some of the best things in my tragedy and put them into his own comedy sneer that might be done i dare be sworn sir fret and then if such a person gives you the least hint or assistance he is devilish apt to take the merit of the whole dang if it succeeds sir fret ay but with regard to this piece i think i can hit that gentleman for i can safely swear he never read it sneer ill tell you how you may hurt him more sir fret how sneer swear he wrote it sir fret plague ont now sneer i shall take it illi believe you want to take away my character as an author sneer then i am sure you ought to be very much obliged to me sir fret heysir dang oh you know he never means what he says sir fret sincerely thendo you like the piece sneer wonderfully sir fret but come now there must be something that you think might be mended heymr dangle has nothing struck you dang why faith it is but an ungracious thing for the most part to sir fret with most authors it is just so indeed they are in general strangely tenacious but for my part i am never so well pleased as when a judicious critic points out any defect to me for what is the purpose of showing a work to a friend if you dont mean to profit by his opinion sneer very truewhy then though i seriously admire the piece upon the whole yet there is one small objection which if youll give me leave ill mention sir fret sir you cant oblige me more sneer i think it wants incident sir fret good god you surprise mewants incident sneer yes i own i think the incidents are too few sir fret good god believe me mr sneer there is no person for whose judgment i have a more implicit deference but i protest to you mr sneer i am only apprehensive that the incidents are too crowdedmy dear dangle how does it strike you dang really i cant agree with my friend sneer i think the plot quite sufficient and the four first acts by many degrees the best i ever read or saw in my life if i might venture to suggest anything it is that the interest rather falls off in the fifth sir fret rises i believe you mean sir dang no i dont upon my word sir fret yes yes you do upon my soulit certainly dont fall off i assure youno no it dont fall off dang now mrs dangle didnt you say it struck you in the same light mrs dang no indeed i did noti did not see a fault in any part of the play from the beginning to the end sir fret upon my soul the women are the best judges after all mrs dang or if i made any objection i am sure it was to nothing in the piece but that i was afraid it was on the whole a little too long sir fret pray madam do you speak as to duration of time or do you mean that the story is tediously spun out mrs dang o lud noi speak only with reference to the usual length of acting plays sir fret then i am very happyvery happy indeed because the play is a short play a remarkably short play i should not venture to differ with a lady on a point of taste but on these occasions the watch you know is the critic mrs dang then i suppose it must have been mr dangles drawling manner of reading it to me sir fret oh if mr dangle read it thats quite another affairbut i assure you mrs dangle the first evening you can spare me three hours and a half ill undertake to read you the whole from beginning to end with the prologue and epilogue and allow time for the music between the acts mrs dang i hope to see it on the stage next dang well sir fretful i wish you may be able to get rid as easily of the newspaper criticisms as you do of ours sir fret the newspapers sir they are the most villainouslicentiousabominableinfernalnot that i ever read themnoi make it a rule never to look into a newspaper dang you are quite right for it certainly must hurt an author of delicate feelings to see the liberties they take sir fret no quite the contrary their abuse is in fact the best panegyrici like it of all things an authors reputation is only in danger from their support sneer why thats trueand that attack now on you the other day sir fret what where dang ay you mean in a paper of thursday it was completely illnatured to be sure sir fret oh so much the betterha ha ha i wouldnt have it otherwise dang certainly it is only to be laughed at for sir fret you dont happen to recollect what the fellow said do you sneer pray danglesir fretful seems a little anxious sir fret o lud noanxiousnot inot the least ibut one may as well hear you know dang sneer do you recollectaside to sneer make out something sneer aside to dangle i willaloud yes yes i remember perfectly sir fret well and pray nownot that it signifieswhat might the gentleman say sneer why he roundly asserts that you have not the slightest invention or original genius whatever though you are the greatest traducer of all other authors living sir fret ha ha havery good sneer that as to comedy you have not one idea of your own he believes even in your commonplacebookwhere stray jokes and pilfered witticisms are kept with as much method as the ledger of the lost and stolen office sir fret ha ha havery pleasant sneer nay that you are so unlucky as not to have the skill even to steal with tastebut that you glean from the refuse of obscure volumes where more judicious plagiarists have been before you so that the body of your work is a composition of dregs and sentimentslike a bad taverns worst wine sir fret ha ha sneer in your more serious efforts he says your bombast would be less intolerable if the thoughts were ever suited to the expression but the homeliness of the sentiment stares through the fantastic encumbrance of its fine language like a clown in one of the new uniforms sir fret ha ha sneer that your occasional tropes and flowers suit the general coarseness of your style as tambour sprigs would a ground of linseywoolsey while your imitations of shakspeare resemble the mimicry of falstaffs page and are about as near the standard as the original sir fret ha sneer in short that even the finest passages you steal are of no service to you for the poverty of your own language prevents their assimilating so that they lie on the surface like lumps of marl on a barren moor encumbering what it is not in their power to fertilize sir fret after great agitation now another person would be vexed at this sneer oh but i wouldnt have told youonly to divert you sir fret i know iti am divertedha ha hanot the least inventionha ha havery goodvery good sneer yesno genius ha ha ha dang a severe rogue ha ha ha but you are quite right sir fretful never to read such nonsense sir fret to be surefor if there is anything to ones praise it is a foolish vanity to be gratified at it and if it is abusewhy one is always sure to hear of it from one damned goodnatured friend or other enter servant ser sir there is an italian gentleman with a french interpreter and three young ladies and a dozen musicians who say they are sent by lady rondeau and mrs fugue dang gadso they come by appointmentdear mrs dangle do let them know ill see them directly mrs dang you know

sir fret zounds no mr dangle dont i tell you these things never fret me in the least dang nay i only thought sir fret and let me tell you mr dangle tis damned affronting in you to suppose that i am hurt when i tell you i am not sneer but why so warm sir fretful sir fret gads life mr sneer you are as absurd as dangle how often must i repeat it to you that nothing can vex me but your supposing it possible for me to mind the damned nonsense you have been repeating to melet me tell you if you continue to believe this you must mean to insult me gentlemen and then your disrespect will affect me no more than the newspaper criticismsand i shall treat it with exactly the same calm indifference and philosophic contemptand so your servant exit sneer ha ha ha poor sir fretful now will he go and vent his philosophy in anonymous abuse of all modern critics and authorsbut dangle you must get your friend puff to take me to the rehearsal of his tragedy dang ill answer fort hell thank you for desiring it but come and help me to judge of this musical family they are recommended by people of consequence i assure you sneer i am at your disposal the whole morningbut i thought you had been a decided critic in music as well as in literature dang so i ambut i have a bad ear ifaith sneer though i am afraid we were a little too severe on sir fretful though he is my friend sneer why tis certain that unnecessarily to mortify the vanity of any writer is a cruelty which mere dulness never can deserve but where a base and personal malignity usurps the place of literary emulation the aggressor

friends and brother authors dangle knows i love to be frank on the subject and to advertise myself viva voce i am sir a practitioner in panegyric or to speak more plainly a professor of the art of puffing at your serviceor anybody elses sneer sir you are very obligingi believe mr puff i have often admired your talents in the daily prints puff yes sir i flatter myself i do as much business in that way as any six of the fraternity in towndevilish hard work all the summer friend danglenever worked harder but harkeethe winter managers were a little sore i believe dang no i believe they took it all in good part puff ay then that must have been affectation in them for egad there were some of the attacks which there was no laughing at sneer ay the humorous onesbut i should think mr puff that authors would in general be able to do this sort of work for themselves puff why yesbut in a clumsy way besides we look on that as an encroachment and so take the opposite side i dare say now you conceive half the very civil paragraphs and advertisements you see to be written by the parties concerned or their friends no such thing nine out of ten manufactured by me in the way of business sneer indeed puff even the auctioneers nowthe auctioneers i saythough the rogues have lately got some credit for their languagenot an article of the merit theirs take them out of their pulpits and they are as dull as cataloguesno sir twas i first enriched their styletwas i first taught them to crowd their advertisements with panegyrical superlatives each epithet rising above the other like the bidders in their own auction rooms from me they learned to inlay their phraseology with variegated chips of exotic metaphor by me too their inventive faculties were called forthyes sir by me they were instructed to clothe ideal walls with gratuitous fruitsto insinuate obsequious rivulets into visionary grovesto teach courteous shrubs to nod their approbation of the grateful soil or on emergencies to raise upstart oaks where there never had been an acorn to create a delightful vicinage without the assistance of a neighbour or fix the temple of hygeia in the fens of lincolnshire dang i am sure you have done them infinite service for now when a gentleman is ruined he parts with his house with some credit sneer service if they had any gratitude they would erect a statue to him they would figure him as a presiding mercury the god of traffic and fiction with a hammer in his hand instead of a caduceusbut pray mr puff what first put you on exercising your talents in this way puff egad sir sheer necessitythe proper parent of an art so nearly allied to invention you must know mr sneer that from the first time i tried my hand at an advertisement my success was such that for some time after i led a most extraordinary life indeed sneer how pray puff sir i supported myself two years entirely by my misfortunes sneer by your misfortunes puff yes sir assisted by long sickness and other occasional disorders and a very comfortable living i had of it sneer from sickness and misfortunes you practised as a doctor and an attorney at once puff no egad both maladies and miseries were my own sneer hey what the plague dang tis true ifaith puff harkeeby advertisements oh i understand you puff and in truth i deserved what i got for i suppose never man went through such a series of calamities in the same space of time sir i was five times made a bankrupt and reduced from a state of affluence by a train of unavoidable misfortunes then sir though a very industrious tradesman i was twice burned out and lost my little all both times i lived upon those fires a month i soon after was confined by a most excruciating disorder and lost the use of my limbs that told very well for i had the case strongly attested and went about to collect the subscriptions myself dang egad i believe that was when you first called on me puff in november lasto no i was at that time a close prisoner in the marshalsea for a debt benevolently contracted to serve a friend i was afterwards twice tapped for a dropsy which declined into a very profitable consumption i was then reduced too nothen i became a widow with six helpless children after having had eleven husbands pressed and being left every time eight months gone with child and without money to get me into an hospital sneer and you bore all with patience i make no doubt puff why yes though i made some occasional attempts at felo de se but as i did not find those rash actions answer i left off killing myself very soon well sir at last what with bankruptcies fires gout dropsies imprisonments and other valuable calamities having got together a pretty handsome sum i determined to quit a business which had always gone rather against my conscience and in a more liberal way still to indulge my talents for fiction and embellishment through my favourite channels of diurnal communicationand so sir you have my history sneer most obligingly communicative indeed and your confession if published might certainly serve the cause of true charity by rescuing the most useful channels of appeal to benevolence from the cant of imposition but surely mr puff there is no great mystery in your present profession puff mystery sir i will take upon me to say the matter was never scientifically treated nor reduced to rule before sneer reduced to rule puff o lud sir you are very ignorant i am afraidyes sir puffing is of various sorts the principal are the puff direct the puff preliminary the puff collateral the puff collusive and the puff oblique or puff by implication these all assume as circumstances require the various forms of letter to the editor occasional anecdote impartial critique observation from correspondent or advertisement from the party sneer the puff direct i can conceive puff o yes thats simple enough for instancea new comedy or farce is to be produced at one of the theatres though bytheby they dont bring out half what they ought to dothe author suppose mr smatter or mr dapper or any particular friend of minevery well the day before it is to be performed i write an account of the manner in which it was received i have the plot from the author and only addcharacters strongly drawnhighly colouredhand of a masterfund of genuine humourmine of inventionneat dialogueattic salt then for the performancemr dodd was astonishingly great in the character of sir harry that universal and judicious actor mr palmer perhaps never appeared to more advantage than in the colonelbut it is not in the power of language to do justice to mr king indeed he more than merited those repeated bursts of applause which he drew from a most brilliant and judicious audience as to the scenerythe miraculous powers of mr de loutherbourgs pencil are universally acknowledged in short we are at a loss which to admire most the unrivalled genius of the author the great attention and liberality of the managers the wonderful abilities of the painter or the incredible exertions of all the performers sneer thats pretty well indeed sir puff oh coolquite coolto what i sometimes do sneer and do you think there are any who are influenced by this puff o lud yes sir the number of those who undergo the fatigue of judging for themselves is very small indeed sneer well sir the puff preliminary puff o that sir does well in the form of a caution in a matter of gallantry nowsir flimsy gossamer wishes to be well with lady fanny fetehe applies to mei open trenches for him with a paragraph in the morning postit is recommended to the beautiful and accomplished lady f four stars f dash e to be on her guard against that dangerous character sir f dash g who however pleasing and insinuating his manners may be is certainly not remarkable for the constancy of his attachments in italics here you see sir flimsy gossamer is introduced to the particular notice of lady fanny who perhaps never thought of him beforeshe finds herself publicly cautioned to avoid him which naturally makes her desirous of seeing him the observation of their acquaintance causes a pretty kind of mutual embarrassment this produces a sort of sympathy of interest which if sir flimsy is unable to improve effectually he at least gains the credit of having their names mentioned together by a particular set and in a particular waywhich nine times out of ten is the full accomplishment of modern gallantry dang egad sneer you will be quite an adept in the business puff now sir the puff collateral is much used as an appendage to advertisements and may take the form of anecdote yesterday as the celebrated george bonmot was sauntering down st jamess street he met the lively lady mary myrtle coming out of the parkgood god lady mary im surprised to meet you in a white jacketfor i expected never to have seen you but in a fulltrimmed uniform and a light horsemans capheavens george where could you have learned thatwhy replied the wit  i just saw a print of you in a new publication called the camp magazine which bytheby is a devilish clever thing and is sold at no 3 on the right hand of the way two doors from the printingoffice the corner of ivy lane paternoster row price only one shilling sneer very ingenious indeed puff but the puff collusive is the newest of any for it acts in the disguise of determined hostility it is much used by bold booksellers and enterprising poetsan indignant correspondent observes that the new poem called beelsebubs cotillon or proserpines f√™te champ√™tre is one of the most unjustifiable performances he ever read the severity with which certain characters are handled is quite shocking and as there are many descriptions in it too warmly coloured for female delicacy the shameful avidity with which this piece is bought by all people of fashion is a reproach on the taste of the times and a disgrace to the delicacy of the age here you see the two strongest inducements are held forth first that nobody ought to read it and secondly that everybody buys it on the strength of which the publisher boldly prints the tenth edition before he had sold ten of the first and then establishes it by threatening himself with the pillory or absolutely indicting himself for scan mag dang ha ha hagad i know it is so puff as to the puff oblique or puff by implication it is too various and extensive to be illustrated by an instance it attracts in titles and resumes in patents it lurks in the limitation of a subscription and invites in the assurance of crowd and incommodation at public places it delights to draw forth concealed merit with a most disinterested assiduity and sometimes wears a countenance of smiling censure and tender reproach it has a wonderful memory for parliamentary debates and will often give the whole speech of a favoured member with the most flattering accuracy but above all it is a great dealer in reports and suppositions it has the earliest intelligence of intended preferments that will reflect honour on the patrons and embryo promotions of modest gentlemen who know nothing of the matter themselves it can hint a ribbon for implied services in the air of a common report and with the carelessness of a casual paragraph suggest officers into commands to which they have no pretension but their wishes this sir is the last principal class of the art of puffingan art which i hope you will now agree with me is of the highest dignity yielding a tablature of benevolence and public spirit befriending equally trade gallantry criticism and politics the applause of geniusthe register of charitythe triumph of heroismthe selfdefence of contractorsthe fame of oratorsand the gazette of ministers sneer sir i am completely a convert both to the importance and ingenuity of your profession and now sir there is but one thing which can possibly increase my respect for you and that is your permitting me to be present this morning at the rehearsal of your new trage puff hush for heavens sakemy tragedyegad dangle i take this very ill you know how apprehensive i am of being known to be the author dang ifaith i would not have toldbut its in the papers and your name at length in the morning chronicle puff ah those damned editors never can keep a secret i well mr sneer no doubt you will do me great honouri shall be infinitely happyhighly flattereddang i believe it must be near the timeshall we go together puff no it will not be yet this hour for they are always late at that theatre besides i must meet you there for i have some little matters here to send to the papers and a few paragraphs to scribble before i golooking at memorandums here is a conscientious baker on the subject of the army bread and a detester of visible brickwork in favour of the new invented stucco both in the style of junius and promised for tomorrow the thames navigation too is at a stand misomud or antishoal must go to work again directlyhere too are some political memorandumsi see ay to take paul jones and get the indiamen out of the shannon reinforce byroncompel the dutch tosoi must do that in the evening papers or reserve it for the morning herald for i know that i have undertaken tomorrow besides to establish the unanimity of the fleet in the public advertiser and to shoot charles fox in the morning postso egad i hant a moment to lose dang well well meet in the green room exeunt severally     act ii  scene ithe theatre before the curtain enter dangle puff and sneer puff no no sir what shakspeare says of actors may be better applied to the purpose of plays they ought to be the abstract and brief chronicles of the time therefore when history and particularly the history of our own country furnishes anything like a case in point to the time in which an author writes if he knows his own interest he will take advantage of it so sir i call my tragedy the spanish armada and have laid the scene before tilbury fort sneer a most happy thought certainly i dang egad it wasi told you so but pray now i dont understand how you have contrived to introduce any love into it puff love oh nothing so easy for it is a received point among poets that where history gives you a good heroic outline for a play you may fill up with a little love at your own discretion in doing which nine times out of ten you only make up a deficiency in the private history of the times now i rather think i have done this with some success sneer no scandal about queen elizabeth i hope puff o lud no noi only suppose the governor of tilbury forts daughter to be in love with the son of the spanish admiral sneer oh is that all dang excellent ifaith i see at once but wont this appear rather improbable puff to be sure it willbut what the plague a play is not to show occurrences that happen every day but things just so strange that though they never did they might happen sneer certainly nothing is unnatural that is not physically impossible puff very trueand for that matter don ferolo whiskerandos for thats the lovers name might have been over here in the train of the spanish ambassador or tilburina for that is the ladys name might have been in love with him from having heard his character or seen his picture or from knowing that he was the last man in the world she ought to be in love withor for any other good female reasonhowever sir the fact is that though she is but a knights daughter egad she is in love like any princess dang poor young lady i feel for her already for i can conceive how great the conflict must be between her passion and her duty her love for her country and her love for don ferolo whiskerandos puff oh amazingher poor susceptible heart is swayed to and fro by contending passions like enter under prompter und promp sir the scene is set and everything is ready to begin if you please puff egad then well lose no time und promp though i believe sir you will find it very short for all the performers have profited by the kind permission you granted them puff hey what und promp you know sir you gave them leave to cut out or omit whatever they found heavy or unnecessary to the plot and i must own they have taken very liberal advantage of your indulgence puff well wellthey are in general very good judges and i know i am luxuriantnow mr hopkins as soon as you please und promp to the orchestra gentlemen will you play a few bars of something just to puff ay thats right for as we have the scenes and dresses egad well go tot as if it was the first nights performancebut you need not mind stopping between the acts exit under prompterorchestra playthen the bell  rings soh stand clear gentlemen now you know there will be a cry of down downhats offsilencethen up curtain and let us see what our painters have done for us curtain rises  scene iitilbury fort two sentinels discovered asleep dang tilbury fortvery fine indeed puff now what do you think i open with sneer faith i cant guess puff a clockharkclock strikes i open with a clock striking to beget an awful attention in the audience it also marks the time which is four oclock in the morning and saves a description of the rising sun and a great deal about gilding the eastern hemisphere pang but pray are the sentinels to be asleep puff fast as watchmen sneer isnt that odd though at such an alarming crisis puff to be sure it isbut smaller things must give way to a striking scene at the opening thats a rule and the case is that two great men are coming to this very spot to begin the piece now it is not to be supposed they would open their lips if these fellows were watching them so egad i must either have sent them off their posts or set them asleep sneer oh that accounts for it but tell us who are these coming puff these are theysir walter raleigh and sir christopher hatton youll know sir christopher by his turning out his toesfamous you know for his dancing i like to preserve all the little traits of characternow attend enter sir walter raleigh and sir christopher hatton sir christ true gallant raleigh dang what they had been talking before puff o yes all the way as they came alongto the actors i beg pardon gentlemen but these are particular friends of mine whose remarks may be of great service to us to sneer and dangle dont mind interrupting them whenever anything strikes you sir christ    true gallant raleigh   but oh thou champion of thy countrys fame   there is a question which i yet must ask   a question which i never askd before   what mean these mighty armaments   this general muster and this throng of chiefs  sneer pray mr puff how came sir christopher hatton never to ask that question before puff what before the play beganhow the plague could he dang thats true ifaith puff but you will hear what he thinks of the matter sir christ   alas i my noble friend when i behold   yon tented plains in martial symmetry   arrayd when i count oer yon glittering lines   of crested warriors where the proud steeds neigh   and valourbreathing trumpets shrill appeal   responsive vibrate on my listening ear   when virgin majesty herself i view   like her protecting pallas veild in steel   with graceful confidence exhort to arms   when briefly all i hear or see bears stamp   of martial vigilance and stern defence   i cannot but surmiseforgive my friend   if the conjectures rashi cannot but   surmise the state some danger apprehends  sneer a very cautious conjecture that puff yes thats his character not to give an opinion but on secure groundsnow then sir walt   o most accomplishd christopher  puff he calls him by his christian name to show that they are on the most familiar terms sir walt o most accomplishd christopher i find thy staunch sagacity still tracks the future in the fresh print of the oertaken past puff figurative sir walt thy fears are just sir christ but where whence when and what the danger ismethinks i fain would learn sir walt you know my friend scarce two revolving suns and three revolving moons have closed their course since haughty philip in despite of peace with hostile hand hath struck at englands trade sir christ i know it well sir walt philip you know is proud iberias king sir christ he is sir walt his subjects in base bigotry and catholic oppression heldwhile we you know the protestant persuasion hold sir christ we do sir walt you know beside his boasted armament the famed armada by the pope baptized with purpose to invade these realms sir christ is sailed our last advices so report

walter go on telling him puff but the audience are not supposed to know anything of the matter are they sneer true but i think you manage ill for there certainly appears no reason why sir walter should be so communicative puff fore gad now that is one of the most ungrateful observations i ever heardfor the less inducement he has to tell all this the more i think you ought to be obliged to him for i am sure youd know nothing of the matter without it dang thats very true upon my word puff but you will find he was not going on sir christ enough enoughtis plainand i no more am in amazement lost puff here now you see sir christopher did not in fact ask any one question for his own information sneer no indeed his has been a most disinterested curiosity dang really i find that we are very
