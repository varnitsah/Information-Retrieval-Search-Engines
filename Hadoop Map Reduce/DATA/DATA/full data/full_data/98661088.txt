    303     birds and man    chapter i  birds at their best   by way of introduction  years ago in a chapter concerning eyes in a book of patagonian memories i spoke of the unpleasant sensations produced in me by the sight of stuffed birds not bird skins in the drawers of a cabinet it will be understood these being indispensable to the ornithologist and very useful to the larger class of persons who without being ornithologists yet take an intelligent interest in birds the unpleasantness was at the sight of skins stuffed with wool and set up on their legs in imitation of the living bird sometimes oh mockery in their natural surroundings these surroundings are as a rule constructed or composed of a few handfuls of earth to form the floor of the glass casesand rock clay chalk or gravel whatever the material may be it invariably has like all matter out of place a grimy and depressing appearance on the floor are planted grasses sedges and miniature bushes made of tin or zinc and then dipped in a bucket of green paint in the chapter referred to it was said when the eye closes in death the bird except to the naturalist becomes a mere bundle of dead feathers crystal globes may be put into the empty sockets and a bold lifeimitating attitude given to the stuffed specimen but the vitreous orbs shoot forth no lifelike glances the passion and the life whose fountains are within have vanished and the best work of the taxidermist who has given a life to his bastard art produces in the mind only sensations of irritation and disgust  that in the last clause was wrongly writ it should have been my mind and the minds of those who knowing living birds intimately as i do have the same feeling about them  this then being my feeling about stuffed birds set up in their natural surroundings i very naturally avoid the places where they are exhibited at brighton for instance on many occasions when i have visited and stayed in that town there was no inclination to see the booth collection which is supposed to be an ideal collection of british birds and we know it was the lifework of a zealous ornithologist who was also a wealthy man and who spared no pains to make it perfect of its kind about eighteen months ago i passed a night in the house of a friend close to the dyke road and next morning having a couple of hours to get rid of i strolled into the museum it was painfully disappointing for though no actual pleasure had been expected the distress experienced was more than i had bargained for it happened that a short time before i had been watching the living dartford warbler at a time when the sight of this small elusive creature is loveliest for not only was the bird in his brightest feathers but his surroundings were then most perfect     the whin was frankincense and flame  his appearance as i saw him then and on many other occasions in the furzeflowering season is fully described in a chapter in this book but on this particular occasion while watching my bird i saw it in a new and unexpected aspect and in my surprise and delight i exclaimed mentally now i have seen the furze wren at his very best  it was perhaps a very rare thingone of those effects of light on plumage which we are accustomed to see in birds that have glossed metallic feathers and more rarely in other kinds thus the turtledove when flying from the spectator with a strong sunlight on its upper plumage sometimes at a distance of two to three hundred yards appears of a shining whiteness  i had been watching the birds for a couple of hours sitting quite still on a tuft of heather among the furzebushes and at intervals they came to me impelled by curiosity and solicitude their nests being near but ever restless they would never remain more than a few seconds at a time in sight the prettiest and the boldest was a male and it was this bird that in the end flew to a bush within twelve yards of where i sat and perching on a spray about on a level with my eyes exhibited himself to me in his characteristic manner the long tail raised crest erect crimson eye sparkling and throat puffed out with his little scolding notes but his colour was no longer that of the furze wren seen at a distance the upper plumage always appears slatyblack near at hand it is of a deep slatybrown now it was dark sprinkled or frosted over with a delicate greyishwhite the white of oxidised silver and this rare and beautiful appearance continued for a space of about twenty seconds but no sooner did he flit to another spray than it vanished and he was once more the slatybrown little bird with a chestnutred breast  it is unlikely that i shall ever again see the furze wren in this aspect with a curious splendour wrought by the sunlight in the dark but semitranslucent delicate feathers of his mantle but its image is in the mind and with a thousand others equally beautiful remains to me a permanent possession  as i went in to see the famous booth collection a thought of the bird i have just described came into my mind and glancing round the big long room with shelves crowded with stuffed birds like the crowded shelves of a shop to see where the dartford warblers were i went straight to the case and saw a group of them fastened to a furzebush the specimens twisted by the stuffer into a variety of attitudesancient dusty dead little birds painful to look ata libel on nature and an insult to a mans intelligence  it was a relief to go from this case to the others which were not of the same degree of badness but all like the furze wrens were in their natural surroundingsthe pebbles bit of turf painted leaves and what not and finally a view of the wide world beyond the green earth and the blue sky all painted on the little square of deal or canvas which formed the back of the glass case  listening to the talk of other visitors who were making the round of the room i heard many sincere expressions of admiration they were really pleased and thought it all very wonderful that is in fact the common feeling which most persons express in such places and assuming that it is sincere the obvious explanation is that they know no better they have never properly seen anything in nature but have looked always with mind and the inner vision preoccupied with other and familiar thingsindoor scenes and objects and scenes described in books if they had ever looked at wild birds properlythat is to say emotionallythe images of such sights would have remained in their minds and with such a standard for comparison these dreary remnants of dead things set before them as restorations and as semblances of life would have only produced a profoundly depressing effect  we hear of the educational value of such exhibitions and it may be conceded that they might be made useful to young students of zoology by distributing the specimens over a large area arranged in scattered groups so as to give a rough idea of the relationship existing among its members and of all together to other neighbouring groups and to others still further removed the one advantage of such a plan to the young student would be that it would help him to get rid of the false notion which classification studied in books invariably produces that nature marshals her species in a line or row or her genera in a chain but no such plan is ever attempted probably because it would only be for the benefit of about one person in five hundred visitors and the expense would be too great  as things are these collections help no one and their effect is confusing and in many ways injurious to the mind especially to the young a multitude of specimens are brought before the sight each and every one a falsification and degradation of nature and the impression left is of an assemblage or mob of incongruous forms and of a confusion of colours the one comfort is that nature wiser than our masters sets herself against this rude system of overloading the brain she is kind to her wild children in their intemperance and is able to relieve the congested mind too from this burden these objects in a museum are not and cannot be viewed emotionally as we view living forms and all nature hence they do not and we being what we are cannot register lasting impressions  it needed a long walk on the downs to get myself once more in tune with the outdoor world after that distuning experience but just before quitting the house in the dyke road an old memory came to me and gave me some relief inasmuch as it caused me to smile it was a memory of a tale of the age of fools which i heard long years ago in the days of my youth  i was at a small riverine port of the plata river called ensenada de barragán assisting a friend to ship a number of sheep which he had purchased in buenos ayres and was sending to the banda orientalthe little republic on the east side of the great sealike river the sheep numbering about six thousand were penned at the side of the creek where the small sailing ships were lying close to the bank and a gang of eight men were engaged in carrying the animals on board taking them one by one on their backs over a narrow plank while i stood by keeping count the men were gauchos all but onea short rather grotesquelooking portuguese with one eye this fellow was the life and soul of the gang and with his jokes and antics kept the others in a merry humour it was an excessively hot day and at intervals of about an hour the men would knock off work and squatting on the muddy bank rest and smoke their cigarettes and on each occasion the funny oneeyed portuguese would relate some entertaining history one of these histories was about the age of fools and amused me so much that i remember it to this day it was the history of a man of that remote age who was born out of his time and who grew tired of the monotony of his life even of the society of his wife who was no whit wiser than the other inhabitants of the village they lived in and at last he resolved to go forth and see the world and bidding his wife and friends farewell he set out on his travels he travelled far and met with many strange and entertaining adventures which i must be pardoned for not relating as this is not a storybook in the end he returned safe and sound to his home a much richer man than when he started and opening his pack he spread out before his wife an immense number of gold coins with scores of precious stones and trinkets of the greatest value at the sight of this glittering treasure she uttered a great scream of joy and jumping up rushed from the room seeing that she did not return he went to look for her and after some searching discovered that she had rushed down to the winecellar and knocking open a large cask of wine had jumped into it and drowned herself for pure joy  thus happily ended his adventures concluded the oneeyed cynic and they all got up and resumed their work of carrying sheep to the boat  it was one of the adventures met with by the man of the tale in his travels that came into my mind when i was in the booth museum and caused me to smile in his wanderings in a thinly settled district he arrived at a village where passing by the church his attention was attracted by a curious spectacle the church was a big building with a rounded roof and great blank windowless walls and the only door he could see was no larger than the door of a cottage from this door as he looked a small old man came out with a large empty sack in his hands he was very old bowed and bent with infirmities and his long hair and beard were white as snow toddling out to the middle of the churchyard he stood still and grasping the empty sack by its top held it open between his outstretched arms for a space of about five minutes then with a sudden movement of his hands he closed the sacks mouth and still grasping it tightly hurried back to the church as fast as his stiff joints would let him and disappeared within the door by and by he came forth again and repeated the performance and then again until the traveller approached and asked him what he was doing i am lighting the church said the old man and he then went on to explain that it was a large and a fine church full of rich ornaments but very dark insideso dark that when people came to service the greatest confusion prevailed and they could not see each other or the priest nor the priest them it had always been so he continued and it was a great mystery he had been engaged by the fathers of the village a long time back when he was a young man to carry sunlight in to light the interior but though he had grown old at his task and had carried in many many thousands of sackfuls of sunlight every year it still remained dark and no one could say why it was so  it is not necessary to relate the sequel the reader knows by now that in the end the dark church was filled with light that the traveller was feasted and honoured by all the people of the village and that he left them loaded with gifts  parables of this kind as a rule can have no moral or hidden meaning in an age so enlightened as this yet oddly enough we do find among us a delusion resembling that of the villagers who thought they could convey sunshine in a sack to light their dark church it is one of a group or family of indoor delusions and illusions which mr sully has not mentioned in his book on that fascinating subject one example of the particular delusion i have been speaking of in which it is seen in its crudest form may be given here  a man walking by the waterside sees by chance a kingfisher fly past its colour a wonderful blue far surpassing in beauty and brilliancy any blue he has ever seen in sky or water or in flower or stone or any other thing no sooner has he seen than he wishes to become the possessor of that rare loveliness that shining object which he fondly imagines will be a continual delight to him and to all in his housean ornament comparable to that splendid stone which the poor fisherman found in a fishs belly which was his childrens plaything by day and his candle by night forthwith he gets his gun and shoots it and has it stuffed and put in a glass case but it is no longer the same thing the image of the living sunlit bird flashing past him is in his mind and creates a kind of illusion when he looks at his feathered mummy but the lustre is not visible to others  it is because of the commonness of this delusion that stuffed kingfishers and other brilliant species are to be seen in the parlours of tens of thousands of cottages all over the land nor is it only those who live in cottages that make this mistake those who care to look for it will find that it exists in some degree in most mindsthe curious delusion that the lustre which we see and admire is in the case the coil the substance which may be grasped and not in the spirit of life which is within and the atmosphere and miracleworking sunlight which are without  to return to my own taste and feelings since in the present chapter i must be allowed to write on man myself to wit and birds the other chapters being occupied with the subject of birds and man it has always or since i can remember been my ambition and principal delight to see and hear every bird at its best this is here a comparative term and simply means an unusually attractive aspect of the bird or a very much better than the ordinary one this may result from a fortunate conjunction of circumstances or may be due to a peculiar harmony between the creature and its surroundings or in some instances as in that given above of the dartford warbler to a rare effect of the sun in still other cases motions and antics rarely seen singularly graceful or even grotesque may give the best impression after one such impression has been received another equally excellent may follow at a later date in that case the second impression does not obliterate or is not superimposed upon the former one both remain as permanent possessions of the mind and we may thus have several mental pictures of the same species  it is the same with all minds with regard to the objects and scenes which happen to be of special interest the following illustration will serve to make the matter clearer to readers who are not accustomed to pay attention to their own mental processes when any common object such as a chair or spade or apple is thought of or spoken of an image of a picture of it instantly comes before the minds eye not of a particular spade or apple but of a type representing the object which exists in the mind ready for use on all occasions with the question of the origin of this type this spade or apple of the mind we need not concern ourselves here if the object thought or spoken of be an animala horse let us say the image seen in the mind will in most cases be as in the foregoing case a type existing in the mind and not of an individual but if a person is keenly interested in horses generally and is a rider and has owned and loved many horses the image of some particular one which he has known or has looked at with appreciative eyes will come to mind and he will also be able to call up the images of dozens or of scores of horses he has known or seen in the same way if on the other hand we think of a rat we see not any individual but a type because we have no interest in or no special feeling with regard to such a creature and all the successive images we receive of it become merged in onethe type which already existed in the mind and was probably formed very early in life with the dog for subject the case is different dogs are more with uswe know them intimately and have perhaps regarded many individuals with affection hence the image that rises in the mind is as a rule of some dog we have known  the important point to be noted is that while each and everything we see registers an impression in the brain and may be recalled several minutes or hours or even days afterwards the only permanent impressions are of the sights which we have viewed emotionally we may remember that we have seen a thousand things in which at some later period an interest has been born in the mind when it would be greatly to our pleasure and even profit to recover their images and we strive and ransack our brains to do so but all in vain they have been lost for ever because we happened not to be interested in the originals but viewed them with indifference or unemotionally  with regard to birds i see them mentally in two ways each species which i have known and observed in its wild state has its type in the mindan image which i invariably see when i think of the species and in addition one or two or several in some cases as many as fifty images of the same species of bird as it appeared at some exceptionally favourable moment and was viewed with peculiar interest and pleasure  of hundreds of such enduring images of our commonest species i will here describe one before concluding with this part of the subject  the longtailed or bottletit is one of the most delicately pretty of our small woodland birds and among my treasures in my invisible and intangible album there were several pictures of him which i had thought unsurpassable until on a day two years ago when a new and better one was garnered i was walking a few miles from bath by the avon where it is not more than thirty or forty yards wide on a cold windy very bright day in february the opposite bank was lined with bushes growing close to the water the roots and lower trunks of many of them being submerged as the river was very full and behind this low growth the ground rose abruptly forming a long green hill crowned with tall beeches i stopped to admire one of the bushes across the stream and i wish i could now say what its species was it was low with widespread branches close to the surface of the water and its leafless twigs were adorned with catkins resembling those of the black poplar as long as a mans little finger of a rich darkred or maroon colour a party of about a dozen longtailed tits were travelling or drifting in their usual desultory way through the line of bushes towards this point and in due time they arrived one by one at the bush i was watching and finding it sheltered from the wind they elected to remain at that spot for a space of fifteen minutes i looked on with delight rejoicing at the rare chance which had brought that exquisite bird and plantscene before me the long deepred pendent catkins and the little pale birdlings among them in their grey and rosecoloured plumage with long graceful tails and minute round parroty heads some quietly perched just above the water others moving about here and there occasionally suspending themselves back downwards from the slender terminal twigsthe whole mirrored below that magical effect of water and sunlight gave to the scene a somewhat fairylike an almost illusory character  such scenes live in their loveliness only for him who has seen and harvested them they cannot be pictured forth to another by words nor with the painters brush though it be charged with tintas orientales least of all by photography which brings all things down to one flat monotonous colourless shadow of things weary to look at  from sights we pass to the consideration of sounds and it is unfortunate that the two subjects have to be treated consecutively instead of together since with birds they are more intimately joined than in any other order of beings and in images of bird life at its best they sometimes cannot be dissociatedthe aërial form of the creature its harmonious delicate tints and its grace of motion and the voice which loud or low is aërial too in harmony with the form  we know that as with sights so it is with sounds those to which we listen attentively appreciatively or in any way emotionally live in the mind to be recalled and reheard at will there is no doubt that in a large majority of persons this retentive power is far less strong with regard to sounds than sights but we are all supposed to have it in some degree so far i have met with but one person a lady who is without it sounds in her case do not register an impression in the brain so that with regard to this sense she is in the condition of civilised man generally with regard to smells i say of civilised man being convinced that this power has become obsolete in us although it appears to exist in savages and in the lower animals the most common sounds natural or artificial the most familiar birdnotes the lowing of a cow the voices of her nearest and dearest friends and simplest melodies sung or played cannot be reproduced in her brain she remembers them as agreeable sounds just as we all remember that certain flowers and herbs have agreeable odours but she does not hear them probably there are not many persons in the same case but in such matters it is hard to know what the real condition of anothers mind may be our acquaintances refuse to analyse or turn themselves inside out merely to gratify a curiosity which they may think idle in some cases they perhaps have a kind of superstition about such things the secret processes of their mind are their secret or business and like the secret and real name of a person among some savage tribes not to be revealed but at the risk of giving to another a mysterious power over their lives and fortunes even worse than the reticent the superstitious and the simply unintelligent is the highly imaginative person who is only too ready to answer all inquiries who catches at what you say in explanation divines what you want and instantly and unconsciously invents something to tell you  but we may i think take it for granted that the faculty of retaining sounds is as universal as that of retaining sights although speaking generally the impressions of sounds are less perfect and lasting than those which relate to the higher more intellectual sense of vision also that this power varies greatly in different persons furthermore we see in the case of musical composers and probably of most musicians who are devoted to their art that this faculty is capable of being trained and developed to an extraordinary degree of efficiency the composer sitting pen in hand to write his score in his silent room hears the voices and the various instruments the solos and orchestral sounds which are in his thoughts it is true that he is a creator and listens mentally to compositions that have never been previously heard but he cannot imagine or cannot hear mentally any note or combination of notes which he has never heard with his physical sense in creating he selects from the infinite variety of sounds whose images exist in his mind and rearranging them produces new effects  the difference in the brains with regard to their soundstoring power of the accomplished musician and the ordinary person who does not know one tune from another and has but fleeting impressions of sounds in general is no doubt enormous probably it is as great as that which exists in the logical faculty between a professor of that science in one of the universities and a native of the andaman islands or of tierra del fuego it is we see a question of training any person with a normal brain who is accustomed to listen appreciatively to certain sounds natural or artificial must store his mind with the images of such sounds and the openair naturalist who is keenly interested in the language of birds and has listened with delight to a great variety of species should be as rich in such impressions as the musician is with regard to musical sounds unconsciously he has all his life been training the faculty  with regard to the durability of the images it may be thought by some that speaking of birds only those which are revived and restored so to speak from time to time by fresh senseimpressions remain permanently distinct that would naturally be the first conclusion most persons would arrive at considering that the soundimages which exist in their minds are of the species found in their own country which they are able to hear occasionally even if at very long intervals in some cases my own experience proves that it is not so that a man may cut himself off from the bird life he knows to make his home in another region of the globe thousands of miles away and after a period exceeding a quarter of a century during which he has become intimate with a wholly different bird life to find that the old soundimages which have never been refreshed with new senseimpressions are as distinct as they ever were and seem indeed imperishable  i confess that when i think of it i am astonished myself at such an experience and to some it must seem almost incredible it will be said perhaps that in the infinite variety of birdsounds heard anywhere there must be innumerable notes which closely resemble or are similar to those of other species in other lands and although heard in a different order the old images of cries and calls and songs are thus indirectly refreshed and kept alive i do not think that has been any real help to me thus i think of some species which has not been thought of for years and its language comes back at call to my mind i listen mentally to its various notes and there is not one in the least like the notes of any british species these images have therefore never received refreshment again where there is a resemblance as in the trisyllabic cry of the common sandpiper and another species i listen mentally to one then to the other heard so long ago and hear both distinctly and comparing the two find a considerable difference one being a thinner shriller and less musical sound than the other still again in the case of the blackbird which has a considerable variety in its language there is one little chirp familiar to every onea small round drop of sound of a musical belllike character now it happens that one of the true thrushes of south america a bird resembling our songthrush has an almost identical belllike chirp and so far as that small drop of sound is concerned the old image may be refreshed by new senseimpressions or i might even say that the original image has been covered by the later one as in the case of the laughterlike cries of the dominican and the blackbacked gulls but with regard to the thrushes excepting that small drop of sound the language of the two species is utterly different each has a melody perfect of its kind the song of the foreign bird is not fluty nor mellow nor placid like that of the blackbird but has in a high degree that quality of plaintiveness and gladness commingled which we admire in some fresh and very beautiful human voices like that described in lowells lines to perdita singing     it hath caught a touch of sadness        yet it is not sad    it hath tones of clearest gladness        yet it is not glad  again that foreign song is composed of many notes and is poured out in a stream as a skylark sings and it is also singular on account of the contrast between these notes which suggest human feeling and a purely metallic belllike sound which coming in at intervals has the effect of the triangle in a band of wind instruments the image of this beautiful song is as distinct in my mind as that of the blackbird which i heard every day last summer from every green place  doubtless there are some and perhaps a good many ornithologists among us who have been abroad to observe the bird life of distant countries and who when at home find that the soundimpressions they have received are not persistent or if not wholly lost that they grow faint and indistinct and become increasingly difficult to recall they can no longer listen to those oversea notes and songs as they can mentally to the cuckoos call in spring the woodowls hoot to the song of the skylark and of the treepipit the reeling of the nightjar and the startling scream of the woodland jay the deep humanlike tones of the raven the inflected wild cry of the curlew and the beautiful wild whistle of the widgeon heard in the silence of the night on some lonely mere  the reason is that these and numberless more are the sounds of the bird life of their own home and country the living voices to which they listened when they were young and the senses keener than now and their enthusiasm greater they were in fact heard with an emotion which the foreign species never inspired in them and thus heard the images of the sounds were made imperishable  in my case the foreign were the home birds and on that account alone more to me than all others yet i escaped that prejudice which the british naturalist is never wholly withoutthe notion that the home bird is intrinsically better worth listening to than the bird abroad finally on coming to this country i could not listen to the birds coldly as an english naturalist would to those of let us say queensland or burma or canada or patagonia but with an intense interest for these were the birds which my forbears had known and listened to all their lives long and my imagination was fired by all that had been said of their charm not indeed by frigid ornithologists but by a long succession of great poets from chaucer down to those of our own time hearing them thus emotionally their notes became permanently impressed on my mind and i found myself the happy possessor of a large number of soundimages representing the bird language of two widely separated regions  to return to the main pointthe durability of the impressions both of sight and sound  in order to get a more satisfactory idea of the number and comparative strength or vividness of the images of twentysix years ago remaining to me after so long a time than i could by merely thinking about the subject i drew up a list of the species of birds observed by me in the two adjoining districts of la plata and patagonia against the name of each species the surviving sight and soundimpressions were set down but on going over this first list and analysis fresh details came to mind and some images which had become dimmed all at once grew bright again and to bring these in the work had to be redone then it was put away and the subject left for a few days to the subliminal consciousness after which i took it up once more and rewrote it alllist and analysis and i think it now gives a fairly accurate account of the state of these old impressions as they exist in memory  this has not been done solely for my own gratification i confess to a very strong feeling of curiosity as to the mental experience on this point of other field naturalists and as these or some of them may have the same wish to look into their neighbours minds that i have it may be that the example given here will be followed  my list comprises 226 speciesa large number to remember when we consider that it exceeds by about 16 or 18 the number of british species that is to say those which may truly be described as belonging to these islands without including the waifs and strays and rare visitants which by a fiction are described as british birds of the 226 the sightimpressions of 10 have become indistinct and one has been completely forgotten the sight of a specimen might perhaps revive an image of this lost one as it was seen a living wild bird but i do not know this leaves 215 every one of which i can mentally see as distinctly as i see in my mind the common species i am accustomed to look at every day in englandthrush starling robin etc  a different story has to be told with regard to the language to begin with there are no fewer than 34 species of which no soundimpressions were received these include the habitually silent kindsthe stork which rattles its beak but makes no vocal sound the painted snipe the wood ibis and a few more species which were rarely seen and emitted no soundcondor muscovy duck harpy eagle and others species which were known only as winter visitants or seen on migration and which at such seasons were invariably silent  thus those which were heard number 192 of these the language of 7 species has been completely forgotten and of 31 the soundimpressions have now become indistinct in varying degrees deducting those whose notes have become silent and are not clearly heard in the mind there remain 154 species which are distinctly remembered that is to say when i think of them and their language the cries calls songs and other sounds are reproduced in the mind  studying the list in which the species are ranged in order according to their affinities it is easy to see why the language of some although not many has been lost or has become more or less indistinct in some cases it is because there was nothing distinctive or in any way attractive in the notes in other cases because the images have been covered and obliterated by othersthe stronger images of closelyallied species in the two american families of tyrantbirds and woodhewers neither of which are songsters there is in some of the closelyrelated species a remarkable family resemblance in their voices listening to their various cries and calls the trained ear of the ornithologist can easily distinguish them and identify the species but after years the image of the more powerful or the better voices of say two or three species in a group of four or five absorb and overcome the others i cannot find a similar case among british species to illustrate this point unless it be that of the meadow and rockpipit strongly as the mind is impressed by the measured tinkling notes of these two songs emitted as the birds descend to earth it is not probable that any person who had not heard them for a number of years would be able to distinguish or keep them separate in his mindto hear them in their images as two distinct songs  in the case of the good singers in that distant region i find the voices continue remarkably distinct and as an example will give the two melodious families of the finches and the troupials icteridae the last an american family related to the finches but starlinglike in appearance many of them brilliantly coloured of the first i am acquainted with 12 and of the second with 14 species  here then are 26 highly vocal species of which the songs calls chirps and various other notes are distinctly remembered in 23 of the other three one was silenta small rare migratory finch resembling the beardedtit in its reedloving habits its long tail and slender shape and partly too in its colouring i listened in vain for this birds singing notes of the remaining two one is a finch the other a troupial the first a pretty bird in appearance a small hawfinch with its whole plumage a lovely glaucous blue a poor singer with a low rambling song the second a bird of the size of a starling coloured like a golden oriole but more brilliant and this one has a short impetuous song composed of mixed guttural and clear notes  why is this rather peculiar song of a species which on account of its colouring and pleasing social habits strongly impresses the mind less distinct in memory than the songs of other troupials i believe it is because it is a rare thing to hear a single song they perch in a tree in company like birds of paradise and no sooner does one open his beak than all burst out together and their singing strikes on the sense in a rising and falling tempest of confused sound but it may be added that though these two songs are marked indistinct in the list they are not very indistinct and become less so when i listen mentally with closed eyes  in conclusion it is worthy of remark that the good voices as to quality and the powerful ones are not more enduring in their images than those which were listened to appreciatively for other reasons voices which have the quality of ventriloquism or are in any way mysterious or are suggestive of human tones are extremely persistent and such voices are found in owls pigeons snipe rails grebes nightjars tinamous rheas and in some passerine birds again the swallows are not remarkable as singers compared with thrushes finches and other melodists but on account of their intrinsic charm and beauty their interesting habits and the sentiment they inspire we listen to them emotionally and i accordingly find that the language of the five species of swallows i was formerly accustomed to see and hear continues as distinct in my mind as that of the chimney swallow which i listen to every summer in england                                       i had meant in this chapter to give three or four or half a dozen instances of birds seen at their best instead of the one i have giventhat of the longtailed tit and as many more images in which a rare unforgettable effect was produced by melody for as with sights so it is with sounds for these too there are special moments which have special grace but this chapter is already longer than it was ever meant to be and something on another subject yet remains to be said  the question is sometimes asked what is the charm which you find or say you find in nature is it real or do these words so often repeated have a merely conventional meaning like so many other words and phrases which men use with regard to other things birds for instance apart from the interest which the ornithologists must take in his subject what substantial happiness can be got out of these shy creatures mostly small and not too well seen that fly from us when approached and utter sounds which at their best are so poor so thin so trivial compared with our soulstirring human music  that briefly is the indoor view of the subjectthe view of those who to begin with were perhaps townborn and townbred who have existed amid conditions occupied with work and pleasures the reflex effect of which taken altogether and in the longrun is to dim and even deaden some of the brains many faculties and chiefly this best faculty of preserving impressions of nature for long years or to the end of life in all their original freshness  some five or six years ago i heard a speech about birds delivered by sir edward grey in which he said that the love and appreciation and study of birds was something fresher and brighter than the secondhand interests and conventional amusements in which so many in this day try to live that the pleasure of seeing and listening to them was purer and more lasting than any pleasures of excitement and in the longrun happier than personal success that was a saying to stick in the mind and it is probable that some who listened failed to understand let us imagine that in addition to this miraculous faculty of the brain of storing innumerable brilliant images of things seen and heard to be reproduced at call to the inner sense there existed in a few gifted persons a correlated faculty by means of which these treasured images could be thrown at will into the mind of another let us further imagine that some one in the audience who had wondered at that saying finding it both dark and hard had asked me to explain it and that in response i had shown him as by a swift succession of lightning flashes a score or a hundred images of birds at their bestthe unimaginable loveliness the sunlit colour the grace of form and of motion and the melodyhow great the effect of even that brief glance into a new unknown world would have been and if i had then said all that you have seenthe pictures in one small room in a house of many roomsis not after all the main thing that it would be idle to speak of since you cannot know what you do not feel though it should be told you many times this only can be toldthe enduring images are but an incidental result of a feeling which existed already they were never looked for and are a free gift from nature to her worshipperif i had said this to him the words of the speech which has seemed almost sheer insanity a little while before would have acquired a meaning and an appearance of truth                                       it has curiously happened that while writing these concluding sentences some old longforgotten lines which i read in my youth came suddenly into my mind as if some person sitting invisible at my side and thinking them apposite to the subject had whispered them into my ear they are lines addressed to the merrimac river by an american poetwhether a major or minor i do not know having forgotten his name in one stanza he mentions the fact that young brissot looked upon this stream in its bright flow     and bore its image oer the deep        to soothe a martyrs sadness    and fresco in his troubled sleep        his prison walls with gladness  brissot is not generally looked upon as a martyr on this side of the atlantic nor was he allowed to enjoy his troubled sleep too long after his fellowcitizens especially the great and seagreen incorruptible had begun in their fraternal fashion to thirst for his blood but we can easily believe that during those dark days in the bastille the image and vision of the beautiful river thousands of miles away was more to him than all his varied stores of knowledge all his schemes for the benefit of suffering humanity and perhaps even a better consolation than his philosophy  it is indeed this gladness of old sunshine stored within usif we have had the habit of seeing beauty everywhere and of viewing all beautiful things with appreciationthis incalculable wealth of images of vanished scenes which is one of our best and dearest possessions and a joy for ever  what asketh man to have cried chaucer and goes on to say in bitterest words that now with his love he must soon lie in the coldë gravealone withouten any companie  what he asketh to have i suppose is a blue diamondsome unattainable good and in the meantime just to go on with certain pleasant things which perish in the using  these same pleasant things are not to be despised but they leave nothing for the mind in hungry days to feed upon and can be of no comfort to one who is shut up within himself by age and bodily infirmities and the decay of the senses on the contrary the recollection of them at such times as has been said can but serve to make a present misery more poignantly felt  it was the nobly expressed consolation of an american poet now dead when standing in the summer sunshine amid a fine prospect of woods and hills to think when he remembered the darkness of decay and the grave that he had beheld in nature though but for a moment     the brightness of the skirts of god     chapter ii  birds and man   to most of our wild birds man must appear as a being eccentric and contradictory in his actions by turns he is hostile indifferent friendly towards them so that they never quite know what to expect take the case of a blackbird who has gradually acquired trustful habits and builds its nest in the garden or shrubbery in sight of the friends that have fed it in frosty weather so little does it fear that it allows them to come a dozen times a day put the branches aside and look upon it and even stroke its back as it sits on its eggs by and by a neighbours egghunting boy creeps in discovers the nest and pulls it down the bird finds itself betrayed by its confidence had it suspected the boys evil intentions it would have made an outcry at his approach as at the appearance of a cat and the nest would perhaps have been saved the result of such an accident would probably be the unsettling of an acquired habit the return to the usual suspicious attitude  birds are able sometimes to discriminate between protectors and persecutors but seldom very well i should imagine they do not view the face only but the whole form and our frequent change of dress must make it difficult for them to distinguish the individuals they know and trust from strangers even a dog is occasionally at fault when his master last seen in black and grey suit reappears in straw hat and flannels  nevertheless if birds once come to know those who habitually protect them and form a trustful habit this will not be abandoned on account of a little rough treatment on occasions a lady at worthing told me of her blackbirds breeding in her garden that they refused to be kept from the strawberries when she netted the ripening fruit one or more of the birds would always manage to get under the net and when she would capture the robber and carry him screaming struggling and pecking at her fingers to the end of the garden and release him he would immediately follow her back to the bed and set himself to get at the fruit again  in a birds relations with other mammals there is no room for doubt or confusion each consistently acts after its kind once hostile always hostile and if once seen to be harmless then to be trusted for ever the fox must always be feared and detested his disposition like his sharp nose and red coat is unchangeable so too with the cat stoat weasel etc on the other hand in the presence of herbivorous mammals birds show no sign of suspicion they know that all these various creatures are absolutely harmless from the big formidablelooking bull and roaring stag to the mildeyed timorous hare and rabbit it is common to see wagtails and other species attending cattle in the pastures and keeping close to their noses on the lookout for the small insects driven from hiding in the grass daws and starlings search the backs of cattle and sheep for ticks and other parasites and it is plain that their visits are welcome here a joint interest unites bird and beast it is the nearest approach to symbiosis among the higher vertebrates of this country but is far less advanced than the partnership which exists between the rhinoceros bird and the rhinoceros or buffalo and between the spurwinged plover and crocodile in africa  one day i was walking by a meadow adjoining the bishops palace at wells where several cows were grazing and noticed a little beyond them a number of rooks and starlings scattered about presently a flock of about forty of the cathedral jackdaws flew over me and slanted down to join the other birds when all at once two daws dropped out of the flock on to the back of the cow standing nearest to me immediately five more daws followed and the crowd of seven birds began eagerly pecking at the animals hide but there was not room enough for them to move freely they pushed and struggled for a footing throwing their wings out to keep their balance looking like a number of hungry vultures fighting for places on a carcase and soon two of the seven were thrown off and flew away the remaining five although much straitened for room continued for some time scrambling over the cows back busy with their beaks and apparently very much excited over the treasure they had discovered it was amusing to see how the cow took their visit sinking her body as if about to lie down and broadening her back and dropping her head until her nose touched the ground she stood perfectly motionless her tail stuck out behind like a pumphandle at length the daws finished their feeding and quarrelling and flew away but for some minutes the cow remained immovable in the same attitude as if the rare and delightful sensation of so many beaks prodding and so many sharp claws scratching her hide had not yet worn off  deer too like cows are very grateful to the daw for its services in savernake forest i once witnessed a very pretty little scene i noticed a hind lying down by herself in a grassy hollow and as i passed her at a distance of about fifty yards it struck me as singular that she kept her head so low down that i could only see the top of it on a level with her back walking round to get a better sight i saw a jackdaw standing on the turf before her very busily pecking at her face with my glass i was able to watch his movements very closely he pecked round her eyes then her nostrils her throat and in fact every part of her face and just as a man when being shaved turns his face this way and that under the gentle guiding touch of the barbers fingers and lifts up his chin to allow the razor to pass beneath it so did the hind raise and lower and turn her face about to enable the bird to examine and reach every part with his bill finally the daw left the face and moving round jumped on to the deers shoulders and began a minute search in that part having finished this he jumped on to the head and pecked at the forehead and round the bases of the ears the pecking done he remained for some seconds sitting perfectly still looking very pretty with the graceful red head for a stand the hinds long ears thrust out on either side of him from his living perch he sprang into the air and flew away going close to the surface then slowly the deer raised her head and gazed after her black friendgratefully and regretting his departure i could not but think  some birds when breeding exhibit great anxiety at the approach of any animal to the nest but even when most excited they behave very differently towards herbivorous mammals and those which they know to be at all times the enemies of their kind the nest of a groundbreeding species may be endangered by the proximity of a goat sheep deer or any grazing animal but the birds do not winnow the air above it scream make threatening dashes at its head and try to lead it away as they would do in the case of a dog or fox when small birds dash at and violently attack large animals and man in defence of their nest even though the nest may not have been touched the action appears to be purely instinctive and involuntary almost unconscious in fact acts of this kind are more often seen in hummingbirds than in birds of other families and hummingbirds do not appear to discriminate between rapacious and herbivorous mammals when they see a large animal moving about they fly close to and examine it for a few moments then dart away if it comes too near the nest they will attack it or threaten an attack when examining their nests i have had hummingbirds dash into my face the action is similar to that of a stingless solitary carpenter bee common in la plata a round burly insect with a shining steelblue body when the tree or bush in which this bee has its nest is approached by a man it darts about in an eccentric manner humming loudly and at intervals remains suspended motionless for ten or fifteen seconds at a height of seven or eight yards above his head suddenly it dashes quick as lightning into his face inflicting a sharp blow the bee falls as if stunned a space of a couple of feet then rises again to repeat the action  there is certainly a wide difference between so simple an instinctive action as this which cannot be regarded as intelligent or conscious and the actions of most birds in the presence of danger to their eggs or young in species that breed on the ground in open situations the dangers to which bird and nest are exposed are of different kinds and leaving out the case of that anomalous creature man we see that as a rule the birds judgment is not at fault in one case it is necessary that he should guard himself while trying to save his nest in another case the danger is to the nest only and he then shows that he has no fear for himself the most striking instance i have met with bearing on this last point relates to the action of a spurwinged lapwing observed on the pampas the birds loud excited cries attracted my attention a sheep was lying down with its nose directly over the nest containing three eggs and the plover was trying to make it get up and go away it was a hot day and the sheep refused to stir possibly the fanning of the birds wings was grateful to her after beating the sheeps face for some time it began pecking sharply at the nose then the sheep raised her head but soon grew tired of holding it up and no sooner was it lowered than the blows and peckings began again again the head was raised and lowered again with the same result and this continued for about twelve or fourteen minutes until the annoyance became intolerable then the sheep raised her head and refused to lower it any more and in that very uncomfortable position with her nose high in the air she appeared determined to stay in vain the lapwing waited and at last began to make little jumps at the face the nose was out of reach but by and by in one of its jumps it caught the sheeps ear in its beak and remained hanging with drooping wings and dangling legs the sheep shook her head several times and at last shook the bird off but no sooner was it down than it jumped up and caught the ear again then at last the sheep fairly beaten struggled up to her feet throwing the bird off and lazily walked away shaking her head repeatedly  how great the confidence of the plover must have been to allow it to act in such a manner  this perfect confidence which birds have in the mammals they have been taught by experience and tradition to regard as harmless must be familiar to any one who has observed partridges associating with rabbits the manners of the rabbit one would imagine must be exceedingly upsetting to birds of so timorous a disposition he has a way after a quiet interval of leaping into activity with startling suddenness darting violently away as if scared out of his senses but his eccentric movements do not in the least alarm his feathered companions one evening early in the month of march i witnessed an amusing scene near ockley in surrey i was walking towards the village about half an hour after sunset when hearing the loud call of a partridge i turned my eyes in the direction of the sound and saw five birds on a slight eminence nearly in the centre of a small green field surrounded by a low thorn hedge they had come to that spot to roost the calling bird was standing erect and for some time he continued to call at intervals after the others had settled down at a distance of one or two yards apart all at once while i stood watching the birds there was a rustling sound in the hedge and out of it burst two buck rabbits engaged in a frantic running fight for some time they kept near the hedge but fighting rabbits seldom continue long on one spot they are incessantly on the move although their movements are chiefly round and round now one wayflight and pursuitthen like lightning the foremost rabbit doubles back and there is a collision bitings and rolling over and over together and in an instant they are up again wide apart racing like mad gradually they went farther and farther from the hedge and at length chance took them to the very spot on which the partridges had settled and there for three or four minutes the duel went on but the birds refused to be turned out of their quarters the bird that had called still remained standing expectant with raised head as if watching for the appearance of some loiterer while the others all kept their places their quietude in the midst of that whirlwind of battle was wonderful to see their only movement was when one of the birds was in a direct line with a flying rabbit when if it stayed still in another moment it would be struck and perhaps killed by the shock then it would leap a few inches aside and immediately settle down again in this way every one of the birds had been forced to move several times before the battle passed on towards the opposite side of the field and left the covey in peace  social animals herbert spencer truly says take pleasure in the consciousness of one anothers company but he appears to limit the feeling to those of the same herd or flock or species speaking of the mental processes of the cow he tells us just how that large mammal is impressed by the sight of birds that come near it and pass across its field of vision they are regarded in a vague way as mere shadows or shadowy objects flitting or blown about hither and thither over the grass or through the air he didnt know a cows mind my conviction is that all animals distinctly see in those of other species living sentient intelligent beings like themselves and that when birds and mammals meet together they take pleasure in the consciousness of one anothers presence in spite of the enormous difference in size voice habits etc i believe that this sympathy exists and is just as strong between a cow and its small volatile companion the wagtail as between a bird and mammal that more nearly resemble each other in size for instance the partridge or pheasant and rabbit  the only bird with us that appears to have some such feeling of pleasure in the company of man is the robin it is not universal not even very common and macgillivray in speaking of the confidence in men of that bird during severe weather very truly says in ordinary times he is not perfectly disposed to trust in man any person can prove this for himself by going into a garden or shrubbery and approaching a robin we see too that the bird shows intense anxiety when its nest is approached by a man this point however need not be made much of since all visitors even its best friends are unwelcome to the breeding bird still there is no doubt that the robin is less distrustful of man than other species but not surely because this bird is regarded by most persons with kindly feelings the curious point is that the young birds find something in man to attract them this is usually seen at the end of summer when the old birds have gone into hiding and it is then surprising to find how many of the young robins left in possession of the ground appear to take pleasure in the company of human beings often before a person has been many minutes in a garden strolling about he will discover that the quiet little spotted bird is with him hopping and flying from twig to twig and occasionally alighting on the ground keeping company with him sometimes sitting quite still a yard from his hand the gardener is usually attended by a friendly robin and when he turns up the soil the bird will come down close to his feet to pick up the small grubs and worms is it not probable that the tameness of the tame young robin so frequently met with is like that of the robin who keeps company with the gardener or woodman an acquired habit that the young bird has made the discovery that when a person is moving about among the plants picking fruit perhaps lurking insects are disturbed at the roots and small spiders and caterpillars shaken from the leaves we are to the robin what the cow is to the wagtail and the sheep to the starlinga food finder  among the birds of the homestead the swallow is another somewhat exceptional species in his way of regarding man he is too much a creature of the air to take any pleasure in the company of heavy animals bound to earth the distance is too great for sympathy to exist when we consider how closely he is bound and how much he is to us it is hard to believe that he is wholly unconscious of our benefits that when he returns in spring overflowing with gladness to twitter his delightful airy music round the house he is not singing to us glad to see us again after a long absence to be once more our welcome guest as in past years but so it is when there were no houses in the land he built his nest in some rocky cavern where a shewolf had her lair and his life and music were just as joyous as they are now and the wolf suckling her cubs on the stony floor beneath was nothing to him but if by chance she climbed a little way up or put her nose too near his nest his lively twittering quickly changed to shrill cries of alarm and anger and we are no more than the vanished wolf to the swallow and so long as we refrain from peeping into his nest and handling his eggs or young he does not know us and is hardly conscious of our existence all the social feelings and sympathy of the swallow are for creatures as aërial and swiftwinged as itselfits playmates in the wide fields of air  swallows hawking after flies in a village street where people are walking about is a familiar sight swifts are just as confident a short time ago while standing in the churchyard at farnham in surrey watching a bunch of ten or twelve swifts racing through the air i noticed that on each return to the church they followed the same line doubling round the tower on the same side then sweeping down close to the surface and mounting again going to the spot i put myself directly in their wayon their racecourse as it were at that point where it touched the earth but they did not on that account vary their route each time they came back they streamed screaming past my head so near as almost to brush my face with their wings but i was never more struck by the unconcern at the presence of man shown by these birdsswallows martins and swiftsas on one occasion at frensham when the birds were very numerous this was in the month of may about five weeks after i had witnessed the fight between two rabbits and the wonderful composure exhibited by a covey of partridges through it all it was on a close hot morning after a night of rain when walking down to frensham great pond i saw the birds hawking about near the water the mayflies were just out and in some mysterious way the news had been swiftly carried all over the surrounding country so great was the number of birds that the entire population of swallows house and sandmartins and swifts must have been gathered at that spot from the villages farms and sandbanks for several miles around at the side of the pond i was approaching there is a green strip about a hundred and twenty or a hundred and thirty yards in length and forty or fifty yards wide and over this ground from end to end the birds were smoothly and swiftly gliding backwards and forwards the whole place seemed alive with them hurrying to the spot i met with a little adventure which it may not be inapt to relate walking on through some scattered furzebushes gazing intently ahead at the swallows i almost knocked my foot against a hen pheasant covering her young chicks on the bare ground beside a dwarf bush catching sight of her just in time i started back then with my feet about a yard from the bird i stood and regarded her for some time not the slightest movement did she make she was like a bird carved out of some beautifully variegated and highlypolished stone but her bright round eyes had a wonderfully alert and wild expression with all her stillness the poor bird must have been in an agony of terror and suspense and i wondered how long she would endure the tension she stood it for about fifty seconds then burst screaming away with such violence that her seven or eight chicks were flung in all directions to a distance of two or three feet like little balls of fluff and going twenty yards away she dropped to the ground and began beating her wings calling loudly  i then walked on and in three or four minutes was on the green ground in the thick of the swallows they were in hundreds flying at various heights but mostly low so that i looked down on them and they certainly formed a curious and beautiful spectacle so thick were they and so straight and rapid their flight that they formed in appearance a current or rather many currents flowing side by side in opposite directions and when viewed with nearly closed eyes the birds were like black lines on the green surface they were silent except for the occasional weak note of the sandmartin and through it all they were perfectly regardless of me whether i stood still or walked about among them only when i happened to be directly in the way of a bird coming towards me he would swerve aside just far enough to avoid touching me  in the evening of that very day the behaviour of a number of goldcrests disturbed at my presence surprised and puzzled me not a little their action had a peculiar interest just then as the encounter with the pheasant and the sight of the multitude of swallows and their indifference towards me were still very fresh in memory the incident has only an indirect bearing on the subject discussed here but i think it is worth relating  about two miles from frensham ponds there is a plantation of firtrees with a good deal of gorse growing scattered about among the trees in walking through this wood on previous occasions i had noticed that goldcrests were abundant in it soon after sunset on the evening in question i went through this wood and after going about eighty to a hundred yards became conscious of a commotion of a novel kind in the branches above my headconscious too that it had been going on for some time and that absorbed in thought i had not remarked it a considerable number of goldcrests were flitting through the branches and passing from tree to tree keeping over and near me all together uttering their most vehement cries of alarm i stopped and listened to the little chorus of shrill squeaking sounds and watched the birds as well as i could in the obscurity of the branches flitting about in the greatest agitation it was perfectly clear that i was the cause of the excitement as the birds increased in number as long as i stood at that spot until there could not have been less than forty or fifty and when i again walked on they followed one expects to be mobbed and screamed at by gulls terns lapwings and some other species when approaching their nestingplaces but a hostile demonstration of this kind from such minute creatures as goldcrests usually indifferent to man struck me as very unusual and somewhat ridiculous what i asked myself could be the reason of their sudden alarm when my previous visits to the wood had not excited them in the least i could only suppose that i had without knowing it brushed against a nest and the alarm note of the parent birds had excited the others and caused them to gather near me and that in the obscure light they had mistaken me for some rapacious animal the right explanation i think it the right one was found by chance three months later  in august i was in ireland staying at a country house among the wicklow hills there were several swallows nests in the stable one or two so low that they could be reached by the hand and the birds went in and out regardless of the presence of any person in a few days the young were out sitting in rows on the roof of the house or on a low fence near it where their parents fed them for a short time after these young birds were able to take care of themselves they still kept about the house and were joined by more swallows and martins from the neighbourhood one bright sunny morning when not fewer than two or three score of these birds were flying about the house gaily twittering i went into the garden to get some fruit all at once a swallow uttered his loud shrill alarm cry overhead and at the same time darted down at me almost grazing my hat then mounting up he continued making swoops screaming all the time immediately all the other swallows and martins came to the spot joining in the cry and continued flying about over my head but not darting at me like the first bird for some moments i was very much astonished at the attack then i looked round for the catit must be the cat i thought this animal had a habit of hiding among the gooseberry bushes and when i stooped to pick the fruit springing very suddenly upon my back but pussy was nowhere near and as the swallow continued to make dashes at me i thought that there must be something to alarm it on my head and at once pulled off my hat and began to examine it in a moment the alarm cries ceased and the whole gathering of swallows dispersed in all directions there was no doubt that my hat had caused the excitement it was of tweed of an obscure grey colour striped or barred with dark brown throwing it down on the ground among the bushes it struck me that its colour and markings were like those of a grey striped cat any one seeing it lying there would at the first moment have mistaken it for a cat lying curled up asleep among the bushes then i remembered that i had been wearing the same delusive dangerouslooking round tweed fishinghat on the occasion of being mobbed by the goldcrests at frensham of course the illusion could only have been produced in a bird looking down upon the top of the hat from above     chapter iii  daws in the west country   daws are more abundant in the west and southwest of england generally than in any other part of the kingdom and they abound most in somerset or so it has seemed to me it is true that the largest congregations of daws in the entire country are to be seen at savernake in wiltshire where the ancient hollow beeches and oaks in the central parts of the forest supply them with all the nesting holes they require there is no such wood of old decaying trees in somerset to attract them to one spot in such numbers but the country generally is singularly favourable to them it is mainly a pastoral country with large areas of rich low grass land and ranges of high hills where there are many rocky precipices such as the daw loves for very good reasons he prefers the inland to the seacliff as a breeding site it is to begin with in the midst of his feeding ground whereas the seawall is a boundary to a feeding ground beyond which the bird cannot go better still the inland bird has an immense advantage over the other in travelling to and from his nest in bad weather when the wind blows strong from the sea the seaside bird must perpetually fight against it and win his home by sheer muscular exertion the other bird able to go foraging to this side or that according to the way the wind blows can always have the wind as a help instead of a hindrance  somerset also possesses a long coastline and some miles of seacliffs but the colonies of jackdaws found here are small compared with those of the mendip range the inlandcliff breeding daws that inhabit the valley of the somerset axe alone probably greatly outnumber all the daws in middlesex or surrey or essex  finally besides the cliffs and woods there are the old towns and villagessmall towns and villages with churches that are almost like cathedrals no county in england is richer in noble churches and no kind of building seems more attractive to the ecclesiastical daw than the great perpendicular tower of the glastonbury type which is so common here  of the old towns which the bird loves and inhabits in numbers wells comes first if wells had no birds it would still be a city one could not but delight in there are not more than half a dozen towns in all the country where if i were compelled to live in towns life would not seem something of a burden and of these two are in somersetbath and wells of the former something will be said further on wells has the first place in my affections and is the one town in england the sight of which in april and early may from a neighbouring hill has caused me to sigh with pleasure its cathedral is assuredly the loveliest work of man in this land supremely beautiful even without the multitude of daws that make it their house and may be seen every day in scores looking like black doves perched on the stony heads and hands and shoulders of that great company of angels and saints apostles kings queens and bishops that decorate the wonderful west front for in this buildingnot viewed as in a photograph or picture nor through the eye of the mere architect or archaeologist who sees the gem but not the settingnature and man appear to have worked together more harmoniously than in others  but it is hard to imagine a birdless wells the hills beautiful with trees and grass and flowers come down to it cattle graze on their slopes the peewit has its nest in their stony places and the kestrel with quickbeating wings hangs motionless overhead nature is round it breathing upon and touching it caressingly on every side flowing through it like the waters that gave it its name in olden days that still gush with noise and foam from the everlasting rock to send their crystal currents along the streets and with nature in and around the rustic villagelike city live the birds the green woodpecker laughs aloud from the group of old cedars and pines hard by the cathedral closeyou will not hear that woodland sound in any other city in the kingdom and the rooks caw all day from the rookery in the old elms that grow at the side of the palace moat but the cathedral daws on account of their numbers are the most important of the feathered inhabitants of wells these city birds are familiarly called bishops jacks to distinguish them from the ebor jacks the daws that in large numbers have their home and breedingplace in the neighbouring cliffs called the ebor rocks  the ebor daws are but the first of a succession of colonies extending along the side of the cheddar valley a curious belief exists among the people of wells and the district that the ebor jacks make better pets than the bishops jacks if you want a young bird you have to pay more for one from the rocks than from the cathedral i was assured that the cliff bird makes a livelier more intelligent and amusing pet than the other a similar notion exists or existed at hastings where there was a saying among the fisher folks and other natives that a grainger daa is worth a hapenny more than a castle daa the grainger rock once a favourite breedingplace of the daws at that point has long since fallen into the sea and the saying has perhaps died out  at wells most of the cathedral birdsa hundred couples at leastbreed in the cavities behind the stone statues standing each in its niche in rows tier above tier on the west front in april when the daws are busiest at their nestbuilding i have amused myself early every morning watching them flying to the front in a constant procession every bird bringing his stick this work is all done in the early morning and about halfpast eight oclock a man comes with a barrow to gather up the fallen sticksthere is always a big barrowful heaped high of them and if not thus removed the accumulated material would in a few days form a rampart or zareba which would prevent access to the cathedral on that side  it has often been observed that the daw albeit so clever a bird shows a curious deficiency of judgment when building in his persistent efforts to carry in sticks too big for the cavity here for instance each morning in turning over the litter of fallen material i picked up sticks measuring from four or five to seven feet in length these very long sticks were so slender and dry that the bird was able to lift and to fly with them therefore to his corvine mind they were suitable for his purpose it comes to this the daw knows a stick when he sees one but the only way of testing its usefulness to him is to pick it up in his beak then to try to fly with it if the stick is six feet long and the cavity will only admit one of not more than eighteen inches he discovers his mistake only on getting home the question arises does he continue all his life long repeating this egregious blunder one can hardly believe that an old experienced bird can go on from day to day and year to year wasting his energies in gathering and carrying building materials that will have to be thrown away in the endthat he is in fact mentally on a level with the great mass of meaner beings who forget nothing and learn nothing it is not to be doubted that the daw was once a builder in trees like all his relations with the exception of the cliffbreeding chough he is even capable of reverting to the original habit as i know from an instance which has quite recently come to my knowledge in this case a small colony of daws have been noticed for several years past breeding in stick nests placed among the clustering foliage of a group of scotch firs this colony may have sprung from a bird hatched and reared in the nest of a carrion crow or magpie still the habit of breeding in holes must be very ancient and considering that the jackdaw is one of the most intelligent of our birds one cannot but be astonished at the rude primitive blundering way in which the nestbuilding work is generally performed the most we can see by carefully watching a number of birds at work is that there appears to be some difference with regard to intelligence between bird and bird some individuals blunder less than others it is possible that these have learned something from experience but if that be so their better way is theirs only and their young will not inherit it  one morning at wells as i stood on the cathedral green watching the birds at their work i witnessed a rare and curious sceneone amazing to an ornithologist a bird dropped a stickan incident that occurred a dozen times or oftener any minute at that busy time but in this instance the bird had no sooner let the stick fall than he rushed down after it to attempt its recovery just as one may see a sparrow drop a feather or straw and then dart down after it and often recover it before it touches the ground the heavy stick fell straight and fast on to the pile of sticks already lying on the pavement and instantly the daw was down and had it in his beak and thereupon laboriously flew up to his nestingplace which was forty to fifty feet high at the moment that he rushed down after the falling stick two other daws that happened to be standing on ledges above dropped down after him and copied his action by each picking up a stick and flying with it to their nests other daws followed suit and in a few minutes there was a stream of descending and ascending daws at that spot every ascending bird with a stick in his beak it was curious to see that although sticks were lying in hundreds on the pavement along the entire breadth of the west front the daws continued coming down only at that spot where the first bird had picked up the stick he had dropped by and by to my regret the birds suddenly took alarm at something and rose up and from that moment not one descended  presently the man came round with his rake and broom and barrow to tidy up the place before beginning his work he solemnly made the following remark is it not curious sir considering the distance the birds go to get their sticks and the work of carrying them that they never by any chance think to come down and pick up what they have dropped i replied that i had heard the same thing said before and that it was in all the books and then i told him of the scene i had just witnessed he was very much surprised and said that such a thing had never been witnessed before at that place it had a disturbing effect on him and he appeared to me to resent this departure from their old ancient conservative ways on the part of the cathedral birds  for many mornings after i continued to watch the daws until the nestbuilding was finished without witnessing any fresh outbreak of intelligence in the colony they had once more shaken down into the old inconvenient traditional groove to the manifest relief of the man with the broom and barrow  bath like wells is a city that has a considerable amount of nature in its composition and is set down in a country of hills woods rocks and streams and is therefore like the other a city loved by daws and by many other wild birds it is a town built of white stone in the hollow of an oblong basin with the river avon flowing through it and though perhaps too large for perfect beauty it is exceedingly pleasant its stone walls do not a prison make since they do not shut you out from rural sights and sounds walking in almost any street even in the lowest part in the busiest noisiest centre of the town you have but to lift your eyes to see a green hill not far away and viewed from the top of one of these hills that encircle it bath in certain favourable states of the atmosphere wears a beautiful look one afternoon a couple of miles out i was on the top of barrow hill in a sudden violent storm of rain and wind when the rain ceased the sun burst out behind me and the town rainwet and sunflushed shone white as a city built of whitest marble against the green hills and black cloud on the farther side then on the slaty blackness appeared a complete and most brilliant rainbow on one side streaming athwart the green hill and resting on the centre of the town so that the high old richlydecorated abbey church was seen through a band of green and violet mist that storm and that rainbow seen by chance gave a peculiar grace and glory to bath and the bright unfading picture it left in memory has perhaps become too much associated in my mind with the thought of bath and has given me an exaggerated idea of its charm  when staying in bath in the winter of 18989 i saw a good deal of bird life even in the heart of the town at the back of the house i lodged in in new king street within four minutes walk of the pump room there was a strip of ground called a garden but with no plants except a few dead stalks and stumps and two small leafless trees clotheslines were hung there and the ground was littered with old bricks and rubbish and at the far end of the strip there was a fowlhouse with fowls in it a small shed and a woodpile yet to this unpromisinglooking spot came a considerable variety of birds starlings sparrows and chaffinches were the most numerous while the blackbird thrush robin hedgesparrow and wren were each represented by a pair the wrens lived in the woodpile and were the only members of the little feathered community that did not join the others at table when crumbs and scraps were thrown out  it was surprising to find all or most of these birds evidently wintering on that small plot of ground in the middle of the town solely for the sake of the warmth and shelter it afforded them and the chance crumbs that came in their way it is true that i fed them regularly but they were all there before i came yet it was not an absolutely safe place for them being much infested by cats especially by a big black one who was always on the prowl and who had a peculiarly murderous gleam in his luminous yellow orbs when he crouched down to watch or attempted to stalk them one could not but imagine that the very sight of such eyes in that black devilish face would have been enough to freeze their blood with sudden terror and make them powerless to fly from him but it was not so he could neither fascinate nor take them by surprise no sooner would he begin to practise his wiles than all the population would be up in armsthe loud sharp summons of the blackbird sounding first then the starlings would chatter angrily the thrush scream the chaffinches begin to pinkpink with all their might and the others would join in even the small hideling wrens coming out of their fortress of faggots to take part in the demonstration then puss would give it up and go away or coil himself up and go to sleep on the sloping roof of the tiny shed or in some other sheltered spot peace and quiet would once more settle on the little republic and the birds would be content to dwell with their enemy in their midst in full sight of them so long as he slept or did not watch them too narrowly  finding that blue tits were among the visitors at the back i hung up some lumps of suet and a cocoanut to the twigs of the bushes the suet was immediately attacked but judging from the suspicious way in which they regarded the round brown object swinging in the wind the bath tits had never before been treated to a cocoanut but though suspicious it was plain that the singular object greatly excited their curiosity on the second day they made the discovery that it was a new and delightful dish invented for the benefit of the blue tits and from that time they were at it at all hours coming and going from morning till night there were six of them and occasionally they were all there at once each one anxious to secure a place and never able when he got one to keep it longer than three or four seconds at a time looking upon them from an upper window as they perched against and flitted round and round the suspended cocoanut they looked like a gathering of very large paleblue flies flitting round and feeding on medlar  no doubt the sparrow is the most abundant species in bathi have got into a habit of not noticing that bird and it is as if i did not see him but after him the starling is undoubtedly the most numerous he is we know increasing everywhere but in no other town in england have i found him in such numbers he is seen in flocks of a dozen to half a hundred busily searching for grubs on every lawn and green place in and round the town and if you go up to some elevated spot so as to look down upon bath you will see flocks of starlings arriving and departing at all points as you walk the streets their metallic clinkclinkclink sounds from all quarterssmall noises which to most men are lost among the louder noises of a populous town it is as if every house had a peal of minute bells hidden beneath the tiles or slates of the roof or among the chimneypots that they were constantly being rung and that every bell was cracked  the ordinary or unobservant person sees and hears far more of the jackdaw than of any other bird in bath daws are seen and heard all over the town but are most common about the abbey where they soar and gambol and quarrel all day long and when they think that nobody is looking drop down to the streets to snatch up and carry off any eatablelooking object that catches their eye  it was here at this central spot while i stood one day idly watching the birds disporting themselves about the abbey and listened to their clamour that certain words of ruskin came into my mind and i began to think of them not merely with admiration as when i first read them long ago but critically  ruskin one of our greatest prose writers is usually at his best in the transposition of pictures into words his descriptions of what he has seen in nature and art being the most perfect examples of word painting in the language here his writing is that of one whose vision is not merely as in the majority of men the most important and intellectual of the senses but so infinitely more important than all the others and developed and trained to so extraordinary a degree as to make him appear like a person of a single sense we may say that this predominant sense has caused or fed upon the decay of the others this is to me a defect in the author i most admire for though he makes me see and delight in seeing that which was previously hidden and all things gain in beauty and splendour i yet miss something from the picture just as i should miss light and colour from a description of nature however beautifully written by a man whose sense of sight was nothing or next to nothing to him but whose other senses were all developed to the highest state of perfection  no doubt ruskin is before everything an artist in other words he looks at nature and all visible things with a purpose which i am happily without and the reflex effect of his purpose is to make nature to him what it can never appear to mea painted canvas but this subject which i have touched on in a single sentence demands a volume  ruskin wrote of the cathedral daws that drift of eddying black points now closing now scattering now settling suddenly into invisible places among the bosses and flowers the crowd of restless birds that fill the whole square with that strange clangour of theirs so harsh and yet so soothing for it seemed to me that he had seen the birds but had not properly heard them or else that to his mind the sound they made was of such small consequence in the effect of the whole sceneso insignificant an element compared with the sight of themthat it was really not worth attending to and describing accurately  possibly in this particular case when in speaking of the daws he finished his description by throwing in a few words about their voices he was thinking less of the impression on his own mind presumably always vague about natural sounds than of what the poet cowper had said in the best passage in his best work about sounds harsh and inharmonious in themselves which are yet able to produce a soothing effect on us on account of the peaceful scenes amid which they are heard  cowpers notion of the daws voice by the way was just as false as that expressed by ruskin as we may find in his paraphrase of vincent bournes lines to that bird     there is a bird that by his coat    and by the hoarseness of his note    might be supposed a crow  now the daw is capable at times of emitting both hoarse and harsh notes and the same may perhaps be said of a majority of birds but his usual notethe cry or caw varied and inflected a hundred ways which we hear every day and all day long where daws aboundis neither harsh like the crows nor hoarse like the rooks it is in fact as unlike the harsh grating caw of the former species as the clarion call of the cock is unlike the grunting of swine it may not be described as belllike nor metallic but it is loud and clear with an engaging wildness in it and like metallic sounds farreaching and of so good a quality that very little more would make it ring musically  sometimes when i go into this ancient abbey church or into some cathedral and seating myself and looking over a forest of bonnets see a pale young curate with a black moustache arrayed in white vestments standing before the readingdesk and hear him gabbling some part of the service in a continuous buzz and rumble that roams like a gigantic bluebottle through the vast dim interior then i not following himfor i do not know where he is and cannot find out however much i should like toam apt to remember the daws out of doors and to think that it would be well if that young man would but climb up into the highest tower or on to the roof and dwell there for the space of a year listening to them and that he would fill his mouth with polished pebbles and medals and coins and seals and sealrings and small porcelain cats and dogs and little silver pigs and other objects from the chatelaines of his lady admirers and strive to imitate that clear penetrating sound of the birds voice until he had mastered the rare and beautiful arts of voice production and distinct understandable speech  to go back to cowperthe poet who has been much in mens thoughts of late and who appears to us as perhaps the most modernminded of those who ceased to live a century ago undoubtedly he was as bad a naturalist as any singer before or after him and as any true poet has a perfect right to be as bad let us say as shakespeare and wordsworth and tennyson he does not it is true confound the sparrow and hedgesparrow like wordsworth nor confound the white owl with the brown owl like tennyson nor puzzle the ornithologist with a seablue bird of march but we must not forget that he addressed some verses to a nightingale heard on new years day it is clear that he did not know the crows well for in a letter of may 10 1780 to his friend newton he writes a crow rook or raven has built a nest in one of the young elmtrees at the side of mrs asprays orchard but when he wrote those words     sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh    yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns    and only there please highly for their sake  words which i have suggested misled ruskin and have certainly misled othershe cowper knew better his real feeling and better and wiser thought is expressed in one of his incomparable letters hayley vol ii p 230  my greenhouse is never so pleasant as when we are just on the point of surrendering it i sit with all the windows and the door wide open and am regaled with the scent of every flower in a garden as full of flowers as i have known how to make it we keep no bees but if i lived in a hive i could hardly have more of their music all the bees in the neighbourhood resort to a bed of mignonette opposite to the window and pay me for the honey they get out of it by a hum which though rather monotonous is as agreeable to my ears as the whistling of my linnets all the sounds that nature utters are delightful at least in this country i should not perhaps find the roaring of lions in africa or of bears in russia very pleasing but i know no beast in england whose voice i do not account as musical save and except always the braying of an ass the notes of all our birds and fowls please me without one exception i should not indeed think of keeping a goose in a cage that i might hang him up in the parlour for the sake of his melody but a goose upon a common or in a farmyard is no bad performer and as to insects if the black beetle and beetles indeed of all hues will keep out of my way i have no objection to any of the rest on the contrary in whatever key they sing from the gnats fine treble to the bass of the bumblebee i admire all seriously however it strikes me as a very observable instance of providential kindness to men that such an exact accord has been contrived between his ear and the sounds with which at least in a rural situation it is almost every moment visited  who has not felt the truth of this saying that all natural sounds heard in their proper surroundings are pleasing that even those which we call harsh do not distress jarring or grating on our nerves like artificial noises the braying of the donkey was to cowper the one exception in animal life but he never heard it in its proper conditions i have often listened to it and have been deeply impressed in a wild silent country in a place where herds of semiwild asses roamed over the plains and the sound at a distance had a wild expression that accorded with the scene and owing to its much greater power effected the mind more than the trumpeting of wild swans and shrill neighing of wild horses and other farreaching cries of wild animals  about the sounds emitted by geese in a state of nature and the effect produced on the mind i shall have something to say in a chapter on that bird     chapter iv  early spring in savernake forest   when the springfeeling is in the blood infecting us with vague longings for we know not what when we are restless and seem to be waiting for some obstruction to be removedblown away by winds or washed away by rainssome change that will open the way to liberty and happinessthe feeling not unfrequently takes a more or less definite form we want to go away somewhere to be at a distance from our fellowbeings and nearer if not to the sun at all events to wild nature at such times i think of all the places where i should like to be and one is savernake and thither in two following seasons i have gone to ramble day after day forgetting the world and myself in its endless woods  it is not that spring is early there on the contrary it is actually later by many days than in the surrounding country it is flowerless at a time when outside the forest on southern banks and by the hedgeside in coppices and all sheltered spots the firstlings of the year are seenpurple and white and yellow the woods which are composed almost entirely of beech and oak are leafless the aspect on a dull cold day is somewhat cheerless on the other hand there is that largeness and wildness which accord with the spring mood and there are signs of the coming change even in the greyest weather standing in some wide green drive or other open space you see all about you acres on acres miles on miles of majestic beeches and their upper branches and network of terminal twigs that look at a distance like heavy bankedup clouds are dusky red and purple with the renewed life that is surging in them there are jubilant cries of wild creatures that have felt the seasonal change far more keenly than we are able to feel it above everything we find here that solitariness and absence of human interest now so rare in england for albeit social creatures in the main we are yet all of us at times hermits in heart if not exactly wild men of the woods and that solitude which we create by shutting ourselves from the world in a room or a house is but a poor substitutenay a sham it is to immure ourselves in a cage a prison which hardly serves to keep out the allpervading atmosphere of miserable conventions and cannot refresh and invigorate us there are seasons and moods when even the new forest does not seem sufficiently remote from life in its most secluded places one is always liable to encounter a human being an old resident going about in the exercise of his commoners rights or else his ponies or cows or swine these last if they be not of some improved breed may have a novel or quaint aspect as of wild creatures but the appearance is deceptive as you pass they lift their long snouts from grubbing among the dead leaves to salute you with a too familiar gruntan assurance that william rufus is dead and all is well that they are domestic and will spend their last days in a stye and end their life respectably at the hands of the butcher  at savernake there is nothing so humanised as the pig even of the old type you may roam for long hours and see no man and no domestic animal you have heard that this domain is the property of some person but it seems like a fiction the forest is natures and yours there you are at liberty to ramble all day unchallenged by any one to walk and run to warm yourself to disturb a herd of red deer or of fallow deer which are more numerous to watch them standing still to gaze back at you then all with one impulse move rapidly away showing their painted tails keeping a kind of discipline row behind row moving over the turf with that airy tripping or mincing gait that strikes you as quaint and somewhat birdlike or you may coil yourself up adderlike beside a thick hawthorn bush or at the roots of a giant oak or beech and enjoy the vernal warmth while outside of your shelter the wind blows bleak and loud  to lie or sit thus for an hour at a time listening to the wind is an experience worth going far to seek it is very restorative that is a mysterious voice which the forest has it speaks to us and somehow the life it expresses seems nearer more intimate than that of the sea doubtless because we are ourselves terrestrial and woodland in our origin also because the sound is infinitely more varied as well as more human in character there are sighings and moanings and wails and shrieks and windblown murmurings like the distant confused talking of a vast multitude a high wind in an extensive wood always produces this effect of numbers the sealike sounds and rhythmic volleyings when the gale is at its loudest die away and in the succeeding lull there are only low mysterious agitated whisperings but they are multitudinous the suggestion is ever of a vast concoursecrowds and congregations tumultuous or orderly but all swayed by one absorbing impulse solemn or passionate but not always moved simultaneously through the near whisperings a deeper louder sound comes from a distance it rumbles like thunder falling and rising as it rolls onwards it is antiphonal but changes as it travels nearer then there is no longer demand and response the smitten trees are all bent one way and their innumerable voices are as one voice expressing we know not what but always something not wholly strange to uslament entreaty denunciation  listening thinking of nothing simply living in the sound of the wind that strange feeling which is unrelated to anything that concerns us of the life and intelligence inherent in nature grows upon the mind i have sometimes thought that never does the world seem more alive and watchful of us than on a still moonlight night in a solitary wood when the dusky green foliage is silvered by the beams and all visible objects and the white lights and black shadows in the intervening spaces seem instinct with spirit but it is not so if the conditions be favourable if we go to our solitude as the crystalgazer to his crystal with a mind prepared this faculty is capable of awaking and taking complete possession of us by day as well as by night  as the trees are mostly beechesmiles upon miles of great trees many of them hollowtrunked from age and decaythe fallen leaves are an important element in the forest scenery they lie half a yard to a yard deep in all the deep hollows and dells and old waterworn channels and where the ground is sheltered they cover acres of groundmillions and myriads of dead fallen beech leaves these too always seem to be alive it is a leaf that refuses to die wholly when separated from the tree it has if not immortality at all events a second longer life oak and ash and chestnut leaves fade from month to month and blacken and finally rot and mingle with the earth while the beech leaf keeps its sharp clean edges unbroken its hard texture and fiery colour its buoyancy and rustling incisive sound swept by the autumn winds into sheltered hollows and beaten down by rains the leaves lie mingled in one dead sodden mass for days and weeks at a time and appear ready to mix with the soil but frost and sun suck up the moisture and the dead come to life again they glow like fire and tremble at every breath it was strange and beautiful to see them lying all around me glowing copper and red and gold when the sun was strong on them not dead but sleeping like a brightcoloured serpent in the genial warmth to see when the wind found them how they trembled and moved as if awakening and as the breath increased rose up in twos and threes and halfdozens here and there chasing one another a little way hissing and rustling then all at once struck by a violent gust they would be up in thousands eddying round and round in a dance and whirling aloft scatter and float among the lofty branches to which they were once attached  on a calm day when there was no motion in the sunlit yellow leaves below and the reddishpurple cloud of twigs above the sounds of birdlife were the chief attraction of the forest of these the cooing of the woodpigeon gave me the most pleasure here some reader may remark that this pigeons song is a more agreeable sound than its plain cooing note this indeed is perhaps thought little of in most biographies of the bird it is not even mentioned that he possesses such a note nevertheless i prefer it to the song the song itselfthe set melody composed of half a dozen inflected notes repeated three or four times with little or no variationis occasionally heard in the late winter and early spring but at this time of the year it is often too husky or croaky to be agreeable the songster has not yet thrown off his seasonal cold the sound might sometimes proceed from a crow suffering from a catarrh it improves as the season advances the song is sometimes spelt in books     coocoóroo coócooroo  a lady friend assures me the right words of this song are     take two cows david  she cannot if she tries make the bird say anything different for these are the words she was taught to hear in the song as a child in leicestershire of course they are uttered with a great deal of emotion in the tone david being tearfully almost sobbingly begged and implored to take two cows the emphasis is very strong on the twoit is apparently a matter of the utmost consequence that david should not take one nor three nor any other number of cows but just two  in east anglia i have been informed that what the bird really and truly says is     my toe bleeds betty  many as are the species capable of articulate speech as we may see by referring to any ornithological work there is no bird in our woods whose notes more readily lend themselves to this childish fancy than the woodpigeon on account of the depth and singularly human quality of its voice the song is a passionate complaint one can fancy the humanlike feathered creature in her green bower pleading upbraiding lamenting and listening we will find it easy enough to put it all into plain language     o swear not you love me for you cannot be true    o perjured woodpigeon go from mewoo    some other heartbroken i rue    that softness ah me when you cooed your false coo    soar to your new lovethe creature in blue    who who would have thought it of you    and perhaps you consider her beau    ootiful o you are too too cru    bid them come shoooot me do do    would i had given my heart to a hoo    ooting woodowl cuckoo woodcock hoopoo  one morning at a village in berkshire i was walking along the road about twentyfive yards from a cottage when i heard as i imagined the familiar song of the woodpigeon but it sounded too close for the nearest trees were fifty yards distant glancing up at the open window of an upper room in the cottage i made the discovery that my supposed pigeon was a fouryearold child who had recently been chastised by his mother and sent upstairs to do penance there he sat by the open window his face in his hands crying not as if his heart would break but seeming to take a mournful pleasure in the rhythmical sound of his own sobs and moans they had settled into a rising and falling boohoo with regularly recurring long and short notes agreeable to the ear and very creditable to the little criers musical capacity the incident shows how much the pigeons plaint resembles some human sounds  the plain cooing note is so common in this order of birds that it may be regarded as the original and universal pigeon language out of which the set songs have been developed with in most instances but little change in the quality of the sound in the multitude of species there are voices clear resonant thick or husky or guttural hollow or booming grating and grunting but however much they vary you can generally detect the pigeon or family sound which is more or less humanlike in some species the set song has almost superseded the plain single note which has diminished to a mere murmur in others on the contrary there is no song at all unless the single unvarying coo can be called a song in most species in the typical genus columba the plain coo is quite distinct from the set song but has at the same time developed into a kind of second song the note being pleasantly modulated and repeated many times we find this in the rockdove the curious guttural sounds composing its set song which accompany the love antics of the male are not musical while the clear inflected cooing note is agreeable to most ears it is a pleasing morning sound of the dovecote but the note to be properly appreciated must be heard in some dimly lighted oceancavern in which the bird breeds in its wild state the longdrawn oftrepeated musical coo mingles with and is heard above the murmuring and lapping of the water beneath the hollow chamber retains and prolongs the sound and makes it more sonorous and at the same time gives it something of mystery  of all the cooing notes of the different species i am acquainted with that of the stockdove a pigeon with no set song is undoubtedly the most attractive next in order is that of the woodpigeon on account of its depth and humanlike character and it is far from monotonous in this wood in march i have often kept near a pigeon for half an hour at a time hearing it uttering its cooing note repeated half a dozen or more times at intervals of three or four minutes and again and again the note has changed in length and power and modulation in the profound stillness on a windless day of the vast beechen woods these sonorous notes had a singularly beautiful effect  after spending a short time in the forest one might easily get the idea that it is a sanctuary for all the persecuted creatures of the crow family it is not quite that the ravens have been destroyed here as in most places but the other birds of that tribe are so numerous that even the most bloodthirsty keeper might be appalled at the task of destroying them the clearance would doubtless have been effected if this noble forest had passed as so nearly happened out of the hands of the family that have so long possessed it that calamity was happily averted not only are the rooks there in legions having their rookeries in the park but throughout the forest daws carrion crows jays and magpies are abundant the jackdaws outnumber all the other species rooks included put together they literally swarm and their ringing yelping cries may be heard at all hours of the day in any part of the forest in march when they are nesting their numbers are concentrated in those parts of the wood where the trees beech and oak are very old and have hollow trunks in some places you will find many acres of wood where every tree is hollow and apparently inhabited yet there are doubtless some hollow trees into which the daw is not permitted to intrude the woodowl is common here and is presumably well able to hold his castle against all aggressors if one could but climb into the airy tower and sitting invisible watch the siege and defence and the many strange incidents of the war between these feathered foes the daw bold yet cautious venturing a little way into the dim interior with shrill threats of ejectment ruffling his grey pate and peeping down with his small malicious serpentlike grey eyes the owl puffing out his tigercoloured plumage and lifting to the light his pale shieldlike face and luminous eyeswould indeed be a rare spectacle and then what hissings snappings and beakclatterings and shrill catlike and yelping cries but although these singular contests go on so near us a few yards above the surface savernake might be in the misty midregion of weir or on the slopes of mount yanik for all the chance we have of witnessing them  an experience i had one day when i was new to the forest and used occasionally to lose myself gave me some idea of the numbers of jackdaws breeding in savernake during my walk i came to a spot where all round me and as far as could be seen the trees were in an advanced state of decay not only were they hollow and rotten within but the immense horizontal branches and portions of the trunks were covered with a thick crop of fern which mixed with dead grass and moss gave the dying giants of the forest a strange ragged and desolate appearance many a time looking at one of these trees i have been reminded of holman hunts forlorn scapegoat here the daws had their most populous settlement as i advanced the dead twigs and leaves crackling beneath my feet they rose up everywhere singly and in twos and threes and halfdozens darting hurriedly away and disappearing among the trees before me the alarmnote they emit at such times is like their usual yelping call subdued to a short querulous chirp and this note now sounded before me and on either hand at a distance of about one hundred yards uttered continually by so many birds that their voices mingled into a curious sharp murmur tired of walking i sat down on a root in the shelter of a large oak and remained there perfectly motionless for about an hour but the birds never lost their suspicion all the time the distant subdued tempest of sharp notes went on occasionally dying down until it nearly ceased then suddenly rising and spreading again until i was ringed round with the sound at length the loud sharp invitation or order to fly was given and taken up by many birds then through the opening among the trees before me i saw them rise in a dense flock and circle about at a distance other flocks rose on the right and left hands and joined the first and finally the whole mass come slowly overhead as if to explore but when the foremost birds were directly over me the flock divided into two columns which deployed to the right and left and at a distance poured again into the trees there could not have been fewer than two thousand birds in the flock that came over me and they were probably all building in that part of the forest  the daw whether tame or distrustful of man is always interesting here i was even more interested in the jays and it was indeed chiefly for the pleasure of seeing them when they are best to look at that i visited this forest i had also formed the idea that there was no place in england where the jay could be seen to better advantage as they are or until recently were exceedingly abundant at savernake and were not in constant fear of the keeper and his everlasting gun here one could witness their early spring assemblies when the jay beautiful at all times is seen at his very best  it is necessary to say here that this habit of the jay does not appear to be too well known to our ornithologists when i stated in a small work on british birds a few years ago that jays had the custom of congregating in spring a distinguished naturalist who reviewed the book in one of the papers rebuked me for so absurd a statement and informed me that the jay is a solitary bird except at the end of summer and in the early autumn when they are sometimes seen in families if i had not made it a rule never to reply to a critic i could have informed this one that i knew exactly where his knowledge of the habits of the jay was derivedthat it dated back to a book published ninetynine years ago it was a very good book and all it contains some errors included have been incorporated in most of the important ornithological works which have appeared during the nineteenth century but though my critic thus wrote it all by rote according to the books he did not write it right the ancient error has not however been repeated by all writers on the subject seebohm in his history of british birds wrote sometimes especially in spring fortune may favour you and you will see a regular gathering of these noisy birds it is only at this time that the jay displays a social disposition and the birds may often be heard to utter a great variety of notes some of the modulations approaching almost to a song  the truth of the statement i have made that most of our writers on birds have strictly followed montague in his account of the jays habits unmistakably shows itself in all they say about the birds language montagu wrote in his famous dictionary of birds 1802  its common notes are various but harsh will sometimes in spring utter a sort of song in a soft and pleasing manner but so low as not to be heard at any distance and at intervals introduce the bleatings of a lamb mewing of a cat the note of a kite or buzzard hooting of an owl and even the neighing of a horse  these imitations are so exact even in a natural wild state that we have frequently been deceived  this description somewhat amplified and the wording varied to suit the writers style has been copied into most books on british birdsthe lamb and the cat and the kite and the horse faithfully appearing in most cases yet it is certain that if all the writers had listened to the jays vocal performances for themselves they would have given a different account it is not that montagu was wrong he went to nature for his facts and put down what he heard or thought he heard but the particular sounds which he describes they would not have heard  my experience is that the same notes and phrases are not ordinarily heard in any two localities that the bird is able to emit a great variety of soundssome highly musical that he is also a great mimic in a wild irregular way mixing borrowed notes with his own and flinging them out anyhow so that there is no order nor harmony and they do not form a song  but he also has a real song which may be heard in any assembly of jays and from some male birds after the congregating season is over and breeding is in progress this singing of the jay is somewhat of a puzzle as it is not the same song in any two places and gives one the idea that there is no inherited and no traditional song in this species but that each bird that has a song has invented it for himself it varies from a sort of low song as montagu saida soft chatter and warble which one can just hear at a distance of thirty or forty yardsto a song composed of several musical notes harmoniously arranged which may be heard distinctly a quarter of a mile away this set and farreaching song is rare but some birds have a single very powerful and musical note or short phrase which they repeat at regular intervals by way of song if by following up the sound one can get near enough to the tree where the meeting is being held to see what is going on it is most interesting to watch the vocalist who is like a leader and who perched quietly continues to repeat that one powerful unchanging measured sound in the midst of a continuous concert of more or less musical sounds from the other birds  what i should very much like to know is whether these powerful and peculiar notes phrases and songs of the jay which are clearly not imitations of other species are repeated year after year by the birds in the same localities or are dropped for ever or forgotten at the end of each season it is hard for me to find this out because i do not as a rule revisit the same places in spring and on going to a new or a different spot i find that the birds utter different sounds again the places where jays assemble in numbers are very few and far between it is true as an observant gamekeeper once said to me that if there are as many as half a dozen to a dozen jays in any wood they will contrive to hold a meeting but when the birds are few and much persecuted it is difficult to see and hear them at such times and when seen and heard no adequate idea is formed of the beauty of their displays and the power and variety of their language as witnessed in localities where they are numerous and fear of the keepers gun has not damped their mad jubilant spirits  in genial weather the jays assembly may be held at any hour but is most frequently seen during the early part of the day on a fine warm morning in march and april one can always count on witnessing an assembly or at all events of hearing the birds in any wood where they are fairly common and not very shy they are so vociferous and so conspicuous to the eye during these social intervals and at the same time so carried away by excitement that it is not only easy to find and see them but possible at times to observe them very closely  the loud rasping alarm and angrycry of the jay is a sound familiar to every one the cry used by the bird to call his fellows together is somewhat different it resembles the cry or call of the carrion crow in localities where that bird is not persecuted when in the love season he takes his stand on the top of the nestingtree and calls with a prolonged harsh grating and exceedingly powerful note many times repeated the jays call has the same grating or grinding character but is louder sharper more prolonged and in a quiet atmosphere may be heard distinctly a mile away the wood is in an uproar when the birds assemble and scream in concert while madly pursuing one another over the tall trees  at such times the peculiar flight of the jay is best seen and is very beautiful in almost all birds that have short round wings as we may see in our little wren and in game birds and the sparrowhawk and several others the wingbeats are exceedingly rapid this is the case with the magpie the quickness of the wingbeats causes the black and white on the quills to mingle and appear a misty grey but at short intervals the bird glides and the wings appear black and white again the jay although his wings are so short and round when not in a hurry progresses by means of comparatively slow measured wingbeats and looks as if swimming rather than flying  it is when the gathered birds all finally settle on a tree that they are most to be admired they will sometimes remain on the spot for half an hour or longer displaying their graces and emitting the extraordinary medley of noises mixed with musical sounds but they do not often sit still at such times if there are many birds and the excitement is great some of them are perpetually moving jumping and flitting from branch to branch and springing into the air to wheel round or pass over the tree all apparently intent on showing off their various coloursvinaceous brown sky blue velvet black and glistening whiteto the best advantage  again and again when watching these gatherings at savernake and at other places where jays abound i have been reminded of the description given by alfred russel wallace of the bird of paradise assemblies in the malayan region our jay in some ways resembles his glorious eastern relation and although his lustre is so much less he is at his very best not altogether unworthy of being called the british bird of paradise     chapter v  a wood wren at wells   east of wells cathedral close to the moat surrounding the bishops palace there is a beautifully wooded spot a steep slope where the birds had their headquarters there was much to attract them there sheltered by the hill behind it was a warm corner a wooded angle protected by high old stone walls dear to the redstart masses of ivy and thickets of evergreens while outside the walls were green meadows and running water when going out for a walk i always passed through this wood lingering a little in it and when i wanted to smoke a pipe or have a lazy hour to myself among the trees or sitting in the sun i almost invariably made for this favourite spot at different hours of the day i was a visitor and there i heard the first spring migrants on their arrivalchiffchaff willow wren cuckoo redstart blackcap whitethroat then when april was drawing to an end i said there are no more to come for the wryneck lesser whitethroat and garden warbler had failed to appear and the few nightingales that visit the neighbourhood had settled down in a more secluded spot a couple of miles away where the million leaves in coppice and brake were not set atremble by the melodious thunder of the cathedral chimes  nevertheless there was another still to come the one i perhaps love best of all on the last day of april i heard the song of the wood wren and at once all the other notes ceased for a while to interest me even the last comer the mellow blackcap might have been singing at that spot since february like the wren and hedgesparrow so familiar and workaday a strain did it seem to have compared with this late warbler i was more than glad to welcome him to that particular spot where if he chose to stay i should have him so near me  it is well known that the wood wren can only be properly seen immediately after his arrival in this country at the end of april or early in may when the young foliage does not so completely hide his slight unresting form as is the case afterwards for he too is green in colour like wordsworths green linnet     a brother of the leaves he seems  there is another reason why he can be seen so much better during the first days of his sojourn with us he does not then keep to the higher parts of the tall trees he frequents as his habit is later when the air is warm and the minute winged insects on which he feeds are abundant on the upper suntouched foliage of the high oaks and beeches on account of that ambitious habit of the wood wren there is no bird with us so difficult to observe you may spend hours at a spot where his voice sounds from the trees at intervals of half a minute to a minute without once getting a glimpse of his form at the end of april the trees are still very thinly clad the upper foliage is but an airy garment a slight goldengreen mist through which the sun shines lighting up the dim interior and making the bed of old fallen beechleaves look like a floor of red gold the smallwinged insects sunloving and sensitive to cold then hold their revels near the surface and the bird too prefers the neighbourhood of the earth it was so in the case of the wood wren i observed at wells watching him on several consecutive days sometimes for an hour or two at a stretch and generally more than once a day the spot where he was always to be found was quite free from underwood and the trees were straight and tall most of them with slender smooth boles standing there my figure must have looked very conspicuous to all the small birds in the place but for a time it seemed to me that the wood wren paid not the slightest attention to my presence that as he wandered hither and thither in sunlight and shade at his own sweet will my motionless form was no more to him than a mossgrown stump or grey upright stone by and by it became apparent that the bird knew me to be no stump or stone but a strange living creature whose appearance greatly interested him for invariably soon after i had taken up my position his careless little flights from twig to twig and from tree to tree brought him nearer and then nearer and finally near me he would remain for most of the time sometimes he would wander for a distance of forty or fifty yards away but before long he would wander back and be with me once more often perching so near that the most delicate shadings of his plumage were as distinctly seen as if i had had him perched on my hand  the human form seen in an unaccustomed place always excites a good deal of attention among the birds it awakes their curiosity suspicion and alarm the wood wren was probably curious and nothing more his keeping near me looked strange only because he at the same time appeared so wholly absorbed in his own music two or three times i tried the experiment of walking to a distance of fifty or sixty yards and taking up a new position but always after a while he would drift thither and i would have him near me singing and moving as before  i was glad of this inquisitiveness if that was the birds motive that i had unconsciously fascinated him i could not believe for of all the wood wrens i have seen this seemed the most beautiful most graceful in his motions and untiring in song doubtless this was because i saw him so closely and for such long intervals his fresh yellowishgreen upper and white under plumage gave him a wonderfully delicate appearance and these colours harmonised with the tender greens of the opening leaves and the pale greys and silvery whites of the slender boles  seebohm says of this species they arrive in our woods in marvellously perfect plumage in the early morning sun they look almost as delicate a yellowishgreen as the halfgrown leaves amongst which they disport themselves in the hand the delicate shading of the eyestripe and the margin of the feathers of the wings and tail is exquisitely beautiful but is almost all lost under the rude handling of the birdskinner  the concluding words sound almost strange but it is a fact that this sylphlike creature is sometimes shattered with shot and its poor remains operated on by the birdstuffer its beauty in the hand cannot compare with that exhibited when it lives and moves and sings its appearance during flight differs from that of other warblers on account of the greater length and sharpness of the wings most warblers fly and sing hurriedly the wood wrens motions like its song are slower more leisurely and more beautiful when moved by the singing passion it is seldom still for more than a few moments at a time but is continually passing from branch to branch from tree to tree finding a fresh perch from which to deliver its song on each occasion at such times it has the appearance of a delicately coloured miniature kestrel or hobby most lovely is its appearance when it begins to sing in the air for then the long sharp wings beat time to the first clear measured notes the prelude to the song as a rule however the flight is silent and the song begins when the new perch is reachedfirst the distinct notes that are like musical strokes and fall faster and faster until they run and swell into a long passionate trillthe woodland sound which is like no other  charming a creature as the wood wren appears when thus viewed closely in the early springtime he is not my favourite among small birds because of his beauty of shape and colour and graceful motions which are seen only for a short time but on account of his song which lasts until september though i may not find it very easy to give a reason for the preference  it comforts me a little in this inquiry to remember that wordsworth preferred the stockdove to the nightingalethat creature of ebullient heart the poet was a little shaky in his ornithology at times but if we take it that he meant the ringdove his preference might still seem strange to some perhaps it is not so very strange after all  if we take any one of the various qualities which we have agreed to consider highest in birdmusic we find that the wood wren compares badly with his fellowvocaliststhat measured by this standard he is a very inferior singer thus in variety he cannot compare with the thrush gardenwarbler sedgewarbler and others in brilliance and purity of sound with the nightingale blackcap etc in strength and joyousness with the skylark in mellowness with the blackbird in sprightliness with the goldfinch and chaffinch in sweetness with the woodlark treepipit reedwarbler the chats and wagtails and so on to the end of all the qualities which we regard as important what then is the charm of the wood wrens song the sound is unlike any other but that is nothing since the same can be said of the wryneck and cuckoo and grasshopper warbler to many persons the wood wrens note is a birdsound and nothing more and it may even surprise them to hear it called a song indeed some ornithologists have said that it is not a song but a call or cry and it has also been described as harsh  i here recall a lady who sat next to me on the coach that took me from minehead to lynton the lady resided at lynton and finding that i was visiting the place for the first time she proceeded to describe its attractions with fluent enthusiasm when we arrived at the town and were moving very slowly into it my companion turned and examined my face waiting to hear the expressions of rapturous admiration that would fall from my lips said i there is one thing you can boast of in lynton so far as i know it is the only town in the country where sitting in your own room with the windows open you can listen to the song of the wood wren her face fell she had never heard of the wood wren and when i pointed to the tree from which the sound came and she listened and heard she turned away evidently too disgusted to say anything she had been wasting her eloquence on an unworthy subjectone who was without appreciation for the sublime and beautiful in nature the wild romantic lynn tumbling with noise and foam over its rough stony bed the vast wooded hills the piledup black rocks covered in places with beautiful red and blue lettered advertisements had been passed by in silencenothing had stirred me but the chirping of a miserable little bird which for all that she knew or cared might be a sparrow when we got down from the coach a couple of minutes later she walked away without even saying goodbye  there is no doubt that very many persons know and care as little about bird voices as this lady but how about the others who do know and care a good dealwhat do they think and feel about the song of the wood wren i know two or three persons who are as fond of the bird as i am and two or three recent writers on bird life have spoken of its song as if they loved it the ornithologists have in most cases been satisfied to quote gilbert whites description of letter xix this last haunts only the tops of trees in high beechen woods and makes a sibilous grasshopperlike noise now and then at short intervals shaking a little with its wings when it sings  white was a little more appreciative in the case of the willow wren when he spoke of its joyous easy laughing note yet the willow wren has had to wait a long time to be recognised as one of our best vocalists some years ago it was greatly praised by john burroughs who came over from america to hear the british songsters his thoughts running chiefly on the nightingale blackcap throstle and blackbird and he was astonished to find that this unfamed warbler about which the ornithologists had said little and the poets nothing was one of the most delightful vocalists and had a delicious warble he waxed indignant at our neglect of such a singer and cried out that it had too fine a song to please the british ear that a louder coarser voice was needed to come up to john bulls standard of a good song no one who loves a hearty laugh can feel hurt at his manner of expressing himself so characteristic of an american nevertheless the fact remains that only since burroughs appreciation of the british songbirds first appeared several years ago the willow wren which he found languishing in obscurity has had many to praise it at all events the merits of its song are now much more freely acknowledged than they were formerly  perhaps the wood wrens turn will come by and by he is still an obscure bird little known or not known to most people we are more influenced by what the old writers have said than we know or like to believe our preferences have mostly been made for us the species which they praised and made famous have kept their places in popular esteem while other species equally charming which they did not know or said nothing about are still but little regarded it is hardly to be doubted that the wood wren would have been thought more of if willughby the father of british ornithology had known it and expressed a high opinion of its song or that it would have had millions to admire it if chaucer or shakespeare had singled it out for a few words of praise  it is also probably the fact that those who are not students or close observers of bird life seldom know more than a very few of the most common species and that when they hear a note that pleases them they set it down to one of the halfdozen or three or four songsters whose names they remember i met with an amusing instance of this common mistake at a spot in the west of england where i visited a castle on a hill and was shown over the beautiful but steep grounds by a stout old dame whose breath and temper were alike short it was a bright morning in may and the birds were in full song as we walked through the shrubbery a blackcap burst into a torrent of wild heartenlivening melody from amidst the foliage not more than three yards away how well that blackcap sings i remarked that blackbird she corrected yes it sings well she stuck to it that it was a blackbird and to prove that i was wrong assured me that there were no blackcaps there finding that i refused to acknowledge myself in error she got cross and dropped into sullen silence but ten or fifteen minutes later she returned of her own accord to the subject ive been thinking sir she said that you must be right i said there are no blackcaps here because ive been told so but all the same ive often remarked that the blackbird has two different songs now i know but im so sorry that i didnt know a few days sooner i asked her why she replied the other day a young american lady came to the castle and i took her over the grounds the birds were singing the same as today and the young lady said now i want you to tell me which is the blackcaps song just think she said what a distance i have come from america well when i was bidding goodbye to my friends at home i said dont you envy me im going to old england to hear the blackcaps song well when i told her we had no blackcaps she was so disappointed and yet sir if what you say is right the bird was singing near us all the time  poor young lady from america i should have liked to know whose written words first fired her brain with desire of the blackcaps songa golden voice in imaginations ear while the finest home voices were merely silvern i think of my own case how in boyhood this same bird first warbled to me in some lines of a poem i read and how long years afterwards i first heard the real songbeautiful but how unlike the song i had imaginedone bright evening in early may at netley abbey but the poets name had meanwhile slipped out of memory nothing but a vague impression remained and still persists that he flourished and had great fame about the beginning of the nineteenth century and that now his or her fame and works are covered with oblivion  to return to the subject of this paper the wood wrenthe secret of its charm we see that tried by ordinary standards many other singers are its superiors what then is the mysterious something in its music that makes it to some of us even better than the best speaking for myself i should say because it is more harmonious or in more perfect accord with the nature amid which it is heard it is the truer woodland voice  the chaffinch as a rule sings in open woods and orchards and groves when there is light and life and movement but sometimes in the heart of a deep wood the silence is broken by its sudden loud lyric it is unexpected and sounds unfamiliar in such a scene the wonderfully joyous ringing notes are like a sudden flood of sunshine in a shady place the sound is intensely distinct and individual in sharp contrast to the low forest tones its effect on the ear is similar to that produced on the sight by a vivid contrast in colours as by a splendid scarlet or shining yellow flower blooming solitary where all else is green the effect produced by the wood wren is totally different the strain does not contrast with but is complementary to the tremulous cadence low of inanimate nature in the high woods of windswayed branches and pattering of rain and lisping and murmuring of innumerable leavesthe elemental sounds out of which it has been fashioned in a sense it may be called a trivial and a monotonous songthe strain that is like a long tremulous cry repeated again and again without variation but it is really beyond criticismone would have to begin by depreciating the music of the wind it is a voice of the beechen woods in summer of the farup cloud of green translucent leaves with open spaces full of green shifting sunlight and shadow though resonant and farreaching it does not strike you as loud but rather as the diffused sound of the wind in the foliage concentrated and made cleara voice that has light and shade rising and passing like the wind changing as it flows and quivering like a windfluttered leaf it is on account of this harmony that it is not trivial and that the ear never grows tired of listening to it sooner would it tire of the nightingaleits purest most brilliant tone and most perfect artistry  the continuous singing of a skylark at a vast height above the green billowy sun and shadowswept earth is an etherealised sound which fills the blue space fills it and falls and is part of that visible nature above us as if the blue sky the floating clouds the wind and sunshine has something for the hearing as well as for the sight and as the lark in its soaring song is of the sky so the wood wren is of the wood     chapter vi  the secret of the willow wren   the willow wren is one of the commonest and undoubtedly the most generally diffused of the british songsters a summer visitor one of the earliest to arrive usually appearing on the south coast in the last week in march a little later he may be met with in very nearly every wood thicket hedge common marsh orchard and large garden throughout the kingdomit is hard to say writes seebohm where he is not found wherever there are green perchingplaces and small caterpillars flies and aphides to feed upon there you will see and hear the willow wren he is a sweet and constant singer from the date of his arrival until about the middle of june when he becomes silent for a season resuming his song in july and continuing it throughout august and even into september this late summer singing is however fitful and weak and less joyous in character than in the spring but in spite of his abundance and universality and the charm of his little melody he is not familiarly known to the people generally as they know the robin redbreast pied wagtail dunnock redstart wheatear and stonechat the name we call him by is a very old one it was first used in english by ray in his translation of willughbys ornithology about three centuries ago but it still remains a bookname unknown to the rustic nor has this common little bird any widely known vernacular name if by chance you find a countryman who knows the bird and has a name for it this will be one which is applied indiscriminately to two three or four species the willow wren in fact is one of those little birds that are seen rather than distinguished on account of its small size modest colouring and its close resemblance to other species of warblers also on account of the quiet gentle character of its song which is little noticed in the spring and summer concert of loud familiar voices  one day in london during the late summer i was amused and at the same time a little disgusted at this general indifference to the delicate beauty in a birdsound which distinguishes the willow wren even among such delicate singers as the warblers it struck me as a kind of æsthetic hardness of hearing i heard the song in the flower walk in kensington gardens on a sunday morning and sat down to listen to it and for half an hour the bird continued to repeat his song two or three times a minute on the trees and bushes within half a dozen yards of my seat just after i had sat down a throstle perched on the topmost bough of a thorn that projected over the walk began his song and continued it a long time heedless of the people passing below now i noticed that in almost every case the person approaching lifted his eyes to the bird above apparently admiring the music sometimes even pausing for a moment in his walk and that when two or three came together they not only looked up but made some remark about the beauty of the song but from first to last not one of all the passersby cast a look towards the tree where the willow wren was singing nor was there anything to show that the sound had any attraction for them although they must have heard it the loudness of the thrush prevented them from giving it any attention and made it practically inaudible it was like a pimpernel blossoming by the side of a poppy or dahlia or peony where even if seen it would not be noticed as a beautiful flower  in the chapter on the wood wren i endeavoured to trace to its source the pleasurable feelings which the song of that bird produces in me and in many othersa charm exceeding that of many more celebrated vocalists in that chapter the song of the willow wren was mentioned incidentally now these twowood wren and willow wrenalbeit nearly related are in the character of their notes as widely different as it is possible for two songsters to be and when we listen attentively to both we recognise that the feeling produced in us differs in each casethat it has a different cause in the case of the willow wren it might be said offhand that our pleasure is simply due to the fact that it is a melodious sound associated in our minds with summer scenes as much could be said of any other migrants songnightingale treepipit blackcap garden warbler swallow and a dozen more but it does not explain the individual and very special charm of this particular birdwhat i have ventured to call the secret of the willow wren after all it is not a deeply hidden secret and has indeed been half guessed or hinted by various writers on bird melody and as it also happens to be the secret of other singers besides the willow wren we may i think find in it an explanation of the fact that the best singers do not invariably please us so well as some that are considered inferior  the song of the willow wren has been called singular and unique among our birds and mr warde fowler who has best described it says that it forms an almost perfect cadence and adds by which i mean that it descends gradually not of course on the notes of our musical scale by which no birds in their natural state would deign to be fettered but through fractions of one or perhaps two of our tones and without returning upward at the end now this arrangement of its notes although very rare and beautiful does not give the little song its highest æsthetic value the secret of the charm i imagine is traceable to the fact that there is distinctly something humanlike in the quality of the voice its timbre many years ago an observer of wild birds and listener to their songs came to this country and walking one day in a london suburb he heard a small bird singing among the trees the trees were in an enclosure and he could not see the bird but there would he thought be no difficulty in ascertaining the species since it would only be necessary to describe its peculiar little song to his friends and they would tell him accordingly on his return to the house he proceeded to describe the song and ask the name of the singer no one could tell him and much to his surprise his account of the melody was received with smiles of amusement and incredulity he described it as a song that was like a wonderfully bright and delicate human voice talking or laughingly saying something rather than singing it was not until some time afterwards that the birdlover in a strange land discovered that his little talker and laugher among the leaves was the willow wren in vain he had turned to the ornithological works the song he had heard or at all events the song as he had heard it was not described therein and yet to this day he cannot hear it differentlycannot dissociate the sound from the idea of a fairylike child with an exquisitely pure bright spiritual voice laughingly speaking in some green place  and yet gilbert white over a century ago had noted the human quality in the willow wrens voice when he described it as an easy joyous laughing note it is still better to be able to quote mr warde fowler when writing in a year with the birds on the futile attempts which are often made to represent birds songs by means of our notation since birds are guided in their songs by no regular succession of intervals speaking of the willow wren in this connection he adds strange as it may seem the songs of birds may perhaps be more justly compared with the human voice when speaking than with a musical instrument or with the human voice when singing the truth of this observation must strike any person who will pay close attention to the singing of birds but there are two criticisms to be made on it one is that the resemblance of a birds song to a human voice when speaking is confined to some or to a few species the second is that it is a mistake to think as mr fowler appears to do that the resemblance is wholly or mainly due to the fact that the birds voice is free when singingthat like the human voice in talking it is not tied to tones and semitones for instance we note this peculiarity in the willow wren but not in say the wren and chaffinch although the songs of these two are just as free just as independent of regular intervals as our voices when speaking and laughing the resemblance in a birds song to human speech is entirely due to the humanlike quality in the voice for we find that other songstersnotably the swallowhave a charm similar to that of the willow wren although the notes of the former bird are differently arranged and do not form anything like a cadence again take the case of the blackbird we are accustomed to describe the blackbirds voice as flutelike and the flute is one of the instruments which most nearly resemble the human voice now on account of the leisurely manner in which the blackbird gives out his notes the resemblance to human speech is not so pronounced as in the case of the willow wren or swallow but when two or three or half a dozen blackbirds are heard singing close together as we sometimes hear them in woods and orchards where they are abundant the effect is singularly beautiful and gives the idea of a conversation being carried on by a set of human beings of arboreal habits not monkeys with glorified voices listening to these blackbird concerts i have sometimes wondered whether or not they produced the same effect on others ears as on mine as of people talking to one another in highpitched and beautiful tones oddly enough it was only while writing this chapter that i by chance found an affirmative answer to my question glancing through leslies riverside letters which i had not previously seen i came upon the following remarks quoted from sir george grove in a letter to the author on the blackbirds singing he selects a spot where he is within hearing of a comrade and then he begins quite at leisure not all in a hurry like the thrush a regular conversation and how are you isnt this a fine day let us have a nice talk etc etc he is answered in the same strain and then replies and so on nothing more thoughtful more refined more feeling can be conceived in another passage he writes i love them the robins but they fill a much smaller part than the blackbird does in my heart to hear the blackbird talking to his mate a field off with deliberate refined conversation the very acme of grace and courtesy is perfectly splendid  there are two more common british songsters that produce much the same effect as the willow wren and blackbird these are the swallow and pied wagtail they are not in the first rank as melodists and i can find no explanation of the fact that they please me better than the great singers other than their more humanlike tones which to my hearing have something of an exceedingly beautiful contralto sound the swallows song is familiar to every one but that of the wagtail is not well known the bird has two distinct songs one heard oftenest in early spring consists of a low rambling warble with some resemblance to the whinchats song it is the second song heard occasionally until late june frequently uttered on the winga torrent of loud rapidly uttered and somewhat swallowlike notesthat comes nearest in tone to the human voice and has the greatest charm  after these we find other songsters with one or two notes or a phrase humanlike in quality in their songs of these i will only mention the blackcap linnet and treepipit the most beautiful of the blackcaps notes which come nearest to the blackbird have this human sound and certainly the most beautiful part of the linnets song is the opening phrase composed of notes that are both swallowlike and humanlike  it may appear strange to some readers that i put the treepipit with his thin shrill canarylike pipe in this list but his notes are not all of this character he is moreover a most variable singer and it happens that in some individuals the concluding notes of the song have more of that peculiar human quality than any other british songster no doubt it was a bird in which these humanlike languishing notes at the close of the song were very full and beautiful that inspired burns to write his address to a woodlark the tree pipit is often called by that name in scotland where the true woodlark is not found     o stay sweet warbling woodlark stay    nor quit for me the trembling spray    a hopeless lover courts thy lay        thy soothing fond complaining     again again that tender part    that i may catch thy melting art    for surely that would touch her heart        who kills me wi disdaining     say was thy little mate unkind    and heard thee as the passing wind    o nocht but love and sorrow joined        sic notes o wae could waken     thou tells o neverceasing care    o speechless grief and dark despair    for pitys sake sweet bird nae mair        or my poor heart is broken  much more could be said about these and other species in the passerine order that have some resemblance distinct or faint to the human voice in their singing notesan echo as it were of our own common emotions in most cases simply glad or joyous but sometimes as in the case of the treepipit of another character and even those species that are furthest removed from us in the character of the sounds they emit have some notes that suggest a highly brightened human voice witness the throstle and nightingale the last approaches to the human voice in that rich musical throb repeated many times with passion which is the invariable prelude to his song and again in that one low piping note more sweet than all four times repeated in a wonderfully beautiful crescendo who that ever listened to carlotta patti does not remember sounds like these from her lips it was commonly said of her that her voice was birdlike certainly it was clarified and brightened beyond other voicesin some of her notes almost beyond recognition as a human voice it was a voice that had a great deal of the quality of gladness in it but less depth of human passion than other great singers still it was a human voice and just as carlotta patti outshining the best of her sistersingers even as the diamond outsparkles all other gems rose to the birds in her miraculous flights so do some of the birds come down to and resemble us in their songs  if i am right in thinking that it is the human note in the voices of some passerine birds that gives a peculiar and very great charm to their songs so that an inferior singer shall please us more than one that ranks high according to the accepted standard it remains to ask why it should be so why i mean should the mere likeness to a human tone in a little singingbird impart so great a pleasure to the mind when the undoubtedly humanlike voices of many nonpasserine species do not as a rule affect us in the same way as a matter of fact we find in the multitude of species that resemble us in their voices a few outside of the order of singers that do give us a pleasure similar to that imparted by the willow wren swallow and treepipit thus among british birds we have the woodpigeon and the stockdove the green woodpecker with his laughlike cry the cuckoo a universal favourite on account of his double fluty call and to those who are not inclined to be superstitious the woodowl a most musical nightsinger and the curlew with in a less degree various other shore birds but in a majority of the larger birds of all orders the effect produced is different and often the reverse of pleasant or if such sounds delight us the feeling differs in character from that produced by the melodious singer and is mainly due to that wildness with which we are in sympathy expressed by such sounds humanlike voices are found among the auks loons and grebes eagles and falcons cuckoos pigeons goatsuckers owls crows rails ducks waders and gallinaceous birds the cries and shrieks of some among these particularly when heard in the dark hours in deep woods and marshes and other solitary places profoundly impress and even startle the mind and have given rise all the world over to numberless superstitious beliefs such sounds are supposed to proceed from devils or from demons inhabiting woods and waters and all desert places from nightwandering witches spirits sent to prophesy death or disaster ghosts of dead men and women wandering by night about the world in search of a way out of it and sometimes human beings who burdened with dreadful crimes or irremediable griefs have been changed into birds the three british species best known on account of their supernatural character have very remarkable voices with a human sound in them the raven with his angry barking cry and deep solemn croak the booming bittern and the white or church owl with his funereal screech  it is i think plain that the various sensations excited in us by the cries moans screams and the more or less musical notes of different species are due to the human emotions which they express or seem to express if the voice simulates that of a maniac or of a being tortured in body or mind or overcome with grief or maddened with terror the bloodcurdling and other sensations proper to the occasion will be experienced only if we are familiar with the sound or know its cause the sensation will be weak similarly if in some deep silent wood we are suddenly startled by a loud human whistle or shouted hi although we may know that a bird somewhere in that waste of foliage around us uttered the shout we yet cannot help experiencing the feelingsa combination of curiosity amusement and irritationwhich we should have if some friend or some human being had hailed us while purposely keeping out of sight finally if the birdsounds resemble refined bright and highly musical human voices the voices let us say of young girls in conversation expressive of various beautiful qualitiessympathy tenderness innocent mirth and overflowing gladness of heartthe effect will be in the highest degree delightful  herbert spencer in his account of the origin of our love of music in his psychology writes while the tones of anger and authority are harsh and coarse the tones of sympathy and refinement are relatively gentle and of agreeable timbre that is to say the timbre is associated in experience with the receipt of gratification has acquired a pleasuregiving quality and consequently the tones which in music have an allied timbre become pleasuregiving and are called beautiful not that this is the sole cause of their pleasuregiving quality still in recalling the tones of instruments which approach the tones of the human voice and observing that they seem beautiful in proportion to their approach we see that this secondary æsthetic element is important  as with instruments so it is with bird voices in proportion as they approach the tones of the human voice expressive of sympathy refinement and other beautiful qualities they will seem beautifulin some cases even more beautiful than those which however high they may rank in other ways are yet without this secondary æsthetic element     chapter vii  secret of the charm of flowers   when my mind was occupied with the subject of the last chapterthe human quality in some sweet bird voicesit struck me forcibly that all resemblances to man in the animal and vegetable worlds and in inanimate nature enter largely into and strongly colour our æsthetic feelings we have but to listen to the human tones in wind and water and in animal voices and to recognise the human shape in plant and rock and cloud and in the round heads of certain mammals like the seal and the human expression in the eyes and faces generally of many mammals birds and reptiles to know that these casual resemblances are a great deal to us they constitute the expression of numberless natural sights and sounds with which we are familiar although in a majority of cases the resemblance being but slight and to some one quality only we are not conscious of the cause of the expression  it was principally with flowers which excite more attention and give more pleasure than most natural objects that my mind was occupied in this connection for here it seemed to me that the effect was similar to that produced on the mind by sweet humanlike tones in bird music in other words a very great if not the principal charm of the flower was to be traced to the human associations of its colouring and this was in some cases more than all its other attractions including beauty of form purity and brilliance of colour and the harmonious arrangement of colours and finally fragrance where such a quality existed  we see then that there is an intimate connection between the two subjectshuman associations in the colouring of flowers and in the voices of birds and that in both cases this association constitutes or is a principal element in the expression this connection and the fact that the present subject was suggested and appeared almost an inevitable outcome of the one last discussed must be my excuse for introducing a chapter on flowers in a book on birdsor birds and man but an excuse is hardly needed it must strike most readers that a great fault of books on birds is that there is too much about birds in them consequently that a chapter about something else which has not exactly been dragged in may come as a positive relief  as the word expression which occurs with frequency in this chapter was not understood in the sense in which i used it on the first appearance of the book it may be well to explain that it is not used here in its ordinary meaning as the quality in a face or picture or any work of art which indicates thought or feeling here the word has the meaning given to it by writers on the æsthetic sense as descriptive of the quality imparted to an object by its associations these may be untraceable we may not be conscious and as a rule we are not conscious that any such associations exist nevertheless they are in us all the time and with what they add to an object may enhance and even double its intrinsic beauty and charm                                       i have somewhere read a very ancient legend which tells that man was originally made of many materials and that at the last a bunch of wild flowers was gathered and thrown into the mixture to give colour to his eyes it is a pretty story but might have been better told since it is certain that flowers which have delicate and beautiful fleshtints are attractive mainly on that account just as blue and some purples delight us chiefly because of their associations with the human iris the skin too needed some beautiful colour and there were red as well as blue flowers in the bunch and the red flowers being most abundant in nature and in greater variety of tints give us altogether more pleasure than their beautiful rivals in our affection  the blue flower is associated consciously or not with the human blue eye and as the floral blue is in all or nearly all instances pure and beautiful it is like the most beautiful human eye this association and not the colour itself strikes me as the true cause of the superior attraction which the blue flower has for most of us apart from association blue is less attractive than red orange and yellow because less luminous furthermore green is the least effective background for such a colour as blue in so small an object as a flower and as a fact we see that at a little distance the blue of the flower is absorbed and disappears in the surrounding green while reds and yellows keep their splendour nevertheless the blue has a stronger hold on our affections as a human colour blue comes first in a blueeyed race because it is the colour of the most important feature and we may say of the very soul in man  some purple flowers stand next in our regard on account of their nearness in colour to the pure blue the wild hyacinth bluebottle violet and pansy and some others will occur to every one these are the purple flowers in which blue predominates and on that account have the same expression as the blue the purples in which red predominates are akin in expression to the reds and are associated with fleshtints and blood and here it may be noted that the blue and bluepurple flowers which have the greatest charm for us are those in which not only the colour of the eye but some resemblance in their form to the iris with its central spot representing the pupil appears for example the flax borage blue geranium periwinkle forgetmenot speedwell pansy and blue pimpernel are actually more to us than some larger and handsomer blue flowers such as the bluebottle vipers bugloss and succory and of blue flowers seen in masses  with regard to the numerous blue and purpleblue flowers which we all admire or rather for which we all feel so great an affection we find that in many cases their very names have been suggested by their human associationsby their expression  loveinamist angels eyes forgetmenot and heartsease are familiar examples heartsease and pansy both strike us as peculiarly appropriate to one of our commonest and most universal garden flowers yet we see something besides the sympathetic and restful expression which suggested these names in this flowera certain suggestion of demureness in fact reminding those who have seen guidos picture of the adoration of the virgin of one of his loveliest angels whose angelical eyes and face reveal some desire for admiration and love in the spectator and that expression too of the pansy named loveinidleness has been described coarsely or rudely it may be in some of its country names kiss me behind the garden gate and better or worse still meetherithentrykissherithbuttery of this order of names are nonesopretty and pretty maids pretty betsy kissmequick even such a name as tears of the blood of christ does not sound extravagantly fanciful or startling when we look at the glowing deep golden crimson of the wall flower nor of a blue flower the germander speedwell such names as the more i see you the more i love you and angels tears and tears of christ with many more  a writer on our wild flowers in speaking of their vernacular names of this kind has said could we penetrate to the original suggestive idea that called forth its name it would bring valuable information about the first openings of the human mind towards nature and the merest dream of such a discovery invests with a strange charm the words that could tell if we could understand so much of the forgotten infancy of the human race  what a roll of words and what a mighty and mysterious business is here made of a very simple little matter it is a charming example of the strange helplessness not to say imbecility which affects most of those who have been trained in our mindkilling schools trained not to think but taught to go for anything and everything they desire to know to the books if the books in the british museum fail to say why our ancestors hundreds of years ago named a flower nonesopretty or loveinamist why then we must be satisfied to sit in thick darkness with regard to this matter until some heavenborn genius descends to illuminate us yet i daresay there is not a country child who does not occasionally invent a name for some plant or creature which has attracted his attention and in many cases the childs new name is suggested by some human association in the objectsome resemblance to be seen in form or colour or sound not books but the light of nature the experience of our own early years the look which no person not blinded by reading can fail to see in a flower is sufficient to reveal all this hidden wonderful knowledge about the first openings of the heart towards nature during the remote infancy of the human race  from this it will be seen that i am not claiming a discovery that what i have called a secret of the charm of flowers is a secret known to every man woman and child even to those of my own friends who stoutly deny that they have any such knowledge but i think it is best known to children what i am here doing is merely to bring together and put in form certain more or less vague thoughts and feelings which i and therefore all of us have about flowers and it is a small matter but it happens to be one which no person has hitherto attempted  it may be that in some of my readers mindsthose who like the sceptical friends i have mentioned are not distinctly conscious of the cause or secret of the expression of a flowersome doubt may still remain after what has been said of the blue and purpleblue blossom such a doubt ought to disappear when the reds are considered and when it is found that the expression peculiar to red flowers varies infinitely in degree and is always greatest in those shades of the colour which come nearest to the most beautiful fleshtints  when i say beautiful fleshtints i am thinking of the æsthetic pleasure which we receive from the expression the associations of the red flower the expression which delights is in the soft and delicate shades and in the texture which is sometimes like the beautiful soft skin but the expression would exist still in the case of floral tints resembling the unpleasant reds or the reds which disgust us in the human face and we most of us know that these distressing hues are to be seen in some flowers i remember that i once went into a florists shop and seeing a great mass of hard purplered cinerarias on a shelf i made some remark about them yes are they not beautiful said the woman in the shop no i loathe the sight of them i returned so do i she said very quickly and then added that she called them beautiful because she had to sell them she too had no doubt seen that same purplered colour in the evil flower called grogblossom and in the faces of many middleaged lovers of the bottle male and female who would perish before their time to the great relief of their kindred and whose actions after they were gone would not smell sweet and blossom in the dust  the reds we like best in flowers are the delicate roseate and pinky shades they are more to us than the purest and most luminous tints and here as with bird notes which delight us on account of their resemblance to fresh young highly musical human voices flowers please us best when they exhibit the loveliest human tintsthe apple blossom and the bindweed musk mallow and almond and wild rose for example after these we are most taken with the deeper but soft and not too luminous redsthe red which we admire in the red horsechestnut blossom and many other flowers down to the minute pimpernel next come the intense rosy reds seen in the herbrobert and other wild geraniums valerian red campion and ragged robin and this shade of red intensified but still soft is seen in the willowherb and foxglove and still more intensified in the bell and smallleafed heath some if not all of these pleasing reds have purple in them and there are very many distinctly purple flowers that appeal to us in the same way that red flowers do receiving their expression from the same cause there is some purple colour in most skins and even some blue     the azured harebell like thy veins  is a familiar verse from cymbeline any one can see the resemblance to the pale blue of that admired and loved blossom in the blue veins of any person with a delicate skin purples and purplish reds in masses are mostly seen in young persons of delicate skins and high colour in frosty weather in winter when the eyes sparkle and the face glows with the happy sensations natural to the young and healthy during and after outdoor exercise the skin purples and purplereds here described are beautiful and may be matched to a nicety in many flowers the human purple may be seen to name a very common wild flower in purple loosestrife and the large marsh mallow and in dozens and scores of other familiar purple flowers and the purplered hue in many richly coloured skins has its exact shade in common hounds tongue and in other dark and purplered flowers but we always find i fancy that the expression due to human association in a purple flower is greatest when this colour as in the human face is placed side by side or fades into some shade of red or pink i think we may see this even in a small flower like the fumitory in which one portion is deep purple and all the rest of the blossoms a delicate pink even when the red is very intense as in the common field poppy the pleasing expression of purple on red is very evident  to return to pure reds we may say that just as purples in flowers look best or have a greater degree of expression when appearing in or with reds so do the most delicate rose and pink shades appeal most to us when they appear as a tinge or blush on white flowers probably the flower that gives the most pleasure on account of its beautiful fleshtints of different shades is the gloire de dîjon rose so common with us and so universal a favourite roses being mostly of the garden are out of my line but they are certainly glorious to look atglorious because of their associations their expression whether we know it or not one can forgive thomas carew the conceit in his lines     ask me no more where jove bestows    when june is past the fading rose    for in your beautys orient deep    these flowers as in their causes sleep  but all reds have something human even the most luminous scarlets and crimsonsthe scarlet verbena the poppy our garden geraniums etcalthough in intensity they so greatly surpass the brightest colour of the lips and the most vivid blush on the cheek luminous reds are not however confined to lips and cheeks even the fingers when held up before the eyes to the sun or to firelight show a very delicate and beautiful red and this same brilliant floral hue is seen at times in the membrane of the ear it is in fact the colour of blood and that bright fluid which is the life and is often spilt comes very much into the human associations of flowers the persian poet whose name is best left unwritten since from hearing it too often most persons are now sick and tired of it has said     i sometimes think that never blooms so red    the rose as where some buried cæsar bled  there is many and many a plant of the blood of men our most common loveliesbleeding with its dropping wells of crimson serves to remind us that there are numberless vulgar names that express this resemblance and association the thought or fancy is found everywhere in poetic literature in the fables of antiquity in the tales and folklore of all nations civilised and barbarous  i think that we can more quickly recognise this human interest in a flower due to its colour and best appreciate its æsthetic value from this cause when we turn from the blues purples and reds to the whites and the yellows the feeling these last give us is distinctly different in character from that produced by the others they are not like us nor like any living sentient thing we are related to there is no kinship no human quality  when i say no kinship no human quality i refer to flowers that are entirely pure white or pure yellow in some dull or impure yellows and in white and yellow flowers that have some tinge or mixture of red or purple we do get the expression of the red and purple flower the crystalline and snow white of the whitest flowers do indeed resemble the white of the eyeballs and the teeth in human faces but we may see that this human white colour by itself has no human association in a flower  the whiteness of the white flower where there is any red is never unhuman probably because a very brilliant red or rose colour on some delicate skins causes the light fleshtints to appear white by contrast and is the complexion known as milk and roses the appleblossom is a beautiful example and the beloved daisythe wee modest crimsontipped flower which would be so much less dear but for that touch of human crimson this is the herbmargaret of so many tender and pretty legends that has white for purity and red for repentance even those who have never read these legends and that prettiest most pathetic of all which tells of the daisys origin find a secret charm in the flower among other common examples are the rosywhite hawthorn wood anemone bindweed dropwort and many others in the dropwort the rosy buds are seen among the creamy white open flowers and the expression is always very marked and beautiful when there is any red or purple tinge or blush on creamwhites and ivorywhites when we look from the dropwort to its nearest relative the common meadowsweet we see how great a charm the touch of rosered has given to the first the meadowsweet has no expression of the kind we are consideringno human association  in pure yellow flowers as in pure white human interest is wanting it is true that yellow is a human colour since in the hair we find yellows of different shadesit is a pity that we cannot find or have not found a better word than shades for the specific differences of a colour there is the socalled tow the tawny the bronze the simple yellow and the golden which includes many varieties and the hair called carroty but none of these has the flower yellow richard jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign by the side of a dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours werethat in fact no two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the yellow of the flower it is not necessary to set a lock of hair and any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues are the yellow of the hair is like that of metals of clay of stone and of various earthy substances and like the fur of some mammals and like xanthophyll in leaf and stalk and the yellow sometimes seen in clouds when ossian in his famous address to the sun speaks of his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds we instantly feel the truth as well as beauty of the simile we admire the yellow flower for the purity and brilliance of its colour just as we admire some bird notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound however unlike the human voice they may be we also admire it in many instances for the exquisite beauty of its form and the beauty of the contrast of pure yellow and deep green as in the yellow flag mimulus and numerous other plants but however much we may admire we do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and reds inspire in us in other words the yellow flower has not the expression which distinguishes those of other colours thus when tennyson speaks of the speedwells darling blue we know that he is rightthat he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of us but no poet would make so great so absurd a mistake as to describe the purest and loveliest yellow of the most prized and familiar wild flowerbuttercup or kingcup yellow flag sea poppy marsh marigold or broom or furze or rockrose let us sayby such a wordthe word that denotes an intimate and affectionate feelingthe feeling one cherishes for the loved ones of our kind nor could that word of tennyson be properly used of any pure white flowerthe stitchwort for instance nor of any white and yellow flower like the marguerite but no sooner do you get a touch of rose or crimson in the whitest flower as we see in the daisy and eyebright than you can say of it that it is a dear or a darling colour and no one can find fault with the expression  when we consider the dull and impure yellows sometimes seen in flowers and some soft yellows seen in combination with pleasing wholesome reds as in the honeysuckle we may find something of the expressionthe human associationin yellow flowers for there is yellow in the skin even in perfect health it appears strongest on the neck and spread round to the throat and chin and is a warm buff very beautiful in some women but very little of this tint appears in the face when a tinge of this warm buffy yellow and creamy yellow is seen mixed with warmer reds as in the gloire de dîjon rose the effect is most beautiful and the expression most marked but the expression in flowers of a pale dull impure yellow where there is an expression is unpleasant it is the yellow of unhealthy skins of faces discoloured by jaundice dyspepsia and other ailments we commonly say of such flowers that they are sickly in colour and the association is with sick and decaying humanity gerarde in describing such hues in flowers was fond of the word overworn and it was a very good word and like the one now in use is derived from the association  it will be noted by those who are acquainted with many flowers that i have given the names of but fewit may be too fewas examples and that these are nearly all of familiar wild flowers my reason for not going to the garden is that our cultivated blooms are not only artificially produced and in some degree monstrosities but they are seen in unnatural conditions in crowds and masses the various kinds too near together and in most cases selected on account of their gorgeous colouring the effect produced however delightful it may be in some ways is confusing to those simple natural feelings which flowers in a state of nature cause in us  i confess that gardens in most cases affect me disagreeably hence i avoid them and think and know little about garden flowers it is of course impossible not to go into gardens the large garden is the greatly valued annexe of the large house and is as much or more to the mistress than the coverts to the master and when i am asked to go into the garden to see and admire all that is there i cannot say madam i hate gardens on the contrary i must weakly comply and pretend to be pleased and when going the rounds of her paradise my eyes light by chance on a bed of tulips or scarlet geraniums or blue larkspurs or detested calceolarias or cinerariasa great patch of coloured flame springing out of a square or round bed of grassless brown desolate earththe effect is more than disagreeable the mass of colour glares at and takes possession of me and spreads itself over and blots out a hundred delicate and prized images of things seen that existed in the mind  but i am going too far and perhaps making an enemy of a reader when i would much prefer to have him or her for a friend  i have named few flowers and those all the most familiar kinds because it seemed to me that many examples would have had a confusing effect on readers who do not intimately know many species or do not remember the exact colour in each case and are therefore unable to reproduce in their minds the exact expressionthe feeling which every flower conveys on the other hand the reader who knows and loves flowers who has in his mind the distinct images of many scores perhaps of two or three hundreds of species can add to my example many more from his own memory  there is one objection to the explanation given here of the cause of the charm of certain flowers which will instantly occur to some readers and may as well be answered in advance this view or theory must be wrong a reader will perhaps say because my own preference is for a yellow flower the primrose or daffodil let us say which to me has a beauty and charm exceeding all other flowers  the obvious explanation of such a preference would be that the particular flower preferred is intimately associated with recollections of a happy childhood or of early life the associations will have made it a flower among flowers charged with a subtle magic so that the mere sight or smell of it calls up beautiful visions before the minds eye every person bred in a country place is affected in this way by certain natural objects and odours and i recall the case of cuvier who was always affected to tears by the sight of some common yellow flower the name of which i have forgotten  the way to test the theory is to take or think of two or three or halfadozen flowers that have no personal associations with ones own early lifethat are not like the primrose and daffodil in the foregoing instance sacred flowers unlike all others some with and some without human colouring and consider the feeling produced in each case on the mind if any one will look at say a gloire de dîjon rose in some persons its mental image will serve as well as the object itself and then at a perfect white chrysanthemum or lily or other beautiful white flower then at a perfect yellow chrysanthemum or an allamanda and at any exquisitely beautiful orchid that has no human colour in it which he may be acquainted with he will probably say i admire these chrysanthemums and other flowers more than the rose they are most perfect in their beautyi cannot imagine anything more beautiful but though the rose is less beautiful and splendid the admiration i have for it appears to differ somewhat in characterto be mixed with some new element which makes this flower actually more to me than the others  that something different and something more is the human association which this flower has for us in virtue of its colour and the new elementthe feeling it inspires which has something of tenderness and affection in itis one and the same with the feeling which we have for human beauty                                       the foregoing has been given here with a few alterations mainly verbal as it appeared originally something now remains to be added  when writing about the wild flowers of west cornwall in a work on the lands end 1908 i returned to the subject of the charm of flowers due to their human colouring and will repeat here much of what was there said  some of the readers of my flower chapter were not convinced that i had made out my case it came as a surprise to them and in some instances they cherished views of their own which they did not want to give up thus two of my critics writing independently expressed their belief that flowers are precious to us and seem more beautiful than they are because they are absolutely unrelated to our human life with its passions sorrows and tragediesbecause looking at flowers we are taken into or have glimpses of another and brighter world such as a disembodied spirit might find itself in it was nothing more than a pretty fancy but i had other more thoughtful critics and during my correspondence with them i became convinced of a serious omission in my account of the blue flower when i said that its expression was due to association with the blue eye in man the strongest of my friendly adversaries informed me that any man can revel at will among his own personal feelings and associations that these were a kind of bloom on the intrinsic beauty of thingsa happy phrase he then asks what does blue suggest to a sailor sometimes the sea sometimes the sky sometimes the blue peter but if you ask him what does blue paint suggest he would say mourning that being the colour of a ships mourning dr sutton always called blue no colour because it was the colour of death the sign of the withdrawal of life  this was interesting but fails as an argument since it was taken for granted in the chapter that blue in a flower or anything else and in fact any colour possesses individual associations for every one of us according to what we are to the temper of our minds to the conditions in which we exist our vocation our early life and so on blue may suggest sea and sky and the blue peter to a sailor and yet the blue flower have an expression due to its human association in him as in another  but my critic dropped by chance into something better when he went on to ask why shouldnt the heavens blue make us love flowers it does in my case i know and i can feel the different blues of skies and air and distance in flower blue  undoubtedly he was right the blue sky fair weather the open air was a suggestion of the blue flower it amazed me to think of the years i had spent under blue skies and of all i had felt about blue flowers without stumbling upon this very simple fact so simple so near to the surface that you no sooner hear it than you imagine you have always known it it was impossible to look at blue flowers and not be convinced of its truth especially when the flowers were spread over considerable areas as when i looked at wild hyacinths in the spring woods or followed the interminable blue band of the vernal squill on the west cornish coast or saw large arid tracts of land in suffolk blue with vipers bugloss  oddly enough just after the letter containing this criticism had reached me another correspondent who was also among my opponents sent me this fine passage from the old writer sir john ferne on azure in blazoning which blew colour representeth the aire amongst the elements that of all the rest is the greatest favourer of life as the only nurse and maintainer of spirits in any living creature the colour blew is commonly taken from the blue skye which appeareth so often as the tempests be overblowne and notes prosperous successe and good fortune to the wearer in all his affayres  in conclusion after having adopted this new idea my view is still that the human association is the principal factor in the expression of the blue flower or at all events in a majority of flowers that bloom more or less sparingly and are usually seen as single blooms not as mere splashes of colour such are the pansy violet speedwell hairbell lungwort blue geranium etc it may be that in all flowers of this kind too an element in the expression is due to the fairweather associations with the colour but these associations must be very much stronger in the case of a blue flower always seen in masses and sheets of colour as the wild hyacinth among darkeyed races the fairweather associations would alone give the blue flower its expression i shouldnt wonder if some explorer with a curious mind would try to find out what savages feel about flowers that he would discover in them a special regard for the blue flower     chapter viii  ravens in somerset   mr warde fowler in his summer studies of birds and books has a pleasant chapter on wagtails in which he remarks incidentally that he does not care for the big solemn birds that please or are dear to mr hudson their bigness disturbs and their solemnity oppresses him they do not twitter and warble and flit hither and thither flirting their feathers and with their dainty gracefulness and airy fairy ways wind themselves round his heart wagtails are quite big enough for him they are in fact as big as birds should be and so long as these charming little creatures abound in these islands he mr fowler will be content indeed he goes so far as to declare that on a desert island without a human creature to share its solitude with him he would be happy enough if only wagtails were there to keep him company mr fowler is not joking he tells us frankly what he thinks and feels and when we come to consider the matter seriously as he wishes us to do we discover that there is nothing astonishing in his confessionthat his mental attitude is capable of being explained it is only natural in an england from which most of the larger birds have been banished that he should have become absorbed in observing and in admiration of the small species that remain for we observe and study the life that is nearest to us and seeing it well we are impressed by its perfectionthe perfect correspondence that exists between the creature and its surroundingsby its beauty grace and other attractive qualities as we are not impressed by the life which is at a distance and of which we only obtain rare and partial glimpses  these thoughts passed through my mind one cold windy day in spring several hours of which i spent lying on the short grass on the summit of a cliff watching at intervals a pair of ravens that had their nest on a ledge of rock some distance below big and solemn and solemn and big they certainly were and although inferior in this respect to eagle pelican bustard crane vulture heron stork and many another feathered notable to see them was at the same time a pleasure and a relief it also occurred to me at the time that alone on a desert island i should be better off with ravens than wagtails for companions and this for an excellent reason the wagtail is no doubt a very lively pretty engaging creatureso for that matter is the house flybut between ourselves and the small birds there exists psychologically a vast gulf birds says matthew arnold live beside us but unknown and try how we will we can find no passages from our souls to theirs but to arnoldin the poem to which i have alluded at all eventsa bird simply meant a caged canary he was not thinking of the larger more mammallike and therefore more humanlike mind of the raven and it may be added of the crows generally  the pair i spent so long a time in watching were greatly disturbed at my presence on the cliff their anxiety was not strange seeing that their nest is annually plundered in the interest of the cursed collector as sir herbert maxwell has taught us to name the worst enemy of the rarer british birds the worst i say but there is another almost if not quite as bad and who in the case of some species is really worse at intervals of from fifteen to twenty minutes they would appear overhead uttering their angry deep croak and with wings outspread seemingly without an effort on their parts allow the wind to lift them higher and higher until they would look no bigger than daws and after dwelling for a couple of minutes on the air at that great height they would descend to the earth again to disappear behind a neighbouring cliff and on each occasion they exhibited that wonderful aërial feat characteristic of the raven and rare among birds of coming down in a series of long drops with closed wings i am inclined to think that a strong wind is necessary for the performance of this feat enabling the bird to fall obliquely and to arrest the fall at any moment by merely throwing out the wings at any rate it is a fact that i have never seen this method of descent used by the bird in calm weather it is totally different to the tumbling down as if wounded of ravens when two or more are seen toying with each other in the aira performance which is also practised by rooks and other species of the crow family the tumbling feat is indulged in only when the birds are playing and as it would appear solely for the fun of the thing the feat i am describing has a use as it enables the bird to come down from a great height in the air in the shortest time and with the least expenditure of force possible with the vertical fall of a bird like the gannet on its prey we are not concerned here but with the descent to earth of a bird soaring at a considerable height now many birds when rushing rapidly down appear to close their wings but they are never wholly closed in some cases they are carried as when folded but are slightly raised from the body in other cases the wing is tightly pressed against the side but the primaries stand out obliquely giving the descending bird the figure of a barbed arrowhead this may be seen in daws choughs pipits and many other species the raven suddenly closes his outspread wings just as a man might drop his arms to his sides and falls head downwards through the air like a stone bird cast down from its pedestal but he falls obliquely and after falling for a space of twenty or thirty or more feet he throws out his wings and floats for a few seconds on the air then falls again and then again until the earth is reached  let the reader imagine a series of invisible wires stretched wire above wire at a distance of thirty or forty yards apart to a height of six or seven hundred yards from the earth let him next imagine an acrobat infinitely more daring more agile and graceful in action than any performer he has ever seen standing on the highest wire of all in his black silk tights against the blue sky his arms outstretched then dropping his arms to his sides and diving through the air to the next wire then to the next and so on successively until he comes to the earth the feat would be similar only on a larger scale and less beautiful than that of the ravens as i witnessed it again and again from the cliff on that windy day  while watching this magnificent display it troubled me to think that this pair of ravens would probably not long survive to be an ornament to the coast their nest it has been stated is regularly robbed but i had been informed that in the summer of 1894 a third bird appeared and it was then conjectured that the pair had succeeded in rearing one of their young about a month later a raven was picked up dead on the coast by a boatmankilled it was believed by his fellowravensand since then two birds only have been seen there are only two more pair of ravens on the somersetshire coast and as one of these has made no attempt to breed of late we may take it that the raven population of this county where the species was formerly common has now been reduced to two pairs  anxious to find out if there was any desire in the place to preserve the birds i had been observing i made many inquiries in the neighbourhood and was told that the landlord cared nothing about them and that the tenants only desire was to see the last of them the tenant kept a large number of sheep and always feared one of his men told me that the ravens would attack and kill his lambs it was true that they had not done so as yet but they might kill a lamb at any time and besides there were the rabbitsthe place swarmed with themthere was no doubt that a young rabbit was taken occasionally  why then i asked if they were so destructive did not his master go out and shoot them at once the man looked grave and answered that his master would not do the killing himself but would be very glad to see it done by some other person  how curious it is to find that the old superstitions about the raven and the evil consequences of inflicting wilful injury on the bird still survive in spite of the fact that the species has been persecuted almost to extirpation  have you not read sir don quixote is made to say the annals and histories of england wherein are renowned and famous exploits of king arthur of whom there goes a tradition and a common one all over that kingdom of great britain that the king did not die but that by magic art he was transformed into a raven and that in process of time he shall reign again and recover his kingdom and sceptre for which reason it cannot be proved that from that day to this any englishman has killed a raven  now it is certain that many englishmen kill ravens also that if the country people in england ever had any knowledge of king arthur they have long forgotten it nevertheless this particular superstition still exists i have met with it in various places and found an instance of it only the other day in the midlands where the raven no longer breeds near broadway in worcestershire there is a farm called kites nest where a pair of ravens bred annually up to about twentyeight or thirty years ago when the young were taken and the nest pulled down by three young men from the village to this day it is related by some of the old people that the three young men all shortly came to bad ends near broadway an old farmer told me that since the birds had been driven away from kites nest he had not seen a raven in that part of the country until one made its appearance on his farm about four years ago he was out one day with his gun cautiously approaching a rabbit warren when the bird suddenly got up from the mouth of a burrow and coming straight to him hovered for some seconds above his head not more than thirty yards from him it looked as if he wanted to be shot at said the old man but hes no bird to be shot at by i twould be bad for i to hurt a raven and no mistake  continuing my inquiries about the somerset ravens i found a man who was anxious that they should be spared his real reason was that their eggs for him were golden eggs for he lived near the cliff and had an eye always on them and had been successful for many years in robbing their nest until he had at length come to look on these birds almost as his own property being his he loved them and was glad to talk about them to me by the hour among other things he related that the ravens had for very near neighbours on the rocks a pair of peregrine falcons and for several years there had always been peace between them at length one winter afternoon he heard loud angry cries and presently two birds appeared above the cliffa raven and a falconengaged in desperate battle and mounting higher and higher as they fought the raven he said did not croak but constantly uttered his harsh powerful barking cry while the falcon emitted shrill piercing cries that must have been audible two miles away at intervals as they rose wheeling round and round they struck at each other and becoming locked together fell like one bird for a considerable distance then they would separate and mount again shrieking and barking at length they rose to so great a height that he feared to lose sight of them but the struggle grew fiercer they closed more often and fell longer distances until they were near the earth once more when they finally separated flying away in opposite directions he was afraid that the birds had fatally injured each other but after two or three days he saw them again in their places  it was not possible for him he told me to describe the feelings he had while watching the birds it was the most wonderful thing he had ever witnessed and while the fight lasted he looked round from time to time straining his eyes and praying that some one would come to share the sight with him and because no one appeared he was miserable  i could well understand his feeling and have not ceased to envy him his good fortune thinking after leaving him of the sublime conflict he had described and of the ravens savage nature blakes question in his tiger tiger burning bright came to my mind     did he who made the lamb make thee  we can but answer that it was no other that when the supreme artist had fashioned it with bold free lines out of the blueblack rock he smote upon it with his mallet and bade it live and speak and its voice when it spoke was in accord with its appearance and temperthe savage humanlike croak and the loud angry bark as if a deepchested man had barked like a bloodhound  how strange it seems when we come to think of it that the owners of great estates and vast parks who are lovers of wild nature and animal life and should therefore have been most anxious to preserve this bird have allowed it to be extirpated a raven tree says the author of the birds of wiltshire is no mean ornament to a park and speaks of a wide domain and large timber and an ancient family for the raven is an aristocratic bird and cannot brook a confined property and trees of a young growth would that its predilection were more humoured and a secure retreat allowed it by the larger proprietors in the land  the wide domains the large timber and the ancient families survive but the raven has vanished it occasionally takes a young rabbit but the human ravens of somersetto wit the men and boys who have as little right to the rabbitsdo the same i do not suppose that in this way fewer than ten thousand to twenty thousand rabbits are annually picked up or poachedif any one likes that word betterin the county probably a larger number the existence of a pair of ravens on an estate of twenty or thirty thousand acres would not add much to the loss no doubt the raven kills other creatures that are preserved for sport but it does not appear that its extermination has improved things in somerset thirty years ago when blackgame was more plentiful than it is now the raven was to be met with throughout the county and was abundant on exmoor and the quantocks the old head keeper on the forest of exmoor told me that when he took the place twentyfive years ago ravens carrion crows buzzards and hawks of various kinds were very abundant and that the war he had waged against them for a quarter of a century had wellnigh extirpated all these species he had kept a careful record of all birds killed noting the species in every case as he was paid for all but the reward varied the largest sum being given for the largest birdsravens and buzzards his book shows that in one year a quarter of a century ago he was paid for fiftytwo ravens shot and trapped after that the number annually diminished rapidly and for several years past not one raven had been killed  at present one may go from end to end of the county which is a long one and find no raven but in very many places from north devon to the borders of gloucestershire one would find accounts of last ravens even in the comparatively populous neighbourhood of wells at least three pairs of ravens bred annually down to about twenty years agoone pair in the tower on glastonbury tor one on the ebor rocks and one at wookey hole two miles from the town  but somerset is no richer in memories of last ravens than most english counties a selection of the most interesting of such memories of ravens expelled from their ancestral breedingplaces during the last halfcentury would fill a volume in conclusion i will give one of the raven stories i picked up in somerset it was related to me by dr livett who has been the parish doctor in wells for over sixty years and was able to boast before retiring in 1898 that he was the oldest parish doctor in the kingdom about the year 1841 he was sent for to attend a cottage woman at priddya desolate little village high up in the mendips four or five miles from wells he had to remain some hours at the cottage and about midnight he was with the other members of the family in the livingroom when a loud tapping was heard on the glazed window as no one in the room moved and the tapping continued at intervals he asked why some one did not open the door they replied that it was only the ravens and went on to tell him that a pair of these birds roosted every night close by and invariably when a light was seen burning at a late hour in any cottage they would come and tap at the window the ravens had often been seen doing it and their habit was so well known that no notice was taken of it     chapter ix  owls in a village   in november when tramping in the midlands i paid a visit to a friend who had previously informed me in describing the attractions of the small remote rustic village he lived in that it was haunted by owls  the nightroving bird that inhabits the country village and its immediate neighbourhood is in most cases the white or barn owl the owl that prefers a loft in a barn or a church tower for home and breedingplace to the hollow ivied tree the loft is dry and roomy the best shelter from the storm and the tempest although not always from the tempest of mans insensate animosity the larger wood owl is supposed to have a different disposition to be a dweller in deep woods in love with seclusion gloom and retirementa thorough hermit it is not so everywhere certainly not in my friends gloucestershire village where the white owl is unknown while the brown or wood owl is quite common but it is not a thickly wooded district the woods there are small and widely separated there is however a deal of old hedgerow timber and many large trees scattered about the fields these the owl inhabits and is abundant simply because the gamekeeper is not there with his everlasting gun while the farmers look on the bird rather as a friend than an enemy  to go a little further into the matter there are no gamekeepers because the landowners cannot afford the expensive luxury of handreared pheasants the country is or was a rich one but the soil is clay so extraordinarily stiff that four or five horses are needed to draw a plough it is indeed strange to see five huge horses all in line dragging a plough and moving so slowly that when looked at from a distance they appear not to move at all if here and there a little wheat is still grown it is only because as the farmers say we mun have straw the land has mostly gone out of cultivation many vacant farms could be had at about five shillings an acre and the landlords would in many cases when pay day came round be glad to take half a crown and forgive the rest  the fields that were once ploughed are used for grazing but the sheep and cattle on them are very few one can only suppose that the land is not suitable for grazing purposes or else that the farmers are too poor to buy sufficient stock  viewed from some eminence the wide green country appears a veritable waste the idle hedges enclosing vacant fields the ancient scattered trees the absence of life the noonday quiet where the silence is only broken at intervals by some distant bird voice strangely impress the mind as by a vision of a time to come and of an england dispeopled it is restful there is a melancholy charm in it similar to that of a nature untouched by man although not so strong here everywhere are visible the marks of human toil and ownershipthe wavelike parallel ridges in the fields now mantled with grass and the hedges that cut up the surface of the earth into innumerable segments of various shapes and sizes it is not wild but there is something in it of the desolaton that accompanies wildnessa promise soon to be fulfilled now that grass and herbage will have freedom to grow and the hedges that have been trimmed for a thousand years will no longer be restrained from spreading  in this district the farmhouses and cottages are not scattered over the country the farmbuildings as a rule form part of the village the villages are small and mostly hidden from sight among embowering trees or in a coombe from the high ground in some places it is possible to gaze over many miles of surrounding country and not see a human habitation hours may sometimes be passed in such a spot without a human figure appearing in the landscape  the village i was staying at is called willersey the nearest to it a little over a mile away is saintbury this last was just such a pretty peaceful spot as would tempt a worldweary man to exclaim on first catching sight of it here i could wish to end my days a little oldworld village set among trees in the sheltering hollow of a deep coombe consisting of thatched stone cottages grouped in a pretty disorder a modest alehouse a parsonage overgrown with ivy and the old stone church stained yellow and grey with lichen its low square tower overtopped by the surrounding trees it was a pleasure merely to sit idle thinking of nothing on the higher part of the green slope with that small centre of rustic life at my feet for many hours of each day it was strangely silent the hours during which the men were away at a distance in the fields the children shut up in school and the women in their cottages an occasional bird voice alone broke the silencethe distant harsh call of a crow or the sudden startled note of a magpie close at hand a sound that resembles the broken or tremulous bleat of a goat if an apple dropped from a tree in the village its thud would be audible from end to end of the little crooked street in every cottage it would be known that an apple had dropped on some days the sound of the threshingmachine would be heard a mile or two away in that still atmosphere it was like the prolonged hum of some large fly magnified a million times a musical sound buzzing or clear at times tremulous rising or falling at intervals it would swell and fill the world then grow faint and die away this is one of the artificial sounds which like distant chimes harmonise with rural scenes  towards evening the children were all at play their shrill cries and laughter sounding from all parts of the village then when the sun had set and the landscape grew dim they would begin to call to one another from all sides in imitation of the wood owls hoot during these autumn evenings the children at this spot appeared to drop naturally into the owls note just as in spring in all parts of england they take to mimicking the cuckoos call children are like birds of a social and loquacious disposition in their fondness for a set call a penetrative cry or note by means of which they can converse at long distances but they have no settled call of their own no cry as distinctive as that of one of the lower animals they mimic some natural sound in the case of the children of these midland villages it is the wood owls clear prolonged note and in every place where some animal with a striking and imitable voice is found its call is used by them where no such sound is heard as in large towns they invent a call that is one invents it and the others immediately take it up it is curious that the human species in spite of its long wild life in the past should have no distinctive call or calls universally understood among savage tribes the men often mimic the cry of some wild animal as a call just as our children do that of an owl by night and of some diurnal species in the daytime other tribes have a call of their own a shout or yell peculiar to the tribe but it is not used instinctivelyit is a mere symbol and is artificial like the longdrawn piercing cooee of the australian colonists in the bush and the abrupt hi with which we hail a cab with other forms of halooing or even the lupine gurgled yowl of the morning milkman  after dark the silence at the village was very profound until about halfpast nine to ten oclock when the real owls so easily to be distinguished from their human mockers would begin their hootinga single long uninflected note and after it a silent interval of eight or ten seconds then the succeeding longer much more beautiful note quavering at first but growing steady and clear with some slight modulation in it the symbols hoohoo and towhit towho as shakespeare wrote it stand for the wood owls note in books but you cannot spell the sound of an oaten straw nor of the owls pipe there is no w in it and no h and no t it suggests some wind instrument that resembles the human voice but a very unenglish oneperhaps the highpitched somewhat nasal voice of an arab intoning a prayer to allah one cannot hit on the precise instrument there are so many perhaps it is obsolete and the owl was taught his song by lovers in the long ago who wooed at twilight in a forgotten tongue         and gave the soft winds a voice    with instruments of unremembered forms  no that cannot be for the wood owls music is doubtless older than any instrument made by hands to be blown by human lips listening by night to their concert the many notes that come from far and near humanlike yet airy delicate mysterious one could imagine that the sounds had a meaning and a message to us that like the fairyfolk in mr yeatss celtic lyric the singers were singing     we who are old old and gay          o so old    thousands of years thousands of years          if all were told  the fairies certainly have a more understandable way of putting it than the geologists and the anthropologists when we ask them to tell us how long it is since palæolithic man listened to the hooting of the wood owl has this sound the same meaning for us that it had for himthe human being that did not walk erect and smile and look on heaven but went with a stoop looking on the earth no and yes standing alone under the great trees in the dark still nights the sound seems to increase the feeling of loneliness to make the gloom deeper the silence more profound turning our visions inward on such occasions we are startled with a glimpse of the nightside of nature in the soul we have with us strange unexpected guests fantastic beings that are in no way related to our lives dead and buried since childhood they have miraculously been restored to life when we are back in the candlelight and firelight and when the morrow dawns these children of night and the unsubstantial appearance of things                        fade away    into the light of common day  the villagers of saintbury are however still in a somewhat primitive mental condition the light of common day does not deliver them from the presence of phantoms as the following instance will show  near willersey there is a group of very large old elmtrees which is a favourite meetingplace of the owls and one very dark starless night about ten oclock i had been listening to them and after they ceased hooting i remained for half an hour standing motionless in the same place at length in the direction of saintbury i heard the dull sound of heavy stumbling footsteps coming towards me over the rough ridgy field nearer and nearer the man came until arriving at the hedge close to which i stood he scrambled through muttering maledictions on the thorns that scratched and tore him then catching sight of me at a distance of two or three yards he started back and stood still very much astonished at seeing a motionless human figure at that spot i greeted him and to explain my presence remarked that i had been listening to the owls  owlslistening to the owls he exclaimed staring at me after a while he added we have been having too much of the owls over at saintbury had i heard he asked about the young woman who had dropped down dead a week or two ago after hearing an owl hooting near her cottage in the daytime well the owl had been hooting again in the same tree and no one knew who it was for and what to expect next the village was in an excited state about it and all the children had gathered near the tree and thrown stones into it but the owl had stubbornly refused to come out  that about the young woman he had spoken of is a queer little story to read in this enlightened land she was apparently in very good health a wife and the mother of a small child but a few weeks before her sudden death a strange thing occurred to trouble her mind one afternoon when sitting alone in her cottage taking tea she saw a cricket come in at the open door and run straight into the middle of the room there it remained motionless and without stirring from her seat she took a few moist tealeaves and threw them down near the welcome guest the cricket moved up to the leaves and when it touched them and appeared just about to begin sucking their moisture to her dismay it turned aside ran away out at the door and disappeared she informed all her neighbours of this startling occurrence and sadly spoke of an aunt who was living at another village and was known to be in bad health it must be for her she said well soon be hearing bad news of her im thinking but no bad news came and when she was beginning to believe that the strange cricket that had refused to remain in the house had proved a false prophet the warning of the owl came to startle her afresh at noonday she heard it hooting in the great horsechestnut overgrown with ivy that stands at the roadside close to her cottage the incident was discussed by the villagers with their usual solemnity and headshakings and now the young woman gave up all hopes of her sick aunts recovery for that one of her people was going to die was certain and it could be no other than that ailing one and after all the message and warning was for her and not the aunt not many days after the owl had hooted in broad daylight she dropped down dead in her cottage while engaged in some domestic work  on the following morning i went with the friend i was visiting at willersey to saintbury and the story heard overnight was confirmed the owl had been hooting in the daytime in the same old horsechestnut tree from which it had a short time ago foretold the young womans death one of the villagers who was engaged in repairing the thatch of a cottage close to the tree informed us that the owls hooting had not troubled him in the least owls he truly said often hoot in the daytime during the autumn months and he did not believe that it meant death for some one  this sceptical fellow it is hardly necessary to say was a young man who had spent a good deal of his time away from the village  at willersey a mr andrews a lover of birds who owns a large garden and orchard in the village gave me an entertaining account of a pet wood owl he once had he had it as a young bird and never confined it as a rule it spent most of the daylight hours in an apple loft coming forth when the sun was low to fly about the grounds until it found him when it would perch on his shoulder and spend the evening in his company in one thing this owl differed from most pet birds which are allowed to have their liberty he made no difference between the people of the house and those who were not of it he would fly on to anybodys shoulder although he only addressed his hungercry to those who were accustomed to feed him as he roamed at will all over the place he became well known to every one and on account of his beauty and perfect confidence he grew to be something of a village pet but short days with long dark eveningsand how dark they can be in a small treeshaded lampless villagewrought a change in the public feeling about the owl he was always abroad in the evening gliding about unseen in the darkness on downy silent wings and very suddenly dropping on to the shoulder of any personman woman or childwho happened to be out of doors men would utter savage maledictions when they felt the demon claws suddenly clutch them girls shrieked and fled to the nearest cottage into which they would rush palpitating with terror then there would be a laugh for it was only the tame owl but the same terror would be experienced on the next occasion and young women and children were afraid to venture out after nightfall lest the ghostly creature with luminous eyes should pop down upon them  at length one morning the bird came not back from his nightwandering and after two days and nights during which he had not been seen he was given up for lost on the third day mr andrews was in his orchard when happening to pass near a clump of bushes he heard the owls note of recognition very faintly uttered the poor bird had been in hiding at that spot the whole time and when taken up was found to be in a very weak condition and to have one leg broken no doubt one of the villagers on whose shoulders it had sought to alight had struck it down with his stick and caused its injury the bone was skilfully repaired and the bird tenderly cared for and before long he was well again and strong as ever but a change had come over his disposition his confidence in his human fellowcreatures was gone he now regarded them alleven those of the housewith suspicion opening wide his eyes and drawing a little back when any person approached him never more did he alight on any persons shoulder though his evenings were spent as before in flying about the village insensibly his range widened and he became wilder human companionship no longer pleasant ceased to be necessary and at length he found a mate who was willing to overlook his pauper past and with her he went away to live his wild life     chapter x  the strange and beautiful sheldrake   at the head of the cheddar valley a couple of miles from the cathedral city of wells the somerset axe is born gushing out noisily a mighty volume of clear cold water from a cavern in a black precipitous rock on the hillside this cavern is called wookey hole and above it the rough wall is draped with ivy and fern and many small creeping plants and flowery shrubs rooted in the crevices and in the holes in the rock the daws have their nests they are a numerous and a vociferous colony but the noise of their loudest cawings when they rush out like a black cloud and are most excited is almost drowned by the louder roar of the torrent beneaththe rivers great cry of liberty and joy on issuing from the blackness in the hollow of the hills into the sunshine of heaven and the verdure of that beautiful valley the axe finishes its course fifteen miles away for tis a short river but they are pleasant miles in one of the fairest vales in the west of england rich in cattle and in corn and at the point where it flows into the severn sea stands brean down a huge isolated hill the last of the mendip range on that side it has a singular appearance it might be likened in its form to a hippopotamus standing on the flat margin of an african lake its breast and mouth touching the water and all its body bellydeep in the mud it is in fact a hill or a promontory united to the mainland by a strip of low flat landa huge oblong saddlebacked hill projected into the sea towards wales down at its foot at the point where it touches the mainland close to the mouth of the axe there is a farmhouse and the farmer is the tenant of the entire hill and uses it as a sheepwalk the sheep and rabbits and birds are the only inhabitants i remember a delightful experience i had one cold windy but very bright spring morning near the farmhouse there is there at a spot where one is able to ascend the steep hill a long strip of rock that looks like the wall of a gigantic ruined castle rough and black draped with ancient ivy and crowned with furze and bramble and thorn here coming out of the cold wind to the shelter of this giant ivydraped black wall i stood still to enjoy the sensations of warmth and a motionless air when high above appeared a swiftmoving little cloud of linnets seemingly blown across the sky by the gale but quite suddenly when directly over me the birds all came straight down to drop like a shower of small stones into the great masses of ivy and furze and bramble and no sooner had they settled vanishing into that warm and windless greenery than they simultaneously burst into such a concert of sweetest wild linnet music that i was enchanted and thought that never in all the years i had spent in the haunts of wild birds had i heard anything so fairylike and beautiful  on this hill or down at the highest point you have the severn sea before you and beyond the blue mountains of glamorganshire and on the shore the town of cardiff made beautiful by distance vaguely seen in the blue haze and shimmering sunlight like a dream city on your right hand on your own side of the narrow sea you have a good view of the big young growing town of westonsupermarebristols margate or brighton as it has been called it is built of bath stone and at this distance looks grey darkened with the slate roofs and a little strange but the sight is not unpleasant and if you wish to retain that pleasant impression go not nearer to it than brean down since on a closer view its aspect changes and it is simply ugly on your left hand you look over long miles long leagues of low flat country extending to the parret river and beyond it to the blue quantock range that low land is on a level with the sea and is the flattest bit of country in england not even excepting the ely district apart from the charm which flatness has in itself for some personsit has for me a very great charm on account of early associationsthere is much here to attract the lover of nature it is the chief haunt and paradise of the reed warbler one of our sweetest songsters and here his music may be heard amid more perfect surroundings than in any other haunt of the bird known to me in england  this low level strip of country is mostly pastureland and is drained by endless ditches full of reeds and sedges growing in the stagnant sherrycoloured water dwarf hawthorn grows on the banks of the ditches and is the only tree vegetation standing on one of the wide flat green fields or spaces at a distance from the sandy dyke or ditch it is strangely silent unless a lark is singing near there is no sound at all but it is wonderfully bright and fragrant where the green level earth is yellowed over with cowslips and you get the deliciousness of that flower in fullest measure on coming to the dyke you are no longer in a silent land with fragrance as its principal charmyou are in the midst of a perpetual flow and rush of sound you may sit or lie there on the green bank by the hour and it will not cease and so sweet and beautiful is it that after a day spent in rambling in such a place with these delicate spring delights on returning to the woods and fields and homesteads the songs of thrush and blackbird sound in the ear as loud and coarse as the cackling of fowls and geese  it is in this district from brean down westwards along the coast to dunster that i have been best able to observe and enjoy the beautiful sheldrakealmost the only large bird which is now permitted to exist in somerset  the sheldrake of the british islands called the common sheldrake or sheldduck in the natural history books for no good reason since there is but one is now becoming common enough as an ornamental waterfowl it is to be seen in so many parks and private grounds all over the country that the sight of it in its conspicuous plumage must be pretty familiar to people generally and many of those who know it best as a tame bird would perhaps say that the descriptive epithets of strange and beautiful do not exactly fit it they would say that it has a striking appearance or that it is peculiar and handsome in a curious way or they might describe it as an abnormally slender and elegantlooking aylesbury duck whiter than that domestic bird with a crimson beak and legs darkgreen glossy head and sundry patches of chestnutred and black on its snowy plumage in calling it strange i was thinking of its manners and customs rather than of the singularity of its appearance  as to its beauty those who know it in a state of nature in its haunts on the sea coast will agree that it is one of the handsomest of our large wild birds it cannot now be said that it is common except in a few favoured localities on the south coast it is all but extinct as a breeding species and on the east side of england it is becoming increasingly rare even in spots so well suited to it as holy island and the coast at bamborough castle with its great sandhills these same hills that look on the sea and are greener than ivy with the everlasting green of the rough marram grass that covers them would be a very paradise to the sheldrake but for manvile manwho watches him through a spyglass in the breeding season to rob him of his eggs the persecuted bird has grown exceedingly shy and cautious but go he must to his burrow in the dunes and the patient watcher sees him at a great distance on account of his conspicuous white plumage and marks the spot then takes his spade to dig down to the hidden eggs  on the somerset coast the bird is not so badly off and i have had many happy days with him there simply to watch the birds at feed when the tide goes out and they are busy searching for the small marine creatures they live on among the stranded seaweed is a great pleasure at such times they are most active and loquacious uttering a variety of wild gooselike sounds frequently rising to pursue one another in circles or to fly up and down the coast in pairs or strings of half a dozen birds with a wonderfully graceful flight if after watching this seafowl by the sea a person will go to some park water to look on the same bird pinioned and tame sitting or standing or swimming about in a quiet listless way he will be amazed at the difference in its appearance the tame bird is no bigger than a domestic duck the wild sheldrake flying about in the strong sunshine looks almost as large as a goose a similar illusion is produced in the case of some other large birds thus the common buzzard when rising in circles high above us at times appears as big as an eagle and it has been conjectured that this magnifying effect which gives something of sublimity to the soaring buzzard is caused by the sunlight passing through the semitranslucent wing and tail feathers in the case of the sheldrake the exaggerated size may be an effect of strong sunlight on a flying white object seen on the wing at a distance the plumage appears entirely of a surpassing whiteness the dark patches of chestnut black and deep green colour showing only when the bird is near or when it alights and folds its white wings  when the tide has covered their feedingground on the coast the sheldrakes are accustomed to visit the low green pasturelands and may be seen in small flocks feeding like geese on the clover and grass here one day i saw about a dozen sheldrakes in the midst of an immense congregation of rooks daws and starlings feeding among some cows it was a curious gathering and the red devons shining white sheldrakes and black rooks on the bright green grass produced a singular effect  best of all it is to observe the birds when breeding in may brean down is an ancient favourite breedingsite and the birds breed there in the rabbit holes and sometimes under a thick furzebush on the ground at another spot on this coast i have had the rare good fortune to find a number of pairs breeding at one spot on private enclosed land where i could approach them very closely and watch them any day for hours at a stretch studying their curious signlanguage about which nothing to my knowledge has hitherto been written there were about thirty pairs and their breedingholes were mostly rabbitburrows scattered about on a piece of sandy ground about an acre and a half in extent almost surrounded by water when i watched them the birds were laying and at about ten oclock in the morning they would begin to come in from the sea in pairs all to settle down at one spot and by creeping some distance at the waterside among the rushes i could get within forty yards of them and watch them by the hour without being discovered by them in an hour or so there would be forty or fifty birds forming a flock each couple always keeping close together some sitting on the short grass others standing all very quiet at length one bird in the flock a male would all at once begin to move his head in a slow measured manner from side to side like a pianist swaying his body in time to his own music if no notice was taken of this motion by the duck sitting by his side dozing on the grass the drake would take a few steps forward and place himself directly before her so as to compel her to give attention and rock more vigorously than ever haranguing her as it were although without words the meaning of it all being that it was time for her to get up and go to her burrow to lay her egg i do not know any other species in which the male takes it on himself to instruct his mate on a domestic matter which one would imagine to be exclusively within her own province and some ornithologists may doubt that i have given a right explanation of these curious doings of the sheldrake but mark what follows the duck at length gets up in a lazy reluctant way perhaps and stretches a wing and a leg and then after awhile sways her head two or three times as if to say that she is ready at once the drake followed by her walks off and leads the way to the burrow which may be a couple of hundred yards away and during the walk she sometimes stops whereupon he at once turns back and begins the swaying motion again at last arriving at the mouth of the burrow he steps aside and invites her to enter rocking himself again and anon bending his head down and looking into the cavity then drawing back again and at last after so much persuasion on his part she lowers her head creeps quietly down and disappears within left alone the drake stations himself at the burrows mouth with head raised like a sentinel on duty but after five or ten minutes he slowly walks back to the flock and settles down for a quiet nap among his fellows they are all married couples and every drake among them when in some mysterious way he knows the time has come for the egg to be laid has to go through the same long ceremonious performance with variations according to his partners individual disposition  it is amusing to see at intervals a pair march off from the flock and one wonders whether the others whose turn will come by and by pass any remarks but the dumb conversation at the burrows mouth is always most delightful to witness sometimes the lady bird exhibits an extreme reluctance and one can imagine her saying i have come thus far just to please you but youll never persuade me to go down into that horrid dark hole if i must lay an egg ill just drop it out here on the grass and let it take its chance  it is rather hard on the drake but he never loses his temper never boxes her ears with his carmine red beak or thrashes her with his shining white wings nor does he tell her that she is just like a womanan illogical fool he is most gentle and considerate full of distress and sympathy for her and tells her again what he has said before but in a different way he agrees with her that it is dark and close down there away from the sweet sunlight but that it is an old old custom of the sheldrakes to breed in holes and has its advantages and that if she will only overcome her natural repugnance and fear of the dark in that long narrow tunnel when she is once settled down on the nest and feels the cold eggs growing warm again under her warm body she will find that it is not so bad after all  and in the end he prevails and bowing her pretty head she creeps quietly down and disappears while he remains on guard at the doorfor a little while     chapter xi  geese an appreciation and a memory   one november evening in the neighbourhood of lyndhurst i saw a flock of geese marching in a long procession led as their custom is by a majestical gander they were coming home from their feedingground in the forest and when i spied them were approaching their owners cottage arrived at the wooden gate of the garden in front of the cottage the leading bird drew up square before it and with repeated loud screams demanded admittance pretty soon in response to the summons a man came out of the cottage walked briskly down the garden path and opened the gate but only wide enough to put his right leg through then placing his foot and knee against the leading bird he thrust him roughly back as he did so three young geese pressed forward and were allowed to pass in then the gate was slammed in the face of the gander and the rest of his followers and the man went back to the cottage the ganders indignation was fine to see though he had most probably experienced the same rude treatment on many previous occasions drawing up to the gate again he called more loudly than before then deliberately lifted a leg and placing his broad webbed foot like an open hand against the gate actually tried to push it open his strength was not sufficient but he continued to push and to call until the man returned to open the gate and let the birds go in  it was an amusing scene and the behaviour of the bird struck me as characteristic it was this lofty spirit of the goose and strict adhesion to his rights as well as his noble appearance and the stately formality and deliberation of his conduct that caused me very long ago to respect and admire him above all our domestic birds doubtless from the æsthetic point of view other domesticated species are his superiors in some things the mute swan floating double graceful and majestical with arched neck and ruffled scapulars the oriental peafowl in his glittering mantle the helmeted guineafowl powdered with stars and the red cock with his military bearinga shining elizabethan knight of the feathered world singer lover and fighter it is hardly to be doubted that mentally the goose is above all these and to my mind his too is the nobler figure but it is a very familiar figure and we have not forgotten the reason of its presence among us he satisfies a material want only too generously and on this account is too much associated in the mind with mere flavours we keep a swan or a peacock for ornament a goose for the tablehe is the michaelmas and christmas bird a somewhat similar debasement has fallen on the sheep in australia to the man in the bush he is nothing but a tallowelaborating organism whose destiny it is to be cast at maturity into the melting vat and whose chief use it is to lubricate the machinery of civilisation it a little shocks and at the same time amuses our colonial to find that great artists in the parent country admire this most unpoetic beast and waste their time and talents in painting it  some five or six years ago in the alpine journal sir martin conway gave a lively and amusing account of his first meeting with a d mcormick the artist who subsequently accompanied him to the karakoram himalayas a friend he wrote came to me bringing in his pocket a crumpledup water sketch or impression of a lot of geese i was struck by the breadth of the treatment and i remember saying that the man who could see such monumental magnificence in a flock of geese ought to be the kind of man to paint mountains and render somewhat of their majesty  i will venture to say that he looked at the sketch or impression with the artists clear eye but had not previously so looked at the living creature or had not seen it clearly owing to the mist of imagesif that be a permissible wordthat floated between it and his visionremembered flavours and fragrances of rich meats and of sage and onions and sweet apple sauce when this interposing mist is not present who can fail to admire the goosethat stately birdshaped monument of clouded grey or crystal white marble to be seen standing conspicuous on any village green or common in england for albeit a conquered bird something of the ancient wild and independent spirit survives to give him a prouder bearing than we see in his fellow feathered servants he is the least timid of our domestic birds yet even at a distance he regards your approach in an attitude distinctly reminiscent of the greylag goose the wariest of wild fowl stretching up his neck and standing motionless and watchful a sentinel on duty seeing him thus if you deliberately go near him he does not slink or scuttle away as other domestic birds of meaner spirits do but boldly advances to meet and challenge you how keen his senses are how undimmed by ages of captivity the ancient instinct of watchfulness is in him every one must know who has slept in lonely country houses at some late hour of the night the sleeper was suddenly awakened by the loud screaming of the geese they had discovered the approach of some secret prowler a fox perhaps or a thievish tramp or gipsy before a dog barked in many a lonely farmhouse throughout the land you will be told that the goose is the better watchdog  when we consider this bird purely from the æsthetic point of viewand here i am speaking of geese generally all of the thirty species of the subfamily anserinæ distributed over the cold and temperate regions of the globewe find that several of them possess a rich and beautiful colouring and if not so proud often a more graceful carriage than our domestic bird or its original the wild greylag goose to know these birds is to greatly admire them and we may now add that this admiration is no new thing on the earth it is the belief of distinguished egyptologists that a fragmentary fresco discovered at medum dates back to a time at least four thousand years before the christian era and is probably the oldest picture in the world it is a representation of six geese of three different species depicted with marvellous fidelity and a thorough appreciation of form and colouring  among the most distinguished in appearance and carriage of the handsome exotic species is the magellanic goose one of the five or six species of the antarctic genus chloëphaga found in patagonia and the magellan islands one peculiarity of this bird is that the sexes differ in colouring the male being white with grey mottlings whereas the prevailing colour of the female is a ruddy browna fine rich colour set off with some white grey intense cinnamon and beautiful black mottlings seen on the wing the flock presents a somewhat singular appearance as of two distinct species associating together as we may see when by chance gulls and rooks or sheldrakes and black scoters mix in one flock  this fine bird has long been introduced into this country and as it breeds freely it promises to become quite common i can see it any day but these exiles pinioned and imprisoned in parks are not quite like the magellanic geese i was intimate with in former years in patagonia and in the southern pampas of buenos ayres where they wintered every year in incredible numbers and were called bustards by the natives to see them again as i have seen them by day and all day long in their thousands and to listen again by night to their wild cries i would willingly give up in exchange all the invitations to dine which i shall receive all the novels i shall read all the plays i shall witness in the next three years and some other miserable pleasures might be thrown in listening to the birds when during migration on a still frosty night they flew low following the course of some river flock succeeding flock all night long or heard from a herdsmans hut on the pampas when thousands of the birds had encamped for the night on the plain hard by the effect of their many voices like that of their appearance when seen flying was singular as well as beautiful on account of the striking contrasts in the various sounds they uttered on clear frosty nights they are most loquacious and their voices may be heard by the hour rising and falling now few and now many taking part in the endless confabulationa talkeetalkee and concert in one a chatter as of many magpies the solemn deep honkhonk the long grave note changing to a shuddering sound and most wonderful the fine silvery whistle of the male steady or tremulous now long and now short modulated a hundred wayswilder and more beautiful than the nightcry of the widgeon brighter than the voice of any shore bird or any warbler thrush or wren or the sound of any wind instrument  it is probable that those who have never known the magellanic goose in a state of nature are best able to appreciate its fine qualities in its present semidomestic state in england at all events the enthusiasm with which a londoner spoke of this bird in my presence some time ago came to me rather as a surprise it was at the studio in st johns wood of our greatest animal painter one sunday evening and the talk was partly about birds when an elderly gentleman said that he was pleased to meet some one who would be able to tell him the name of a wonderful bird he had lately seen in st jamess park his description was vague he could not say what its colour was nor what sort of beak it had nor whether its feet were webbed or not but it was a large tall bird and there were two of them it was the way this bird had comported itself towards him that had so taken him as he went through the park at the side of the enclosure he caught sight of the pair some distance away on the grass and the birds observing that he had stopped in his walk to regard them left off feeding or whatever they were doing and came to him not to be fedit was impossible to believe that they had any such motive it was solely and purely a friendly feeling towards him which caused them immediately to respond to his look and to approach him to salute him in their way and when they had approached to within three or four yards of where he stood advancing with a quiet dignity and had then uttered a few soft low sounds accompanied with certain graceful gestures they turned and left him but not abruptly with their backs towards himoh no they did nothing so common they were not like other birdsthey were perfect in everything and moving from him half paused at intervals half turning first to one side then the other inclining their heads as they went here our old friend rose and paced up and down the floor bowing to this side and that and making other suitable gestures to try to give us some faint idea of the birds gentle courtesy and exquisite grace it was he assured us most astonishing the birds gestures and motions were those of a human being but in their perfection immeasurably superior to anything of the kind to be seen in any court in europe or the world  the birds he had described i told him were no doubt upland geese  geese he exclaimed in a tone of surprise and disgust are you speaking seriously geese oh no nothing like geesea sort of ostrich  it was plain that he had no accurate knowledge of birds if he had caught sight of a kingfisher or green woodpecker he would probably have described it as a sort of peacock of the goose he only knew that it is a ridiculous awkward creature proverbial for its stupidity although very good to eat and it wounded him to find that any one could think so meanly of his intelligence and taste as to imagine him capable of greatly admiring any bird called a goose or any bird in any way related to a goose  i will now leave the subject of the beautiful antarctic goose the bustard of the horsemen of the pampas and sort of ostrich of our londoner to relate a memory of my early years and of how i first became an admirer of the familiar domestic goose never since have i looked on it in such favourable conditions  two miles from my home there stood an old mudbuilt house thatched with rushes and shaded by a few ancient halfdead trees here lived a very old woman with her two unmarried daughters both withered and grey as their mother indeed in appearance they were three amiable sister witches all very very old the high ground on which the house stood sloped down to an extensive reed and rushgrown marsh the source of an important stream it was a paradise of wild fowl swan roseate spoonbill herons white and herons grey ducks of half a dozen species snipe and painted snipe and stilt plover and godwit the glossy ibis and the great crested blue ibis with a powerful voice all these interested i might say fascinated me less than the tame geese that spent most of their time in or on the borders of the marsh in the company of the wild birds the three old women were so fond of their geese that they would not part with one for love or money the most they would ever do would be to present an egg in the laying season to some visitor as a special mark of esteem  it was a grand spectacle when the entire flock numbering upwards of a thousand stood up on the marsh and raised their necks on a persons approach it was grand to hear them too when as often happened they all burst out in a great screaming concert i can hear that mighty uproar now  with regard to the character of the sound we have seen in a former chapter that the poet cowper thought not meanly of the domestic grey goose as a vocalist when heard on a common or even in a farmyard but there is a vast difference in the effect produced on the mind when the sound is heard amid its natural surroundings in silent desert places even hearing them as i did from a distance on that great marsh where they existed almost in a state of nature the sound was not comparable to that of the perfectly wild bird in his native haunts the cry of the wild greylag was described by robert gray in his birds of the west of scotland of the birds voice he writes my most recent experiences august 1870 in the outer hebrides remind me of a curious effect which i noted in connection with the callnote of this bird in these quiet solitudes i had reached south uist and taken up my quarters under the hospitable roof of mr birnie at grogarry  and in the stillness of the sabbath morning following my arrival was aroused from sleep by the cries of the greylags as they flew past the house their voices softened by distance sounded not unpleasantly reminding me of the clanging of church bells in the heart of a large town  it is a fact i think that to many minds the mere wildness represented by the voice of a great wild bird in his lonely haunts is so grateful that the sound itself whatever its quality may be delights and is more than the most beautiful music a certain distinguished man of letters and church dignitary was once asked a friend tells me why he lived away from society buried in the loneliest village on the dreary east coast at that spot where standing on the flat desolate shore you look over the north sea and have no land between you and far spitzbergen he answered that he made his home there because it was the only spot in england in which sitting in his own room he could listen to the cry of the pinkfooted goose only those who have lost their souls will fail to understand  the geese i have described belonging to the three old women could fly remarkably well and eventually some of them during their flights down stream discovered at a distance of about eight miles from home the immense low marshy plain bordering the sealike plata river there were no houses and no people in that endless green wet land and they liked it so well that they visited it more and more often in small flocks of a dozen to twenty birds going and coming all day long until all knew the road it was observed that when a man on foot or on horseback appeared in sight of one of these flocks the birds at this distance from home were as wary as really wild birds and watched the strangers approach in alarm and when he was still at a considerable distance rose and flew away beyond sight  the old dames grieved at this wandering spirit in their beloved birds and became more and more anxious for their safety but by this time the aged mother was fading visibly into the tomb though so slowly that long months went by while she lay on her bed a weirdlooking objecti remember her wellleaner greyer more ghostlike than the silent lean grey heron on the marsh hard by and at last she faded out of life aged it was said by her descendants a hundred and ten years and after she was dead it was found that of that great company of noble birds there remained only a small remnant of about forty and these were probably incapable of sustained flight the others returned no more but whether they met their death from duck and swan shooters in the marshes or had followed the great river down to the sea forgetting their home was never known for about a year after they had ceased going back small flocks were occasionally seen in the marshes very wild and strong on the wing but even these too vanished at last  it is probable that but for powder and shot the domestic goose of europe by occasionally taking to a feral life in thinlysettled countries would ere this have become widely distributed over the earth  and one wonders if in the long centuries running to thousands of years of tame flightless existence the strongest impulse of the wild migrant has been wholly extinguished in the domestic goose we regard him as a comparatively unchangeable species and it is probable that the unexercised faculty is not dead but sleeping and would wake again in favourable circumstances the strength of the wild birds passion has been aptly described by miss dora sigerson in her little poem the flight of the wild geese the poem oddly enough is not about geese but about menwild irishmen who were called wild geese but the birds powerful impulse and homing faculty are employed as an illustration and admirably described     flinging the salt from their wings and despair from their hearts    they arise on the breast of the storm with a cry and are gone    when will you come home wild geese in your thousand strong    not the fierce wind can stay your return or tumultuous sea    only death in his reaping could make you return no more  now arctic and antarctic geese are alike in this their devotion to their distant breedingground the cradle and true home of the species or race and i will conclude this chapter with an incident related to me many years ago by a brother who was sheepfarming in a wild and lonely district on the southern frontier of buenos ayres immense numbers of upland geese in great flocks used to spend the cold months on the plains where he had his lonely hut and one morning in august in the early spring of that southern country some days after all the flocks had taken their departure to the south he was out riding and saw at a distance before him on the plain a pair of geese they were male and femalea white and a brown bird their movements attracted his attention and he rode to them the female was walking steadily on in a southerly direction while the male greatly excited and calling loudly from time to time walked at a distance ahead and constantly turned back to see and call to his mate and at intervals of a few minutes he would rise up and fly screaming to a distance of some hundreds of yards then finding that he had not been followed he would return and alight at a distance of forty or fifty yards in advance of the other bird and begin walking on as before the female had one wing broken and unable to fly had set out on her long journey to the magellanic islands on her feet and her mate though called to by that mysterious imperative voice in his breast yet would not forsake her but flying a little distance to show her the way and returning again and again and calling to her with his wildest and most piercing cries urged her still to spread her wings and fly with him to their distant home  and in that sad anxious way they would journey on to the inevitable end when a pair or family of carrion eagles would spy them from a great distancethe two travellers left far behind by their fellows one flying the other walking and the first would be left to continue the journey alone  since this appreciation was written a good many years ago i have seen much of geese or as it might be put have continued my relations with them and have written about them too in my adventures among birds 1913 in recent years it has become a custom of mine to frequent wellsnextthesea in october and november just to welcome the wild geese that come in numbers annually to winter at that favoured spot among the incidents related in that last book of mine about the wild geese there were two or three about the birds noble and dignified bearing and its extraordinary intelligence and i wish here to return to that subject just to tell yet one more goose story only in this instance it was about the domestic bird  it happened that among the numerous letters i received from readers of birds and man on its first appearance there was one which particularly interested me from an old gentleman a retired schoolmaster in the cathedral city of wells he was a delightful letterwriter but byandbye our correspondence ceased and i heard no more of him for three or four years then i was at wells spending a few days looking up and inquiring after old friends in the place and remembering my pleasant letterwriter i went to call on him during our conversation he told me that the chapter which had impressed him most in my book was the one on the goose especially all that related to the lofty dignified bearing of the bird its independent spirit and fearlessness of its human masters in which it differs so greatly from all other domestic birds he knew it well he had been feelingly persuaded of that proud spirit in the bird and had greatly desired to tell me of an adventure he had met with but the incident reflected so unfavourably on himself as a humane and fairminded or sportsmanlike person that he had refrained however now that i had come to see him he would make a clean breast of it  it happened that in january some winters ago there was a very great fall of snow in england especially in the south and west the snow fell without intermission all day and all night and on the following morning wells appeared half buried in it he was then living with a daughter who kept house for him in a cottage standing in its own grounds on the outskirts of the town on attempting to leave the house he found they were shut in by the snow which had banked itself against the walls to the height of the eaves half an hours vigorous spade work enabled him to get out from the kitchen door into the open and the sun in a blue sky shining on a dazzling white and silent world but no milkman was going his rounds and there would be no baker nor butcher nor any other tradesman to call for orders and there were no provisions in the house but the milk for breakfast was the first thing needed and so with a jug in his hand he went bravely out to try and make his way to the milk shop which was not far off  a wall and hedge bounded his front garden on one side and this was now entirely covered by an immense snowdrift sloping up to a height of about seven feet it was only when he paused to look at this vast snow heap in his garden that he caught sight of a goose a very big snowwhite bird without a grey spot in its plumage standing within a few yards of him about four feet from the ground its entire snowy whiteness with snow for a background had prevented him from seeing it until he looked directly at it he stood still gazing in astonishment and admiration at this noble bird standing so motionless with its head raised high that it was like the figure of a goose carved out of some crystalline white stone and set up at that spot on the glittering snowdrift but it was no statue it had living eyes which without the least turning of the head watched him and every motion he made then all at once the thought came into his head that here was something very good succulent food in fact sent he almost thought providentially to provision his house for how easy it would be for him as he passed the bird to throw himself suddenly upon and capture it it had belonged to some one no doubt but that great snowstorm and the furious northeast wind had blown it far far from its native place and it was lost to its owner for ever practically it was now a wild bird free for him to take without any qualms and to nourish himself on its flesh while the snow siege lasted standing there jug in hand he thought it out and then took a few steps towards the bird in order to see if there was any sign of suspicion in it but there was none only he could see that the goose without turning its head was all the time regarding him out of the corner of one eye finally he came to the conclusion that his best plan was to go for the milk and on his return to set the jug down by the gate when coming in then to walk in a careless unconcerned manner towards the door taking no notice of the goose until he got abreast of it and then turn suddenly and hurl himself upon it nothing could be easier so away he went and in about twenty minutes was back again with the milk to find the bird in the same place standing as before motionless in the same attitude it was not disturbed at his coming in at the gate nor did it show the slightest disposition to move when he walked towards it in his studied careless manner then when within three yards of it came the supreme moment and wheeling suddenly round he hurled himself with violence upon his victim throwing out his arms to capture it and so great was the impulse he had given himself that he was buried to the ankles in the drift but before going into it in that brief moment the fraction of a second he saw what happened just as his hands were about to touch it the wings opened and the bird was lifted from its stand and out of his reach as if by a miracle in the drift he was like a drowning man swallowing snow into his lungs for water for a few dreadful moments he thought it was all over with him then he succeeded in struggling out and stood trembling and gasping and choking blinded with snow byandbye he recovered and had a look round and lo there stood his goose on the summit of the snow bank about three yards from the spot where it had been it was standing as before perfectly motionless its long neck and head raised and was still in appearance the snowwhite figure of a carved bird only it was more conspicuous and impressive now being outlined against the blue sky and as before it was regarding him out of the corner of one eye he had never he said felt so ashamed of himself in his life if the bird had screamed and fled from him it would not have been so bad but there it had chosen to remain as if despising his attempt at harming it too much even to feel resentment a most uncanny bird it seemed to him that it had divined his intention from the first and had been prepared for his every movement and now it appeared to him to be saying mentally have you got no more plans to capture me in your clever brain or have you quite given it up  yes he had quite quite given it up  and then the goose seeing there were no more plans quietly unfolded its wings and rose from the snowdrift and flew away over the town and the cathedral away on the further side and towards the snowcovered mendips he standing there watching it until it was lost to sight in the pale sky     chapter xii  the dartford warbler   how to save our rare birds  the most interesting chapter in john burroughs fresh fields contains an account of an anxious hurried search after a nightingale in song at a time of the year when that creature of ebullient heart somewhat suddenly drops into silence a few days were spent by the author in rushing about the country in surrey and hampshire with the result that once or twice a few musical throbs of sound a trill a short detached phrase were heardjust enough to convince the eager listener that here was a vocalist beautiful beyond all others and that he had missed its music by appearing a very few days too late on the scene  during the last seven or eight years i have read this chapter several times with undiminished interest and with a feeling of keen sympathy for the writer in his disappointment for it is the case that i too all this time have been in chase of a small british songstera rare elusive bird hard to find at any time as it is to hear a nightingale pour out its full song in the last week in june in these years i have at every opportunity in spring summer and autumn sought for the bird in the southern half of england chiefly in the south and southwestern counties in the midlands and in devonshire where he was formerly well known but where the authorities say he is now extinct i failed to find him i found him altogether in four counties in a few widelyseparated localities in every case in such small numbers that i was reluctantly forced to give up a longcherished hope that this species might yet recover from the low state with regard to numbers in which it fingers and be permanently preserved as a member of the british avifauna  it would indeed hardly be reasonable to entertain such a hope when we consider that the furze wren or dartford warbler as it is named in books is a small frail insectivorous species a feeble flyer that must brave the winters at home that down to within thirty years ago it was fairly common though local in the south of england and ranged as far north as the borders of yorkshire and that in this period it has fallen to its present state when but a few pairs and small colonies wide apart exist in isolated patches of furze in four or five possibly six counties  there can be no doubt that the decline of this species which on account of its furzeloving habits must always be restricted to limited areas is directly attributable to the greed of private collectors who are all bound to have specimensas many as they can getboth of the bird and its nest and eggs its strictly local distribution made its destruction a comparatively easy task in 1873 gould wrote in his large work on british birds all the commons south of london from blackheath and wimbledon to the coast were formerly tenanted by this little bird but the increase in the number of collectors has i fear greatly thinned them in all the districts near the metropolis it is still however very abundant in many parts of surrey and hampshire it did not long continue very abundant gould was shown the bird and supplied with specimens by a man named smithers a birdstuffer of churt who was at that time collecting dartford warblers and their eggs for the trade and many private persons on the open heath and gorsegrown country that lies between farnham and haslemere gould in the work quoted adds as most british collectors must now be supplied with the eggs of the furze wren i trust mr smithers will be more sparing in the future so little sparing was he that when he died but few birds were left for others of his detestable trade who came after him  three or four years ago i got in conversation with a heathcutter on milford common a singular and brutallooking fellow of the halfgypsy devils punchbowl type described so ably by baringgould in his broom squire he told me that when he was a boy about thirtyfive years ago the furze wren was common in all that part of the country until smithers offer of a shilling for every clutch of eggs had set the boys from all the villages in the district hunting for the nests many a shilling had he been paid for the nests he found but in a few years the birds became rare and he added that he had not now seen one for a very long time  in clarks kennedys birds of berkshire and buckinghamshire we get a glimpse of the furze wren collecting business at an earlier date and nearer the metropolis in 1868 he wrotethe only locality in the two counties in which this species is at all numerous is a common in the vicinity of sunninghill where it is found breeding every summer and from whence a person in the neighbourhood obtains specimens at all times of the year with which to supply the london birdstuffers  when the district worked by smithers and the neighbouring commons round godalming where newman in his letters of rusticus says he had seen the tops of the furze quite alive with these birds had been depleted other favourite haunts of the little doomed furzelover were visited and for a time yielded a rich harvest in a few years the bird was practically extirpated in the sixties and seventies it was common now there are many young ornithologists with us who have never seen it in this country at all events in a state of nature in some cases even persons interested in bird life some of them naturalists too did not know what was going on in their immediate neighbourhood until after the bird was gone i met with a case of the kind a very strange case indeed in the summer of 1899 at a place near the south coast where the bird was common after it had been destroyed in surrey but does not now exist in my search for information i paid a visit to the octogenarian vicar of a small rustic village he was a native of the parish and loved his home above all places even as white loved selborne and had been a clergyman in it for over sixty years moreover he was i was told a keen naturalist and though not a collector nor a writer of books he knew every plant and every wild animal to be found in the parish he better than another i imagined would be able to give me some authentic local information  i found him in his studya tall handsome whitehaired old man very feeble he rose and supporting his steps with a long staff led me out into the grounds and talked about nature but his memory like his strength was failing he seemed indeed but the ruin of a man although still of a very noble presence what he called the vicarage gardens where we strolled about among the trees was a place without walks all overgrown with grass and wildings for roses and dahlias he showed me fennel goatsbeard henbane and common hounds tongue and when speaking of their nature he stroked their leaves and stems caressingly he loved these better than the gardeners blooms and so did i but i wanted to hear about the vanished birds of the district particularly the furze wren which had survived all the others that were gone  his dim eyes brightened for a moment with old pleasant memories of days spent in observing these birds and leading me to a spot among the trees from which there was a view of the open country beyond he pointed to a great green down a couple of miles away and told me that on the other side i would come on a large patch of furze and that by sitting quietly there for half an hour or so i might see a dozen furze wrens then he added a dozen did i say why i saw not fewer than forty or fifty flitting about the bushes the very last time i went there and i daresay if you are patient enough you will see quite as many  i assured him that there were no furze wrens at the spot he had indicated nor anywhere in that neighbourhood and i ventured to add that he must be telling me of what he had witnessed a good many years ago no not so many he returned and i am astonished and grieved to hear that the birds are gonefour or five years perhaps no it was longer ago you are righti think it must be at least fifteen years since i went to that spot the last time i am not so strong as i was and for some years have not been able to take any long walks  fifteen years may seem but a short space of time to a man verging on ninety in the mournful story of the extermination of rare and beautiful british birds for the cabinet it is in reality a long period fifteen years ago the honey buzzard was a breeding species in england and had doubtless been so for thousands of years when the price of a britishkilled specimen rose to £25 and of a britishtaken egg to two or three or four pounds the bird quickly ceased to exist probably there is not a local ornithologist in all the land who could not say of some species that bred annually within the limits of his own country that it has not been extirpated within the last fifteen years  in the instance just related when the aged vicar sorrying at the loss of the birds began to recall the rare pleasure it had given him to watch them disporting themselves among the furzebushes something of the illusion which had been in his mind imparted itself to mine for i could see what he was mentally seeing and the fifteen years dwindled to a very brief space of time like burroughs with the nightingale i too had arrived a few days too late on the scene the cursed collector had been beforehand with me as had indeed been the case on so many previous occasions with regard to other species  a short time after my interview with the aged vicar at an inn a very few miles from the village i met a person who interested me in an exceedingly unpleasant way he was a big repulsivelooking man in a black greasy coata human animal to be avoided but i overheard him say something about rare birds which caused me to put on a friendly air and join in the talk he was a kentish man who spent most of his time in driving about from village to village and from farm to farm in the southern counties in search of bargains and was prepared to buy for cash down anything he could find cheap from an old teapot or a print or copper scuttle to a horse or cart or pig or a houseful of furniture he also bought rare birds in the flesh or stuffed and was no doubt in league with a good many honest gamekeepers in those counties i had heard of travellers sent out by the great bird stuffers to go the rounds of all the big estates in some parts of england but this scoundrel appeared to be a traveller in the business on his own account i asked him if he had done anything lately in dartford warblers he at once became confidential and said he had done nothing but hoped shortly to do something very good indeed the bird he said was supposed to be extinct in kent and on that account specimens obtained in that county would command a high price now he had but recently discovered that a fewtwo or three pairsexisted at one spot and he was anxious to finish the business he had on hand so as to go there and secure them in answer to further questions he said that the birds were in a place where they could not very well be shot but that made no difference he had a simple effective way of getting them without a gun and he was sure that not one would escape him  on my mentioning the fact that the kent county council had obtained an order for an all the year round protection of this very bird he looked at me out of the corners of his eyes and laughed but said nothing he took it as a rather good joke on my part  there is not the slightest doubt that our wealthy private collectors have created the class of injurious wretches to which this man belonged                                       to some who have glanced at a little dusty out of shape mummy of a bird labelled dartford warbler in a museum or private collection or under a glass shade it may seem that i speak too warmly of the pleasure which the sight of the small furzelover can give us they have never seen it in a state of nature and probably never will when i consider all these british passeres which seen at their best give most delight to the æsthetic sensethe jay the british bird of paradise as i have ventured to call it displaying his varicoloured feathers at a springtime gathering the yellowgreen longwinged wood wren most aërial and delicate of the woodland warblers the kingfisher flashing turquoise blue as he speeds by the elegant fawncoloured blackbearded tit clinging to the greygreen swaying reeds and springing from them with a belllike note and the rosetinted narrowshaped bottletit as he drifts by overhead in a flock the bright lively goldfinch scattering the silvery thistledown on the air the crossbill that quaint little manycoloured parrot of the north feeding on a pinecone the grey wagtail exhibiting his graceful motions and the goldencrested wren seen suspended motionless with swiftly vibrating wings above his mate concealed among the clustering leaves in appearance a great green hawkmoth his opened and flattened crest a shining flamecoloured disc or shield on his headwhen i consider all these and others i find that the peculiar charm of each does not exceed in degree that of the furze wrenseen at his best he is of the type of the whitethroat but idealised the familiar brown excitable sylvia pretty as he is and welcome to our hedges in april is in appearance but a rough study for the smaller more delicatelyfashioned and richlycoloured melizophilus or furzelover on account of his excessive rarity he can now be seen at his best only by those who are able to spend many days in searching and in watching who have the patience to sit motionless by the hour and at length the little hideling tired of concealment or overcome by curiosity shows himself and comes nearer and nearer until the ruby red of the small gemlike eye may been seen without aid to the vision a spritelike bird in his slender exquisite shape and his beautiful fits of excitement fantastic in his motions as he flits and flies from spray to spray now hovering motionless in the air like the wooing goldcrest anon dropping on a perch to sit jerking his long tail his crest raised his throat swollen chiding when he sings and singing when he chides like a refined and lesser sedge warbler in a frenzy his slateblack and chestnutred plumage showing rich and dark against the pure luminous yellow of the massed furze blossoms it is a sight of fairylike bird life and of flower which cannot soon be forgotten and i do not think that any man who has in him any love of nature and of the beautiful can see such a thing and exist with its image in his mind and not regard with an extreme bitterness of hatred those among us whose particular craze it is to collect such creatures thereby depriving us and our posterity of the delight the sight of them affords  of many curious experiences i have met in my quest of the rare little bird or of information concerning it i have related two or three i have one more to giveassuredly the strangest of all i was out for a days ramble with the members of a natural history society at a place the name of which must not be told and was walking in advance of the others with a mr a the leading ornithologist of the county one whose name is honourably known to all naturalists in the kingdom the dartford warbler he said in the course of conversation had unhappily long been extinct in the county now it happened that among those just behind us there was another local naturalist also well known outside his own countymr b let us call him when i separated from my companion this gentleman came to my side and said that he had overheard some of our talk and he wished me to know that mr a was in error in saying that the dartford warbler was extinct in the county there was one small colony of three or four pairs to be found at a spot ten to eleven miles from where we then were and he would be glad to take me to the place and show me the birds the existence of this small remnant had been known for several years to half a dozen persons who had jealously kept the secretto their great regret they had had to keep it from their best friend and chief supporter of their society mr a simply because it would not be safe with him he was enthusiastic about the native bird life the number of species the county could boast etc and sooner or later he would incautiously speak about the dartford warbler and the wealthy local collectors would hear of it with the result that the birds would quickly be gathered into their cabinets  my informant went on to say that the greatest offenders were four or five gentlemen in the place who were zealous collectors the county had obtained a stringent order with alltheyearround protection for its rare species much too had been done by individuals to create a public opinion favourable to bird protection and among the educated classes there was now a strong feeling against the destruction by private collectors of all that was best worth preserving in the local wild bird life but so far not the slightest effect had been produced in the principal offenders they would have the rare birds both the resident species and the occasional visitants and paid liberally for all specimens birdstuffers gamekeeperstheir own and their neighboursfowlers and all those who had a keen eye for a feathered rarity were in their pay and so the destruction went merrily on the worst of it was that the authors of the evil who were not only lawbreakers themselves but were paying others to break the law could not be touched no one could prosecute nor openly denounce them because of their important social position in the county  there was nothing new to me in all this it was an old familiar story i have given it fully simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country there is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs and lawbreakers both directly and indirectly every day of their lives they all take and pay for every rare visitant that comes in their way and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties in this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated within the last few years we have seen the disappearance as breeding species of the ruff and reeve marsh harrier and honey buzzard and the species now on the verge of extinction which will soon follow these and others that have gone before if indeed some of them have not already gone are the seaeagle osprey kite hen harrier montagus harrier stone curlew kentish plover dotterel rednecked phalarope roseate tern bearded tit greylag goose and great skua these in their turn will be followed by the chough hobby great blackbacked gull furze wren crested tit and others these are the species which as things are going will absolutely and for ever disappear as residents and breeders from off the british islands meanwhile other species that although comparatively rare are less local in their distribution are being annually exterminated in some parts of the country it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern england to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene and have lately been done to death there may still be met with in the wilder districts of scotland or in some forest in the north of wales finally we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times some quite recently or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrivalbittern little bittern night heron spoonbill stork avocet black tern hoopoe golden oriole and many others of less wellknown names  this is the case and that it is a bad one and wellnigh hopeless no man will deny nevertheless i believe that it may be possible to find a remedy  that destruction of beautiful things about which ruskin wrote despairingly of late ending in perfect blackness of catastrophe and ruin of all grace and glory in the land has fallen and continues to fall most heavily on the beautiful bird life of our country but the destruction has not been unremarked and unlamented and the existence of a strong and widespread public feeling in favour of the preservation of our wild birds has of late shown itself in many ways especially in the unopposed legislation on the subject during the last few years and the willingness that government and parliament have shown recently to consider a new act there is no doubt that this feeling will grow until it becomes too strong even for the selfish philistines who are blind to all grace and glory in nature and incapable of seeing anything in a rare and beautiful bird but an object to be collected those who in the years to come will inherit the numberless useless private collections now being formed will make haste to rid themselves of such unhappy legacies by thrusting them upon local museums or by destroying them outright in their anxiety to have it forgotten that one of their name had a part in the detestable business of depriving the land of these wonderful and beautiful forms of lifea life which future generations would have cherished as a dear and sacred possession  but we cannot afford to wait we have been made too poor in species already and are losing something further every year we want a remedy now  so far two suggestions have been made one is an alteration in the existing law which will allow the infliction of far heavier fines on offenders all those who are acquainted with collectors and their ways will at once agree that increased penalties will not meet the case that the only effect of such an alteration in the law would be to make collectors and the persons employed by them more careful than they have yet found it necessary to be the other suggestion vaguely put forth is that something of the nature of a private inquiry agency should be established to find out the offenders and that they should be pilloried in the columns of some widelycirculating journal a method which has been tried with some success in the cases of other classes of obnoxious persons this suggestion may be dismissed at once as of no value not one offence in a hundred would be discovered by such means and the greatest sinners who are not infrequently the most intelligent men would escape scot free  perhaps i should have said that three suggestions have been made for there is yet another put forward by mr richard kearton in one of his late books he is thoroughly convinced he tells us that the county council orders are perfectly useless in the case of any and every rare bird which collectors covet and on that point we are all agreed he then says we should select a dozen species admitted by a committee of practical ornithologists to be in danger and afford them personal protection during the whole of the breeding season by placing reliable watchers night and day upon the nestingground  watchers provided and paid by individuals and associations have been in existence these many years and this is undoubtedly the best plan in the case of all species which breed in colonies these are mostly seabirdsgulls terns cormorants guillemots razorbills etc our rare birds are distributed over the country and in the case of some if a hundred pairs of a species exist in the british islands a hundred or two hundred watchers would have to be engaged but who that has any knowledge of what goes on in the collecting world does not know that the guarded birds would be the first to vanish i have seen such thingspairs of rare birds breeding in private grounds where the keepers had strict orders to watch over them and no stranger could enter without being challenged and in a little while they have mysteriously disappeared the watcher is good enough on the exposed seacoast or island where an eye is kept on his doings and where the large number of birds in his charge enables him to do a little profitable stealing and still keep up an appearance of honesty i have visited most of the watched colonies and therefore know the watchers who were paid a pound a week for guarding the nests were not chary of their hints and i have also been told in very plain words that i could have any eggs i wanted  it is hardly necessary to say here that the proposed alteration in the law to make it protective of all species will so far as the private collector is concerned leave matters just as they are  there is really only one way out of the difficultyone remedy for an evil which grows in spite of penalties and of public opinionnamely a law to forbid the making of collections of british birds by private persons if all that has been done in and out of parliament since 1868 to preserve our wild birdsnot merely the common abundant species which are not regarded by collectors but all speciesis not to be so much labour wasted such a law must sooner or later be made it will not be denied by any private collector whether he clings to the old delusion that it is to the advantage of science that he should have cabinets full of british killed specimens or notit will not be denied that the drain on our wild bird life caused by collecting is a constantly increasing one and that no fresh legislation on the lines of previous bird protection acts can arrest or diminish that drain thirty years ago when the first act was passed which prohibited the slaughter of seabirds during the breeding season the drain on the bird life which is valued by collectors was far less than it is now not only because there are a dozen or more collectors now where there was one in the sixties but also because the business of collecting has been developed and brought to perfection all the localities in which the rare resident species may be looked for are known while the collectors all over the country are in touch with each other and have a system of exchanges as complete as it is deadly to the birds then there is the money element birdcollecting is not only the hobby of hundreds of persons of moderate means and of moderate wealth but like horseracing yachting and other expensive forms of sport it now attracts the very wealthy and is even a pastime of millionaires all this is a familiar fact and clearly shows that without such a law as i have suggested it has now become impossible to save the best of our wild bird life  the collectors will doubtless cry out that such a law would be a monstrous injustice and an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject that there is really no more harm in collecting birds and their eggs than in collecting old prints guatemalan postage stamps samplers and first editions of minor poets that to compel them to give up their treasures which have cost them infinite pains and thousands of pounds to get together and to abandon the pursuit in which their happiness is placed would be worse than confiscation and downright tyranny that the private collectors cannot properly be described as lawbreakers and injurious persons since they count among their numbers hundreds of country gentlemen of position professional men including clergymen noblemen magistrates and justices of the peace and distinguished naturalistsall honourable men  to put in one word on this last very delicate point where in collecting does the honourable man draw the line and sternly refuse to enrich his cabinet with a longwishedfor specimen of a rare british speciesa specimen in the flesh not only british killed but obtained in the county not killed wantonly nor stolen by some poaching rascal but unhappily shot in mistake for something else by an ignorant young underkeeper who in fear of a wigging took it secretly to a friend at a distance and gave it to him to get rid of the story of the unfortunate killing of the rare bird varies in each case when it has to be told to one whose standard of morality is very high even with regard to his hobby my experience is that where there are collectors who are men of means there you find their parasites who know how to treat them and who feed on their enthusiasms  in my rambles about the country during the last few years i have neglected no opportunity of conversing with landowners and large tenants on this subject and with the exception of one man all those i have spoken to agreed that owners generallynot nine in every ten as i had put it but ninetynine in every hundredwould gladly welcome a law to put down the collecting of british birds by private persons the one man who disagreed is the owner of an immense estate and he was the bitterest of all in denouncing the scoundrels who came to steal his birds and if a law could be made to put an end to such practices he would he said be delighted but he drew the line at forbidding a man to collect birds on his own property no no he concluded that would be an interference with the liberty of the subject then it came out that he was a collector himself and was very proud of the rare species in his collection if i had known that before i should not have gone out of my way to discuss the subject with him  clearly then there is a very strong case for legislation how strong the case is i am not yet able to show my means not having enabled me to carry out an intention of discussing the subject with a much greater number of landowners and of addressing a circular later stating the case to all the landlords and shootingtenants in the country that remains to be done in the meantime this chapter will serve to bring the subject to the attention of a considerable number of persons who would prefer that our birds should be preserved rather than that they should be exterminated in the interests of a certain number of individuals whose amusement it is to collect such objects  that a law on the lines suggested will be made sooner or later is my belief that it may come soon is my hope and prayer lest we have to say of the dartford warbler and of twenty other species named in this chapter as we have had to say of so many others that have gone     the beautiful is vanished and returns not                                          notethe foregoing chapter albeit written so many years ago    is still uptodatestill represents without a shadow of a    shade of difference the state of the case the extermination of    our rare birds and occasional visitors still goes merrily on    in defiance of the law and the worst offenders are still    received with open arms by the british ornithologists union    indeed that society from the point of view of many of its    members would have no raison dêtre if membership were denied    to the private collector of rare british killed birds and    their eggs and to the scientific ornithologist whose mission    is to add several new species annually to the british list    they still dine together and exhibit their specimens to one    another on the last occasion of my attending one of these    meetings a member exhibited a small bird in the flesha bird    from some far country which had been shot somewhere on the east    coast and was so knocked to pieces by the shot that the    ornithologists had great difficulty in identifying it although    a collector himself he was anxious to dispose of the specimen    but none of his brother collectors would give him a fivepound    note for it owing to its condition it was handed round and    examined and discussed by all the authorities present i stood    apart looking at a group of ornithologists bending over the    shattered specimen all talking and arguing when another    member who by chance was not a collector moved to my side and    whispered in my ear just like a lot of little children     is it not time to say to these little children that they must    find a new toya fresh amusement to fill their vacant hours    that birdsliving flying birdsare a part of nature of this    visible world in this island the dwellingplace of some    fortyfive or fifty millions of souls that these millions have    a right in the countrys wild life toosurely a better one    than that of a few hundreds of gentlemen of leisure who have    money to hire gamekeepers birdstuffers wildfowlers and    many others to break the law for them and to take the    punishment when any is given     by saying it will be understood that i mean enacting a law to    prohibit private collection it is surely time but what    prospects are there of such an act being passed by a parliament    which has spent six years playing with a plumage prohibition    bill     well just now we have a committee appointed by the government    to consider the whole question of bird protection with a view    to fresh legislation will this committee recommend the one and    only way to put a stop to the continuous destruction of our    rarer birds i dont think so for such a law would be aimed at    those of their own class at their friends at themselves     at the end of the chapter i gave an account of an interview i    had with a great landowner who happened to be a collector and    who cried out that such a law as the one i suggested would be    an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject    another interview years later was with one who is not only a    landowner the head of a branch of a great family in the land    but a great power in the political world as well and finally    not wonderful to relate a great protector of birds no    he said warmly i will not for a moment encourage you to hope    that any good will come of such a proposal if any person    should bring in such a measure i would do everything in my    power to defeat it i am a collector myself and i am perfectly    sure that such an interference with the liberty of the subject    would not be tolerated     that i take it is or will be the attitude of the committee    now considering the subject of our wild bird life and its    better protection     chapter xiii  vertvert or parrot gossip   i am not an admirer of pet parrots to me and i have made the discovery that to many others too it is a depressing experience on a first visit to nice people to find that a parrot is a member of the family as a rule he is the most important member when i am compelled to stand in the admiring circle to look on and to listen while he exhibits his weary accomplishments it is but lip service that i render my eyes are turned inward and a vision of a green forest comes before them resounding with the wild glad mad cries of flocks of wild parrots this is done purposely and the sound which i mentally hear and the sight of their varicoloured plumage in the dazzling sunlight are a corrective and keep me from hating the bird before me because of the imbecility of its owners in his proper place which is not in a tin cage in a room of a house he is to be admired above most birds and i wish i could be where he is living his wild life that i could have again a swarm of parrots angry at my presence hovering above my head and deafening me with their outrageous screams but i cannot go to those beautiful distant placesi must be content with an image and a memory of things seen and heard and with the occasional sight of a bird or birds kept by some intelligent person also with an occasional visit to the parrot house in regents park there the uproar when it is at its greatest when innumerable discordant voices shrill and raucous unite in one voice and one great cry and persons of weak nerves stop up their ears and fly from such a pandemonium is highly exhilarating  of the most interesting captive parrots i have met in recent years i will speak here of two the first was a st vincent bird chrysotis guildingi brought home with seven other parrots of various species by lady thompson the wife of the then administrator of the island this is a handsome bird green with blue head and yellow tail and is a member of an american genus numbering over forty species he received his funny specific name in compliment to a clergyman who was a zealous collector not of mens souls but of birds skins to ornithologists this parrot is interesting on account of its rarity for the last thirty years it has existed in small numbers and as it is confined to the island of st vincent it is feared that it may become extinct at no distant date altogether there are about five hundred species of parrots in the world or about as many parrots as there are species of birds of all kinds in europe from the great bustard the hooper swan and golden eagle to the little bottletit whose minute body stript of its feathers may be put in a ladys thimble and of this multitude of parrots the st vincent chrysotis if it still exists is probably the rarest  the parrot i have spoken of with his seven travelling companions arrived in england in december and a few days later their mistress witnessed a curious thing on a cold grey morning they were enjoying themselves on their perches in a wellwarmed room in london before a large window when suddenly they all together emitted a harsh cry of alarm or terrorthe sound which they invariably utter on the appearance of a bird of prey in the sky but at no other time looking up quickly she saw that snow in big flakes had begun to fall it was the birds first experience of such a phenomenon but they had seen and had been taught to fear something closely resembling falling flakesflying feathers to wit the fear of flying feathers is universal among species that are preyed upon by hawks in a majority of cases the birds that exhibit terror and fly into cover or sit closely have never actually seen that winged thunderbolt the peregrine falcon strike down a duck or pigeon sending out a small cloud of feathers or even a harrier or sparrowhawk pulling out and scattering the feathers of a bird it has captured but a tradition exists among them that the sight of flying feathers signifies danger to bird life  when i was in the young barbarian stage and my playmates were gaucho boys on horseback on the pampas they taught me to catch partridges in their simple way with a slender cane twenty to twentyfive feet long a running noose at its tip made from the fine pliant shaft of a rheas wing feather the bird was not a real partridge though it looks like it but was the common or spotted tinamou of the plains nothura maculosa as good a table bird as our partridge our method was when we flushed a bird to follow its swift straight flight at a gallop and mark the exact spot where it dropped to earth and vanished in the grass then to go round the spot examining the ground until the tinamou was detected in spite of his protective colouring sitting close among the dead and fading grass and herbage the cane was put out the circle narrowed until the small noose was exactly over the birds head so that when he sprang into the air on being touched by the slender tip of the cane he caught and strangled himself to make the bird sit tight until the noose was actually over his head we practised various tricks and a very common one was on catching sight of the closesquatting partridge to start plucking feathers from a previouslykilled bird hanging to our belt and scatter them on the wind sometimes we were saved the trouble of scattering feathers when we were followed by a pair of big carrion hawks on the lookout for an escaped bird or for any trifle we throw to them to keep them with us the effect was the same in both cases the sight of the flying feathers was just as terrifying as that of the big hovering hawks and caused the partridge to sit close  this way of taking the tinamou may seem unsportsmanlike well if i were a boy in a wild land againwith my present feelings about bird life i meani should not do it nor would i shoot them for i take it that the gun is the deadliest instrument our cunning brains have devised to destroy birds in spite of their bright instinct of selfpreservation their faculty of flight and their intelligence it is a hundred times more effective than the boyonhorsebacks long cane with its noose made of an ostrich feathertherefore more unsportsmanlike  to return the resemblance of falling flakes to flying white feathers does not deceive birds accustomed to the sight of snow it is very striking nevertheless and so generally recognised that most persons in europe have heard of the old woman plucking her geese in the sky it is curious to find the subject discussed in herodotus in book iv he says the scythians say that those lands which are situated in the northernmost parts of their territories are neither visible nor practicable by reason of the feathers that fall continually on all sides for the earth is so entirely covered and the air is so full of these feathers that the sight is altogether obstructed further on he says touching the feathers  my opinion is that perpetual snows fall in those parts though probably in less quantity during the summer than in winter and whoever has observed great abundance of snow falling will easily comprehend what i say for snow is not unlike feathers  probably the scythians had but one word to designate both to go back to the st vincent parrot concerning a bird of that species i have heard and cannot disbelieve a remarkable story during the early years of the last century a gentleman went out from england to look after some landed property in the island which had come to him by inheritance and when out there he paid a visit to a friend who had a plantation in the interior his friend was away when he arrived and he was conducted by a servant into a large darkened cool room and tired with his long ride in the hot sun he soon fell asleep in his chair before long a loud noise awoke him and from certain scrubbing sounds he made out that a couple of negro women were engaged in washing close to him on the other side of the lowered window blinds and that they were quarrelling over their task of course the poor women did not know that he was there but he was a man of a sensitive mind and it was a torture to him to have to listen to the torrents of exceedingly bad language they discharged at one another it made him angry presently his friend arrived and welcomed him with a hearty handshake and asked him how he liked the place he answered that it was a very beautiful place but he wondered how his friend could tolerate those women with their tongues so close to his windows women with their tongues what did he mean exclaimed the other in great surprise he meant he said those wretched nigger washerwomen outside the window his host thereupon threw up the blind and both looked out no living creature was there except a st vincent parrot dozing on his perch in the shaded verandah ah i see the parrot said his friend and he apologised and explained that some of the niggers had taken advantage of the birds extraordinary quickness in learning to teach him a lot of improper stuff  another parrot which interested me more than the st vincent bird was a member of the same numerous genus a doublefronted amazon chrysotis lavalainte a larger bird green with face and forepart of head pure yellow and some crimson colour in the wings and tail i came upon it at an inn the lamb at hindon a village in the south wiltshire downs one could plainly see that it was a very old bird and judging from the ragged state of its plumage that it had long fallen into the period of irregular or imperfect moultthe sere the yellow leaf in the birds life it also had the tremor of the very agedman or bird but its eyes were still as bright as polished yellow gems and full of the almost uncanny parrot intelligence the voice too was loud and cheerful its call to its mistressmother mother would ring through the whole rambling old house he talked and laughed heartily and uttered a variety of powerful whistling notes as round and full and modulated as those of any grey parrot now all that would not have attracted me much to the bird if i had not heard its singular history told to me by its mistress the landlady she had had it in her possession fifty years and its story was as follows  her fatherinlaw the landlord of the lamb had a beloved son who went off to sea and was seen and heard of no more for a space of fourteen years when one day he turned up in the possession of a sailors usual fortune acquired in distant barbarous landsa parrot in a cage this he left with his parents charging them to take the greatest care of it as it was really a very wonderful bird as they would soon know if they could only understand its language and he then began to make ready to set off again promising his mother to write this time and not to stay away more than five or at most ten years  meanwhile his father who was anxious to keep him succeeded in bringing about a meeting between him and a girl of his acquaintance one who he believed would make his son the best wife in the world the young wanderer saw and loved and as the feeling was returned he soon married and endowed her with all his worldly possessions which consisted of the parrot and cage eventually he succeeded his father as tenant of the lamb where he died many years ago the widow was grey when i first knew her and old like her parrot and she was like the bird too in her youthful spirit and the brilliance of her eyes  her young sailor had picked up the bird at vera cruz in mexico he saw a girl standing in the market place with the parrot on her shoulder she was talking and singing to the bird and the bird was talking whistling and singing back to hersinging snatches of songs in spanish it was a wonderful bird and he was enchanted and bought it and brought it all the way back to england and wiltshire it was the girl had told him just five years old and as fifty years had gone by it was when i first knew it or was supposed to be fiftyfive in its wiltshire home it continued to talk and sing in spanish and had two favourite songs which delighted everybody although no one could understand the words by and by it took to learning words and sentences in english and spoke less in spanish year after year until in about ten to twelve years that language had been completely forgotten its memory was not as good as that of humboldts celebrated parrot of the maipures which had belonged to the apures tribe before they were exterminated by the caribs their language perished with them only the longliving parrot went on talking it this parrot story took the fancy of the public and was retold in a hundred books and was made the subject of poems in several countriesone by our own pleasures of hope campbell  nevertheless i thought it would be worth while trying a little spanish on old polly of the lamb and thought it best to begin by making friends it was of little use to offer her something to eat poll was a person who rather despised sweeties and kickshaws it had been the custom of the house for half a century to allow polly to eat what she liked and when she liked and as sheit was really a hewas of a social disposition she preferred taking her meals with the family and eating the same food at breakfast she would come to the table and partake of bacon and fried eggs also toast and butter and jam and marmalade at dinner it was a cut off the joint with usually two vegetables then pudding or tart with pippins and cheese to follow between meals she amused herself with bird seed but preferred a meaty muttonbone which she would hold in one hand or foot and feed on with great satisfaction it was not strange that when i held out food for her she took it as an insult and when i changed my tactics and offered to scratch her head she lost her temper altogether and when i persisted in my advances she grew dangerous and succeeded in getting in several nips with her huge beak which drew blood from my fingers  it was only then after all my best blandishments had been exhausted and when our relations were at their worst that i began talking to her in spanish in a sort of caressing falsetto like a native girl calling her lorito instead of polly coupled with all the endearing epithets commonly used by the women of the green continent in addressing their green pets polly instantly became attentive she listened and listened coming down nearer to listen better the one eye she fixed on me shining like a fiery gem but she spoke no word spanish or english only from time to time little low inarticulate sounds came from her it was evident after two or three days that she was powerless to recall the old lore but to me it also appeared evident that some vague memory of a vanished time had been evokedthat she was conscious of a past and was trying to recall it at all events the effect of the experiment was that her hostility vanished and we became friends at once she would come down to me step on to my hand climb to my shoulder and allow me to walk about with her  it saddened me a few months later to receive a letter from her mistress announcing pollys death on 2nd december 1909  i have thought since that this bird instead of being only five years old when bought was probably aged twentyfive years or more naturally the girl who had been sent into the marketplace to dispose of the bird would tell a possible buyer that it was young the parrots one wants to buy are generally stated to be five years old however it may be that the bird grew old before its time on account of its extraordinary dietary the parrot may have an adaptive stomach still one is inclined to think that half a century of fried eggs and bacon roast pork boiled beef and carrots steak and onions and stewed rabbit must have put a rather heavy strain on its system  many parrots have lived longer than polly in captivity long as her life was and here it strikes me as an odd circumstance that pollys specific name was bestowed on the species the doublefronted amazon as a compliment to the distinguished french ornithologist la valainte who has himself recorded the greatest age to which a captive parrot has been known to attain this bird was the familiar african grey species he says that it began to lose its memory at the age of sixty to moult irregularly at sixtyfive that it became blind at ninety and died aged ninetythree  we may well believe that if parrots are able to exist for fifty years to a century in the unnatural conditions in which they are kept caged or chained in houses overfed without using their enormouslydeveloped wingmuscles the constant exercise of which must be necessary to perfect health and vigour their life in a state of nature must be twice as long  to return to parrots in general this bird has perhaps more points of interest for us than any other of the entire class his long life unique form and brilliant colouring extreme sociability intelligence beyond that of most birds and last his faculty of imitating human speech more perfectly than the birds of other families  the last is to most persons the parrots greatest distinction to me it is his least i do not find it so wonderful as the imitative faculty of some mocking birds or even of our delightful little marshwarbler described in another book this may be because i have never had the good fortune to meet with a shining example for we know there is an extraordinary difference in the talking powers of parrots even in those of the same speciesdifferences as great in fact as we find in the reasoning faculty between dog and dog and in the songs of different birds of the same species not once but on several occasions i have heard a song from some common bird which took my breath away with astonishment i have described in another book certain blackbirds of genius i have encountered and what a wonderful song that caged canary in a country inn must have had which tempted the great lord peterborough a man of some shining qualities to get the bird from its mistress an old woman who loved it and refused to sell it to him by means of a dishonest and very mean trick denied the bird he examined it minutely and went on his way in due time he returned with a canary closely resembling the one he wanted in size colour and markings concealed on his person he ordered dinner and when the good woman was gone from the room to prepare it changed his bird for hers then having had his meal went on his way rejoicing still he was curious to learn the effect of his trick and whether or not she had noticed any difference in her loved bird so after a long interval he came once more to the inn and seeing the bird in its cage in the old place began to speak in praise of its beautiful singing as he had heard it and remembered it so well she replied sadly that since he listened to and wanted to buy it an unaccountable change had come over her bird it was silent for a spell perhaps sick but when it resumed singing its voice had changed and all the beautiful notes which everyone admired were lost the great man expressed his regret and went away chuckling at his deliciously funny joke  the ordinary talking parrot is no more to me than the ordinary or average canary piping his thin expressionless notes he is a prodigy i am pleased not to know on the other hand there are numerous authenticated cases of parrots possessed of really surprising powers and it was doubtless the mimicking powers of such birds of genius which suggested such fictions as that of the totá kuhami in the east and in europe gressets lively tale of vert vert and the convent nuns  it was perhaps a parrot of this rare kind which played so important a part in the early history of south america it is nothing but a legend of the guarani nation which inhabit paraguay nevertheless i do believe that we have here an account mainly true of an important event in the early history of the race or nation this parrot is not the impossible bird of the fictitious totá kahami order we all know who not only mimics our speech but knows the meaning of the words he utters he was nothing but a mimic exceptionally clever and the moral of the story is the familiar one that great events may proceed from the most trivial causes once the passions of men are inflamed  the tradition was related centuries ago to the jesuit fathers in paraguay and i give it as they tell it briefly                                       in the beginning a great canoe came over the waters from the east and was stranded on the shores of brazil out of the canoe came the brothers tupi and guarani and their sons and daughters with their husbands and wives and their children and childrens children  tupi was the leader and being the eldest was called the father and tupi said to his brother behold this great land with all its rivers and forests abounding in fish and birds and beasts and fruit is ours for there are no other men dwelling in it but we are few in number let us therefore continue to live together with our children in one village  guarani consented and for many years they lived together in peace and amity like one family until at last there came a quarrel to divide them and it was all about a parrot that could talk and laugh and sing just like a man a woman first found it in the forest and not wishing to burden herself with the rearing of it she gave it to another woman so well did it learn to talk from its new mistress that everybody admired it and it grew to be the talk of the village  then the woman who had found and brought it seeing how much it was admired and talked about went and claimed it as her own the other refused to give it up saying that she had reared it and had taught it all it knew and by doing so had become its rightful owner  now no person could say which was in the right and the dispute was not ended and tongues continued wagging until the husbands of the two women became engaged in the quarrel and then brothers and sisters and cousins were drawn into it until the whole village was full of bitterness and strife all because of the parrot and men of the same blood for the first time raised weapons against one another and some were wounded and others killed in open fight and some were treacherously slain when hunting in the forest  now when things had come to this pass tupi the father called his brother to him and said o brother guarani this is a day of grief to us who had looked to the spending of our remaining years together with all our children at this place where we have lived so long now this can no longer be on account of the great quarrel about a parrot and the shedding of blood for only by separating our two families can we save them from destroying one another come then let us divide them and lead them away in opposite directions so that when we settle again they may be far apart guarani consented and he also said that tupi was the elder and their head and was called the father and it was therefore in his right to remain in possession of the village and of all that land and to end his days in it he on his part would call his people together and lead them to a land so distant that the two families would never see nor hear of each other again and there would be no more bitter words and strife between them  then the two old brothers bade each other an eternal farewell and guarani led his people south a great distance and travelled many moons until he came to the river paraguay and settled there and his people still dwell there and are called by his name to this day  only i beg to add they do not call their nation by that word as the spanish colonists first spelt it in their carelessness and as they pronounce it heaven knows how we pronounce it they the guarani people call themselves wäränäeé in a soft musical voice also they call their river which we spell paraguay and pronounce i dont know how päräwäeé     chapter xiv  something pretty in a glass case   it was said by a norfolk naturalist more than threequarters of a century ago that the desire to possess something pretty in a glass case caused the killing of very many birds especially of such as were rare and beautiful which if allowed to exist in our country would maintain the species and be a constant source of pleasure to all who beheld them for who walking by a riverside does not experience a thrill of delight at the sudden appearance in the field of vision of that living jewel the shining blue kingfisher this is one of the favourites of all who desire to have something pretty in a glass case in the cottage parlour in room of the longvanished pyramid of wax flowers and fruit it is however not only the common people the cottager and the village publican who desire to possess such ornaments you see them also in baronial halls many a time on visiting a great house the first thing the owner has drawn my attention to has been his stuffed birds in a glass case but in the great houses the peregrine and hobby and goshawk and buzzard and harrier are more prized than the kingfisher and other pretty little birds  the philistine we know is everywhere and is of all classes  it is to me a cause of astonishment that these mournful mementoes should be regarded as they appear to be as objects pleasing to the eye like pictures and statues tapestries and other decorative works of art the sight of a stuffed bird in a house is revolting to me it outrages our sense of fitness and is as detestable as stuffed birds and wings tails and heads and beaks of murdered and mutilated birds on womens headgear properly speaking said st george mivart in his greatest work there is no such thing as a dead bird the life is the bird and when that has gone out what remains is the case these dead empty cases are as much to me as to any naturalist and i can examine the specimens in a museum cabinet with interest but the mental attitude is changed at the sight of these same dead empty cases set up in imitation of the living creature and the more cleverly the stuffer has done his work the more detestable is the result  it may be that some vague notion of a faint remnant of life lingering in the lifelike specimen with glass eyes is the cause of my hatred of the feathered ornament in a glass case at all events i have had one experience to be related here which has almost made me believe that the idea of a sort of postmortem life in the stuffed bird is not wholly fanciful i will call it   a dialogue of the dead and stuffed  ever since i came the wind has been blowing a gale on this furthermost lonely melancholy coast as if i had got not only to the lands end but to the end of the world itself to the confines of old chaos his kingdom a region where the elements are in everlasting conflict two or three times during the afternoon i have resolutely put on my cap and waterproof and gone out to face it only to be quickly driven in again by the bitter furious blast yet it was almost as bad indoors to have to sit and listen by the hour to its ravings from time to time i get up and look through the windowpane at the few cold grey naked cottages and empty bleak fields divided by naked grey stone fences and beyond the fields the foamflecked colder greyer more desolate ocean would it be better i wonder to fight my way down to those waveloosened masses of granite by the sea where i would hear the roar and thunder of the surf instead of this perpetual insane howling and screaming of the wind round the house i turn from the window with a shiver a splash of rain hurled against it has blotted the landscape out i go back once more to my comfortable easychair by the fire patience patience by and by i say to myselfi say it many times overdaylight will be gone then the lamp will be brought in the curtains drawn and tea will follow with buttered toast and other good things then the solacing pipe and thoughts and memories and some pleasant waking drawn to while away the time  what shall this dream be ah what but the best of all possible dreams on such a day as thisa dream of spring somewhere in the sweet west country i shall stand in a wood where beeches grow and it will be april near the end of the month before the leaves are large enough to hide the blue sky and the floating white clouds so far above their tops perhaps i shall sit down on one of the huge rootbranches coiled like a grey old snake so as to gaze at ease before me at the cloud of purplered boughs and interlacing twigs sprinkled over with golden buds and silky opening leaves of a fresh brilliant green that has no match on the earth or sea nor under the earth in the emerald mines i shall watch the loveflight of the cushat above the wood mounting higher and higher then gliding down on motionless dovecoloured wings and i shall listen to the wood wren ever wandering and singing in the treetopssinging that same insistent passionatepassionless strain to which one could listen for ever  i shall ask for no other song but there will be other creatures there down the tall grey trunk of a beech tree before me a squirrel will slipdown down nearly to the mossy roots then pause and remain so motionless as to seem like a squirrelshaped patch of bright chestnutred moss or lichen or alga on the grey bark and on the next tree but a little distance off i shall presently catch sight of another listener and watchera green woodpecker clinging vertically against the trunk so still as to look like a bird figure carved in wood and painted green and gold and crimson  just when i had got so far with the thought of what my dream was to be i raised my eyes from the fire and allowed them to rest attentively for the first time on a collection of ornaments crowded together in a niche in the wall at the side of the fireplace the ornamental objects one sees in a cottage are as a rule offensive to me and i have acquired the habit of not seeing them now i was compelled to look at these there were photographs little china vases and cups with boys or cupids and things of that kind these i did not regard my whole attention was directed to a pair of glassfronted cases and the living creatures in them they were not really alive but dead and stuffed and set up in lifelike attitudes and one was a squirrel the other a green woodpecker the squirrel with his back to his neighbour sat up on his mossy wood his bushy tail thrown along his back his two little hands grasping a hazelnut which he was in the act of conveying to his mouth the green woodpecker was placed vertically against his branch his side towards his neighbour his head turned partly round so that he looked directly at him with one eye that wideopen white glass eye and the whole attitude of the bird with his wings half open and beak raised gave him a wonderfully alert look so that after regarding him fixedly for some time i began to imagine that despite the old dead dusty look of the feathers there was something of life still remaining in him and that he really was watching his neighbour with the nut very intently  why of course he was alivealive and speaking to the squirrel i could hear him distinctly the wind outside was madly beating against the house and trying to force its way through the window and was making a hundred strange noiseslittle sharp shrill broken sounds that mixed with and filled the pauses between the wailing and shrieking gusts and somehow the woodpecker was catching these small sounds in his beak and turning them into words  hullo he said who are you and what are you doing there  im a squirrel responded the other ive said so over and over again but you will go on worrying me my only wish is that i could bring my tail just a little more to the right so as to hide my head and paws altogether from you  but you cant hullo squirrel what are you doing there you forgot to tell me that  im eating a nut confound you you know it ive told you ten thousand times i cant ever get it up quite close enough to bite it and i havent tasted one for seventeen years one forgets what a thing tastes like  i know ive been fasting just as long myself never an ants egg hullo have you got it up how does it taste  taste you fool if i could only move i wouldnt mind the nut id go for you like a shot and if i could get at you id tear you to pieces i hate you  why do you hate me squirrel  more questions because youre green and yellow like the woods where i lived there were beeches and oaks and because your head is crimson red like the agarics i used to find in the woods in autumn i used to eat them for fun just because they said they were poisonous and it would kill you to eat them  and thats what you died of hullo why dont you answer me where did you find red agarics  ive told you ive told you ive told you in treve woods where i lived very far from here on the other side of lostwithiel  treve woods between the hills away beyond lostwithiel why squirrel thats where i lived  so ive heard you have said it every day and every night these seventeen years i hate you  hullo why do you hate me  i always disliked woodpeckers i remember a pair that made a hole in a beech near the tree my drey was in i played those two yafflers with their laugh laugh laugh some good tricks and the best of all was when their young began to come out one morning when the old birds were away i hid myself in the fork above the hole and waited till they crept out and up close to me when i suddenly burst out upon them chattering and flourishing my tail and they were so terrified they actually lost their hold on the bark and tumbled right down to the ground how i enjoyed it  you malicious little red beast you chattering little red devil they were my young ones and i remember what a fright we were in when we came back and saw what had happened it was lucky we didnt lose one i shall never speak to you again there you may sit trying to eat your nut for another seventeen years and for a hundred years if this horrible life is going to last so long but youll never get another word from me  i thought that would touch you woodpecker ha ha hawhos the yaffler now what a relief at last i shall be left to eat my nut in peace and quiet here in this glass case where they put me  why did they put us here  you are speaking to me are the hundred years over so soon  theres no one elsewhat am i to do answer me why did they put us here answer me little red wretch i dont mind now what you didthey were not hurt after all you didnt know what you were doingyou had no young ones of your own  hadnt i indeed my little ones were there close by in the drey  and when they were out of the drey did you teach them to run about in the tree and jump from one branch to another and pass from tree to tree  i never saw them leave the dreyi was shot  where was that squirrel  in the treve woods where the big beeches are beyond lostwithiel  never why thats just where i lived and was shot too did it hurt you squirrel  i dont know i saw a flash and remembered no more until i found myself dead in the mans pocket pressed against some wet soft thing did it hurt you  yes very much i fell when he fired and tried to get away but he chased and caught me and the blood ran out on to his hand he wiped it off on his coat then squeezed my sides with his finger and thumb until i was dead then put me in his pocket there was some dead warm soft thing in it  here there was a break in the talk owing to a momentary lull in the wind i listened intently but the shrieking and wailing noises without had ceased and with them the sharp little voices had died away then suddenly the wind rose and shrieked again and the talk recommenced  hullo said the woodpecker do you see a man sitting by the fire looking at us he has been staring at us that way all the evening  what of it everyone who comes into this room and sits by the fire does the same its nothing new  it isit is listen to me squirrel he looks as if he could hear and understand us thats new isnt it and he has a strange look in his eyes do you know i think he is going mad  i dont mind woodpecker i shouldnt care if he were to run out on to the rocks at the lands end and cast himself into the sea  nor should i but just think if before rashing out to put an end to himself he should in his raving madness snatch down our cases from the niche and crush them into the grate with his heel  what do you mean woodpecker could such a thing happen  yes if he really is insane and if he is listening to us and we are making him worse  if i could believe such a thing i should cease to hate you woodpecker no no i cant believe it  just think old neighbour to have it end at last burnt up to ashes and smokefeathers and hair glass eyes cottonwool stuffing and all  never again to hear that everlasting hullo to hate you and hate you and tell you a thousand thousand times only to begin it all over again  to fly up away in the smoke out out out in the wind and rain  the rain the rain  the rain from the southwest that made me laugh my loudest raining all day wetting my green feathers wetting every green leaf in the woods beyond lostwithiel raining until all the stony gullies were filled to overflowing and the water ran and gurgled and roared until the whole wood was filled with the sound  no no woodpecker i cant i cant believe it  its true its true dont you see it coming squirrel look at him look at him now now at last at last at last  suddenly their sharp agitated voices fell to a broken whispering and died into silence for the wind had lulled again looking closely at them i thought i could see a new expression in their immovable glass eyes it frightened me i began to be frightened at myself for it now seemed to me that i really was becoming insane and i was suddenly seized with a fierce desire to snatch the cases down and crush them into the fire with my heel to save myself from such a mad act i jumped up and picking up my candle hurried upstairs to my bedroom no sooner did i reach it than the wind was up again wailing and shrieking louder than ever and between the gusts there were the murmurings and strange small noises of the wind in the roof and once more i began to catch the sound of their renewed talk gone gone they said or seemed to say our last hope what shall we do what shall we do years years years then by and by the tone changed and there were question and answer when was that squirrel i heard and then a furious quarrel with curses from the squirrel and hullos and renewed questions from the woodpecker and memories of their life and death in treve wood beyond lostwithiel  what wonder that when hours later i fell asleep i had the most distressing and maddest dreams imaginable  one dream was that when men die and go to hell they are sent in large basketsfull to the taxidermists of the establishment who are highly proficient in the art and set them up in the most perfect lifelike attitudes with wideawake glass eyes blue or dark in their sockets their hair varnished to preserve its natural colour and glossy appearance they are placed separately in glass cases to keep them from the dust and the cases are set up in pairs in niches in the walls of the palace of hell the lord of the place takes great pride in these objects one of his favourite amusements is to sit in his easychair in front of a niche to listen by the hour to the endless discussions going on between the two specimens in which each expresses his virulent but impotent hatred of the other damning his glass eyes at the same time relating his own happy life and adventures in the upper sunlit world how important a person he was in his own parish of borough and what a gorgeous time he was having when he was unfortunately nabbed by one of the collectors or gamekeepers in his lordships service     chapter xv  selborne   1896  first impressions of faces are very much to us vivid and persistent even long after they have been judged false they will from time to time return to console or mock us it is much the same with places for these too an ineradicable instinct will have it are persons few in number are the towns and villages which are dear to us whose memory is always sweet like that of one we love those that wake no emotion that are remembered much as we remember the faces of a crowd of shop assistants in some emporium we are accustomed to visit are many still more numerous perhaps are the places that actually leave a disagreeable impression on the mind probably the reason of this is because most places are approached by railroad the station which is seen first and cannot thereafter be dissociated from the town is invariably the centre of a chaotic collection of ugly objects and discordant noises all the more hateful because so familiar for in coming to a new place we look instinctively for that which is new and the old and in themselves unpleasant sights and sounds at such a moment produce a disheartening deadening effect on the strangerthe same clanging puffing grinding gravelcrushing banging

beautiful countenance appear repulsive there is a station within a few miles of the village i approached by a different route and saw it at the end of a fifteen miles walk rain had begun to fall on the previous evening and when in the morning i looked from my bedroom window in the wayside inn where i had passed the night it was raining still and everywhere as far as i could see broad pools of water were gleaming on the level earth all day the rain fell steadily from a leaden sky so low that where there were trees it seemed almost to touch their tops while the hills away on my left appeared like vague masses of cloud that rest on the earth the road stretched across a level moorland country it was straight and narrow but i was compelled to keep to it since to step aside was to put my feet into water mile after mile i trudged on without meeting a soul where not a house was visiblea still wet desolate country with trees and bushes standing in water unstirred by a breath of wind only at long intervals a yellow hammer was heard uttering his thin note for just as this bird sings in the sultriest weather which silences other voices so he will utter his monotonous chant on the gloomiest day  it may be because he sung     the yellow hammer in the rain  that i have long placed faber among my bestloved minor poets of the past century he alone among our poets has properly appreciated that the singer who never stops but pleased with his own monotony shakes off the rain and sings on in a mood of cheerfulness dashed with melancholy     and there he is within the rain    and beats and beats his tune again    quite happy in himself     within the heart of this great shower    he sits as in a secret bower    with curtains drawn about him    and part in duty part in mirth    he beats as if upon the earth    rain could not fall without him  i remember that w e henley once took me severely to task on account of some jeering remarks made about our poets way of treating the birds and their neglect of so many of our charming singers in the course of our correspondence he questioned me about the cirl bunting that lively singer and pretty first cousin of the yellow hammer and after i had supplied him with full information he informed me that it was his intention to write a poem on that bird and that he would be the first english poet to sing the cirl bunting  he never wrote that lyric part in duty part in mirth he was then near his end  to return to my walk at last the aspect of the country changed in place of brown heath with gloomy fir and furze there was cheerful verdure of grass and deciduous trees and the straight road grew deep and winding running now between hills now beside woods and hopfields and pasture lands and at length wet and tired i reached selbornethe remote hampshire village that has so great a fame  to very many readers a description of the place would seem superfluous they know it so well even without having seen it the little oldworld village at the foot of the long steep banklike hill or hanger clothed to its summit with beechwood as with a green cloud the straggling street the plestor or village green an old tree in the centre with a bench surrounding its trunk for the elders to rest on of a summer evening and close by the grey immemorial church with its churchyard its grand old yewtree and overhead the bunch of swifts rushing with jubilant screams round the square tower  i had not got the book in my knapsack nor did i need it seeing the selborne swifts i thought how a century and a quarter ago gilbert white wrote that the number of birds inhabiting and nesting in the village summer after summer was nearly always the same consisting of about eight pairs the birds now rushing about over the church were twelve and i saw no others  if gilbert white had never lived or had never corresponded with pennant and daines barrington selborne would have impressed me as a very pleasant village set amidst diversified and beautiful scenery and i should have long remembered it as one of the most charming spots which i had found in my rambles in southern england but i thought of white continually the village itself every feature in the surrounding landscape and every object living or inanimate and every sound became associated in my mind with the thought of the obscure country curate who was without ambition and was a still quiet man with no harm in himno not a bit as was once said by one of his parishioners there at selborneto give an altered meaning to a verse of quaint old nicholas culpepper     his image stampéd is on every grass  with a new intense interest i watched the swifts careering through the air and listened to their shrill screams it was the same with all the birds even the commonestthe robin blue tit martin and sparrow in the evening i stood motionless a long time intently watching a small flock of greenfinches settling to roost in a hazelhedge from time to time they became disturbed at my presence and fluttering up to the topmost twigs where their forms looked almost black against the pale amber sky they uttered their longdrawn canarylike note of alarm at all times a delicate tender note now it had something more in itsomething from the far pastthe thought of one whose memory was interwoven with living forms and sounds  the strength and persistence of this feeling had a curious effect it began to seem to me that he who had ceased to five over a century ago whose letters had been the favourite book of several generations of naturalists was albeit dead and gone in some mysterious way still living i spent a long time groping about in the long rank grass of the churchyard in search of a memorial and this when found turned out to be a modestsized headstone and i had to go down on my knees and put aside the rank grass that half covered it just as when we look into a childs face we push back the unkempt hair from its forehead and on the stone were graved the name and beneath 1793 the year of his death  happy the naturelover who in spite of fame is allowed to rest as white rests pressed upon by no ponderous stone the sweet influences of sun and rain are not kept from him even the sound of the wild birds cry may penetrate to his narrow apartment to gladden his dust  perhaps there is some truth in the notion that when a man dies he does not wholly die that is to say the earthly yet intelligent part of him which being of the earth cannot ascend that a residuum of life remains like a perfume left by some longvanished fragrant object or it may be an emanation from the body at death which exists thereafter diffused and mixed with the elements perhaps unconscious and yet responsive or capable of being vivified into consciousness and emotions of pleasure by a keenly sympathetic presence at selborne this did not seem mere fantasy strolling about the village loitering in the parklike garden of the wakes or exploring the hanger or when i sat on the bench under the churchyard yew or went softly through the grass to look again at those two letters graved on the headstone there was a continual sense of an unseen presence near me it was like the sensation a man sometimes has when lying still with closed eyes of some one moving softly to his side i began to think that if that feeling and sensation lasted long enough without diminishing its strength it would in the end produce something like conviction and the conviction would imply communion furthermore between the thought that we may come to believe in a thing and belief itself there is practically no difference i began to speculate as to the subjects about to be discussed by us the chief one would doubtless relate to the bird life of the district there are fresh things to be related of the cuckoo how wonder has been added to wonder by observers of that bird since the end of the eighteenth century and here is a delicate subject to followto wit the hibernation of swallowsyet one by no possibility to be avoided it would be something of a disappointment to him to hear it stated as an established fact that none of our hirundines do winter fast asleep like dormice in these islands but there would be comfort in the succeeding declaration that the old controversy is not quite dead yetthat at least two popular writers on british birds have boldly expressed the belief that some of our supposed migrants do actually lay up in the dead season the deep interest manifested in the subject would be a temptation to dwell on it i should touch on the discovery made recently by a young english naturalist abroad that a small species of swallow in a temperate country in the southern hemisphere shelters itself under the thick matted grass and remains torpid during spells of cold weather we have now a magnificent monograph of the swallows and it is there stated of the purple martin an american species that in some years bitter cold weather succeeds its arrival in early spring in canada that at such times the birds take refuge in their nesting holes and lie huddled together in a semitorpid state sometimes for a week or ten days until the return of genial weather when they revive and appear as full of life and vigour as before it is said that these and other swallows are possessed of habits and powers of which we have as yet but slight knowledge candour would compel me to add that the author of the monograph in question who is one of the first living ornithologists is inclined to believe that some swallows in some circumstances do hibernate  at this i should experience a curious and almost startling sensation as if the airy hands of my invisible companion had been clapped together and the clap had been followed by an exclamationa triumphant ah  then there would be much to say concerning the changes in the bird population of selborne parish and of the southern counties generally a few small specieshawfinch pretty chaps and goldcrestwere much more common now than in his day but a very different and sadder story had to be told of most large birds not only had the honey buzzard never returned to nest on the beeches of the hanger since 1780 but it had continued to decrease everywhere in england and was now extinct the raven too was lost to england as an inland breeder it could not now be said that there are bustards on the wide downs near brighthelmstone nor indeed anywhere in the kingdom the south downs were unchanged and there were still pretty rides and prospects round lewes but he might now make his autumn journey to ringmer without seeing kites and buzzards since these had both vanished nor would he find the chough breeding at beachy head and all along the sussex coast it would also be necessary to mention the disappearance of the quail and the growing scarcity of other once abundant species such as the stone plover and curlew and even of the white owl which no longer inhabited its ancient breedingplace beneath the caves of selborne church  finally after discussing these and various other matters which once engaged his attention also the little book he gave to the world so long ago there would still remain another subject to be mentioned about which i should feel somewhat shynamely the marked difference in manner perhaps in feeling between the old and new writers on animal life and nature the subject would be strange to him on going into particulars he would be surprised at the disposition almost amounting to a passion of the modern mind to view life and nature in their æsthetic aspects this new spirit would strike him as something odd and exotic as if the writers had been first artists or landscapegardeners who had as naturalists retained the habit of looking for the picturesque he would further note that we moderns are more emotional than the writers of the past or at all events less reticent there is no doubt he would say that our researches into the kingdom of nature produce in us a wonderful pleasure unlike in character and perhaps superior to most others but this feeling which was indefinable and not to be traced to its source was probably given to us for a secret gratification if we are curious to know its significance might we not regard it as something ancillary to our spiritual natures as a kind of subsidiary conscience a private assurance that in all our researches into the wonderful works of creation we are acting in obedience to a tacit command or at all events in harmony with the divine will  ingenious would be my comment and possibly to the eighteenth century mind it would have proved satisfactory there was something to be said in defence of what appeared to him as new and strange in our books and methods not easily said unfortunately since it was not only the expression that was new but the outlook and something in the heart we are bound as much as ever to facts we seek for them more and more diligently knowing that to break from them is to be carried away by vain imaginations all the same facts in themselves are nothing to us they are important only in their relations to other facts and thingsto all things and the essence of things material and spiritual we are not like children gathering painted shells and pebbles on a beach but whether we know it or not are seeking after something beyond and above knowledge the wilderness in which we are sojourners is not our home it is enough that its herbs and roots and wild fruits nourish and give us strength to go onward intellectual curiosity with the gratification of the individual for only purpose has no place in this scheme of things as we conceive it heart and soul are with the brain in all investigationa truth which some know in rare beautiful intervals and others never but we are all meanwhile busy with our work like myriads of social insects engaged in raising a structure that was never planned perhaps we are not so wholly unconscious of our destinies as were the patient gatherers of facts of a hundred years ago even in one brief century the dawn has come nearerperhaps a faint whiteness in the east has exhilarated us like wine undoubtedly we are more conscious of many things both within and withoutof the length and breadth and depth of nature of a unity which was hardly dreamed of by the naturalists of past ages a commensalism on earth from which the meanest organism is not excluded for we are no longer isolated standing like starry visitors on a mountaintop surveying life from the outside but are on a level with and part and parcel of it and if the mystery of life daily deepens it is because we view it more closely and with clearer vision a poet of our age has said that in the meanest floweret we may find thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears the poet and prophet is not alone in this he expresses a feeling common to all of those who with our wider knowledge have the passion for nature in their hearts who go to nature whether for knowledge or inspiration that there should appear in recent literature something of a new spirit a sympathetic feeling which could not possibly have flourished in a former age is not to be wondered at considering all that has happened in the present century to change the current of mens thoughts for not only has the new knowledge wrought in our minds but has entered or is at last entering into our souls  having got so far in my apology a feeling of despair would all at once overcome me at the thought of the vastness of the subject i had entered upon looking back it seems but a little while since the introduction of that new element into thought that fiery leaven which in the end would leaven all the hearts of men for ever but the time was not really so short the gift had been rejected with scorn and bitterness by the mass of mankind at first it had taken them yearsthe years of a generationto overcome repugnance and resentment and to accept it even so it had wrought a mighty change only this had been in the mind the change in the heart would follow and it was perhaps early to boast of it how was i to disclose all this to him all that i had spoken was but a brief exordiuma prelude and note of preparation for what should followa story immeasurably longer and infinitely more wonderful than that which the ancient mariner told to the wedding guest it was an impossible task  at length after an interval of silence to me full of trouble the expected note of dissent would come  i had told him he would say either too much or not enough no doubt there had been a very considerable increase of knowledge since his day nevertheless judging from something i had said on the hibernation or torpid condition of swallows there was still something to learn with regard to the life and conversation of animals the change in the character of modern books about nature of which i had told him quoting passagesa change in the direction of a more poetic and emotional treatment of the subjecthe looking from a distance was inclined to regard as merely a literary fashion of the time that anything so unforeseen had come to passso important as to change the current of thought to give to men new ideas about the unity of nature and the relation in which we stood towards the inferior creatureshe could not understand it should be remembered that the human race had existed some fifty or sixty centuries on the earth and that since the invention of letters men had recorded their observations the increase in the body of facts had thus been on the whole gradual and continuous take the case of the cuckoo aristotle some two thousand years ago had given a fairly accurate account of its habits and yet in very recent years as i had informed him new facts relating to the procreant instincts of that singular fowl had come to light  after a short interval of silence i would become conscious of a change in him as if a cloud had liftedof a quiet smile on his to my earthly eyes invisible countenance and he would add no no you have yourself supplied me with a reason for questioning your views your statement of thempardon me for saying itstruck me as somewhat rhapsodical i refer to your commendations of my humble history of the parish of selborne it is gratifying to me to hear that this poor little book is still in such good repute and i have been even more pleased at that idea of modern naturalists so flattering to my memory of a pilgrimage to selborne but if so great a change has come over mens minds as you appear to believe and if they have put some new interpretation on nature it is certainly curious that i should still have readers  it would be my turn to smile nowa smile for a smileand silence would follow and so with the dispersal of this little cloud there would be an end of the colloquy and each would go his way one to be reabsorbed into the grey stones and long grass the ancient yewtree the wooded hanger the other to pursue his walk to the neighbouring parish of liss almost ready to believe as he went that the interview had actually taken place  it only remains to say that the smile my smile would have been at the expense of some modern editors of the famous letters rather than at that of my interlocutor they are astonished at gilbert whites vitality and cannot find a reason for it why does this little cockleshell of a book as one of them has lately called it come gaily down to us over a sea full of waves where so many brave barks have foundered the style is sweet and clear but a book cannot live merely because it is well written it is chockfull of facts but the facts have been tested and sifted and all that were worth keeping are to be found incorporated in scores of standard works on natural history i would humbly suggest that there is no mystery at all about it that the personality of the author is the principal charm of the letters for in spite of his modesty and extreme reticence his spirit shines in every page that the world will not willingly let this small book die not only because it is small and well written and full of interesting matter but chiefly because it is a very delightful human document     index     a     adventures among birds 216    age of fools story of the 8    agriculture decay of in gloucestershire 174    amazon doublefronted 256
