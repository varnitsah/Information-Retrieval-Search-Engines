turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse  these words are especially solemn words  they stand in an especially solemn and important part of the bible  they are the last words of the old testament  i cannot but think that it was gods will that they should stand where they are and nowhere else malachi the prophet who wrote them did not know perhaps that he was the last of the old testament prophets  he did not know that no prophet would arise among the jews for 400 years till the time when john the baptist came preaching repentance  but god knew  and by gods ordinance these words stand at the end of the old testament to make us understand the beginning of the new testament  for the old testament ends by saying that god would send to the jews elijah the prophet  and the new testament begins by telling us of john the baptists coming as a prophet in the spirit and power of elias and how the lord jesus himself declared plainly that john the baptist was elijah who was to come that is the elijah of whom malachi prophesies in my text  therefore we may be certain that this text tells us what john the baptists work was that john the baptist came to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers lest the lord should come and smite the land with a curse  some may be ready to answer to this of course john the baptist came to warn parents of behaving wrongly to their children if they were careless or cruel and children to their parents if they were disobedient or ungrateful  of course he would tell bad parents and children to repent just as he came to tell all other kinds of sinners to repent  but that was only a part of john the baptists work  he came to be the forerunner of the messiah the saviour the redeemer  be it so my friends  i only hope that you really do believe that john the baptist did come to proclaim that a saviour was born into the worldprovided only that you remember all the while who that saviour was  john the baptist tells you who he was  if you will only remember that and get the thought of it into your hearts you will not be inclined to put any words of your own in place of the prophet malachis or to fancy that you can describe better than malachi what john the baptists work was to be and that turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers was only a small part of john the baptists work instead of being as malachi says it was his principal work his very work the work which must be done lest the lord instead of saving the land should come and smite it with a curse  yesyou must remember who it was that john the baptist came to bear record of and to manifest or show to the jews  the angels on the first christmas eve told usthey said it was the lord unto you they said is born a saviour who is christ the lord  john the baptist told you and all mankind who it wasthat it was the lord  the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord  the lord  what lordwhich lord  john the baptist knew  simeon anna nathaniel all righteous and faithful hearts who waited for the salvation of the lord knew  the pharisees and sadducees did not know  the men who wrote our creeds our prayer book our church catechism knew  the pharisees and the sadducees in our day who fancy themselves wiser than the creeds and the prayer book and the church catechism do not know  may god grant that we may all know not only with our lips but with our hearts our faith our love our lives who the lord is  jesus christ the babe of bethlehem is the lord  but who is he the bible tells us when we have heard what the bible tells us we shall be able better to understand the text  the lord is he of whom it is written and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness  and who is gods image and gods likeness  the new testament tells usjesus christ  in him man was made  he is the son of man who is in heaventhe true perfect pattern of man  but he is also the image and likeness of god the brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person  he is the lord  he is the lord who instituted marriage and said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an helpmeet for him  he is the lord who said to man be fruitful and multiply fill the earth and subdue it  he is the lord who said to the first murderer thy brothers blood crieth against thee from the ground he is the lord who talked with abraham face to face as a man talks with his friend who blest him by giving him a son in his old age that he might be the father of many nations  he is the lord who on mount sinai gave those ten commandments the foundation of all law and right order between man and god between man and manthou shalt honour thy father and thy mother  thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery  thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not bear false witness in courts of law or elsewhere  thou shalt not covet thy neighbours property  this is the lord  not a god far away from men who does not feel for them nor feel with them not a god who despises men or has an illwill to men and must be won over to change his mind and have mercy on them by many supplications and tears and fear and trembling and superstitious ceremonies  but this is the lord this is the babe of bethlehem this is he whose way john the baptist came to prepareeven he of whom it is written that he possessed wisdom the simple practical human wisdom useful for this everyday earthly life of ours which solomon sets forth in his proverbs in the beginning before his works of old and that when he appointed the foundations of the earth that wisdom was by him as one brought up with him and she was daily his delight rejoicing alway before him rejoicing in the habitable parts of the earth and her delights were with the sons of men  in one word he is the lord in whose likeness man is made  mans justice is a pattern of his mans love is a pattern of his mans industry a pattern of his mans sabbathrest in some unspeakable and eternal way a pattern of his  mans family ties are patterns of his  god the father is he said st paul from whom every fathership in heaven and earth is named that we may be such fathers to our children as god is to us  god the son is he who is not ashamed to call us brethren and to declare to us the glorious news that in him we too are the sons of god that we may be such sons to our heavenly fatheray and to our earthly fathers also as the lord jesus was to his father  yesand even more wonderful still and more blessed still the lord is not ashamed to call himself a husband  our human wedlock and married love is a pattern of some divine mystery  husbands love your wives as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle but that it should be holy and without blemish  blessed words which we cannot pretend to explain or understand but can only believe and adore and find as we shall find in proportion as we are loving and faithful in wedlock that gods spirit bears witness with our spirit that they are reasonable blessed true true for ever  this then was the lord who was coming to judge these jews not merely a god but the god  the lord in whose likeness man was made who had appointed men to be fathers sons husbands citizens of a nation owners of property subject to laws and yet makers of laws because all these things in some wonderful way are parts of his likeness  he was coming to this nation of the jews first and then to all the nations of the earth to judge them malachi said with a great and terrible day  to lay the axe to the root of the tree to cut down from the very root the evil principles which were working in society  his fan was in his hand and he would thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner for the use of future generations  but the chaff all that was empty light and useless he would burn up and destroy utterly out of the way with unquenchable fire  he would inquire of every man how have you kept my image my likeness in which i made you  what sort of husbands fathers sons neighbours subjects and governors have you been  and above all malachi says the root question of all would be what sort of fathers have you been to your children  what sort of children to your fathers  does that seem to you a small question my friends  would you have rather expected to hear john the baptist ask what sort of saints they had been  what sort of doctrines they were professing  a small question  look at these two little words father and son father and son  are they not the most deep and awful as well as the most blessed and hopeful words on earth  do they not tell us the very mystery of gods being  are they not the very name of god god the father and god the son knit together by one holy spirit of love to each other and to all who proceeds alike from the father and from the son  and then will you think it a light matter to ask fallen creatures made in the likeness of that perfect father and that perfect son what sort of fathers and sons they have been  god help us all and give us grace to ask ourselves that question morning and night before the great and terrible day of the lord come lest he come and smite this land with a curse  i have been led to think deeply and to speak openly upon this solemn matter my friends by seeing as who can help seeing the great division and estrangement between the old and the young which is growing up in our days  i do not alas i cannot deny the complaints which old people commonly make  old people complain that young people are grown too independent disobedient saucy and what not  it is too true frightfully miserably true that there is not the same reverence for parents as there was a generation backthat the children break loose from their parents spend their parents money choose their own road in life their own politics their own religion alas too often for themselvesthat young people now presume to do and say a hundred things which they would not have dreamed in old times  and they are ready enough to cry out that all this is a sign of the last days of which they say st paul speaks in 2 tim iii 4when men shall be disobedient to parents unthankful boasters heady highminded despisers of those who are good lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god  my friends my friends it is far better for us who have children instead of prying into the times and seasons which god has kept in his own hand to read our bibles faithfully and when we quote a text quote the whole of it and not just those bits of it which help us to throw blame on other people  what st paul really says is that in the last days evil times will come just as they had come he shows when he wrote and what he means i will try and show you presently  and moreover remember that malachi says that the hearts of the parents in judea needed turning to their children as well as the hearts of the children to their parents  take care lest it be not so in england now  remember that st paul in that same solemn passage gives other marks of last days which have to do with parents as well as with children and some which can only have to do with parentsfor they are the sins of grownup and elderly people and not of young ones  he says that in those days men shall also be covetous proud without natural affection breakers of their word blasphemers having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof  will none of these hard words hit some grown people in our day  will not they fill some of us with dread lest the parents nowadays should be as much in fault as the children of whom they complain lest the parents sins should be but too often the cause of the childrens sins  read through st pauls sad list of sins and see how every young mans sin in it has some old mans sin corresponding to it  st paul does not part his list and i dare not and cannot  st paul mixes the parents and the childrens sins together in his words and i fear that we do the same in our actions  oh beware beware you who complain of the behaviour of children nowadays lest your children have as much cause to complain of you  are your children selfish lovers of themselvessee that you have not set them the example by your own covetousness or laziness are they boastfulsee that your pride has not taught them incontinent and profligatesee that your own fierceness has not taught them  if they see you unable to master your own temper they will not care to try to master their appetites  are they disobedient and unthankfulsee well then that your want of natural affection to them your neglect and harshness and want of feeling and tenderness has not made the balance of unkindness fearfully even between you  are your children disobedient to you see that you have not taught them to be so by breaking your word to them by letting them see you deceitful to others till they have lost all trust in you all reverence for you  above all are your children lovers of pleasure more than lovers of godoh beware beware lest you have made them solest you have been blasphemers against god even when you have been fancying that you talked religion  beware lest you have been teaching them dark cruel superstitious thoughts about godmaking them look up to him not as their heavenly father but as a stern taskmaster whom they must obey not from gratitude but from fear of hell and so have made god look so unlovely in their eyes that there is no beauty in him that they should desire him  can you wonder at their loving pleasure rather than loving god when you show them nothing in gods character to love but everything to dread and shrink from  and last of all are your children despisers of those who are good inclined to laugh at religion to suspect and sneer at pious people and call them hypocrites  oh beware beware lest your lip religion your dead faith your inconsistent practice has not been the cause of it  if you as st paul says have a form of godliness and yet in your life and actions deny the power of it by living without god in the world and following the lowest maxims of the world in everything but what you call the salvation of your souls what wonder if your children grow up despisers of those who are good  if they see you preaching one thing and practising another they will learn to fancy that all godly people do the same if they see your religion a sham they will learn to fancy all religion false also  oh woe woe most terrible to those who thus harden their own childrens hearts and destroy in them as too many do all faith in god and man all hope all charity  woe to them for the lord himself who came to lay the axe to the root of the tree said of such if any man cause one of these little ones to offend it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea  so it is too often nowadays and so it will be until people condescend to learn over again that simple old church catechism which they were taught when they were little and to teach it to their children not only with their lips but in their lives  the church catechism some here will say to themselves with a smile that is but a paltry medicine for so great a diseasea pitiful ending forsooth to such a severe sermon as this to recommend just the church catechism  let those laugh who will my friends  if you think you can bring up your children to be blessings to youif you think you can live so as to be blessings to your children without the church catechism you can but try  i think that you will fail  more and more year by year i find that those who try do fail  more and more year by year i find that even religious peoples education of their children fails and that pious mens sons nowadays are becoming more and more apt to be scandals to their parents and to religion  if any choose to say that the reason is that the pious mens sons were not of the number of the elect though their fathers were i can only answer that god is no respecter of persons and that they say that he is that god is not the author of the evil and that they say that he is  if a child of mine turns out ill i am bound to lay the fault first on myself and certainly never on godand so is every man unless the inspired scripture is wrong where it says train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it and the fault is in ourselves  very few people really teach their children nowadays the church catechism very few really believe the church catechism very few really believe that god is such an one as the church catechism declares to us very few believe in the lord in whose image and likeness man is made whose way john the baptist prepared by turning the hearts of the fathers to the children  they put perhaps religious books into their childrens hands and talk to them a great deal about their souls  but they do not tell their children what the church catechism tells them because they do not believe what the church catechism tells them  what that is what the church catechism does tell us which the favourite religious books nowadays do not tell us and what that has to do with turning the hearts of the fathers to the children i must tell you hereafter  god grant that my words may sink into all hearts as far as they are right and true if sooner or later we are not all brought to understand the meaning of those two simple words father and son neither baptism nor confirmation nor schools nor this church nor the very body and blood of him who died for us to share which you are all called this day will be of avail for the wellbeing of this parish or of this country or any other country upon earth  for where the root is corrupt the fruit will be also and where family life and family ties which are the root and foundation of society are out of joint there the nation and the church will decay also as it is written if the foundations be cast down what can the righteous do  and whensoever in any family or nation and church the root of the tree which is the conduct of parents to children and of children to parents grows corrupt and rotten then last days as st paul calls them are indeed come to it and evil times therewith for the lord will surely lay the axe to the root of it and cut it down and cast it into the fire  neither will the days of that family or that people or that church be long in the land which the lord their god has given them  so it has been as yet in all ages and in all countries on the face of gods earth and so it will be until the end  wheresoever the hearts of the fathers are not turned to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers there will a great and terrible day of the lord come and that nation like judaea of old like many a fair country in europe at this moment will be smitten with a curse    sermon ii  salvation    john xvii 3  this is life eternal that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent  before i can explain what this text has to do with the church catechism i must say to you a little about what it means  now if i asked any of you what salvation was you would probably answer eternal life  and you would answer rightly  that is exactly what salvation is and neither more nor less  no more than that for nothing greater than that can belong to any created being  no less than that for gods love and mercy are eternal and without bound  but what is eternal life  some will answer going to heaven when we die  but what before you die  you do not know cannot tell  let us listen to what god himself says  let us listen to what the lord jesus christ the word of god says  let us listen to what he who spake as man never spake says  surely his words must be the clearest the simplest the most exact the deepest the widest the exactly fit and true words the complete words the perfect words which cannot be improved on by adding to them or taking away one jot or tittle  what did the lord jesus christ say that eternal life was  this is eternal life that they may know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent  to know god and jesus christ that is eternal life  that is all the eternal life which any of us will ever have my friends  unless our lords words are not complete and perfect and do not tell us the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth about eternal life that is all the eternal life any one will ever have and we must make up our minds to be content therewith  to which some will answer almost angrily of course  the way to obtain eternal life is to know god and jesus christ for if we do not we cannot obtain it  what words are these my friends what rash words are these which men thrust into scripture out of their own carnal conceits as if they could improve upon the speech of the son of man himself  he says not that to know god is the way to eternal life  but rather that eternal life is the way to know god  he does not say this is to know god and jesus christ in order that they may have eternal life  whatever he says he does not say that  nay more if we are to be very exact and can we be too exact with the lords words he says that this is eternal life in order that they may know god and jesus christ  not that we are to know god that we may obtain eternal life but that we must have eternal life in order that we may know god that eternal life is the means and the knowledge of god the end and purpose for which eternal life is given us  however this may be at least he says what the noble collect which we repeat every sunday says that our eternal life stands in the knowledge of god depends on it and will fall without it  that we may know god  not merely that we may know doctrines about salvation and the ways of winning gods favour and turning away his vengeance not merely to know what god has done ages ago or may do ages hence for us  but to know god himself to know his person his likeness his character and what he is and what he does now and always to know his righteousness his goodness his truth his love his mercy his strength his willingness and mightiness to save in a word what the bible calls his glory and therefore to admire and delight in him utterly  that is what our eternal life stands in that is why god has given to us eternal life in his son that we may know that  oh believe your saviour simply like little children and enter into the joy of your lord  acquaint yourselves with god and be at peace  to know god and also to know jesus christ whom he has sent  for st john when he tells us that god has already given to us eternal life says also that this life is in his son  to know the son of god in whom the father is well pleased because he is his perfect son his exact likeness the likeness of that glory of his and the express image of that person and character of his which i described to you just now one whose life was and is and ever will be eternally all love and mercy and selfsacrifice and labour for lost and sinful men all trust and obedience to his father  to know him and his life and to come to him and receive from him an eternal life which this world did not give us and cannot take away from us which neither man devil nor angel nor the death of our bodies the ruin of empires the destruction of the whole universe and of time and space and all things whereof man can conceive or dream can alter in the slightest because it is a life of goodness and righteousness and love which are eternal as the god from whom they spring eternal as christ who is the same yesterday today and for ever and nothing but our own sinful wills can rob us of them  this is eternal life and therefore this is salvation  a very different account of it though it is the bible account from that narrow and paltry one which too many have in their minds nowadays a narrow and paltry notion that it means only being saved from the punishment of our sins after we die and a very unbelieving and godless and atheistical notion too which like all unbelief hurts and spoils mens lives  for too many say to themselves god must save me after i am dead of course for no one else can  but as long as i am alive i must save myself  god must save me from hell but i must save myself from poverty from trouble from what the world may say of me or do to me if i offend it  and so salvation seems to have to do altogether with the next life and not at all with this and people lose entirely the belief that god is our deliverer our protector our guide our friend now here in this life and do not really think that they can get on better in this world by knowing god and jesus christ and so they set to work to help themselves by cunning by covetousness by cowardly truckling to the wicked ways of the very world which they renounced at baptism by following after a multitude to do evil and standing by saying i saw it not when they see wrong and cruelty done upon the earth afraid to fight gods battles like men of god because they say it is dangerous and so in these evil days thousands who call themselves christians live on worldly and selfish without god in the world while they talk busily enough of preparing to meet god in the world to come dreaming poor souls of arriving at what they call salvation after they die while they are too often i fear deep enough in what the scripture calls damnation before they die  but say some is not salvation going to a place called heaven my friends let the bible speak  it tells us that salvation is not in a place at all but in a person a living moving acting person who is none other than the lord jesus christ  let the psalmists speak and shame us who ought to know being christians even better than they that the lord himself is salvation  the whole book of psalms what is it but the blessed discovery that salvation is not merely in a place or a state not even in some beatific vision after men die but in the lord himself all day long in this world that salvation is a life in god and with god  the lord is my light and my salvation of whom then shall i be afraid  the lord is the strength of my life and my portion for ever  this is their keynote  shame on us christians that we should have forgotten it for one so much lower  the name of the lord says solomon is a strong tower  the righteous runneth into it and is safe  into it  not merely into some pleasant place after he dies but all day long and is safe  not merely after he dies but in every chance and change of this mortal life  my friends i am ashamed to have to put christian men in mind of these things truly evil communications have corrupted good manners awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i am ashamed i say for there are old hymns in the mouths of every one to this day which testify against their want of faith which say christ is my life christ is my salvation and which were written i doubt not by men who meant literally what they said whatever those who sing them nowadays may mean by them  now what do those hymns mean by such words if they mean anything at all surely what i have been preaching to you and what seems to some of you i fear strange and new doctrine  and what else does the church catechism mean when it bids every child thank god for having brought him into a state of salvation  for mind throughout the whole church catechism there is not one word about what people commonly call heaven and hell not one word though heaven and hell are nowadays generally the first things about which children are taught  not one word is the child taught about what will happen to him after death except that his body will rise again and that christ will be his judge after he is dead as well as while he is alive  but not one word about that salvation after he is dead which is almost the only thing of which one hears in many pulpits and why but because the catechism teaches the child to believe that jesus christ is his salvation now in this life and believes that to be enough for him to know  for if christ be eternal his salvation must be eternal also  if christs life be in the child eternal life must be in the child for christs life must be eternal even as christ himself and that is enough for the child and for us also  and with this agrees that great text of scripture when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive  people nowadays are apt to make two mistakes about that one text  first they forget the when and read it as if it stood if the wicked man turn away from his wickedness in this life he shall save his soul in the next life but the bible says much more than that  it says that when he turns then and there that moment he shall save his soul alive and next they read the text as if it stood he shall save his soul  here again my friends the bible says a great deal more it says that he shall save his soul alive  perhaps that does not seem to you any great difference  alas alas my friends i fear that there are too many now as there have been in all times who do not care for the difference  provided their souls are saved by which they mean provided they escape torment after they die it matters nothing to them whether their souls are saved alive or saved dead they do not even know the difference between a dead soul and a live soul because they know nothing about eternal death and eternal life which are the death and the life of eternal persons such as souls are they say to themselves if they be protestants i hope i shall have faith enough to be saved or if they be papists i hope i shall have good works enough to be saved valuing faith and works not for themselves yea valuingfor i must say italmighty god himself not for himself and his own glory but valuing faith and works and the father and the son and the holy spirit only because as they dream they are so many helps to a life of pleasure beyond the grave not knowing this that living faith and good works do not merely lead to heaven but are heaven itself that true real eternal heaven wherein alone men really live that true real eternal life which was with the father and was manifested in jesus christ whom st john saw living upon earth that same eternal life and bore witness of him that his life was the light of men that eternal life whereof it is written that god hath brought us to life together with christ and raised us up and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesusnot knowing this that the only life which any soul ought to live is the life of god and of christ and of the spirit of god and christ a life of righteousness and justice and truth and obedience and mercy and love a life which god has given to us that we may know and copy him and do his works and live his life for evernot knowing this also that eternal death is not merely some torture of fire and worms beyond the grave  but that this is eternal death not to live the eternal life which is the only possible life for souls the life of righteousness and love a death which may come on respectable people and high religious professors while they are fancying themselves sure to be saved as easily and surely as it may on thieves and harlots wallowing in the mire of sins  for what is this same eternal death  the opposite surely to eternal life  eternal life is to know god and therefore to obey him eternal life is to know god whose name is love and therefore to rejoice to fulfil his law of which it is written love is the fulfilling of the law and therefore to be full of love ourselves as it is written we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren and again every one that loveth knoweth god for god is love  and on the other hand eternal death is not to know god and therefore not to care for his law of love and therefore to be without love as it is written on the other hand he that loveth not his brother abideth in death  whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him and again he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love  eternal death then is to love no one to be shut up in the dark prisonhouse of our own wilful and wayward thoughts and passions full of spite suspicion envy fear in fact in one word to be a devil  oh my friends is not that damnation indeed to be a devil here on earth and for aught we know for ever and ever  do you not know what frame of mind i mean  thank god none of us i suppose is ever utterly without some grain of love left for some one none of us i suppose is ever utterly shut up in himself and as long as there is love there is life and as long as there is life there is hope  but yet there have been moments when one has felt with horror how near and how terrible and how easy was this same eternal death which some fancy only possible after they die  for my friends were you ever any one of you for one half hour completely angry completely sulky displeased and disgusted with everybody and everything round you and yet displeased and disgusted with yourself all the while liking to think everyone wrong liking to make out that they were unjust to you feeling quite proud at the notion that you were an injured person  and yet feeling in your heart the very opposite of all these fancies  feeling that you were wrong that you were unjust to them and feeling utterly ashamed at the thought that they were the injured persons and that you had injured them  and perhaps to make all worse the person about whom all this storm had arisen in your heart was some dear friend or relation whom you loved strange contradiction yet most true at the very moment that you were trying to hate  oh my friends if one such dark hour has ever come home to you if you have ever let the sun go down upon your wrath and so given place to the devil then you know something at least of what eternal death is  you know how in such moments there is a worm in the heart and a fire in the heart compared with which all bodily torment would be light and bearable a worm in the heart which does not die  and a fire in the heart which you cannot quench  but which if they remained there would surely destroy you  so intolerable are they that you feel that you will actually and really die in some strange unspeakable way if you continue in that temper long  do not there open at such times within our hearts black depths of evil a power of becoming wicked a chance of being swept off into sin if one gives way which one never suspected till then and yet with all these the most dreadful sense of helplessness of slavery of despairgod grant that may not remain for then comes the mad hope to escape death by death to try by one desperate stroke to rid oneself of that self which is for the time ones torment worm fire death and hell and what is this dark fight within us  what does the bible call it it is death and life eternal death and eternal life salvation and damnation hell and heaven fighting together within our hapless hearts to see which shall be our masters  it is the battle of the evil spirit who is the devil fighting with the good spirit who is god  nothing less than that my friends  yes in those hateful and shameful moments of pride or spite or contempt or selfwill or suspicion or sneering on which when they are past we look back with shame and horror and wonder how we could have been such wretches even for a momentat such times i say our heart is a battlefield on which no less than the devil himself and god himself are fighting for our souls  on one side satan trying to bring us into that state of eternal death in which he lives himself satan the loveless one the selfwilled one the accuser the slanderer slandering god to us slandering man to us slandering to us the friends we love best and trust most utterly yea slandering our own selves to us trying to make us believe that we are as bad ought to be as bad and must always be as bad as we seem for the time to be that we cannot shake off our evil passions that we cannot rise again out of the eternal death of sin into the eternal life of righteousness  and on the other side the spirit of god and of his christ the spirit of eternal life the spirit of justice and righteousness love joy peace duty selfsacrifice trying to make us know him and see his beauty and obey him and be at peace trying to raise us again into that eternal life and state of salvation which the lord jesus christ has bought for us with his most precious blood  oh awful thought  life and death the devil himself and the lord jesus christ himself fighting in your heart and in mine and in the heart of every human being round us  and yet most blessed thought hopeful gloriousfull of the promise of eternal victory  for greater is he that is with us than he that is against us and he who conquered satan for himself can and will conquer him for us also  no thing can separate us from the love of christ no thing yea no angel or devil principality or power no thing but only ourselves only our own proud and wayward will and determination to the devils voice in our hearts and not the voice of christ the word of life who is nigh us in our hearts even in our darkest moments loving us still pitying us ready able and willing to help all who cast themselves on him and raise us there and then the very moment we cry to him and renounce the devil and our own foolish will out of selfwill into gods will out of darkness into light out of hatred into love out of despair into hope out of doubt into faith out of tempest into peace out of the death of sin into the life of righteousness the life of love and charity which abideth for ever  oh listen not to the lying slanderous devil who tells you that by your own sin you have lost your share in christ lost baptismal grace lost christs lovelost his love his who were you in the very lowest depths of hell would pity you still  his love who himself went down into hell and preached to the spirits in prison to show that he did care even for them  not so  into him you have been baptized  his cross is on your foreheads his father is your fatherand can a father desert his child even though he sinned seventy and seven times if seventy and seven times he turn and repent  can man weary god  can the creature conquer and destroy the love of his creator  can christ deny himself  not so whosoever thou art however sorely tempted however deeply fallen however disgusted and terrified at thyself turn only to that blessed face which wept over jerusalem to that great heart which bled for thee upon the cross and thou shalt find him unchanged the same yesterday today and for ever the lord of life and love able and willing to save to the uttermost all who come to god through him and the accusing devil shall turn and flee and thou shalt know that thy redeemer liveth still and in thy flesh thou shalt see the salvation of god and cry rejoice not against me satan mine enemy for when i fall i shall arise    sermon iii  a good conscience    1 peter iii 21  the like figure whereunto baptism doth now save us not the putting away the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ  these words are very wide words too wide to please most people they preach a very free grace too free to please most people  such free and full grace indeed that some who talk most about free grace and insist most on mans being saved only by free grace are the very men who shrink from these words most and would be more comfortable in their minds i suspect if they were not in the bible at all because the grace they preach is too free  but so it always has been and so it is and so i suppose it always will be  man preaches his notions of gods forgiveness his notions of what he thinks god ought to do but when god proclaims his own forgiveness and tells men what he has actually done and bids his apostle declare boldly that baptism doth now save us then man is frightened at the vastness of gods generosity and thinks gods grace too free his forgiveness too complete and considers this text and many another in the bible as dangerous forsooth if it is preached unreservedly and not to be quoted without some words of mans invention tacked to it to water it down and narrow it and take all the strength and life out of it and if he be asked whether he believes the words of scripturefor instance whether st paul spoke truth when he told the heathen athenians that they and all men were the offspring of godor when he told the romans that as by the offence of one judgment came on all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of lifeor when he told the corinthians that as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made aliveor whether st peter spoke truth when he said that baptism doth also now save usthen they answer that the words are true in a sense that is not in their plain sense true if they were only true true and yet somehow at the same time not true and not to be preached unreservedly as if man could be more cautious and correct in his language than the spirit of god who inspired the apostles as if man could be more careful of gods honour than god is of his own as if man could hate sin and guard against sin more carefully than god himself  just in the same way do people stumble at certain invaluable words in the church catechism which teach children to thank god for having brought them into that state of salvation  even very good people and people who really wish to believe and honour the church catechism and the sacrament of baptism find these words too strong to please them and say that of course a childs being in a state of salvation cannot mean that he is saved but that he may be saved after he dies  my friends i never could find that we have a right to take liberties with the bible and the prayer book which we dare not take with any other book and to put meanings into the words of them which in the case of any other book would be contrary to plain grammar and the english tongue if not to common sense and honesty  if you say of a man he is in a state of happiness you mean do you not that he is happy now not that he may perhaps be happy some day  if you came to me and told me that you were in a state of hunger you would think it a very strange answer to receive if i say very well then if you become hungry come to me and i will feed you  you all know that a mans being in a state of poverty or of misery means that he is poor or miserable now here at this very time that if a man is in a state of sickness he is sick if he is in a state of health he is healthy  then what can a mans being in a state of salvation mean by all rules of english but that he is saved  if i were to say to any one of the good people who do not think so my friend you are in a state of damnation he would answer me quickly enough i am not for i am not damned he would agree that a mans being in a state of damnation means that the man is damned why will he not agree that a mans being in a state of salvation means that he is saved  because my friends gods grace is too full for fallen mans notions and therefore there is an evil fashion abroad in the world that where a text speaks of wrath and misery and punishment you are to interpret it exactly and to the very letter  but where it speaks of love and mercy and forgiveness you are to do no such thing but narrow it and fence it and explain it away for fear you should make sinners too comfortablea plan which seems wise enough but which like other plans of mans wisdom has not succeeded too well to judge by the number of sinners who are already too comfortable though they hear the bible misused and gods grace narrowed in this way every sunday of their lives  but my friends we call ourselves englishmen and churchmen let us be honest englishmen and plain churchmen and take our catechism as it stands  for rightly or wrongly truly or falsely it does teach every christened child to thank god not merely that it has some chance of being saved when it dies but that it is saved already now here on earth  whether that is true or false is another question  i believe it to be true  i believe the text to be true i believe that why people shrink from it is that they have got into their minds a wrong unscriptural superstitious notion of what being saved and saving ones soul alive and salvation mean  and i beg all of you who read your bibles to search the scriptures from beginning to end and try to find out what these words mean and whether the catechism has not kept close after all to the words of scripture  it will be better for you my friends it will be worth your while to know exactly what being saved means for to judge by the signs of the times there are very probably days coming in which it will be as needful for you and for your children to save your souls alive lest you die as ever it was for the jews in isaiahs or jeremiahs time or for the romans in st pauls time and that in that day you will find the catechism wider and deeper and sounder than you have ever suspected it to be and see i trust that in these very words it preaches to you and me and our children after us the one true gospel and good news which will stand and grow and shine brighter and brighter for ever when all the paltry narrow counterfeit gospels which man invents in its place have been burnt up by the unquenchable fire with which the merciful lord purges the chaff from his floor  i told you this morning what i believe that salvation wasto know god and jesus christ whom he has sent  to know gods likeness gods character what god has shown of his own character what he has done for us  to know his boundless love and mercy and knowing that to trust in him utterly and submit to him utterly and obey him utterly sure that he loves us that his will to us is goodwill that his commandments must be life  to know god and therefore to love him and to serve him that is salvation  now what hinders a little child from the very moment that it can think or speak from entering into that salvation  not the childs own heart  there is evil in the childtrue  is there none in you and me  there is a corrupt nature in the childtrue  is there not in you and me  woe to us if we have not found it out  woe to us if we dare to think that we are in ourselvesor out of ourselves eitherone whit better than our own children  what should hinder any child whom you or i ever saw from knowing god and his name the father the son and the holy spirit  has he not an earthly father through whom he may know the father is he not an earthly son and through that may he not know the son  has he not a conscience a spirit in him which knows good from evil holiness from wickednessfar more clearly and tenderly than the souls of most grown people do and can he not therefore understand you when you speak of a holy spirit a spirit which puts good desires into his heart and can enable him to bring those good desires into practice  i know one hindrance at least and that is his parents sins when the parents harshness or neglect tempts the child to fancy that god the father is such a father to him as his parents are and that to be a child of god is to look up to his heavenly father with dread and suspicion as to a hard taskmaster whose anger has to be turned away and not with that perfect love and trust and respect and selfsacrifice with which the lord jesus christ fulfilled his fathers will and proclaimed his fathers glory  or when the parents unholiness and lipreligion teach the child to fancy that the holy spirit means only certain religious fancies and feelings or the learning by heart of certain words and doctrines or worst of all a spirit of bondage unto fear instead of knowing him to be as he is the spirit of righteousness and love and joy and peace longsuffering gentleness goodness meekness temperance  or when again parents by their own teaching do despite to the spirit of grace in their own child and destroy their childs good conscience toward god by telling the child that it does not really love god when it loves him perhaps far better than they do by telling the child that its sins have parted it from god when its sins are light yea are as nothing in the balance compared to the sins they themselves commit every day while they claim for themselves clearer light and knowledge than the child and thereby condemn themselves rather than the child when they darken and defile the pure and beautiful trust and admiration for its heavenly father which gods spirit puts into the childs heart by telling it that it is doomed to i knownotwhat horrible misery and torture when it dies but that it can escape from that wretched end by thinking certain thoughts and feeling certain feelings and so after stirring up in the child all manner of dreadful doubts of gods love and justice and perhaps driving it away from religion altogether by making it believe that it has committed sins which it has not committed and deserves horrible tortures which it has not deserved do perhaps at last awaken in it a new love for god but one which is not like that first love that childlike love one which i fear is hardly a love for god at all but principally a selfish joy and delight at having escaped from coming torments this is the reason my friends and this hindrance at least i know  i will not copy those parents my friends and tell them as they tell their children that they are bringing on themselves endless torture but i must tell them for the lord christ has told them that they are bringing on themselves somethingi know not whatof which it is written that it were better for them that a millstone were hanged about their necks and that they were drowned in the depth of the sea  oh my friends if i speak sternly almost bitterly when i speak of parents sins it is because i speak for those who cannot speak for themselves  i plead for christs little ones  i plead for the souls and consciences of those little children of whom christ said suffer the little children to come unto me not that they might become his but because they were his already not that they might win his love but because he loved them from all eternity  not that they might enter into the kingdom of heaven but because they were in the kingdom of heaven already because the kingdom of heaven was made up of such as them and the angels who ministered unto them always beheld the face of our father who is in heaven  yes i plead for those children of whom the lord said except ye be converted that is utterly turned and changed and become as little children ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  deep and blessed words which are the rootrule of all true righteousness which so few really believe at heart any more than the pharisees and sadducees and herodians of old did up and down all over england i hear men of all denominations saying not except we grown people be converted and become as little children but except the little children be converted and become like us grown people  god grant that the little children may not become like too many grown people  god grant it i say god grant that our children may not become like us  god grant that they may keep through youth and manhood and through the grave and through all worlds to come the tender and childlike heart which we too often have hardened in ourselves by bigotry and superstition and dead faith and lipworship  and i can have good hope that god will grant it  i can have hope that god will teach our children and our childrens children truly to know him whose name is love and righteousness the father the son and the holy spirit as long as i see his providence preserving for us this old church catechism to teach our children what we forget to teach them or what we have not faith enough to teach them  yes i can have hope for england and hope for those mighty nations across the seas whose earthly mother god has ordained that she should be as long as the catechism is taught to her children  for see  this catechism does not begin with telling children that they are sinners  they will find that out soon enough for themselves poor little things from their own wayward and self willed hearts  nor by telling them that man is fallen and corrupt they will find out that also soon enough from the way in which they see people go on around them  it does not even begin by telling them that they ought to be good or what goodness and righteousness is because it takes for granted that they know that already it takes for granted that the light who lights every man who comes into the world is in them even the lord jesus christ himself stirring up in their hearts as he does in the heart of every child the knowledge of good and the love of good  but it begins at once by teaching the child the name of god  it goes at once to the root of the matter to the fountain of goodness itself even to god the father of lights  it is so careful of gods honour so careful that the child should learn from the first to look up to god with love and trust that it dare not tell the child that god can destroy and punish before it has told him that god is a father and a maker the father of spirits who has made him and all the world  it dare not tell him that mankind is fallen before it has told him that all the world is redeemed  it dare not talk to him of unholiness before it has taught him that the holy spirit of god is with him to make him holy  it tells him of a world a flesh and a devil  but he has renounced them  he has neither part nor lot in them and he is not to think of them yet  he is to think of that in which he has part and lot of which he is an inheritor  he is to know where he is and ought to be before he knows where he is not and ought not to be he is to think of the name of god by which he can trample world flesh and devil under foot if they dare hereafter meddle with his soul  in its godinspired tenderness and prudence it dare not darken the heart of one little child or tempt him to hard thoughts of god or to cry why hast thou made me thus lest it put a stumblingblock in the way of christs little ones and dishonour the name and glory of god  it tells him of the love before it tells him of the wrath of the order before it tells him of the disorder of the right before the wrong of the health before the disease of the freedom before the bondage of the truth before the lies of the light before the darkness in one word it tells him first of the eternal and good god who was and is and shall be to all eternity before and above the evil devil  it tells him of the name of god and tells him that god is with him and he with god and bids him believe that and be saved from his birthhour to endless ages  it does not tell him to pray that he may become gods child but to pray because he is gods child already  it does not tell him to love god in order that he may make god love him but to love god because god loves him already and has loved him from all eternity  it does not tell him to obey jesus christ in order that christ may save him but to obey christ because christ has saved him and bought him with his own blood  it does not tell him to do good works in order that gods spirit may be pleased with him and come to him and make him one of the elect neither does it tell him that some day or other if he is converted and feels certain religious experiences he will have a right to consider himself one of gods elect  but it tells him to look man and devil in the face he the poor little ignorant village child and say boldly in the name of god i am one of gods elect  the holy spirit of god is sanctifying me and making me holy  god has saved me and i heartily thank my heavenly father who has called me to this state of salvation  it tells him to believe that he is safe safe in the ark of christs church as noah was safe in the ark at the deluge and that the one way to keep himself within that ark is to obey him to whom it belongs who judges it and will guide it for ever jesus christ the likeness of god and that as long as he does that neither world flesh nor devil can harm him even as noah was safe in the ark and nothing could drown him but his own wilful casting himself out of the ark and trying to free the flood of waters by his own strength and cunning  it tells him i say that he is safe and saved even as david and isaiah and all holy men who ever lived have been as long as he trusts in god and clings to god and obeys god and that only when he forsakes god and follows his own selfishness and pride can anything or being in earth or hell harm him  and do not fancy my friends that this is a mere unimportant question of words and doctrines because a baptized and educated child may be lost after all and fall from his state of salvation into a state of damnation  still more do not fancy that if a child is taught that he is already a child of god regenerated in baptism and elect by gods spirit that therefore he will neglect either vital faith or good worksheaven forbid  is it likely to make a child careless and inclined to neglect vital truth to tell him that god is his father and loves him utterly and has given his only begotten son to die for him  is it not the very way the only way to stir up in him faith and real hearty trust and affection towards god  how can you teach him to trust god but by telling him that god has shown himself boundlessly and perfectly worthy to be trusted by every soul of man or to love god but by showing him that god loves him already  is it likely to make a child careless of good works to tell him that god has elected and chosen him and all his brothers and schoolfellows to be conformed into the likeness of jesus christ and that every good and honourable and gentle thought or feeling which ever crosses his little heart does not come from himself is not part of his own nature or character but is nothing less than the inspiration of the holy spirit nothing less than the voice of almighty god himself speaking to the childs heart that he may answer with samuel speak lord for thy servant heareth  is it likely to make a child careless about losing eternal life to tell him that god has already given to him eternal life and that that life is in his son jesus christ to whom the child belongs body soul and spirit  judge for yourselves my friends  think what awe what reverence purity dread of sin would grow up in a child who was really taught all this and yet what faith and love to god what freedom and joyfulness and good courage about his own duty and calling in life  and then look at the fruits which in general follow a religious education as it is miscalled and take warning  for if you really train up your children in the way in which they should go be sure that when they are old they will not depart from ita promise which is not fulfilled to most religious education which we see around us nowadays from which sad fact if scripture be inspired and infallible we can only judge that such is not the way in which the children should go and that because it is a wrong way therefore god will not and man cannot keep them in it    sermon iv  names    matthew i 21  and thou shall call his name jesus  did it ever seem to you a curious thing that the catechism begins by asking the child its name  what is your name  who gave you this name  i think that if you were not all of you accustomed to the church catechism from your childhood that would seem a strange way of beginning to teach a child about religion  but the more i consider the more sure i am that it is the right way to begin teaching a child what the catechism wishes to teach  do not fancy that it begins by asking the childs name just because it must begin somehow and then go on to religion afterwards  do not fancy that it merely supposes that the clergyman does not know the childs name and must ask it for this catechism is intended to be taught by parents to their children and masters to their apprentices and servants by people therefore who know the childs name perfectly well already and yet they are to begin by asking the child his name  now why is this  what has a childs name to do with his faith and duty as a christian  you may answer because his christian name is given him when he is baptized  but why is his christian name given him when he is baptized  why then rather than at any other time  because it is the old custom of the church  no doubt it is  and a most wise and blessed custom it is and one which shows us how much more about god and man the churchmen in old times knew than most of our religious teachers nowadays  but how did that old custom arise  what put into the minds of church people for the last sixteen hundred years at least that being baptized and being named had anything to do with each other  men had names of their own long before the lord jesus came long before his baptism was heard of on earththe heathens of old had their namesthe heathens have names stillwhy then did church people feel it right to mix a new thing like baptism with a worldold thing like giving a name  my friends i feel and say honestly that there is more in this matter than i understand and what little i do understand i could not explain fully in one sermon or in many either  but let this be enough for today  god grant that i may be able to make you understand me  any ones having a namea name of his own a christian name as we rightly call itsignifies that he is a person that is that he has a character of his own and a responsibility and a calling and duty of his own given him by god in one word that he has an immortal soul in him for which he and he alone must answer and receive the rewards of the deeds which it does in the body whether they be good or evil  but names are not given at random without cause or meaning  when adam named all the beasts we read that whatsoever he called any beast that was the name of it  the names which he gave described each beast were taken from something in its appearance or its ways and habits and so each was its right name the name which expressed its nature  and so now when learned men discover animals or plants in foreign countries they do not give them names at random but take care to invent names for them which may describe their natures and make people understand what they are like as adam did for the beasts of old  and much more in old times had the names of men each of them a meaning  if it was reasonable to give names full of meaning to each kind of dumb animal which are mere things and not persons at all how much more to each man separately for each man is a person of himself each man has a character different from all others a calling different from all others and therefore he ought to have his own name separate from all others  and therefore in old times it was the custom to give each child a separate name which had a meaning in it was as it were a description of the child or of something particular about the child  now we may see this above all in the adorable name of jesus that name above all others ought to show us what a name means for it is the name of the son of man the one perfect and sinless man the pattern of all men and therefore it must be a perfect name and a pattern for all names and it was given to the lord not by man but by god not after he was born but before he was conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin  and therefore it must show and mean not merely some outward accident about him something which he seemed to be or looked like in mens eyes  no the name of jesus must mean what the lord was in the sight of his father in heaven what he was in the eternal purpose of god the father what he was really and absolutely in himself it must mean and declare the very substance of his being  and so indeed it does for the adorable name of jesus means nothing else but god the saviourgod who saves this is his name and was and ever will be  this name he fulfilled on earth and proved it to be his character his exact description his very name in short which made him different from all other beings in heaven or earth create or uncreate and therefore he bears his name to all eternity for a mark of what he has been and is and will be for evergod the saviour and this is the perfect name the pattern of all other names of men  now though the christian names which we give our children here in england have no especial meaning to them and have nothing to do with what we expect or wish the children to be when they grow up yet the names of people in most other countries in the world have the jewish names which we find in the bible have almost all of them a meaning  so simeon i believe means obedient jehoshaphat means the lord will judge daniel god is my judge isaiah means the salvation of the lord isaac means she laughs as a memorial of sarahs laughing when she heard that she was to have a child ishmael means the lord hears in remembrance of gods hearing hagars cry in the wilderness when ishmael was dying of thirst  especially those names of which we read that god commanded them to be given have meanings and to tell the persons who bore those names what god expected of them or would do for them  so abraham means the father of many nations  so the children of both isaiah and hosea had names given them by god each of them meaning something which god was going to do to the nation of the jews  and so john means given by the lord which name was given to john the baptist by the angel before his strange birth in his mothers old age  but we must remember that the heathens also gave names to their children though they did not know that their children owed any duty to god or belonged to god and therefore we cannot call their names christian names  yes the heathens did give their children names some of them give their children names still  and there is to me something most sad and painful in those heathen names and yet most full of meaning  a solemn lesson to us to show us what the fall means what man becomes when he gives way to his fallen nature and is parted from christ the head of man  first these heathens had a dim remembrance that man was made in the likeness of god and lived by faith in god and therefore that mens names were to express that as indeed many of their old names do but alas the likeness of god in fallen man is like a tree without roots or rather a tree without soil to grow in  gods likeness in man can only flourish as long as he is joined to christ the perfect likeness of god the true life and the true light of men the foundation which is already laid and the soil in which man was meant to grow and flourish for ever and as long as he is fed by the spirit of god the lord and giver of life who proceedsnever forget that or you will lose the understanding both of who god is and what man isproceeds not only from god the father but also from god the son the lord jesus christ  and therefore in the heathen gods likeness withered and decayed as a tree withers and decays when torn up from the soil  and first they began to call themselves after the names of false gods which they had invented out of their own carnal fancies  then they called themselves after the names of their dumb animals  so pharaoh means the sungod the ammonites mean the people who worshipped the ram as a god potiphar means a fat bull which the egyptians used to worship and i could tell you of hundreds of heathen names more like these which are ridiculous enough to make one smile if we did not keep in mind what tokens they are of sin and ignorance and the likeness not of god but of the beasts which perish  then comes another set of names showing a lower fall still when heathens have quite forgotten that man was originally made in gods likeness and are not only content to live after the likeness of the beasts which perish but pride themselves on being like beasts and therefore name their children after dumb animalsthe girls after the gentler and fairer animals and the boys after ravenous and cruel beasts of prey  that has been the custom among many heathen nations perhaps among almost all of them at some time or other it is the custom now among the red indians in north america where you will find one man in a tribe called the bull another the panther and another the serpent and so on showing that they would like to be if they could as strong as the bull as cruel as the panther as venomous as the serpent  what wonder that those red indians who have so put on the likeness of the beasts are now dying off the face of the earth like the beasts whom they admire and imitate  and this was the way with our own heathen forefathers before the blessed gospel was preached to them  it is frightful in reading old histories to find how many englishmen our own forefathers were named after fierce wild beasts and tried alas to be like their nameschildren of wrath whose feet were swift to shed blood under whose lips was the poison of adders and destruction and bloodshed following in their paths not knowing the way of peace the wolf was the common wild beast of england then and there are i should say twenty common old english names ending in wolf besides as many more ending in bear and eagle and raven  fearful sign that men of our own flesh and blood should have gloried in being like the wolf the cruellest the greediest the most mean of savage beasts  how shall we thank god enough who sent to them the knowledge of his son jesus christ and called them to be new men in christ jesus and called them to holy baptism to receive new names and begin new lives in the righteous likeness of god himselfthat as by nature they had been the children of wrath so in baptism they might become the children of grace that as from their forefathers they had inherited a corrupt nature original sin and the likeness of the foul and ravenous beasts which perish they might have power from the spirit of god to become the sons of god conformed into the likeness of jesus christ in peace and love and righteousness and all holiness  and yet in names there is a lower depth still among fallen and heathen men when they lose utterly the last dim notion that god intends men to be persons even as god the father is a person and god the son a person and god the holy spirit is a person and so lose the custom of giving their children personal names at all either giving them after they grow up mere nicknames taken from some peculiarity of their bodies or something which they have done or some place where they happen to live or else like many tribes of heathen negroes just name them after the day of the week on which they were born as some way of knowing them apart or last and most shocking of all give them no names at all and have no names themselves knowing each other apart as the dumb animals do only by sight  i can conceive no deeper fall into utter brutishness than that and yet some few of the most savage tribes both in africa and in the indian islands are saidgod help themto live in that way and to have no namesblotted indeed out of the book of life  but is this the right state for men  no it is the wrong state  it is a disease into which men are fallen a disease out of which christ came to raise men and out of which he does raise us in holy baptism  baptism puts the child into its right stateinto the right state for a human being a human soul a human person  and baptism declares what that right state isa member of christ a child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven  a member of christ and therefore a person because christ is a person  a child of god and therefore a person because a childs duty is to love and trust and obey his fatherand only a person can do that not an animal or a thing  an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven and therefore bound to cherish all heavenly thoughts and feelings all righteousness love and obedience which only spirits and persons not animals or things can feel  now can you not see why baptism is the proper time for giving the child a name  because then christ claims the child for his own because having a name shows that the child is a person who has a soul a will a conscience a duty a person who must answer himself for himself alone for what he does in the body whether it be good or evil  and that will and soul and conscience were given the child by christ by whom all things are made who is the light which lights every man who comes into the world  thus in holy baptism god adopts the child for his own in jesus christ  he declares that the child is regenerate and has a new life a life from above a seed of eternal personal life which he himself has not by nature  and that seed of eternal life is none other but the holy spirit of god the spirit of the father and of the son the lord and giver of life who does verily and indeed regenerate the child in holy baptism and dwells with his soul his person his very self that he may educate the childs character and raise his affections and subdue his will and raise him up daily from the death of sin to the life of righteousness  therefore when in the catechism you solemnly ask the child its name you ask it no light question  you speak as a spirit a person to its spirit to its very self which god wills should never perish but live for ever  you single the child out from all its schoolfellows from all the millions of human beings who have ever lived or ever will live and you make the child by answering to his name confess that he is a person an immortal soul who must stand alone before the judgment seat of god a person who has a duty and a calling upon gods earth which he must fulfil or pay the forfeit  and then you ask the child who gave him his name and make him declare that his name was given him in baptism wherein he was made a member of christ and a child of god  you make the child confess that he is a person in jesus christ that christ has redeemed him his very self and taken him to himself and made him not merely gods creature or gods slave but gods child  you make the child confess that his duty as a person is not towards himself to do what he likes and follow his own carnal lusts but toward god and toward his neighbours who are in gods kingdom of heaven as well as he  and then you go on in the rest of the catechism to teach him how he himself the person to whom you are speaking may live for ever and ever as a person by faith in other persons beside himself even in god the father son and holy spirit as you teach him in the creed by doing his duty to other persons beside himself even to god and man as you teach him in the ten commandments and by diligent prayer to another person beside himself even to god his heavenly father to feed and strengthen him day by day with that eternal life which was given to him in baptism thus the whole catechism turns upon the very first question in it what is thy name  it explains to the child what is really meant in the sight of god and of the lord jesus christ and of the whole church in earth and heaven by the childs having a name of his own and being a person and having that name given to him in holy baptism  and if this is true of our children my friends it is equally true of us  you and i are persons and persons in christ each stands alone day and night before the judgmentseat of christ  each must answer for himself  none can deliver his brother nor make agreement unto god for him  each of us has his calling from his heavenly father his duty to do which none can do instead of him each has his own sins his own temptations his own sorrows which he must bring singlehanded and alone to god his father as it is written the heart knoweth its own bitterness and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy  there is a world a flesh and a devil near to us ready to drag us down and destroy our personal and spiritual life which god has given us in christ a flesh which tempts us to follow our own appetites and passions blindly and lawlessly like the beasts which perish a world which tempts us to become mere things without freewills of our own or consciences of our own without personal faith and personal holiness the puppets of the circumstances and the customs which happen to be round us blown about like the dead leaf and swept helplessly down the stream of time  and there is a devil too near us tempting us to the deepest lie of allto set up ourselves apart from god and to try as the devil tries to be persons in our own strength each doing what he chooses each being his own law and his own master that is his own lawlessness and his own tyrant  and if we listen to that devil that spirit of lawlessness and selfwill we shall become his slaves persons in him doing his work and finding torment and misery and slavery in it  awful thought that so many enemies should be against us yea that we ourselves should be our own enemies  but here baptism gives us hope baptism gives us courage we are in christ god is our father and he can and will give us power to have victory and to triumph against the world the flesh and the devil  his spirit is given to us in baptismthat spirit of god who is not merely a force or an influence but a person a living loving holy person  he is with us to give our persons our souls eternal life from his life eternal holiness from his holiness that so not merely some part of us but we our very selves and soulswe the very same persons who were christened and had a name given us in holy baptism and have been answering to that name all our life and were reminded whenever we heard that name that we had a duty of our own a history of our own hopes fears joys sorrows of our own which none could share with us that we i say our own persons our very selves may be raised up again at the last day free pure strong filled with the life of god which is eternal life  and then what blessed words are these from the lord jesus which we read in the book of revelation  and i will give to him that overcometh a new name  a new name for him that overcometh world flesh and devil that shall be our portion in the world to come  a new name perfect like the name of the lord jesus which shall express and mean all that we are to do hereafter and all that we have done well on earth  a name which shall declare to us our calling and work in gods church triumphant throughout all ages and worlds to come  and yet a name which no man knoweth saving he who receiveth it  yes if we may dare to guess at the meaning of those deep words perhaps in that new name shall be recorded for each man all that went on in the secret depths of the mans own heart between himself and his god unknown and unnoticed even by the wife of his bosom  the cup of cold water given in christs name the little private acts of love and kindness and selfsacrifice of which none but god knew the secret prayers the secret acts of contrition the secret hungerings and thirstings after righteousness the secret struggles and agonies of heart which he could not dare not ought not to tell to any human being  all these he shall find will go to make up his character in the life to come to determine what work he is to do for god in the world to come as it is written be thou faithful over a few things and i will make thee ruler over many things  all these perhaps shall be expressed and declared in that new name the full meaning of which none will know but the man himself because none but he knows the secret experiences and struggles which went toward the making of it none but he and god for god will know all he who is the lord and saviour of our souls our persons our very selves and can preserve them utterly to the fulness of eternal life because he knows them thoroughly and utterly because he judges not according to appearance but judges righteous judgment because he sees us not merely as we seem to others to be not even as we seem at times to ourselves to bebut searches the heart and can be touched with the feeling of its infirmities seeing that he himself has been tempted even as we are yet without sin because blessed thought he can pierce through the very marrow of our being and discern the thoughts and intents of our hearts and see what we long to be and what we ought to be so that we can safely and hopefully commend our spirits to his hand day by day and hour by hour and can trust him to cleanse us from our secret faults and to renew and strengthen our very selves day by day with that eternal life which he gives to all who cast themselves utterly upon him    sermon v  sponsorship    1 cor xii 26 27  whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or whether one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it  now ye are the body of christ and members in particular  i have to tell you that there will be a confirmation held at    on the    all persons of fit age who have not yet been confirmed ought to be ready and i hope and trust that most of them will be ready on that day to profess publicly their faith and loyalty to the lord who died for them  i hope and trust that they will as soon as possible tell me that they intend to do so and come to me to talk over the matter and to learn what i can teach them about it  they will find in me i hope nothing but kindness and fellow feeling  but i have not only to tell young persons of the confirmation  i have to tell all godfathers and godmothers of it also  have any of you here ever stood godfather or godmother to any young person in this parish who is not yet confirmed  if you have now is the time for you to fulfil your parts as sponsors  you must help me and help the childrens parents in bringing your godchildren to confirmation  it really is your duty  it will be better for you if you fulfil it  better for you not merely by preventing a punishment but by bringing a blessing  let me try to show you what i mean  now godparents must have some duty some responsibility or other that is plain  if you or i promise and vow things in another persons name we must be bound more or less to see that that other person fulfils the promise which we made for him  and so the baptism service warns the sponsors as soon as the child is christened forasmuch as this child has promised c and then we have a plain explanation of what a godfather and godmothers duties are  and that your godchild may know these things the better c  and finally you shall take care that this child be brought to the bishop to be confirmed  that is the duty of godfathers and godmothers  those who stand for any child do it on that understanding and take upon themselves knowingly that duty  now i will not threaten you my friends i will not pretend to tell you how god will punish those godfathers and godmothers who do not do their duty because i do not know how he will punish them  he has not told us in the bible and who am i to deal out gods thunders as if they belonged to me and judge people of whose real merits and dements in gods sight i have no fair means of judging i always dread and dislike threatening any sinner out of this pulpit except those who plainly break the plain laws which are written in those ten commandments and hypocrites  because i stand in awe of our lords own wordswoe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders while you yourselves touch them not with one of your fingers  there is too much of that nowadays my friends and i have no mind to add my share to it  and sure i am that any godfathers and godmothers who do their duty only because they are afraid that god will punish them if they do not will not do their duty at all  but sure i am also and thankful to god that we cannot neglect any duty whatsoever without being punished in some way or other for our neglect of it  that is not a curse but a blessing  it is a blessing to us to be punished  the only real curse of god in this life is to be left unpunished for our sins  it is a blessing for us that our sins find us out  for if our sins did not find us out we should very often i fear not find our sins out  and therefore when i tell godfathers and godmothers not that god will perhaps punish them for their neglect but that he does punish them for it already i am telling them good news if they will only open their hearts to that good news  for god does punish people for neglecting their godchildren  those who have eyes to see may see it round us now in this very parish and in every parish in england in the selfishness distrust divisions and quarrels which prevail  i do not mean that this parish is worse than others or england worse than other countries that is no concern of ours  our own parish and our own evils are quite concern enough for us  are people happy together  do they pull well together  look at the oldstanding quarrels misunderstandings grudges prejudices suspicions which part one man from another one family from another every man for his own house and very few for the kingdom of godno not even for the general welfare of the parish  do not men try to better themselves at the expense of the parishto the injury of the parish  do not men when they try to raise their own family seem to think that the simplest way to do it is to pull down their neighbours family to draw away their custom oust them from their places or hurt their characters in order to rise upon their fall so that though they are brothers members of the same church nation and parish the greater part of them are in practice at war with each othertrying to live at each others expense  now is this profitable  so far from it that if you will watch the history either of the whole world or of this country or of this one parish you will find that by far the greater part of the misery in it has sprung from this very selfishness and separatenessfrom the perpetual struggle between man and man and between family and family  so that there have been men and those learned and thoughtful and wellmeaning men enough who have said that the only cure for the worlds quarrelling and selfishness was to take all children away from their parents and bring them up in large public schools ay and even to try plans which are sinful foul and wicked all in order to prevent parents knowing which were their own children that they might care for all the children in the parish as much as if they were their own  a foolish plan my friends and for this one reason that it is driving out one evil by a still greater one  it destroys the root to get the fruit by destroying family life and love and obedience to get at the communion of saints or rather at some ghost of it  the real communion of saints is founded on the fifth commandmentthou shalt honour thy father and thy mother and grows out of it not by destroying it but by fulfilling it as the tree grows out of the root without taking away from the life of the root but rather by nourishing and increasing it  now the ancient institution of godfathers and godmothers would it seems to me if it were carried out honestly and really do for us what we certainly have not done for ourselves as yet and bind us all together as one family  it would do all the good which those fanciful philosophers of whom i first spoke have dreamt without any of the evil and it would do it because it goes simply on the belief that the foundation is already laid and that that foundation is christ  it says because this child is not merely the child of his father and mother but the child of god the universal father therefore other people besides his parents have an interest in him  all who are children of god as well as he have an interest in him for they are all his brothers and have a brothers interest in his welfare  because this child is not merely a member of the family whose surname he bears but a member of christ a member of gods great adopted family in the hearts of every one of whom his only begotten son jesus christ is working therefore this child ought to be an object of awe and of interest and love and care to every other member of christs church  moreover the child is an inheritor of a heavenly kingdoma kingdom of gracea kingdom of godwhich is love and justice and peace and joy in the holy spiritall personal spiritual heavenly godgiven gracesand he cannot have them without being a blessing to all around him and he cannot be without them without being a curse to all around him  if in after life when he comes to be confirmed he claims his inheritance in this heavenly kingdom he will be full of love justice peace joy in the holy spirit  if he refuses to claim his inheritance and despises his heavenly birthright and lives as if he were a mere earthly creature only to please himself and help himself he will not be full of those graces  and what then  that he will be full of their opposites of course  if he has not love he will be unloving selfish hard coldto you and yours  if he has not justice he will be unjustto you and yours  if he is not at peace he will be at war quarrelling grudging envying backbitingyou and yours  if he has not joy in the holy spirit he will have joy in an unholy spirit for he must have joy in some spirit he must take pleasure in some sort of way of thinking and feeling and some sort of lifein short in some sort of spirit and whatsoever is not holy is unholy whatsoever is not good is bad whatsoever is not of gods holy spirit is of the deviland therefore if the child as he grows up has not joy in the holy spirit and does not enjoy doing right and pleasing god and being like the lord jesus christ then he will enjoy doing wrong and pleasing himself and being unlike the lord jesus christ and so he will set a bad example and be a temptation to all young people of his own age ready to lead them into sin and draw them away to those sinful and unholy pleasures in which he takes delightwhether it be to rioting and drinking or to uncleanness and unchastity or to sneering and laughing at godliness and at good people  and that as you know by experience may be the worse for you and the worse for your children  is that the sort of young person with whom you would wish to see your children keeping company  is that the sort of young person next door to whom you would wish to live  is not such a person a curse just because he is a person a spiritual being with an evil spirit in him which can harm you and tempt you and act on you for evil just as if he had been a righteous person with the holy and good spirit in him he would have helped you and taught you and worked on you for good  but so it is  we are members one of another and if one member goes wrong and gets diseased and suffers all the other members are sure to suffer more or less with it sooner or later  you feel it so in your bodiesbe sure it is so in gods church  but if one member is sound and healthy all the other members must and will be the better for its health and rejoice with it and be able to do their own work the more freely and strongly and heartily  just think for yourselves consider you who are grown up and have had experience of life the harm you have known one bad man do the sorrow he will cause even to people who never saw him and the good which you have seen one good man not merely do with his own hands but put into other peoples hearts by his example  is not both the good and the harm which is done on earth like the ripple of a stone dropt into water which spreads and spreads for a vast distance round however small the stone may be  indeed bold as it may seem to say it i believe that if we could behold all hearts as the lord jesus does we should find that there never was a good man but that the whole of christendom perhaps all mankind was sooner or later more or less the better for him and that there never was a bad man but that all christendom perhaps all mankind was the worse for him  so fully and really true it is in everyday practice that we are members one of another  now this is the principle on which the church acts  for the little unconscious infant is treated as what it is a most solemn and important person who has other relations beside its father and mother as a person who is the brother of all the people round it and of all the church of god and who too may hereafter do to them boundless good or harm and they to it  therefore we must have some persons to bear witness of that to remind the child himself and the whole church that he is not merely a soul by itself to be saved but that he is a brother a member of a family that he is bound to that family henceforth for good and for evil  and this the godfathers and godmothers do  they represent and stand in the place of the whole church  in one sense every christian who meets that child through life or hears of it ought to behave as far as he can as its godfather ought to help and improve it if he can  but what is everybodys business says the proverb is nobodys business and therefore these godfathers and godmothers are called out from the rest as examples to the rest to watch over the child and to help and advise its father and mother in guiding and training it  but not by interfering with a parents rights god forbid or by drawing away the childs affections from its own flesh and blood for if a child be not taught first to honour its father and mother there is little use in teaching it anything else whatsoever and a godfathers first duty is to see that his godchild obeys its earthly parents for the lords sake for that is right and gods will whatever else is not  now just conceivei am sure that you easily maywhat a blessing to this parish or this part of the country it would be were the duties of godfathers really carried out and practised  every child beside his father and mother would have some two or three elder friends at least whom he had known from his childhood whom he could trust to whom he could go in trouble as to his own flesh and blood  the orphan would have if not relations still godparents to comfort and protect him  no one could go abroad without meeting if not a godparent yet the godparent or godchild of a friend or a relation someone in short who had an interest in him and he in them  all would be bound together in threefold cords of interest and affection  how many spites family quarrels mistakes and ignorances about each other would be done away if people would but thus simply enter into that communion of saints to which by right they belong and bear each others burdens and so fulfil the law of christunless you think that men are such illconditioned creatures that the less they mix with each other the better  i do not  i believe that the more we mix with each other and the better we know each other the more we shall feel for each other  that the more we help people the more we shall find that they are worth helping that the more in a word we try to live not after the likeness of the beasts selfish and apart but after the order and constitution of gods church to which we belong and which is that we are all fellowmembers of one body then the more we shall find that gods order is the right good blessed order by obeying which we enter into comfort of which we never dream as long as we lead selfish separate worldly lives as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the things which god has prepared for those who love him  this may seem a fanciful dream too fair to be possible but what prevents it from being possible save and except our own selfishness and laziness  and as for what fruit will spring from it i have seen by experience the blessing of godfathership and godmothership where it is really carried out how it will knit together in sacred bonds of friendship not merely the children but the grown persons of different families and give them a fellowfeeling a mutual interest which will prevent a hundred quarrels and coldnesses among frail human creatures  and to those who are childless themselves what a blessing to have their love and selfsacrifice called out by being bound in holy bonds if not to children of their own at least to children of godto have young people to care for to teach to guide and so to win for themselves in the church of god a name better than that of sons and daughters  and have no fear that by bringing your kindness to bear especially upon your godchildren you will narrow your love and care less for children in general  not so my friends you will find that your love to your godchildren like love to your own children will make all children lovable in your eyes  you will learn how worthy of your love children are what capacities of good there are in them how truly of such are the kingdom of heaven and their simplicity will often teach you more than you can teach them  their godgiven instincts of right and wrong truth and falsehood which come from the indwelling word of god jesus the lord will often enough shame us will teach us more and more the depth of that great saying out of the mouths of babes and sucklings thou o god hast perfected thy praise  now try i entreat you all godfathers and godmothers to carry out these hints of mine and so fulfil your duty to your godchildren sure that you will find it a blessing to yourselves as well as to them  after all it is your duty  but do not let the slandering devil slander to you that blessed word duty and make you afraid of it and shrink from it as if it meant something burdensome and troublesome and thankless which you suppose you must do for fear of punishment while you have a right to see how little of it you can do and try to be let off as cheaply as possible  beware of that evil spirit my friends for he is very near you and me and every man whenever we think of our duty  very near us he is that evil jesuit spirit that spirit of bondage unto fear which is continually setting us on to find out with how little service god will be contented how human slaves may make the cheapest bargain with some stern taskmaster above of whom they dream  and from that temptation there is no escape save into the blessed name of god himselfour father  our fatherwhenever you think of your duty to god or man think but of those two words  remember that all duty is duty to a father your father and such a father  who gave his only begotten son to die for you who showed what he was in that sonfull of goodness perfectly loving perfectly merciful perfectly just and then you will not be inclined to ask how little obedience how little love how little service he will allow you to pay to him but how much he will help you to pay to him  then you will feel that his service is perfect freedom because it is service to a father who loves you and will help you to do his will  then you will feel that his commandments are not grievous because they are a fathers commandments because you are bound to do them not by dread and superstition but by gratitude honour affection respect trust then you will not be thinking of what punishment will come if you disobeyno nor of what reward will come if you obeybut you will be thinking of the commandment itself and how to carry it out most perfectly and let the consequences take care of themselves because you know that your father takes care of them that he loves you and therefore what he commands must be good for you utterly the best thing for you that he only gives you a commandment because it is good for you that you are made in gods image and therefore gods will must be for you the path of life the only rule by which you can prosper now and for ever  do try now all you who are godfathers and godmothers and for once look on your duty in this light  be sure that in trying to do your duty you will bring a blessing on yourselves because your duty is to a father in heaven  be sure that in trying to better your godchildren you will better yourselves in trying to teach them you will teach yourselves in trying to bring them to confirmation you will indeed confirm root and strengthen yourselves the more deeply in all that is good because your godchildren are indeed gods children and whatsoever you do for them you do for his only begotten son jesus christ as he himself says inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these little ones ye did it unto me do not be afraid of trying you will have a hundred reasons for not trying rise in your mind the devil will find you a hundred lying excuses  it will be so difficult and you do not like to interfere with other peoples children and you have never cared about your godchildren yet and it will seem so odd to begin now and the children may not listen to you and besides you do not know enough to teach them you are not good scholar enough good liver enough you cant preach where you dont practice  oh how ready the devil is to help a man to excuses for not doing his duty how careful he is to keep out of a mans mind the one thought which would sweep all those excuses to the windthe thought that this same duty which he is trying to make look so ugly is duty to a loving father  do not listen to his lies look up to your good father in heaven and try it is gods will that these children should be confirmed it is his will that you should help to bring them to confirmation and if it is his will he will help you to do that will of his  it may seem difficult  but try and the difficulty will vanish for god will make it easy for you  you may be afraid of interfering  believe that gods spirit is working in the hearts of your godchildren and of their parents also and trust to gods spirit to make them kindly and thankful to you about the matter and glad to see that you take an interest in their children  you may seem not to know enough  o my friends you know enough every one of you if you have courage to confess how much you know  ask god for courage to speak out and he will give it you  and even if you are no scholar be sure that as the old proverb says teaching is the best way of learning any parent or godfather or godmother who will try to teach their children gods truth and their duty will find that in so doing they will teach themselves even more than they teach the children  i say it because i know it from my own experience  and for the rest again i say is not god your father  therefore if any man be in want of wisdom or courage or any other heavenly gift let him ask of god who giveth liberally and upbraideth not and he shall receive it  for after all when you ask god to teach you and strengthen you to do your duty you do but ask him for a part of that very inheritance which he has already given you a part of your inheritance in that kingdom of heaven which is a kingdom of spiritual gifts and graces into which you were baptized as well as your godchildren  try then each of you what you can do to bring your own godchildren to confirmation and what you can do to make them fit for confirmation for you are members one of another and if you will act as such you will find strength to do your duty and a blessing in your day from that heavenly father from whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth and yours among the rest is named    sermon vi  justification by faith    ephesians ii 5  by grace ye are saved  we all hold that we are justified by faith that is by believing and that unless we are justified we cannot be saved  and of all men who ever believed this perhaps those who gave us the church catechism believed it most strongly  nay some of them suffered for it endured persecution banishment and a cruel death because they would persist in holding contrary to the romanists that men were justified by faith only and not by the works of the law and that this was one of the rootdoctrines of christianity which if a man did not believe he would believe nothing else rightly  does it not seem then something strange that they should never in this catechism of theirs mention one word about justifying or justification  they do not ask the child how is a man justified that he may answer by faith alone they do not even teach him to say i am justified already  i am in a state of justification but not saying one word about that they teach him to say much more they teach him to say that he is in a state of salvation and to thank god boldly because he is so and then go on at once to ask him the articles of his belief  and even more strange still they teach him to answer that question not by repeating any doctrines but by repeating the simple old apostles creed  they do not teach him to say as some would nowadays i believe in original sin i believe in redemption through christs death i believe in justification by faith i believe in sanctification by the holy spirittrue as these doctrines are still less do they bid the child say i believe in predestination and election and effectual calling and irresistible grace and vicarious satisfaction and forensic justification and vital faith and the three assurances  whether these things be true or false it seemed to the ancient worthies who gave us our catechism that children had no business with them  they had their own opinions on these matters and spoke their opinions moderately and wisely and the sum of their opinions we have in the thirtynine articles which are not meant for children not even for grown persons excepting scholars and clergymen  of course every grown person is at liberty to study them but no one in the church of england is required to agree to them and to swear that they are true except scholars at our old universities and clergymen who are bound to have studied such questions  but for the rest of englishmen all the necessary articles of belief so the old divines considered were contained in the simple old apostles creed  and why  because it seems to me they were what englishmen ought to bewhat too many englishmen are too apt to boast of being in these days while they are not so or anything like itand that is honest men and practical men  they had taught the children to say that they were members of christ children of god and inheritors of the kingdom of heaven and they had taught the children when they said that to mean what they said for they had no notion that i am meant i may possibly be or that i was made meant there is a chance of my being made some time or other  they would not have dared to teach children to say things which were most probably not true  so believing really what they taught they believed also that the children were justified  for if a child is not justified in being a member of christ a child of god and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven what is he justified in being  is not that exactly the just right and proper state for him and for every manthe very state in which all men were meant originally to be in which all men ought to have been  so they looked on these children as being in the just right and proper way on which god looks with satisfaction and pleasure and in which alone a man can do just right and proper things by the spirit of christ which he gives daily and hourly to those who belong to him and trust in him and in his father  but they knew that the children could only keep in this just and right and proper state by trusting in god and looking up to him daily in faith and love and obedience  they knew that if the children whether for one hour or for their whole lives lost trust in god and began trusting in themselves they would that very moment then and there become not justified at all because they would be doing a thing which no man is justified in doing and fall into a state into which no man is justified in remaining for one hourthat is into an unjustifiable state of selfwill and lawlessness and forgetfulness of who and of what they were and of what god was to them in one word into a sinful state which is not a righteous or just or good or proper state for any man but an utterly unrighteous unjust wrong improper mistaken diseased state which is certain to breed unrighteous unjust improper actions in a man as a limb is certain to corrupt if it be cut off from the body as a little child is certain to come to harm if it runs away from its parents and does just what it likes and eats whatsoever pleases its fancy  so these old divines being practical men said to themselves these children are justified and right in being what they are therefore our business is to keep them what they are and we can only do that as long as they have faith in god and in his christ  now if they had been mere men of books they would have said to themselves then we must teach the children very exactly what faith is that they may know how to tell true faith from false and may be able to judge every day and hour whether they have the right sort of faith which will justify them or some wrong sort which will not and many wise and good men in those times did say so and tormented their own minds and the minds of weak brethren with long arguments and dry doctrines about faith till in their eagerness to make out what sort of thing faith ought to be they seemed quite to forget that it must be faith in god and so seemed to forget too who god was and what he was like  therefore they ended by making people believe as too many i fear do nowadays not that they were justified freely by the grace of god shown forth in the life and death and resurrection of his son jesus christ no  but that they were justified by believing in justification by faith and that their salvation depended not on being faithful to god and trusting in him but in standing up fiercely for the doctrine of justification by faith  and so they destroyed the doctrine of free grace while they thought they were fighting for it for they taught men not to look to god for salvation so much as to their own faith their own frames and feelings and experiences and these as common sense will show you are just as much something in a man as acts of his own and part of him as his good works would be and so by making people fancy that it was having the right sort of feelings which justified them they fell back into the very same mistake as the papists against whom they were so bitter namely that it is something in a mans self which justifies him and not simply christs merits and gods free grace  but our old reformers were of a different mind and everlasting thanks be to almighty god that they were so  for by being so they have made the church of england as i always have said and always will say almost the only church in europe protestant or other which thoroughly and fully stands up for free grace and justification by faith alone  for these old reformers were practical men and took the practical way  they knew perhaps the old proverb a man need not be a builder to live in a house  at least they acted on it and instead of trying to make the children understand what faith was made up of they tried to make them live in faith itself  instead of saying how shall we make the children have faith in god by telling them what faith is they said how shall we make them have faith in god by telling them what god is and therefore instead of puzzling and fretting the childrens minds with any of the controversies which were then going on between papists and protestants or afterwards between calvinists and arminians they taught the children simply about god who he was and what he had done for them and all mankind that so they might learn to love him and look up to him in faith and trust utterly to him and so remain justified and right saved and safe for ever  by doing which my friends they showed that they knew more about faith and about god than if they had written books on books of doctrinal arguments though they wrote those too and wrote them nobly and well they showed that they had true faith in god such trust in him and in the beauty and goodness justice and love which he had shown that they only needed to tell the children of it and they would trust him too and at once have faith in so good a god  they showed that they had such trust in the excellencies and reasonableness and fitness of his gospel that they were sure that it would come home at once to the childrens hearts  they showed that they had such trust in the power of his grace in his love for the children in the working of his spirit in the children that he would bring his gospel home to their hearts and stir them up by the spirit of adoption to feel that they were indeed the children of god to whom they might freely cry my father  and i say that they were not deceived  i say that experience has shown that they were right that the church catechism where it is really and honestly taught gives the children an honest frank sober english temper of mind which no other training which i have seen gives  i have seen alas  church schools fail ere now in training good children but as far as i have seen they have failed either because the catechism was neglected for the sake of cramming the childrens brains with scholarship or because the catechism was not honestly taught  because the words were taught by rote but the explanations which were given of it were no explanations at all but another doctrine which our forefathers knew not  either dissenting or popish either a religion of fancies and feelings and experiences or one of superstitious notions and superstitious ceremonies which have been borrowed from the church of rome and which i trust in god will be soon returned to their proper owner if the free truthful godtrusting english spirit is to remain in our children  i know that there are good men among dissenters my friends good men among romanists  i have met with them and i thank god for them and what may not be good for english children may be good for foreign ones  i judge not to his own master each man stands or falls  but i warn you frankly from experience not of my own merelyheaven forbidbut from the experience of centuries past that if you expect to make the average of english children good children on any other ground than the church catechism takes you will fail  of course there will be some chosen ones here and there whose hearts god will touch but you will find that the greater part of the children will not be made better at all you will find that the cleverer and more tenderhearted will be made conceited pharisaical selfdeceiving for children are as ready to deceive themselves and play the hypocrite to their own consciences as grown people are they will catch up cant words and phrases or little outward forms of reverence and make a religion for themselves out of them to drug their own consciences withal while when they go out into the world and meet temptation they will have no real safeguard against it because whatsoever they have been taught they have not been taught that god is really and practically their father and they his children  i have seen many examples of this kind  perhaps those who have eyes to see may have seen one or two in this very parish  be that as it may i tell you my friends that your children shall be taught the church catechism with the plain honest meaning of the words as they stand  no less  but as god shall give me grace no more  if it be not enough for them to know that god he who made heaven and earth is their father that his son jesus christ redeemed them and all mankind by being born of the virgin mary suffering under pontius pilate being crucified dead and buried descending into hell rising again the third day from the dead ascending into heaven and sitting on the right hand of god the father almighty in the intent of coming from thence to judge the living and the dead to believe in the holy spirit in the holy universal church in which he keeps us in the fellowship of all saints in which he knits us together in the forgiveness of our sins which he proclaims to us in the resurrection of our body which he will quicken at the last day in the life everlasting which is his lifeif i say this be not enough for them to believe and on the strength thereof to trust god utterly and so be justified and saved from this evil world and from the doom and punishment thereof then they must go elsewhere for i have nothing more to offer them and trust in god that i never shall have    sermon vii  duty and superstition    micah vi 68  wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the most high god  shall i come before him with burnt offerings     will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams     shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul  he hath shewed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  there are many nowadays who complain of that part of the church catechism which speaks of our duty to god and to our neighbour and many more i fear who shrink from complaining of the church catechism because it is part of the prayerbook yet wish in their secret hearts that it had said something different about duty  some wonder why it does not say more about what are called religious duties and acts of worship mortification penitence and good works  others wonder no less why it says nothing about what are called christian frames and feelings and inward experiences  for there is a notion abroad in the world as there is in all evil times that a mans chief duty is to save his own soul after he is dead that his business in this world is merely to see how he can get out of it again without suffering endless torture after his body dies  this is called superstition  anxiety about what will happen to us after we die  now if you look at the greater number of religious books whether popish or protestant you will find that in practice the main thing almost the one thing which they are meant to do is to show the reader how he may escape helltorments and reach heavens pleasures after he dies  not how he may do his duty to god and his neighbour they speak of that latter of course  they could not be christian books at all thank god without doing so but they seem to me to tell men to do their duty not simply because it is right and a blessing in itself and worth doing for its own sake but because a man may gain something by it after he dies  therefore to help their readers to gain as much as possible after they die they are not content with the plain duty laid down in the bible and in the catechism but require of men new duties over and above which may be all very good if they help men to do their real duty but are simply worth nothing if they do not  let me explain myself  i said just now that superstition means anxiety about what will happen to us after we die  but people commonly understand by superstition religious ceremonies like the popish ones which god has not commanded  and that is not a wrong meaning either for people take to these ceremonies from over anxiety about the next life  the one springs out of the other the outward conduct out of the inward fear and both spring alike out of a false notion of god which the devil whose great aim is to hinder us from knowing our father in heaven puts into mens minds  man feels that he is sinful and unrighteous the light of christ in his heart shows him that and it shows him at the same time that god is sinless and righteous  then he says god must hate sin and there he says true  then steps in the slanderer satan and whispers but you are sinful therefore god hates you and wills you harm and torture and ruin  and the poor man believes that lying voice and will believe it to the end whether he be christian or heathen until he believes the bible and the sacraments which tell him god does not hate you  he hates your sins and loves you he wills not your misery but your happiness and therefore gods will yea gods earnest endeavour is to raise you out of those sins of yours which make you miserable now and which if you go on in them must bring of themselves everlasting misery to you of themselves not by any arbitrary decree of god whereof the bible says not one single word from beginning to end that he will inflict on you so much pain for so much sin  but by the very nature of sin for to sin is to be parted from god in whose presence alone is life and therefore sin is to be in death  sin is to be at war with god who is love and peace and therefore to be in lovelessness hatred war and misery  sin is to act contrary to the constitution which god gave man when he said let us make man in our image after our likeness and therefore sin is a disease in human nature and like all other diseases must unless it is checked go on everlastingly and perpetually breeding weakness pain and torment  and out of that god is so desirous to raise you that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for you if by any means he might raise you out of that death of sin to the life of righteousnessto a righteous life to a life of dutyto a dutiful life like his son jesus christs life for that must go on if you go on in it producing in you everlastingly and perpetually all health and strength usefulness and happiness in this world and all worlds to come  but men will not hear that voice  the fact is that simply to do right is too difficult for them and too humbling also  they are too proud to like being righteous only with christs righteousness and too slothful also and so they go about like the old pharisees to establish a righteousness of their own one which will pamper their selfconceit by seeming very strange and farfetched and difficult so as to enable them to thank god every day that they are not as other men are and yet one which shall really not be as difficult as the plain homely work of being good sons good fathers good husbands good masters good servants good subjects good rulers  and so they go about to establish a righteousness of their own which can be no righteousness at all for gods righteousness is the only righteousness and christs righteousness is the only pattern of it and teach men that god does not merely require of men to do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with their god but requires of them something more  but by this they deny the righteousness of god for they make out that he has not behaved righteously and justly to men nor showed them what is good but has left them to find it out or invent it for themselves  for is it not establishing a righteousness of ones own to tell people that god only requires these ten commandments of christians in general but that if any one chooses to go further and do certain things which are not contained in the ten commandments counsels of perfection as they are called and good works as if there were no other good works in the world and so do more than it is ones duty to do and lead a sort of life which is called i know not why saintly and angelic then one will obtain a peculiar crown and a higher place in heaven than poor commonplace christian people who only do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with their god  and is it not on the other hand establishing a righteousness of ones own to say that god requires of us belief in certain doctrines about election and forensic justification and sensible conversion and certain frames and feelings and experiences and that without all these a man has no right to expect anything but endless torture and all the while to say little or nothing about gods requiring of men the ten commandments  for my part i am equally shocked and astonished at the doctrine which i have heard round us hereopenly from some few and in practice from more than a fewthat because the ten commandments are part of the law they are done away with because we are not now under the law but under grace  what do they mean  is it not written that not one jot or tittle of the law shall fail and that christ came not to destroy the law but to fulfil it  what do they mean  that it was harm to break the ten commandments before christ came but no harm to break them now  do they mean that jews were forbid to murder steal and commit adultery but that christians are not forbidden  one thing i am afraid they do mean for i see them act up to it steadily enough  that jews were forbidden to covet but that christians are not that jews might not commit fornication but christians may that jews might not lie but christians may that jews might not use false weights and measures or adulterate goods for sale but that christians may  my friends if i am asked the reason of the hypocrisy which seems the besetting sin of england in this dayif i am asked why rich men even high religious professors dare speak untruths at public meetings bribe at elections and go into parliament each man with a lie in his right hand to serve neither god nor his country but his political party and his religious sect by conduct which he would be ashamed to employ in private lifeif i am asked why the middle classes and the high religious professors among them just as much as any are given over to cheating coveting puffing their own goods by shameless and unmanly boasting undermining each other by the dirtiest means while the sons of religious professors both among the higher and the middle classes seem just as liable as any other young men to fall into unmanly profligacyif i am asked why the poor profess gods gospel and practise the devils works and why in this very parish now there are women who while they are drunkards swearers and adulteresses will run anywhere to hear a sermon and like nothing better saving sin than highflown religious booksif i am asked i say why the old english honesty which used to be our glory and our strength has decayed so much of late years and a hideous and shameful hypocrisy has taken the place of it i can only answer by pointing to the good old church catechism and what it says about our duty to god and to our neighbour and declaring boldly it is because you have forgotten that  because you have despised that  because you have fancied that it was beneath you to keep gods plain human commandments  you have been wanting to save your souls while you did not care whether your souls were saved alive or whether they were dead and rotten and damned within you you have dreamed that you could be what you called spiritual while you were the slaves of sin you have dreamed that you could become what you call saints while you were not yet even decent men and women  and so all this superstition has had the same effect as the false preaching in ezekiels time had  it has strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not turn from his wicked way by promising him life and it has made the heart of the righteous sad whom god has not made sad  plain respectable godfearing men and women who have wished simply to do their duty where god has put them have been told that they are still unconverted still carnal that they have no share in christthat gods spirit is not with themthat they are in the way to endless torture  till they have been ready one minute to say let us eat and drink for tomorrow we diesurely i have cleansed my hands in vain and washed my heart in innocency and the next minute to say with job angrily though i die thou shalt not take my righteousness from me  you preachers may call me what names you will but i know that i love what is right and wish to do my duty and so they have been made perplexed and unhappy one day fancying themselves worse than they really were and the next fancying themselves better than they really were and by both tempers of mind tempted to disbelieve gods gospel and throw away the thought of vital religion in disgust  and now people are raising the cry that popery is about to overrun england  it may be so my friends  if it is so i cannot wonder at it if it is so englishmen have no one to blame but themselves and whether popery conquers us or not some other base superstition surely will conquer us if we go on upon our present course and set up any newfangled selfinvented righteousness of our own instead of the plain ten commandments of god  for i tell you plainly they are gods everlasting law the very law of liberty wherewith christ has made us free and only by fulfilling them as christ did can we be freefree from sin the world the flesh and the devil  for to break them is to sin  and whosoever commits sin is the slave of sin and whosoever despises these commandments will never enjoy that freedom but be entangled again in the yoke of bondage and become a slave if not to open and profligate sins still surely to an evil and tormenting conscience to superstitious anxieties as to whether he shall be saved or damned which make him at last ask wherewithal shall i come before the lord  will the lord be pleased with this that and the other fantastical action or great sacrifice of mine or at last perhaps the old question shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul  shall i cheat my own family leave my property away from my children desert them to shut myself up in a convent or to attempt some great religious enterprisethings which have happened a thousand times already and worse far worse than them things which will happen again and worse far worse than them as soon as a hypocritical generation is seized with that dread and terror of god which is sure to arise in the hearts of men who try to invent a righteousness of their own and who forget what gods righteousness is like and who therefore forget what god is like and who therefore forget what gods name is and who therefore forget that jesus christ is gods likeness and that the name of god is love  now i say that the church catechism from beginning to end is the cure for this poison and in no part more than where it tells us our duty to god and our neighbour and that it does carry out the meaning of the text as no other writing does which i know of save the bible only  for what says the text  he hath showed thee o man what is good  who has showed thee  who but this very god from whom thou art shrinking to whom thou art looking up in terror as at a hard taskmaster reaping where he has not sown who willeth the death of a sinner and his endless and unspeakable torment  the very god whom thou dreadest has stooped to save and teach thee  he hath sent his only begotten son to thee to show thee in the person of a man jesus christ what a perfect man is and what he requires of thee to be  this lord jesus is with thee to teach thee to live by faith in thy heavenly father even as he lived and to be justified thereby even as he was justified by being declared to be gods wellbeloved son and by being raised from the dead  he will show thee what is good he has shown thee what is good when he showed thee his own blessed self his story and character written in the four gospels this is thy god and this is thy lord and master not a silent god not a careless god but a revealer of secrets a teacher a guide a most merciful god who showeth to man the thing which he knew not that same word of god who talked with adam in the garden and brought his wife to him who called abraham and gave him a child who sent moses to make a nation of the jews who is the king of all the nations upon earth and has appointed them their times and the bounds of their habitation if haply they may feel after him and find him who meanwhile is not far from any one of them seeing that in him they live and move and have their being and are his offspring who has not left himself without witness that they may know that he is one who loves not one who hates one who gives not one who takes one who has pity not one who destroys in that he gives them rain and fruitful seasons filling their hearts with food and gladness  this is thy god o man from whose face thou desirest to flee away  next he hath showed thee o man  not merely he hath showed thee o deep philosopher or brilliant geniusnot merely he hath showed thee o eminent saint or believer who hast been through many deep experiences but he hath showed thee o man whosoever thou art if thou be a man subsisting like jesus christ the son of man of a reasonable soul and human flesh thou labourer at the plough tradesman in thy shop soldier in the battlefield poor woman working in thy cottage god hath showed thee and thee and thee what is good as surely and fully as he has shown it to scholars and divines to kings and rulers and the wise and prudent of the earth  and he hath showed thee not you  not merely to the whole of you together not merely to some of you so that one will have to tell the other and the greater part know only at secondhand and by hearsay  but he hath showed to thee to each of you to each man woman and child in this church alone privately in the depths of thy own heart he hath showed what is good  he hath sent into thine heart a ray of the light who lighteth every man who comes into the world  he has given to thy soul an eye by which to see that light a conscience which can receive what is good and shrink from what is evil a spiritual sense whereby thou canst discern good and evil that conscience that souls eye of thine god has regenerated as he declares to thee in baptism and he will day by day make it clearer and tenderer by the quickening power of his holy spirit and that spirit will renew himself in thee day by day if thou askest him and will quicken and soften thy soul more and more to love what is good and strengthen it more and more to hate and fly from what is evil  next he hath showed thee o man what is good  not merely what will turn away gods punishments and buy gods rewards not merely what will be good for thee after thou diest  but what is good good in itself good for thee now and good for thee for ever good for thee in health and sickness joy and sorrow life and death good for thee through all worlds present and to come yea what would be good for thee in hell if thou couldst be in hell and yet be good not what is good enough for thy neighbours and not good enough for thee good enough for sinners and not good enough for saints good enough for stupid persons and not good enough for clever ones but what is good in itself and of itself  the one very eternal and absolute good which was with god and in god and from god before all worlds and will be for ever without changing or growing less or greater eternally the same good  the good which would be just as good and just and right and lovely and glorious if there were no world no men no angels no heaven no hell and god were alone in his own abyss  that very good which is the exact pattern of his son jesus christ in whose likeness man was made at the beginning god hath showed thee o man and hath told thee that it is neither more nor less than thy duty thy duty as a man that thy duty is thy good the good out of which if thou doest it all good things such as thou canst not now conceive to thyself must necessarily spring up for thee for ever but which if thou neglectest thou wilt be in danger of getting no good things whatsoever and of having all evil things mishap shame and misery such as thou canst not now conceive of spring up for thee necessarily for ever  this seems to me the plain meaning of the text interpreted by the plain teaching of the rest of scripture  now see how the catechism agrees with this  it takes for granted that god has showed the child what is good that gods spirit is sanctifying and making good not only all the elect people of god but him that one particular child and it makes the child say so  therefore when it asks him what is thy duty to god and to thy neighbour it asks him my child thou sayest that gods spirit is with thee sanctifying thee and showing thee what is good tell me therefore what good the holy spirit has showed theetell me what he has showed thee to be good and therefore thy duty  but some may answer how can you say that the holy spirit teaches the children their duty when it is their schoolmaster or their father who teaches them the ten commandments and the catechism  my friends we may teach our children the ten commandments or anything else we like but we cannot teach them that that is their duty  they must first know what duty means at all before they can learn that any particular things are parts of their duty  and believe me neither you nor i nor all the men in the world put together no nor angel nor archangel nor any created being nor the whole universe can teach one child no nor our own selves the meaning of that plain word duty nor the meaning of those two plain words i ought  no that simple thought that thought which every one of us even the most stupid even the most sinful has more or less comes straight to him from god the father of lights by the inspiration of the holy spirit of god the spirit of duty faith and obedience  for mindwhen you teach a child if you do this wrong thing stealing for instancegod will punish you  but if you are honest god will reward you you are not teaching the child that it is his duty to be honest and his duty not to steal  you are teaching him what is quite right and true namely that it is profitable for him to be honest and hurtful to him to steal  but you are not teaching him as high a spiritual lesson as any soldier knows when he rushes upon certain death knowing that he shall gain nothing and may lose everything thereby but simply because it is his duty  you are only enticing your child to do right and frightening him from doing wrong quite necessary and good to be done  but if he is to be spiritually honest honest at heart honest from a sense of honour and not of fear in one word if he is to be really honest at all or even to try to be really honest something must be done to that childs heart which nothing but the spirit of god can do he must be taught that it is his duty to be honest that honesty is right the perfectly right and proper and beautiful thing for him and for all beings yea for god himself he must be taught to love honesty and whatsoever else is right for its own sake and therefore to feel it his duty  and i say that god does that by your children  i say that we cannot watch our children without seeing that though there is in them as in us a corrupt and wilful flesh which tempts them downward to selfish and selfwilled pleasures  yet there is in them generally more than in us their parents a spirit which makes them love and admire what is right and take pleasure in it and feel that it is good to be good and right to do right which makes them delight in reading and hearing of loving and right and noble actions which makes them shocked they hardly know why at bad words and bad conduct and bad people  and woe to those who deaden that tenderness of conscience in their own children by their bad examples or by false doctrines which tell the children that they are still unregenerate children of the devil not yet christians and who so put a stumblingblock in the way of christs little ones and do despite to the spirit of grace by which they are sealed to the day of redemption  i see parents thinking that their children are to learn the deceitfulness of the human heart from themselves and the working of gods spirit from their parents but i often think that the teachers ought to be converted indeed that is turned right round and become the learners instead of the teachers and learn the workings of gods spirit from their children and the deceitfulness of the human heart from themselves if at least the lord jesuss words have any real force or meaning at all when he said not except the little children be converted and become as you but except ye be converted and become as one of these little children ye and not they shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven  believe me my friends that your childrens angels do indeed behold the face of their father which is in heaven that there is a direct communication between him and them and that the sign and proof of it is the way in which they understand at once what you tell them of their duty and take to it as it were only too readily and hopefully and confidently as if it were a thing natural and easy to them  alas it is neither natural nor easy and they will find out that too soon by sad experience  but still the divine light is there the sense of duty is in their minds and the law of god is written in their hearts by the holy spirit of god who is sanctifying them not merely by teaching them to hope for heaven or to dread hell but by showing them what is good  and herein i say the simple and noble old church catechism by faith in gods spirit does indeed perfect praise out of the mouths of babes  without one word about rewards or punishments heaven or hell it begins to talk to the child like a true english catechism as it is about that glorious old english key word duty  it calls on the child to confess its own duty and teaches it that its duty is something most human simple everyday commonplace if you will call it so  i rejoice that it is commonplace i rejoice that in what it says about our duty to god and to our neighbour it says not one word about those counsels of perfection or those frames and feelings which depend believe me principally on the state of peoples bodily health on the constitution of their nerves and the temper of their brain  but that it requires nothing except what a little child can do as well as a grown person a labouring man as well as a divine a plain farmer as well as the most refined devout imaginative lady  may god bless them all may god help them all to do their duty in that station of life to which it has pleased god to call them but may god grant to them never to forget that there is but one duty for all and that all of them can do that duty equally well whatever their constitution or scholarship or station of life may be provided they will but remember that god has called them to that station and not try to invent some new and finer one for themselves provided they remember that they are to do in that station neither more nor less than every one else is to do in theirs namely to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with their god  in a word to be perfect even as their father in heaven is perfect to do justly because god is just faithful and true rewarding every man according to his works and no partial accepter of persons so that in every nation he that feareth god and worketh righteousness is accepted by him  to love mercy because god loves mercy to be merciful because our father in heaven is merciful because he willeth not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live because god came to seek and to save that which is lost and is good to the unthankful and the evil and because god so loved sinful man that when man hated god gods answer to mans hate gods vengeance upon mans rebellion was to send his onlybegotten son that whosoever believed in him should not perish but have everlasting life  and to walk humbly with your god becauseand what shall i say now does god walk humbly  can there be humility in god  can god obey and yet it must be so  if as is most certain from holy scripture man as far as he is what man ought to be is the image and glory of god if mans justice ought to be a copy of gods justice and mans mercy a copy of gods mercy and all which is good in man a copy of something good in god  if as is most certain all good on earth is gods likeness and only good because it is gods likeness and is given by gods spiritthen our walking humbly with god if it be good must be a copy of something in god  but of what  that my friends is a question which can never be answered but by those who believe in the mystery of the everblessed trinity the father the son and the holy ghost  it is too solemn and great a matter to be spoken of hastily at the end of a sermon  i will tell you what little i seem to see of it next sunday with awe and trembling as one who enters upon holy ground  but this i will tell you to bear in mind meanwhile that if you wish to know or to do what is right you must firmly believe and bear in mind thisthat gods justice is exactly like what would be just in you and me without any difference whatsoever  that gods mercy is exactly like what would be merciful in you and me and that as i hope to show you next sunday gods humility wonderful as it may seem is exactly like what would be humble in you and me  for i warn you that if you do not believe this you will be tempted to forget gods righteousness and to invent a righteousness of your own which is no righteousness at all but unrighteousness  for there can be but one righteousnessmind what i sayonly one righteousness as there can be only one truth and only one reason  forget that and you will be tempted to invent for yourselves a false justice which is dishonest and partial a false mercy which is cruel a false humility which is vain and selfconceited and you will be tempted also as men of all religions and denominations have been to impute to god actions and thoughts and tempers which are as your own consciences if you would listen to gods word in them would tell you unjust cruel and proud and then you will be tempted to say that things are justifiable in god which you would not excuse in any other being by saying  of course it must be right in him because he is god and can do what he will  as if the judge of all the earth would not do right as if he could be anything or could do anything but the eternal good which is his very being and essence and which he has shown forth in his son jesus christ our lord who went about doing good because god was with him  we all know what the good which he did was like  let us believe that god the fathers goodness is the same as jesus christs goodness  let us believe really what we say when we confess that jesus was the brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his person    sermon viii  sonship    john v 19 20 30  then answered jesus verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do  for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise  for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth  i can of mine own self do nothing  as i hear i judge  and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of my father which is in heaven  this my friends is why man should walk humbly and obediently with his god because humility and obedience are the likeness of the son of god who though he is equal to his father yet to do his fathers will humbled himself and took on him the form of a slave and though he is a son yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered sacrificing himself utterly and perfectly to do the commands of his father and our father of his god and our god and sacrificing himself to his father not as a man merely but as a son not because he was in the likeness of sinful flesh but because he was the everlasting son of his father not once only on the cross but from all eternity to all eternity the lamb slain before the foundation of the world  this is a great mystery we may understand somewhat more of it by thinking over the meaning of those great words father and son  now first a son must be of the same nature as his fatherthat is certain  each kind of animal brings forth after its kind  the lion begets lions the sheep sheep the son of a man must be a man of one substance with his earthly father and by the same law the son of god must be god  take away that notion  say that the only begotten son of god is not very god of very god of one substance with his father and the word son means nothing  if a son be not of the same substance as his father he is not a son at all  and more a perfect son must be as great and as good as his father exactly like his father in everything  that is the very meaning of father and son that like should beget like  among fallen and imperfect men some sons are worse and weaker than their fathers  but we all feel that that is an evil a thing to be sorry for a sad consequence of our fallen state  our reasons and hearts tell us that a son ought to be equal to his father and that it is in some way an affliction almost a shame to a father if his children are weaker or worse than he is  but we cannot fancy such a thing in god the onlybegotten perfect son of the almighty and perfect father must be at least equal to his father as great as his father as good as his father the brightness of his fathers glory and the express image of his fathers person  but there is another thing about father and son which we must look at and that is this  a good son loves and obeys his father and the better son he is the more he loves and obeys his father and therefore a perfect son will perfectly love and perfectly obey his father  now here is the great difference between animals and men  among the higher animals the mothers always and the fathers sometimes feed and help and protect their young  but we seldom or never find that young animals help and protect their parents certainly they never obey their fathers when they are full grown but are as ready to tear their fathers in pieces as their fathers are to tear them  so that the love and obedience of fullgrown sons to their fathers is so utterly human a thing so utterly different from anything we find in the brutes that we must believe it to be part of mans immortal soul part of gods likeness in man  and in the text our lord declares that it is so he declares that his obedience to his father and his fathers love to him is the perfect likeness of what goes on between a good son and a good father among men only that it is perfect because it is between a perfect father and a perfect son  father and son  let philosophers and divines discover what they may about god they will never discover anything so deep as the wonder which lies in those two words father and son  so deep and yet so simple  so simple that the wayfaring man though poor shall not err therein  who is god  what is god like  where shall we find him or his likenessso has mankind been crying in all ages and getting no answer or making answers for themselves in all sorts of superstitions idolatries false philosophies  and then the gospel comes and answers to every man to every poor and unlearned labourer  will you know the name of god  it is a father a son and a holy spirit of love joy peace a spirit of perfect satisfaction of the father in the son and perfect satisfaction of the son with the father which proceeds from both the father and the son  it needs no scholarship to understand that name every one may understand it who is a good father every one may understand it who is a good son who looks up to and obeys his father with that filial spirit of love and obedience and satisfaction with his fathers will which is the likeness of the holy spirit of god and can only flourish in any man by the help of the holy spirit which proceeds from the father and the son  father and son what more beautiful words are there in the world what more beautiful sight is there in the world than a son who really loves his father really trusts his father really does his duty to his father really looks up to and obeys his fathers will in all things who is ready to sacrifice his own credit his own pleasure his own success in life for the sake of his fathers comfort and honour  how much more fair and noble must be the love and trust which is between god the father and god the son  i wish that some of those who now write so many excellent books for young people would write one made up entirely of stories of good sons who have obeyed and worked for and suffered for their parents  sure i am that such a book wisely and well written would teach young people much of the meaning of the blessed name of god much of their duty to god  and yet after all my friends is not such a book written already  have we not the four gospels which tell us of jesus christ the perfect son who came to do the will of a perfect father  read that read your bibles  read the history of the lord jesus christ keeping in mind always that it is the history of the son of god and of his obedience to his father  and when in st johns most wonderful gospel you meet with deep texts like the one which i have chosen read them too as carefully if possible more carefully than the rest for they are meant for all parents and for all children upon earth  read how the father loves the son and gives all things into his hand and commits all judgment to the son and gives him power to have life in himself even as the father has life in himself and shows him all things that himself doeth that all men may honour the son even as they honour the father read how the son came only to show forth his fathers glory to be the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person  to establish his fathers kingdom to declare the goodness of his fathers name which is the father  how he does nothing of himself but only what he sees his father do how he seeks not his own will but the will of the father who sent him how he sacrificed all yea even his most precious body and soul upon the cross to finish the work which his father gave him to do  how being in the form of god and thinking it no robbery to be equal with god he could boldly say as the father knoweth me even so know i the father  i and my father are one and still in the fulness of his filial love and obedience declared that he had no will no wish no work no glory but his fathers and in the hour of his agony cried out father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done  my friends you will be able to understand more and more of the meaning of these words just in proportion as you are good sons and good fathers and therefore just in proportion as you are led and taught by the holy spirit of god without whose help no man can be either a good father or a good son  a bad son a disobedient self willed selfconceited son who is seeking his own credit and not his fathers his own pleasure and not his parents comfort a son who is impatient of being kept in order and advised who despises his parents counsel and will have none of his reproofto him these words of our lord the deepest noblest words which were ever spoken on earth will have no more meaning than if they were written in a foreign language he will not know what our lord means he will not be able to see why our lord came and suffered he will not see any beauty in our lords character any righteousness in his sacrificing himself for his father and because he has forgotten his duty to his earthly father he will never learn his duty to god  for what is the duty of the lord jesus christ is our duty if we are the sons of god in him  he is the son of god by an eternal never ceasing generation we are the sons of god by adoption  the way in which we are to look up to god the holy spirit must teach us what is our duty to god the holy spirit must teach us  and who is the holy spirit  he is the spirit who proceeds from the son as well as from the father  he is the spirit of jesus christ the spirit of the son of god the spirit who descended on the lord jesus when he was baptized the spirit which god gave to him without measure  he is the spirit of the son of god and we are sons of god by adoption says saint paul and because we are sons he says god has sent forth into our hearts the spirit of his son by whom we look up to god as our father and this spirit of gods son by whom we cry to god abba father st paul calls in another place the spirit of adoption and declares openly that he is the very spirit of god  therefore in whatsoever way the spirit of god is to teach you to look up to god he will teach you to look up to him as a father the father of spirits and therefore your father for you are a spirit whatsoever duty to god the holy spirit teaches you he teaches you first and before all things that it is filial duty the duty of a son to a father because you are the son of god and god is your father  therefore whatsoever man or book tells you that your duty to god is anything but the duty of a son to his father does not speak by the spirit of god  whatsoever thoughts or feelings in your own hearts tell you that your duty to god is anything but the duty of a son to his father and tempt you to distrust gods forgiveness and shrink from him and look up to him as a taskmaster and an austere and revengeful lord are not the spirit of god no nor your own spirit the spirit of a man which is in you for that was originally made in the likeness of gods spirit and by it rebellious sons arise and go back to their earthly fathers and trust in them when they have nothing else left to trust and say to themselves though all the world has cast me off my parents will not  though all the world despise and hate me my parents love me still though i have rebelled against them deserted them insulted them i am still my fathers child  i will go home to my own people to the house where i was born to the parents who nursed me on their knee i will go to my father  fathers and mothers if your son or daughter came home to you thus though they had insulted you disgraced you and spent their substance in riotous living would you shut your doors upon them would not all be forgiven and forgotten at once  would not you call your neighbours to rejoice with you and say it is good to be merry and glad for this our son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found  and would not that penitent child be more precious to you though you cannot tell why than any other of your children  would you not feel a peculiar interest in him henceforth and do you not know that so to forgive would be no weak indulgence but the part of a good father a good and noble and human thing to do  ay a human thing and therefore a divine thing part of gods likeness in man  for is it not the likeness of god himself  has not god himself in the parable of the prodigal son declared that he does so forgive his penitent children at once and utterly and that there is more joy among the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance  so says the lord jesus christ the only begotten son of god  let who dare dispute his words or try to water them down and explain them away  and why should it not be so  do you fancy god less of a father than you are  is he not the father the perfect father from whom every fatherhood in heaven and earth is named  oh believe that he is indeed a father believe that all the love and care which you can show to your children is as much poorer than the love and care god shows to you as your obedience to your earthly parents is poorer and weaker than the love and obedience of jesus christ to his father  god is as much better a father than you are as jesus christ is a better son than you are  there is a sum of proportions a ruleofthree sum work it out for yourselves and then distrust gods love if you dare  and believe that whatsoever makes you distrust gods love is neither the spirit of god who is the spirit of sonship nor the spirit of man  but the spirit of the devil who loves to slander god to men that they may shrink from him and be afraid to arise and go to their father to be received again as sons of god that so being kept from true penitence they may be kept from true holiness and from their duty to god which is the duty of sons of god to their father in heaven  believe no such notions my friends howsoever humble and reverent they may seem they are but insults to god for under pretence of honouring him they dishonour him for he is love and he who feareth that is who looks up to god with terror and distrust is not made perfect in love  so says st john in the very chapter wherein he tells us that god is love and has manifested his love to us by sending his son to be the saviour of the world and that the very reason for our loving god is that he loves us already and that therefore he who loveth not knoweth not god for god is love  yes my friends god is your father and god is love and your duty to god is a duty of love and obedience to a father who so loved you and all mankind that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for you  our father which art in heaven is to be the keynote of all your duty as it is to be the keynote of all your prayers  and therefore the catechism is right in teaching the child that god is his father and jesus christ the perfect son of god his pattern and the holy spirit of the father and of the son his teacher and inspirer before it says one word to the child about duty to god or sin against god  how indeed can it tell him what sin is until it has told him against whom sin is committed and that if he sins against god he sins against a father and breaks his duty to his father  and how can it tell him that till it has told him that god is his father  how can it tell him what sin is till it has told him what righteousness is  how can it tell him what breaking his duty is till it has told him what the duty itself is but the child knows already that god is his father and therefore when the catechism asks him what is his duty to god it is as much as to say my child thou hast confessed already that thou hast a good father in heaven and thou knowest as well as i perhaps better what a father means  tell me then how dost thou think thou oughtest to behave to such a father  and the whole answer which is put into the childs mouth is the description of duty to a father of things which there would be no reason for his doing to anyone who was not his father nay which he could not do honestly to anyone else but only hypocritically for the sake of flattering and which differs utterly from any notion of duty to god which the heathen have ever had just in this that it is a description of how a son should behave to a father  read it for yourselves my friends and judge for yourselves and may god give you all grace to act up to itnot in order that you by acts of faith or acts of love or acts of devotion may persuade god to love you but because he loves you already with a love boundless as himself because in him you live and move and have your being and are the offspring of god because his mercy is over all his works and because he loved the world and sent his son not to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved because he is the giver the father of lights from whom comes every good and perfect gift because all which makes this earth habitableall justice order wisdom goodness mercy humbleness selfsacrifice all which is fair or honourable or useful in men or angels in kings on their thrones or in labourers at the plough in divines in their studies or soldiers in the field of battleall in the whole universe which is not useless and hurtful and base and damnable and doomed blessed thought that it is so to be burned up in unquenchable fireall i say comes forth from the father of the spirits of all flesh the lord of hosts who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working who spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for us and will with him freely give us all things    sermon ix  the lords prayer    matt vi 9 10  after this manner pray ye  our father which art in heaven  i have shown you what a simple account of our duty to god and to our neighbour the catechism gives us  i now beg you to remark that simple and everyday as this same duty is the catechism warns us that we cannot do it without gods special grace and i beg you to remark further that the catechism does not say that we cannot do these things well without gods special grace but that we cannot do them at all  it does not say that we cannot do all these things of ourselves but that we can do none of them  but i want you to remark one thing more which is very noteworthy  that in this case for the first time throughout the catechism the teacher tells the child something  all along the teacher has as i have often shown you been making the child tell him what is right calling out in the childs heart thoughts and knowledge which were there already now he in his turn tells the child something which he takes for granted is not in the childs heart of which if it is has been put into it by his teachers and of which he must be continually reminded lest he should forget it namely that he cannot do these of himself that as st paul says in him that is in his flesh dwells no good thing that he is not able to think or to do anything as of himself but his sufficiency is of god who works in him to will and to do of his good pleasure who has also given him his holy spirit  the catechism in short takes for granted that the child knows his duty but it takes for granted also that he does not know how to do that duty  it takes for granted that in every child there is as st paul says a law in his members warring against the law of his mind and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin literally of short coming or missing the mark which is in his members now mans natural inclination is to suppose that good thoughts are part of himself and therefore that a good will to put them in practice is in his own power  i blame no one for making that mistake  but i warn them in the name of the bible and of the catechism that it is a mistake and one which every man woman and child will surely discover to be a mistake if they try to act on it  good thoughts are not our own they are jesus christs they come from him the life and the light of men they are his voice speaking to our hearts informing us of his laws showing us what is good  and good desires are not our own  they come from the holy spirit of god who strives with men and labours to lift their hearts up from selfishness to love from what is low and foul to what is noble and pure from what is sinful and contrary to gods will to what is right and according to gods will  this is the lesson which you and i and every man have to learn that in ourselves dwells no good thing but that there is one near us mightier than we from whom all good things do come and that he loves us and will not only teach us what is good but give us the power to do the good we know  but if we forget that if we take any credit whatsoever to ourselves for the good which comes into our minds then we shall be surely taught our mistake by sore afflictions and by shameful falls by gods leaving us to ourselves to try our own strength and to find it weakness to try our own wisdom and find it folly to try our own fancied love of god and find that after all our conceit of ourselves we love ourselves better when it comes to a trial than we love what is right until in short we are driven with st paul to feel that howsoever much our hearts may delight in the law of god there is a corrupt nature in us which fights against our delight in gods law and will surely conquer it and make us slaves to our own fancies slaves to our passions slaves to ourselves ay slaves to the very lowest and meanest part of ourselves  unless we can find a deliverer unless we can find some one stronger than us who can put an end to this hateful shameful war within us between good wishes and bad deeds  and then if we will but cry with st paul oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death we shall surely sooner or later hear a voice within our hearts a voice full of love of comfort of fellowfeeling for usi will deliver thee my child i even i thy father in heaven i will teach thee and inform thee in the way wherein thou shouldest go and i will guide thee with mine eye  and then with st paul we shall be able to answer our own question and say who will deliver me  i thank god that god himself will deliver me through jesus christ our lord  this then is the reason why we need to pray  because we need to be delivered from ourselves  this is the reason why we may pray because god is willing to deliver us from ourselves if we be willing  but every human being round us needs to be delivered from themselves just as much as we do  without that deliverance we cannot do our duty neither can they  and just in proportion as men are delivered from themselves will mankind do its duty and the world go right  now their duty is the same as ours and therefore the prayer which is right and good for us is equally right and good for them  and what is more we cannot pray rightly for ourselves unless we pray for them in the very same breath for the catechism tells us that there is one duty for all of us to love and obey and serve our heavenly father and to love our neighbour as ourselves because they are our brothers children of one common father members of the same gods family as we are and their interest and ours are bound up together  yes to love all mankind as ourselves for though too many of them alas are not yet in gods family and strangers to his covenant yet gods will is that they too should come to the knowledge of the truth and therefore for them we can pray hopefully and trustfully lord have mercy on all men on jews turks infidels and heretics and bring them home blessed lord to thy flock that they may be saved and made one fold under one shepherd through jesus christ our lord in whom thou hast declared thy good will to all the children of men  this is the right prayer  that all men may do their duty where god has put them  that those who like the heathen do not know their duty may be taught it that we who do know it may have strength to do it  and therefore it is that the catechism teaches us the need of prayer immediately after making us confess our duty and therefore it is that it begins by teaching the lords prayer because that prayer is the one of all prayers which ever have been offered upon earth which perfectly expresses the duty of man and mans relation to almighty god  it is throughout a prayer for strength  it confesses throughout what we want strength for to what use we are to put gods grace if he bestows it on us  our delight in the lords prayer will depend on what we consider our duty here on earth to be  if we look upon this earth principally as a place where we are to pray for all the good things which we can get our first prayer will be of course give us this day our daily bread  if we look at this earth principally as a place where we have a chance of being saved from punishment and torment after we die then our first prayer will be forgive us our sins  and in fact that is all that too many of our prayers nowadays seem to consist of oh my maker give me my daily bread  oh my judge forgive me my sins  right prayers enough but spoilt by being taken out of their place spoilt by being prayed before all other prayers spoilt too by being prayed for ourselves alone and not for other people also  but if we believe as the bible and the catechism tell us that we and all christian people are gods children members of gods family set on earth in gods kingdom to do his work by doing our duty each in that station of life to which god has called us in the hope of a just reward hereafter according to our works then our great desire will be for strength to do our duty and the lords prayer will seem to us the most perfect way of asking for that strength and if we believe that we are gods children and he our father we shall feel sure that we must get strength from him and sure that we must ask for that strength and sure that he will give it us if we do ask  but if his will is to give it us why ask him at all  why pray at all if god already knows our necessities and is able and willing to supply them  my friends the longer i live the more certain i am that the only reason for praying at all is because god is our father the more certain i am that we shall never have any heart to pray unless we believe that god is our father  if we forget that we may utter to him selfish cries for bread or when we look at his great power we may become terrified and utter selfish cries to him not to harm us without any real shame or sorrow for sin  but few of us will have any heart to persevere in those cries  people will say to themselves if god is evil he will not care to have mercy on me and if he is good there is no use wearying him by asking him what he has already intended to give me  why should i pray at all  the only answer is pray because god is your father and you his child  the only answer but the most complete answer  i will engage to say that if anyone here is ever troubled with doubts about prayer those two simple words our father if he can once really believe them in their full richness and depth will make the doubts vanish in a moment and prayer seem the most natural and reasonable of all acts  it is because we are gods children not merely his creatures that he will have us pray  because he is educating us to know him to know him not merely to be an almighty power but a living loving person not merely an irresistible fate but a father who delights in the love of his children who wishes to shape them into his own likeness and make them fellowworkers with him therefore it is that he will have us pray  doubtless he could have given us everything without our asking for he does already give us almost everything without our asking  but he wishes to educate us as his children to make us trust in him to make us love him to make us work for him of our own free wills in the great battle which he is carrying on against evil and that he can only do by teaching us to pray to him  i say it reverently but firmly  as far as we can see god cannot educate us to know him the living willing loving father unless he teaches us to open our hearts to him and to ask him freely for what we want just because he knows what we want already  if i have not made this plain enough to any of you my friends let me go back to the simple practical explanation of it which god himself has given us in those two wordsfather and child  should you like to have a child who never spoke to you never asked you for anything  of course not  and why  because you would say one might as well have a dumb animal in ones family instead of a child if it is never to talk and ask questions and advice most true and reasonable my friends  and as you would say concerning your children so says god of his  you feel that unless you teach your children to ask you for all they want even though you know their necessities before they ask and their ignorance in asking you will never call out their love and trust towards you you know that if you want really to have your child to please and obey you not as a mere tame animal but as a willing reasonable loving child you must make him know that you are training him and you must teach him to come to you of his own accord to be trained to be taught his duty and set right where he is wrong  and even so does god with you  if you will only consider the way in which any child must be educated by its human parents then you will at once see why prayer to our heavenly father is a necessary part of our education in the kingdom of heaven  now the lords prayer just this sort of prayer is mans cry to his heavenly father to train him to educate him to take charge of him daily and hourly body and soul and spirit  it is a prayer for grace for special grace that is for help daily and hourly in each particular duty and circumstance for help from god specially suited to enable us to do our duty  and the whole of the prayer is of this kind and not as some think the latter part only  it is too often said that the three first sentences are not prayers for man but rather praises to god  my friends they cannot be one without being the other  you cannot i believe praise god aright without praying for men you cannot pray for men aright without praising god at least you cannot use the lords prayer without doing both at once without at once declaring the glory of god and praying for the welfare of all mankind  hallowed be thy name  is not that a prayer for men as well as praise to god  yes my friends when you say our father hallowed be thy name you pray that all men may come at last to look up to god as their father to love serve and obey god as his children and for what higher blessing can you pray  ay and you pray too that men may learn at last the deep meaning of that wordfather that they may see how godlike and noble a trust god lays on them when he gives them children to educate and make christian men you pray that the hearts of all fathers may be turned to the children and the hearts of all children to the fathers you pray for the welfare and the holiness and the peace of every home on earth you pray for the welfare of generations yet unborn when you pray our father hallowed be thy name  thy kingdom come  is not that too if we will look at it steadfastly prayer for our neighbours prayer for all mankind and still prayer for ourselves prayer for grace prayer for the life and health of our own souls  thy kingdom comethat kingdom of the father which jesus christ proved by his works on earth to be a kingdom of justice and righteousness of love and fellowfeeling  when we pray thy kingdom come it is as if we said son of god root out of this sinful earth all selfwill and lawlessness all injustice and cruelty root out all carelessness ignorance and hardness of heart root out all hatred envy slander root them out of all mens hearts out of my heart for i have the seeds of them in me make me and all men round me day by day more sure that thou art indeed our king that thou hast indeed taught us the laws of thy fathers kingdom and that only in keeping them and loving them is there health and righteousness and safety for any soul of man for any nation under the sun  thy will be doneno not merely thy will be done but done on earth as it is in heaven done not merely as the trees and the animals the wind and clouds do thy will by blindly following their natures but done as angels and blessed spirits do it of their own will  they obey thee as living willing loving persons as thy sons  teach us to obey thee in like manner lovingly because we love thy will willingly because our wills are turned to thy will and therefore oh heavenly father take charge of these wayward wills and minds of ours of these selfish selfwilled ignorant hasty hearts of ours and cleanse them and renew them by thy spirit and change them into thy likeness day by day  make us all clean hearts oh god and renew within us a right spirit the copy of thine own holy spirit  cast us not away from thy presence for from thee alone comes our souls life take not from us thy holy spirit who is the lord and giver of life whose will is thy will who alone can strengthen and change us to do thy will on earth as saints and angels do in heaven and to be fellowworkers with each other fellowworkers with thee o god even as those blessed spirits are who minister day and night to all thy creatures  give us this day our daily bread  people sometimes divide the lords prayer into two partsthe ascriptions and the petitionsand consider that after we have sufficiently glorified and praised god in the first three sentences of the prayer then we are at liberty to begin asking something for ourselves and to say give us day by day our daily bread  i cannot think so my friends  i have been showing you that hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done if we do but recollect that they are spoken to our father are just as much prayers for all mankind as they are hymns of honour to god and so i say of these latter  give usforgive us lead us notdeliver usthat if we will but remember that they too are spoken to our father we shall find that they are just as much hymns of honour to god as prayers for mankind  yes my friends when we say give us this day our daily bread we do indeed honour god and the name of god  we declare that he is love that he is the giver the absolutely and boundlessly generous and magnanimous being  and what higher glory and honour or praise can we ascribe even to god himself than to say that of him  next we pray not for ourselves only but for our neighbours for england for christendom for the heathen who know not god and for generations yet unborn  we pray that god would so guide and teach and preserve the children of men as to enable them to fulfil in every country and every age the work which he gave them to do when he said be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it  we know that our father has commanded us to labour  we know that our father has so well ordered this glorious earth that whosoever labours may reap the just fruit of his labour therefore we pray that god would prosper our righteous plans for earning our own living  we pray to him not only so to order the earth that it may bring forth its fruits in due season but that men may be in a fit state to enjoy those fruits that god may not be forced for their good to withhold from them blessings which they might abuse to their ruin  but we pray also give us not me only but us and therefore we pray that he would prosper our neighbours plans as well as ours  so we confess that we believe god to be no respecter of persons we confess that we believe he will not take bread out of others mouths to give it to us we declare that gods curse is on all selfishness and oppression of man by man we renounce our own selfishness the lust which our fallen nature has to rise upon others fall and say father we are all children at thy common table  thou alone canst prosper the richest and the wisest thou alone canst prosper the poorest and the weakest thou wilt do equal justice to all some day and we confess that thou art just in so doing we only ask thee to do it now and to give us and all mankind that which is good for them  thus we pray not for this generation only but for generations yet unborn not for this nation of england only but for heathens and savages beyond the seas  when we say give us our daily bread we pray for every child here and on earth that he may receive such an education as may enable him to get his daily bread  we pray for learned men in their studies that they may discover arts and sciences which shall enrich and comfort nations yet unborn  we pray for merchants on the seas that they may discover new markets for trade new lands to colonize and fill with christian men and extend the blessings of industry and civilization to the savage who lives as the beasts which perish and dwindles down off the face of the earth by famine disease and war the victim of his own idleness ignorance and improvidence  and all the while we are praying for the widow and the orphan that god would send them friends in time of need for the houseless wanderer for the shipwrecked sailor for sick persons for feeble infants that god would send help to them who cannot help themselves and soften our hearts and the hearts of all around us that we may never turn our faces away from any poor man lest the face of the lord be turned away from us  so far we have been praying to our heavenly father first as a father then as a king then as an inspirer then as a giver and next we pray to him as a forgiverforgive us our trespasses we have been confessing in these four petitions what gods goodwill to man is what god wishes man to be how man ought to live and believe  and then comes the recollection of sin  we must confess what gods law is before we can confess that we have broken it and now we do confess that we have broken it  we know that god is our father  how often have we forgotten that he is a father how often have we forgotten to be good fathers ourselves  we are in gods kingdom  how often have we behaved as if we were our own kings and had no masters over us but our own fancies tempers appetites  we are to do his will on earth as it is done in heaven  how have we been doing our own willpleasing ourselves breaking loose from his laws trying to do right of our own wills and in our own strength instead of asking his spirit to strengthen and cleanse and renew our wills and so have ended by doing not the right which we knew to be right but the wrong which we knew to be wrong  god is a giver  how often have we looked on ourselves as takers and fancied that we must as it were steal the good things of this world from god lest he should forget to give us what was fitting  how often have we forgotten that god gives to all men as well as to us and while we were praying give me my daily bread kept others out of their daily bread  oh my friends we cannot blame ourselves too much for all these sins we cannot think them too heinous  we cannot confess them too openly we cannot cry too humbly and earnestly for forgiveness  but we never shall feel the full sinfulness of sin we never shall thoroughly humble ourselves in confession and repentance unless we remember that all our sins have been sins against a father and a forgiving father and that it is his especial glory the very beauty and excellence in him which ought to have kept us from disobeying him that he does forgive those who disobey him  and lastly in like manner when you say lead us not into temptation but deliver c you are not only entreating god to lead you but you are honouring and praising him you are setting forth his glory and declaring that he is a god who does lead and a god who does not leave his poor creatures to wander their own foolish way but guides men in spite of all their sins full of condescension and pity care and tender love  you do not only ask god to deliver you from evil but you declare that he is righteous and hates evil that he is love and desires to deliver you from evil one who spared not his onlybegotten son but gave him freely for us to deliver us from evil and raised him up and delivered all power into his hand that he might fight his fathers battle against all which is hurtful to man and hateful to god till death itself shall be destroyed and all enemies put under the feet of the saviour god    sermon x  the doxology    psalm viii 1 and sqq  o lord our governor how excellent is thy name in all the earth thou that hast set thy glory above the heavens  out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger  this is the text which i have chosen today because i think it will help us to understand the end of the lords prayer which tells us to say to our father in heaven father thine is the kingdom father thine is the power father thine is the glory  the man who wrote this psalm had been looking up at the sky spangled with countless stars with the moon as if she were the queen of them all walking in her brightness  he had been looking round too on this wonderful earth with its countless beasts and birds and insects trees herbs and flowers each growing and thriving and breeding after their kind according to the law which god had given to each of them without any help of man  and then he had thought of men how small weak ignorant foolish sinful they were and said to himself why should god care for men more than for these beasts and birds and insects round  not because he is the largest and strongest thing in the world for i will consider thy heavens even the work of thy hands the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained how much greater more beautiful they are than poor human beings  may not glorious beings angels be dwelling in them compared to whom man is no better than a beast  and yet he says to himself i know that god though he has put man lower than the angels has crowned him with glory and honour  i know that whatever glorious creatures may live in the sun and moon and stars god has given man the dominion and power here on this world  i know that even to babes and sucklings god has given a strength because of his enemiesthat he may silence the enemy and the avenger and i know that by so doing god has set his glory above the heavens and has shown forth his glory more in these little children to whom he gives strength and wisdom than he has in sun and moon and stars  now how is that  the catechism i think will tell us  the doxology at the end of the lords prayer will tell us if we consider it  if you will listen to me i will try and show you what i mean  suppose i took one of your children and showed him that large bright star which you may see now every evening shining in the southwest and said to him my child that star which looks to you only a bright speck is in reality a worlda world fourteen hundred times as big as our world  we have but one moon to light our earth that little speck has four moons each of them larger than ours which light it by night  that little speck of a star seems to you to be standing still in reality it is travelling through the sky at the rate of 25000 miles an hour  what do you think the childs feeling would be  if he were a dull child he might only be astonished but if he were a sensible and thoughtful child do you not think that a feeling of awe almost of fear would come over him when he thought how small and weak and helpless he was in comparison of those mighty and glorious stars above his head  and next if i turned the child round and bade him look at that comet or fiery star which has appeared lately low down in the northwest and said my child that comet which seems to you to hang just above the next parish is really eighty millions of miles off from us  that bright spot at the lower part of it is a fiery world as large as the moonthat tail of fiery light which you see streaming up from it and which looks a few feet long is a stream of fiery vapour stretching most likely hundreds of thousands of miles through the boundless space  it seems to you to be sinking behind the trees so slowly that you cannot see it move  it is really rushing towards us now with its vast train of light at the rate of some eighty thousand miles an hour  and suppose then if to make the child more astonished than ever i went onyes my child every single tiny star which is twinkling over your head is a sun a sun as large or larger than our own sun perhaps with worlds moving round it as our world moves round our sun but so many millions of miles far off that the strongest spyglass cannot make these stars look any larger or show us the worlds which we believe are moving round them  do you not think that just in proportion to the childs quickness and understanding he would be awed almost terrified  and lastly suppose that to puzzle and astonish him still more i took a chance drop of water out of any standing pool and showed him through a magnifyingglass in that single drop of water dozens perhaps hundreds of living creatures so small that it is impossible to see them with the naked eye each of them of some beautiful and wonderful shape unlike anything which you ever saw or dreamed of but each of them alive each of them moving feeding breeding after its kind each fulfilling the nature which god has given to them and told him all the whole world the air which you breathe the leaves on the trees the soil under your feet ay even often the food which you eat and your own flesh and blood are as full of wonderful things as that drop of water is  you fancy that all the life in the world is made up of the men and women in it and the few beasts and birds and insects which you see about you in the fields  but these living things which you do see are not a millionth part of the whole number of gods creatures and not one smallest plant or tiniest insect dies but what it passes into a new life and becomes food for other creatures even smaller than though just as wonderful as itself  every day fresh living creatures are being discovered filling earth and sea and air till mens brains are weary with counting them and dizzy with watching their unspeakable beauty and strangeness and fitness for the work which god has given each of them to do  and then suppose i said to the child god cares for each of these tiny living creatures  how do you know that he does not care for them as much as he does for you  god made them for his own pleasure that he might rejoice in the work of his own hands  how do you know that he does not rejoice in them as much as in you those mighty worlds and suns above your head which you call stars how do you know that they are not as much more glorious and precious in gods sight than you are as they are larger and more beautiful than you are  and mind all these things from the tiniest insects in the waterdrop to the most vast star or comet in the sky all obey god  they have not fallen as you have they have not sinned as you have they have not broken the law by which god intended them to live as you have  the bible tells you so and the discoveries of learned men prove that the bible is right when it declares that they all continue to this day according to his ordinance for all things serve him that sun and moon and stars and light are praising him that fire and hail snow and vapour wind and storm mountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedars beasts and all cattle worms and feathered fowl are showing forth his glory day and night because he has made them sure for ever and ever each according to its kind and given them a law which shall not be broken for all his works praise him and show the glory of his kingdom and the mightiness of his power that his power his glory and the mightiness of his kingdom might be known unto the children of men  and youthey keep gods ordinance and you have broken it they fulfil gods word you fulfil your own fancies  they have a law which shall not be broken you break gods law daily  are not they better than you  is not not merely sun and stars but even the meanest gnat which hums in the air better than man more worthy of gods love than man  for man has sinned and they have not  do you not think that i should sadden and terrify the child and make him ready to cry out whither shall i flee from the wrath of this great almighty god who has made this wondrous heaven and earth and all of it obeys him except mei a rebel against him who made and rules all this  my friends i only say suppose that i spoke thus to your children for god forbid that i should speak thus to any human being without having first taught him the lords prayer without first having taught him to say i believe in jesus christ very god of very god who was born of the virgin mary and took mans nature on him without having taught him to say our father which art in heaven thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever and ever amen  so it is and so let it be  for so it is well and so i am safe sinner and rebel though i be  i would not say it unless i had taught him this for then i should be speaking the devils words and doing the devils work  for these are the thoughts of which he always takes advantage whenever he finds them in mens hearts because he is the enemy who hates men and the avenger who punishes them for their bad thoughts by leading them on into dark and fearful deeds because he is the devil the slanderer as his name means and slanders god to men and tries always to make them believe that god does not care for men and grudges them blessings in order that he may make men dread god and shrink from him into their own pride or their own carnal lusts and fancies  these are the thoughts of which the devil took advantage in the heathen in old times and tempted them to forget godgod who had not left himself without a witness in that he gave them rain and fruitful seasons filling their hearts with food and gladnessgod whose unseen glory even his eternal power and godhead may be clearly seen from the creation of the world being understood from the things which are madegod in whom as st paul told the heathen they lived and moved and had their being and were the offspring of god  thisthat man is the offspring of god and has a father in heavenis the great truth which the devil has been trying to hide from men in every age and by a hundred different devices by making them forget this he tempted them to worship the creature instead of the creator to pray to sun and moon and stars to send them fair weather good crops prosperous fortune  to look up to the heaven above them and down to the earth beneath their feet in slavish dread and anxiety  and pray to the sun not to blast them to the seas not to sweep them away to the rivers and springs not to let them perish from drought to earthquakes not to swallow them up ay even to try to appease those dark fierce powers with whom they thought the great awful world was filled by cruel sacrifices of human beings so that they offered their sons and their daughters to devils and burned their own children in the fire to moloch the cruel angry fire king whom they fancied was lord of the earthquakes and the burning mountains  so did the canaanites of old and so did the jews after them whensoever they had forgotten that god was their father who had bought them and that the kingdom and the power and the glory throughout heaven and earth were his then at once they began to be afraid of heaven and earth and worshipped baalim and astaroth and the host of heaven which were the sun and moon and stars and moloch the fire king and thammuz the lord of the springtime and with forms of worship which showed plainly enough either by their cruelty or their filthy profligacy who was the author of them and that man when he forgets that heaven and earth belong to his father is in danger of becoming a slave to his own lowest lusts and passions  and do not fancy my friends that because you and i are not likely to worship sun and moon and stars as the old heathen did that therefore we cannot commit the same sin as they did  my friends i believe that we are in more danger of committing it in england just now than ever we were that learned men especially are in danger of so doing because they know so far more of the wonders and the vastness of gods creation than the heathens of old knew  but you are not learned you will say  you are plain people who know nothing about these wonderful discoveries which men make by telescopes and magnifyingglasses but use your own eyes in a plain way to get your daily bread and you feel no such temptations  you believe of course that the kingdom and power and glory of all we see is gods  yes but do you believe too that he whom people are too apt to call god just because they have no other name to call him is your father  that it is your fathers will which governs the weather which makes the earth bear fruit and gladden the heart of man with good and fruitful seasons  alas my friends if we will open our eyes see things in their true light and call things by their true name we shall see many a man in england now honouring the creature more than the creator trusting in the seasons and the soil more than he does in god and so sinning in just the same way as the heathen of old  when people say to themselves i must get land i must get money by any means honestly if i can if not dishonestly for have it i must what are they doing then but denying that the kingdom the power and the glory of this earth belong to the righteous god and that he and not the lying devil gives them to whomsoever he will  when people say to themselves as who does not at moments to be rich is to be safe a mans life does consist in the abundance of what he possesses what are they doing but saying that man does not live by every word which proceeds out of the mouth of god but by what he can get for himself and keep for himself  when they are fretful and anxious about their crops when they even repine and complain of providence as i have known men do because they do not prosper as they wish what are they doing but saying in their hearts the weather and the seasons are the lords and masters of my good fortune or bad fortune  i depend on them and not on god for comfort and for wealth and my heavenly father does not know what i have need of  when parents send their girls out to fieldwork without any care about whom they talk with to have their minds corrupted by hearing filthiness and seeing immodest behaviour what are they doing but offering their daughters in sacrifice not even to moloch but to mammon saying to themselves my daughters modesty my daughters virtue is not of as much value as the paltry money which i can earn by leaving her alone to learn wickedness instead of keeping watch over her if she does work that she may be none the worse for her days labour  i might go on and give you a thousand instances more but they all come alike to this that whensoever you fancy that you cannot earn your daily bread without doing wrong yourself or leaving your children to learn wrong then you do not believe that the kingdom the power and the glory of this earth on which you work is your heavenly fathers  for if you did you would be certain that gains large or small got by breaking the least of his commandments could never prosper you but must bring a curse and a punishment with them and you would be sure also that because god is your father and this earth and all herein is his that he would feed you with food sufficient for you if you do but seek first his kingdomthat is try to learn his laws and seek first his righteousnessthat is strive and pray day by day to become righteous even as he is righteous  yes my friends this is one meaning though only one of st johns words this is the victory which overcometh the world even our faith  we all see the world full of pleasant things for which we long of necessary things too without which we should starve and die  and then the temptation comes to us to snatch at these things for ourselves by any means in our power right or wrong like the dumb animals who break out of their owners field into the next if they do but see better pasturage there or fight and quarrel between themselves for food each trying to get the most for himself and rob his neighbour  so live the beasts and so you and i and every human being shall be tempted to live if we follow our natures if we forget that we are gods children in gods kingdom under the laws of a heavenly father who has shown forth his own love and justice his own kingdom and power and glory in the person of the lord jesus christ  but if we remember that if we remember daily that the kingdom and power and glory is our fathers then we shall neither fear storms and blights bad crops or anything else which is of the earth earthly  we shall fear nothing of that kind which can only kill the body but only fear the evil devil lest by making us distrust and disobey our heavenly father he should after he has killed destroy both body and soul in hell  and as long as we fear him as long as we renounce him as long as we trust utterly in our heavenly fathers love and justice and in the love and justice of his dear son the man christ jesus to whom all power is given in heaven and earththen out of the youngest child among us will gods praise be perfected for the youngest child among us by faith in god his father may look upon all heaven and earth and say great and wonderful and awful as this earth and skies may be i am more precious in the sight of god than sun and moon and stars for they are things  but i am a person a spirit an immortal soul made in the likeness of god redeemed into the likeness of god sanctified into the likeness of god  this great earth was here thousands and thousands of years before i was born and it will be here perhaps millions and millions of years after i am dead but it cannot harm me it cannot kill me  when earth and sun and stars are past away i shall live for ever for i am the immortal child of an immortal father the child of the everlasting god  these things he only made  but me he begot unto everlasting life in jesus christ my lord  i seem to depend on this earth for food for clothing for comfort for life itself  and yet i do not do so in reality for man doth not live by bread alone but by every word which proceeds out of the mouth of god my father in him i have eternal life  a life which this earth did not give and cannot take away a life which by the mercy of my father in heaven i trust and hope to be living when sun and earth stars and comets are returned again to their dust and blotted from the face of heaven  for the kingdom the glory and the power of this world and all other worlds past present and to come belong to him who spared not his onlybegotten son but freely gave him for us and will with him freely give us all things  and thus my friends may gods praise be perfected out of the mouth of any christian child when he declares that god put man a little lower than the angels only to crown him with the glory and worship of having the onlybegotten son of god take mans nature upon him and walk this earth as a man and live and die and rise again as a man that so he might raise fallen man again to the glory and honour which god appointed for men from the beginning when he said let us make man in our image after our likeness  and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air and the beast of the earth and be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it    sermon xi  ahab and naboth    1 kings xxi 2 3  and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house  and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money  and naboth said unto ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee  you heard today read for the first lesson the story of naboth and king ahab  most of you know it well  naboths vineyard has passed into a proverb for something which we covet  it is good that it should be so  we cannot know our bible too well we cannot have bible words and bible thoughts too much worked into our ways of talking and thinking about everyday matters  as far as i can see the best days of england the best days of every christian country of which i ever read have been days when men were not ashamed of their bibles when they were ready to live by their bibles to ask advice of their bibles about buying and selling about making war and peace about all the business of life and were not ashamed to quote texts of scripture in the parliament and in the market and in the battlefield as gods law gods rule gods word about the matter in hand which was therefore sure to be the right word and the right rule  people are grown ashamed of doing so nowadays but that does not alter the matter one jot  we may deny god but he cannot deny himself  his laws are everlasting and he is ruling and judging us by them now all day long just as much as he ruled and judged those jews by them of old  the god of abraham is our god the god of moses is our god the god of ahab and naboth is our god neither he nor his government are altered in the least since their time and they never will alter for ever and ever and ever and if we do not choose to believe that now in this life we shall be made to believe it by some very ugly and painful schooling in the life to come  what laws of god now can we learn from this story  first we may learn what a sacred thing property is  that a mans possessions if they be justly come by belong to him in the sight of god as well as in the sight of man and that god will uphold and avenge the mans right  naboth you see stands simply on his right to his own property the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee  i do not think that he meant that god had actually forbidden him  it seems to have been only some sort of oath which he used  he may certainly have had reasons for thinking it wrong to part with his lands hurtful perhaps to his family after him  yet as ahab had promised him a better vineyard for it or its worth in money i cannot help thinking that naboths reason was the one which shows on the face of his words  it was the inheritance of his fathers this vineyard  they had all worked in it generation after generation perhaps according to the jewish custom they were buried somewhere in it at least it had been theirs and now was his he had worked in it and played in it perhaps since he was a childand he loved it it was part and parcel of his fathers house to him a sacred spot  and so it should be  it is a holy feeling which makes a man cling to the bit of land which he has inherited from his parents even to the cottage though it be only a hired one where he has lived for many a year and where he has planted and tilled perhaps with some that he loved who are now dead and gone or grown up and gone out into the world till the little old cottagegarden is full of remembrances to him of past joys and past sorrows  the feeling which makes a man cling to his home and to his own land is a good feeling and breeds good in the man  it makes him respect himself it keeps him from being reckless and unsettled  it is a feeling which should not be broken through  it is seldom pleasant to see land change hands it is seldom pleasant to see people turned out of their cottages  it must often be so but let it be as seldom as possible  one likes to see a family take root in a place and grow and thrive there one generation after another and you will find my friends that families do take root and thrive in a place just in proportion as they fear god and do righteousness  the psalms tell you again and again that the way to abide in the land and prosper in it is to trust in the lord and be doing good and that the wicked are soon rooted out and their names perish out of the land one sees that come true daily  but to return to naboth  he loved his own land and therefore he had a right to keep it  we may say it was but a fancy of his if he could have a better vineyard or the worth of it in money remember at least that god respected that fancy of his and justified it and avenged it  when after naboths death elijah accused ahab in gods name he put two counts into the indictment for ahab had committed two sins  hast thou killed and also taken possession  killing was one sin taking possession was another  and so ahab learnt two weighty and bitter lessons  he learnt that gods law stands for ever though mans law be broken or be forgotten by disuse  for you must understand that these jews were a free people even as we are  they were not like the nations round about them or as the russians are nowslaves to their king and holding their property only at his will  the law of moses had made them a free people who held their property each man from god by gods law which had said thou shalt not steal  thou shalt not covet  cursed is he who removes his neighbours landmark  and their kings were bound to govern by moses law just as our kings and rulers are bound to govern by the old constitutions of england and to do equal justice by rich and poor  but the wicked kings of israel were trying to break through that law and make themselves tyrants and despots such as the czar of russia is now  first jeroboam began by trying to wean his people from moses law by preventing their going up to worship at jerusalem and making them worship instead the golden calves at dan and at bethel  for he knew that if he could make idolaters of them he should soon make slaves of them and he succeeded and the kingdom of israel grew more miserable year by year and now ahab his wicked successor was breaking down the laws of property and wrongfully taking away his subjects lands  perhaps he said in his heart i am king there is no law stronger than i  i have a right to do what i like  if he did so he found that he was mistaken  he found that though he forgot moses law god had not that the law stood there still because it was founded on eternal justice which proceeds for ever out of the mouth of god and by the law which he had chosen to forget he was judged by the law of god which deals equal justice to rich and poor which is like god himself no acceptor of persons but says thou shalt not covet to the king upon his throne as sternly as to the beggar on the dunghill  and that law stands still my friends doubt it not  thanks to the wisdom and justice of our forefathers who built the laws of england on those old ten commandments which hang for a sign thereof in every church to this day  thanks to them i say and to god the root of the law of england is equal justice between man and man be he high or low and it is a thing to bless god for every day of our lives that here the poor mans little is as safe as the rich mans wealth  but there is many a sin of oppression many a sin of covetousness my friends which no law of man can touch  make laws as artfully as you will bad men can always slip through them and escape the spirit of them while they obey the letter  and i suppose it will be so to the worlds end and that let the laws be as perfect as they may if any man wishes to cheat or oppress his neighbour he will surely be able to work his wicked will in some way or other  well then my friends if mans law is weak gods is notif mans law has flaws and gaps in it through which covetousness can creep gods has noneeven if which god forbid mans law died out and sinners were left to sin without fear of punishment still gods law stands sure and the eye of the living god slumbers not and the hand of the living god never grows weary and out of the everlasting heaven his voice is saying day and night for ever i endure for ever  i sit on the throne judging right a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of my kingdom  i judge the world in justice and minister true judgment unto the people  i also will be a refuge for the oppressed even a refuge in due time of trouble  o hear those words my friends hear and obey if you love life and wish to see good days and never never say a thing is right simply because the law cannot punish you for it  never say in your hearts when you are tempted to be hard cruel covetous overreaching what harm  i break no law by it  there is a law whether you see it or not you break a law whether you confess it or not a law which is as a wall of iron clothed with thunder though mans law be but a flimsy net of thread and that law and not any acts of parliament shall judge you in the day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed and every man shall receive the due reward of the deeds done in the body not according as they were allowed or not by the statute book but according as they were good or evil  another lesson we may learn from this story  that if we give way to our passions we give way to the devil also  ahab gave way to his passion he knew that he was wrong for when naboth refused to sell him the vineyard he did not dare openly to rob him of it he went to his house heavy of heart and fretted like a spoilt child because he could not get what he wanted  it was but a little thing and he might have been content to go without it  he was king of all israel and what was one small vineyard more or less to him  but prosperity had spoilt him he must needs have every toy on which he set his heart and he was weak enough to fret that he could not get more when he had too much already  but he knew that he could not get it that king as he was naboths property was his own and that gods everlasting law stood between him and the thing he coveted  well for him if he had been contented with fretting  but my friendsand be you rich or poor take heed to my wordswhenever any man gives way to selfishness and selfseeking to a proud covetous envious peevish temper the devil is sure to glide up and whisper in his ear thoughts which will make him worseworse ay than he ever dreamt of being  first comes the flesh and then the devil and if the flesh opens the door of the heart the devil steps in quickly enough  first comes the flesh  fleshly carnal pride at being thwarted fleshly carnal longing for a thing which longs all the more for it because one cannot have it fleshly carnal peevishness and illtemper at not having just the pleasant thing one happens to like  that is a state of mind which is a birdcall for all the devils and when they see a man in that temper they flock to him i believe as crows do to carrion  it is astonishing humbling awful my friends what horrible thoughts will cross ones mind if once one gives way to that selfish proud angry longing temper thoughts of which we are ashamed the next moment temptations to sin at which we shudder they seem so unlike ourselves not parts of ourselves at all  when the dark fit is past one can hardly believe that such wicked thoughts ever crossed ones mind  i dont think that they are part of ourselves i believe them to be the whispers of the devil himself and when they pass away i believe that it is the lord jesus christ who drives them away  but if any man gives way to them determines to keep his sullenness and so gives place to the devil then those thoughts do not pass they take hold of a man possess him as the bible calls it and make him in his madness do things whichalas who has not done things in his day of which he has repented all his life afterthings for which he would gladly cut off his right hand for the sake of being able to say i never did that  but the thing is donedone to all eternity  he has given place to the devil and the devil has made him do in five minutes work which he could not undo in five thousand years and all that is left is when he comes to himself to cast himself on gods boundless mercy and christs boundless atonement and cry my sins are like scarlet thou alone canst make them whiter than snow  my sin is ever before me only let it not be ever before thee o god  punish me if thou seest fit but oh forgive for there is mercy with thee and infinite redemption  and thanks be to gods great love he will not cry in vain  yet oh my friends do not give place to the devil unless you wish forgiven or not to repent of it to the latest day you live  and this was ahabs fate  he knew i say that he was wrong he knew that naboths property was his own and dare not openly rob him of it and he went to his house heavy of heart and refused to eat and while he was in such a temper as that the devil lost no time in sending an evil spirit to him  it was a woman whom he sent jezebel ahabs own wife  but she was as far as we can see a woman of a devilish spirit cruel proud profligate and unjust as well as a worshipper of the filthy idols of the canaanites  ahabs first sin was in having married this wicked heathen woman  now his sin punished itself she tempted him through his pride and self conceit she taunted him into sin  dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel  i will give thee the vineyard of naboth  you all remember how she did so by falsely accusing naboth of blasphemy  ahab seems to have taken no part in naboths murder perhaps he was afraid but he was a weak man and jezebel was a strong and fierce spirit and ruled him and led him in this matter as she did in making him worship idols with her and he was content to be led  he was content to let others do the wickedness he had not courage to carry out himself  he forgot that as is well said he who does a thing by another does it by himself that if you let others sin for you you sin for yourself  would to god my friends that we would all remember this  how often people wink at wrongdoing in those with whom they have dealings in those whom they employ in their servants in their children because it is convenient to them  they shut their eyes and their hearts too and say to themselves at all events it is his doing and not mine and it is his concern i am not answerable for other peoples sins  i would not do such a thing myself certainly but as it is done i may as well make the best of it  if i gain by it i need not be so very sharp in looking into the matter  and so you see men who really wish to be honest and kindly themselves making no scruple of profiting by other peoples dishonesty and cruelty  now the law punishes the receiver of stolen goods almost as severely as the thief himself  but there are many receivers of stolen goods my friends whom the law cannot touch  the world at times seems to me to be full of them for every one my friends who hushes up a cruel or a dishonest matter because he himself is a gainer by it he is no better than the receiver of stolen goods and he will find in the day of the lord that the sin will lie at his door as jezebels sin lay at ahabs  there was no need for ahab to say jezebel did it and not i  the prophet did not even give him time to excuse himself  thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession  by taking possession of naboths vineyard and so profiting by his murder he made himself partaker in that murder and had to hear the terrible sentence in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth dogs shall lick thy blood even thine  oh my friends whatsoever you do keep clean hands and a pure heart  if you touch pitch it will surely stick to you  let no gain tempt you to be partaker of others mens sins never fancy that because men cannot lay the blame on the right person god cannot  god will surely lay the burden on the man who helped to make the burden god will surely require part payment from the man who profited by the bargain so keep yourselves clear of other mens sins that you may be clear also of their condemnation  so ahab had committed a horrible and great sin and had received sentence for it and now as i said before there was nothing to be done but to repent and he did so after his fashion  ahab it seems was not an utterly bad man he was a weak man fond of his own pleasure a slave to his own passions and easily led sometimes to good but generally to evil  and god did not execute full vengeance on him  his repentance was a poor one enough but such as it was the good and merciful god gave him credit for it as far as it went and promised him that the worst part of his sentence the ruin of his family should not come in his time  but still the sentence against him stood and was fulfilled  not long after as we read in the second lesson he was killed in battle and that not bravely and with honour for if he had been that would have been but a slight punishment my friends but shamefully by a chance shot after he had disguised himself in the cowardice of his guilty conscience and tried to throw all the danger on his ally good king jehoshaphat of judah and they washed his chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah the prophet  so ends one of the most clear and terrible stories in the whole bible of gods impartial justice  may god give us all grace to lay it to heart  we are all tempted as ahab was rich or poor our temptation is alike to give place to the devil and let him lead us into dark and deep sin by giving way to our own fancies longings pride and temper  we are all tempted as ahab was to overreach our neighbours in some way i do not mean always in cheating them but in being unfair to them in caring more for ourselves than for them thinking of ourselves first and of them last trying to make ourselves comfortable or to feed our own pride at their expense oh my friends whenever we are tempted to be selfish and grasping be sure that we are opening a door to the very devil of hell himself though he may look so smooth and gentle and respectable that perhaps we shall not know him when he comes to us and shall take his counsels for the counsel of an angel of light  but be sure that if it is selfishness which has opened the door of our heart not god but the devil will come in let him disguise himself as cunningly as he will and our only hope is to flee to him in whom there was no selfishness the lord jesus christ who came not to do his own will but his fathers not to glorify himself but his father not to save his own life but to sacrifice it freely for us his selfish weak greedy wandering sheep  pray to him to give you his spirit that glorious spirit of love and duty and self sacrifice by which all the good deeds on earth are done which teaches a man not to care about himself but about others to help others to feel for others to rejoice in their happiness to grieve over their sorrows to give to them rather than take from themin one word the holy spirit of god which may he pour out on you and me and all mankind that we may live justly and lovingly as children of one just and loving father in heaven    sermon xii  the light of god    preached for the chelsea national schools  ephesians v 13  all things which are reproved are made manifest by the light  for whatsoever is made manifest is light  this is a noble text a royal text one of those texts which forbid us to clip and cramp scripture to suit any narrow notions of our own which open before us boundless vistas of gods love of human knowledge of the future of mankind  there are many such texts many more than we fancy but this is one which is especially valuable at the present time one especially fit for a sermon on education for it is as it were the scriptural charter of the advocate of education  it enables him boldly to say there is nothing i will refuse to teach there is nothing which man shall forbid me to teach there is nothing which god has made in heaven or earth about which i will not tell the truth boldly to the young  for light comes from god  god is light and in him is no darkness at all  and therefore he wishes to give light to his children  he willeth not that the least of them should be kept in darkness about any matter  darkness is of the devil and he who keeps any human soul in darkness let his pretences be as reverent and as religious as they may is doing the devils work  nothing then which god has made will we conceal from the young  true there are errors of which we will not speak to the young but they are not made by god  they are the works of darkness  our duty is to teach the young what god has made what he has done what he has ordained to make them freely partakers of whatsoever light god has given us  then by means of that light they will be able to reprove the works of darkness  for whatsoever is made manifest is light  our version says whatsoever makes manifest is light  that is true a noble truth but i should not be honest if i did not confess that that is not what st paul says here  he says that which is made manifest is light  on this the best commentators and scholars agree  our old translators have made a mistake though in grammar only and have substituted one great truth for another equally great  whatsoever is made manifest is light  we should have expected this if we are really christians  if we have faith in god if we believe that god is worthy of our faitha god whom we can trust in whom is neither caprice deceit nor darkness but pure and perfect lightif we believe that we are his children and that he wishes us to be like himself full of light knowing what we are and what the world is because we know who god isif we believe that he sent his son into the world to reveal him to unveil him to draw aside the veil which dark superstition and ignorance had spread between man and god and to show us the glory of godif we believe this then we shall be ready to expect that whatsoever is made manifest would be light for if god be light all that he has made must be light also  like must beget like and therefore light must beget light good beget good love beget love and therefore we ought to expect that as true and sound knowledge increases our views of god will be more full of light  yes my friends under the influence of true science god will be no longer looked upon as he was in those superstitions which we well call dark as a proud angry capricious being as a stern taskmaster as one far removed from the sympathy of men  but as one of whom we may cheerfully say thy name be hallowed for thy name is father thy kingdom come for it is a fathers kingdom thy will be done for it is a fathers will and in doing thy will alone men claim their true dignity of being the sons of god  our views of our fellowmen will be more cheerful also more full of sympathy comprehension charity hope in one word more full of light  if it be true and it is true that god loves all then we should expect to find in all something worthy of our love  if it be true that god willeth that none should perish we should expect to find in each man something which ought not to perish  if it be true that god stooped from heaven yea stoops from heaven eternally to seek and to save that which is lost then we should have good hope that our efforts to seek to save that which is lost will not be in vain  we shall have hope in every good work we undertake for we shall know that in it we are fellowworkers with god  our notions of the worldof gods whole universe will become full of light likewise  do we believe that this earth was made by jesus christby him who was full of grace and truth  do we believe our bibles when they tell us that he hath given all created things a law which cannot be broken that they continue as at the beginning for all things serve him  do we believe this  then we must look on this earth yea on the whole universe of god as like its master full of grace and truth not as old monks and hermits fancied it a dark deceiving evil earth filled with snares and temptations a world from which a man ought to hide himself in the wilderness and find his own safety in ignorance  not thus but as the old hebrews thought of it as a glorious and a divine universe in which the spirit of god the lord and giver of life creates eternal melody bringing for ever life out of death light out of darkness letting his breath go forth that new generations may be made and herein renew the face of the earth  and experience teaches us that this has been the case that for near one thousand eight hundred years there has been a steady progress in the mind of the christian race and that this progress has been in the direction of light  has it not been so in our notions of god  what has the history of theology been for near one thousand eight hundred years  has it not been a gradual justification of god a gradual vindication of his character from those dark and horrid notions of the deity which were borrowed from the pagans and from the jewish rabbis a gradual return to the perfect good news of a good god which was preached by st john and by st paulin one word a gradual manifestation of god and a gradual discovery that when god is manifested behold god is light and in him is no darkness at all  that progress alas is not yet perfect  we still see through a glass darkly and we are still too apt to impute to god himself the darkness of those very hearts of ours in which he is so dimly mirrored  and there are men still even in protestant england who love darkness rather than light and teach men that god is dark and in him are only scattered spots of light and those visible only to a favoured few men who whether from ignorance or covetousness or lust of power preach such a deity as the old pharisees worshipped when they crucified the lord of glory and offer to deliver men forsooth out of the hands of this dreadful phantom of their own dark imaginations  let them be  let the dead bury their dead and let us follow christ  believe indeed that he is the likeness of gods glory and the express image of gods person and you will be safe from the dark dreams with which they ensnare diseased and superstitious consciences  let them be  light is stronger than darkness love stronger than cruelty  perfect god stronger than fallen man and the day shall come when all shall be light in the lord when all mankind shall know god from the least unto the greatest and lifting up free foreheads to him who made them and redeemed them by his son shall in spirit and in truth worship the father  does not experience again show us that in the case of our fellow men whatsoever is made manifest is light  how easy it was a thousand years agoa hundred years ago even to have dark thoughts about our fellowmen simply because we did not know them  easy it was while the nations were kept apart by war even by mere difficulty of travelling for christians to curse jews turks infidels and heretics and believe that god willed their eternal perdition even though the glorious collect for good friday gave their inhumanity the lie  easy to persecute those to whose opinions we could not or would not take the trouble to give a fair hearing  easy to condemn the negro to perpetual slavery when we knew nothing of him but his black face or to hang by hundreds the ragged streetboys while we disdained to inquire into the circumstances which had degraded them or to treat madmen as wild beasts instead of taming them by wise and gentle sympathy  but with a closer knowledge of our fellowcreatures has come toleration pity sympathy  and as that sympathy has been freely obeyed it has justified itself more and more  the more we have tried to help our fellowmen the more easy we have found it to help them  the more we have trusted them the more trustworthy we have found them  the more we have treated them as human beings the more humanity we have found in them  and thus man in proportion as he becomes manifest to man is seen in spite of all defects and sins to be hallowed with a light from god who made him  and if it has been thus in the case of god and of humanity has it not been equally so in the case of the physical world  where are now all those unnatural superstitionsthe monkish contempt for marriage and social life the ghosts and devils the astrology the magic and other dreams of which i will not speak here which made this world in the eyes of our forefathers a doleful and dreadful puzzle and which made man the sport of arbitrary powers of cruel beings who could torment and destroy us but over whom we could have no righteous power in return  where are all those dark dreams gone which maddened our forefathers into witchhunting panics and which on the continent created a priestly science of witchfinding and witchdestroying the literature whereof and it is a large one presents perhaps the most hideous instance known of human cruelty cowardice and cunning  where i ask are those dreams now  so utterly vanished that very few people in this church know what a great part they played in the thoughts of our forefathers how ghosts devils witches magic and astrology filled the minds not only of the ignorant but of the most learned for centuries  and now behold nature being made manifest is light  science has taught men to admire where they used to dread to rule where they used to obey to employ for harmless uses what they were once afraid to touch and where they once saw only fiends to see the orderly and beneficent laws of the allgood and almighty god  everywhere as the work of nature is unfolded to our eyes we see beauty order mutual use the offspring of perfect love as well as perfect wisdom everywhere we are finding means to employ the secret forces of nature for our own benefit or to ward off physical evils which seemed to our forefathers as inevitable supernatural and even the pestilence instead of being as was once fancied the capricious and miraculous infliction of some demonthe pestilence itself is found to be an orderly result of the same laws by which the sun shines and the herb grows a product of nature and therefore subject to man to be prevented and extirpated by him if he will  yes my friends let us teach these things to our children to all children  let us tell them to go to the light and see their heavenly fathers works manifested and know that they are as he is light  i say let us teach our children freely and boldly to know these things and grow up in the light of them  let us leave those to sneer at the triumphs of modern science who trade upon the ignorance and the cowardice of mankind and who say provided you make a child religious what matter if he does fancy the sun goes round the earth  why occupy his head perhaps disturb his simple faith by giving him a smattering of secular science  specious enough is that argument  but shortsighted more than enough  it is of a piece with the wisdom which shrinks from telling children that god is love lest they should not be sufficiently afraid of him which forbids their young hearts to expand freely towards their fellowcreatures  which puts into their mouths the watchwords of sects and parties and thinks to keep them purer christians by making them pharisees from the cradle  my friends we may try to train up children as pharisees  but we shall discover after twenty years of mistaken labour that we have only made them sadducees  the path to infidelity in manhood is superstition in youth  you may tell the child never to mind whether the sun moves round the earth or not  but the day will come when he will mind in spite of you and if he then finds that you have deceived him that you have even left him in wilful ignorance all your moral influence over him is gone and all your religious lessons probably gone also  so true is it that lies are by their very nature selfdestructive  for all truth is of god and no lie is of the truth and therefore no lie can possibly help god or gods work in any human soul  for as the child ceases to respect his teachers he ceases to respect what they believe  his innate instinct of truth and honour his innate longing to believe to look up to some one better than himself have been shocked and shaken once and for all and it may require long years and sad years to bring him back to the faith of his childhood  again i say it we must not fear to tell the children the whole truth in these days above all others which the world has yet seen  you cannot prevent their finding out the truth  then for our own sake let us their authorized teachers be the first to tell it them  let them in after life connect the thought of their clergyman their schoolmaster their church with their first lessons in the free and right use of their godgiven faculties with their first glimpses into the boundless mysteries of art and science  let them learn from us to regard all their powers as their heavenly fathers gift all art all science all discoveries as their heavenly fathers revelation to men  let them learn from us not to shrink from the light not to peep at it by stealth but to claim it as their birthright to welcome it to live and grow in it to the full stature of menrational free christian english men  this i believe must be the method of a truly protestant education  i said protestanti say it again  what is the watchword of protestantism  it is this  that no lie is of the truth  there are those who complain of us english that we attach too high a value to truth  they say that falsehood is an evil  but not so great a one as we fancy  we accept the imputation  we answer boldly that there can be no greater evil than falsehood no greater blessing than truth and that by gods help we will teach the same to our children and to our childrens children  free inquiry religious as well as civil libertythis is the spirit of protestantism  this our fathers have bequeathed to us this we will bequeath to our childrento know that all truth is of god that no lie is of the truth  our enemies may call us heretics unbelievers rebellious political squabblers  they may say in scorn you protestants know not whither you are going you have broken yourselves off from the old catholic tree and now in the wild exercise of your own private judgment you are losing all that standard of doctrine all unity of belief  our answer will beit is not so  but even if it were so even if we did not know whither we were goingwe should go forward still  for though we know not god knows  we have committed ourselves to god the living god and he has led us and we believe that he will lead us  he has taught us and we believe that he will teach us still  he has prospered us and we believe that he will prosper us still  and therefore we will train up our children after us to go on the path which has brought us hither freely to use their minds boldly to prove all things and hold fast that which is good manfully to go forward following truth whithersoever she may lead them trusting in god the father of lights asking him for wisdom who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given them  i have been asked to preach this day for the national schools of this parish  i do so willingly because i believe that in them this course of education is pursued that conjoined with a sound teaching in the principles of our protestant church and a wholesome and kindly moral training there is free and full secular instruction as far as the ages of the children will allow  were it not the case i could not plead for these schools above all at this time when the battle between ancient superstition and modern enlightenment in this land seems fast coming to a crisis and a death struggle  i could not ask you to help any school on earth in which i had not fair proof that the teachers taught on physical and human as well as on moral subjects the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help them god    sermon xiii  providence    matthew vi 31 32 33  be not anxious saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed for after all these things do the heathen seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things  but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you  we must first consider carefully what this text really means what taking no thought for the morrow really is  now it cannot mean that we are to be altogether careless and imprudent for all scripture and especially solomons proverbs give us the very opposite advice and one part of gods word cannot contradict the other  the whole of solomons proverbs is made up of lessons in prudence and foresight and surely our lord did not come to do away with solomons proverbs but to fulfil them  and more solomon declares again and again that prudence and foresight are the gifts of god and gods gifts are surely meant to be used  isaiah too tells us that the common work of the farm tilling the ground sowing and reaping were taught to men by god and says of the ploughman that his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him  neither can god mean us to sit idle with folded hands waiting to be fed by miracles  would he have given to man reason and skill and the power of bettering his mortal condition by ten thousand instructions if he had not meant him to use those gifts we find that at the beginning adam is put into the garden not to sit idle in it nor to feed merely on the fruits which fall from the trees as the dumb animals do but to dress it and to keep it to use his own reason to improve his own condition and the land on which god had placed him  was not the very first command given to man to replenish the earth and subdue it  and do we not find in the very end of scripture the apostles working with their own hands for their daily bread  but what use of many words  it is absurd to believe anything else absurd to believe that man was meant to live like the butterfly flitting without care from flower to flower and like the butterfly die helpless at the first shower or the first winters frost  whatever the text means it cannot mean that  and it does not mean that  i suppose that three hundred years ago when the bible was translated out of the greek tongue in which the apostles wrote into english taking thought meant something different from what it does now  but the plain meaning of the text if it be put into such english as we talk now is do not fret about the morrow  be not anxious about the morrow  there is no doubt at all as any scholar can tell you that that is the plain meaning of the word in our modern english and that our lord is not telling us to be imprudent or idle but not to be anxious and fretful about the morrow  and more i think if we look carefully at these words we shall find that they tell us the very reason why we are to work and to look forward and to believe that god will bless our labour  and what is this reason  it is this that we have a father in heaven not a mere maker not a mere master but a father  all turns on that one gospel of all gospels your father in heaven for our lord seems to me to say be not anxious for your life what ye shall eat or drink or wear  is not the life more than meat has not your heavenly father given you a higher life than the mere life which must be kept up by food which he has given to the animals  he has made you reasonable souls he has given to you wisdom from his own wisdom and a share of the light which lights every man who comes into the world the light of christ his son he has created you in his own likeness that like him you may make things be makers and inventors each in his place and calling each according to his talents and powers even as your heavenly father the maker and creator of all things  and if he has given you all these wonderful powers of mind and soul surely he has given you the less blessing the mere power to earn your own food  if he has made you so much wiser than the beasts surely he has made you as wise as the beasts  and is not the body more than raiment  has he not given you bodies which can speak write build work plant in a thousand cunning and wonderful ways bodies which can do a thousand nobler things than merely keep themselves warm as the beasts do then be sure if he has given you the greater power he has given you the less also  and as for fine clothes and rich ornaments is not the body more than raiment  is not your body a far more beautiful and nobler thing than all the gay clothes with which you can bedizen it  if your bodies be fair strong healthy useful it matters little what clothes you put upon them  why will you not have faith in your heavenly father  why will you not have faith in the great honour which he put on you when he said at first let us make man in our image after our likeness and let him have dominion over all things on the earth  be sure that god would not have made man and given him all these powers and sent him upon this earth unless this earth had been a right good and fit place for him  be sure that if you obey the laws of this earth where god has put you you will never need to be anxious or fret but you will prosper right well you and your children after you  for consider the fowls of the air they neither sow nor reap and gather into barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them and are ye not much better than they  surely you are for you can sow and reap and gather into barns  and if god makes the earth work so well that it feeds the fowls who cannot help themselves how much more will the earth feed you who can help yourselves because god has given you understanding and prudence  but as for anxiety fretting repining complaining to god why hast thou made me thus what use in that which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature will all the fretting and anxiety in the world make you one foot or one inch taller than you are  will it make you stronger wiser more able to help yourself  you are what you are  you can do what god has given you power to do  trust him that he has made you strong enough and wise enough to earn your daily bread and to prosper right well if you will upon this earth which he has made and why be anxious about clothing  consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these  but man can toil man can spin your heavenly father has given to man the power of providing clothes for himself and not for himself only but for others so that while the man who tills the soil feeds the man who spins and weaves the man who spins and weaves shall clothe the man who tills the soil and the town shall work for the country while the country feeds the town and every man if he does but labour where god has put him shall produce comforts for human beings whom he never saw who live perhaps in foreign lands across the sea  for the heavenly father has knit together the great family of man in one blessed bond of mutual need and mutual usefulness all over the world so that no member of it can do without the other and each member of iteach individual manlet him work at what thing he will can make many times more of that thing than he needs for himself and so help others while he earns his own living and so wealth and comfort ought to increase year by year among the whole family of men ay and would increase if it were not for sin  yes my friends if it were not for that same sinif it were not that men do not seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness there would be no end no bound to the wealth the comfort the happiness of the children of men  even as it is in spite of all mans sin the world does prosper marvellously miraculously in spite of all the waste destruction idleness ignorance injustice and folly which goes on in the world mankind increases and replenishes the earth and improves in comfort and in happiness in spite of all god is stronger than the devil life stronger than death wisdom stronger than folly order stronger than disorder fruitfulness stronger than destruction and they will be so more and more till the last great day when christ shall have put all enemies under his feet and death is swallowed up in victory and all mankind is one fold under one shepherd jesus christ the righteous king of all  but some may ask what does our lord mean when he says that if we sought first the kingdom of god and his righteousness all these things should be added to us  i cannot tell you altogether my friends for eye hath not seen nor ear heard nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive what god has prepared for those who love him  but this i can tell you that these things are taken from men instead of being added to them by their not seeking first gods kingdom and his righteousness  i can tell you as the prophet does that it is the sins of man which withhold good things from him because though as the prophet says in the same place god sends the good things and the former and latter rain in their season and reserves to men still the appointed weeks of harvest yet men will not fear that same lord their god and therefore those good things are wasted and mankind remains too often miserable in spite of gods goodness and starving in the midst of gods plenty  if you wish to know what i mean look but once at this present war i do not complain of the war  i honour the war  i thank god from the bottom of my heart for this great and glorious victory and i call on you to thank him too for it  i am none of those who think war sinful  i cannot do so for i swore at my baptism to fight manfully under christs banner against the world the flesh and the devil and if we cannot reach the devil and his works by any other means we must reach them as we are doing now by sharp shot and cold steel and we must hold it an honourable thing and few things more honourable on earth for a man to die fighting against evil men and an evil worlddevouring empire like that of babylon of old or this of russia now that he may save not merely us who sit here now but our childrens children and generations yet unborn from russian tyranny and russian falsehood and russian profligacy and russian superstition  i say i do not complain of this war but i ask you to look at the mere waste which it brings the mere waste of gods blessings  consider all the skilful men now employed in making cannon shot and powder to kill mortal men who might every one of them in time of peace have been employed in making things which would feed and clothe and comfort mortal man  consider that very powder and shot itself the fruit of so much labour and money made simply to be shot away once for all as if a man should spend months in making some precious vessel and then dash it to pieces the moment it was made  consider that sevastopol alone the millions of money which it must have costthe stone the timber the iron all used therein making a mere robbers den which might all have been spent in giving employment and sustenance to whole provinces of poor starving russians  consider those tens of thousands of men labouring day and night for months at those deadly earthworks whose strong arms might have been all tilling gods earth and growing food for the use of man  and then see the waste the want the misery which that one place sevastopol has caused upon gods earth  and consider too the souls of mortal men who have been wasted thereno man knows how many nor will know till the judgment day two hundred thousand at the least they say wasted about that accursed place within the last twelve months  two hundred thousand cunning brains two hundred thousand strong right hands two hundred thousand willing hearts  what good might not each of those men have done if he had been labouring peacefully at home in his right place in gods family  what might he not have invented made carried over land and sea  none dead there but might have been of use in his generation and doubtless many a one who would have done good with all his might who would have been a blessing to those around him and now what is left of him on earth but a few bones beneath the sod  wastedutterly wasted  oh consider how precious is one man consider how much good the weakest and stupidest of us all might do if he set himself with his whole soul to do good consider that the weakest and stupidest of us even if he has no care for good cannot earn his days wages without doing some good to the bodies of his fellowmen and then judge of the loss to mankind by this one single siege of one single town and think how many stomachs must be the emptier how many backs the barer for this one war and then see how man wastes gods gifts and wastes most of all that most precious gift of all men living men with minds and reasons and immortal souls  and whence has all this waste come  simply because these russian rulers have chosen to seek first not gods kingdom but their own instead of behaving like gods ministers and gods stewards and asking how would god our king have us rule his kingdom they have laboured for their own power conquering all the nations round them removing their neighbours landmark and wasting the wealth of their country on armies and fortresses and fleets with which they intended to conquer more and more of the earth which did not belong to them  because instead of seeking gods righteousness and saying to themselves how shall we be righteous even as our heavenly father is righteous and how shall we teach this great people to be righteous likewise they have sought their own pleasure and lived in profligacy covetous and cheating almost beyond belief and instead of behaving righteously to the people or teaching them to be righteous they have crushed down the people stupefied and corrupted them by slavery and maddened them by superstitions which are not the righteousness of god till they have made them easy tools in their unjust wars and are able to drive them even by force like sheep to the slaughter to die miserably in a cause in which even if those unhappy slaves conquered they would only rivet their own chains more tightly and put more power into the hands of the very rulers who are robbing them of their earnings dishonouring their daughters and driving off their sons to die in a foreign land  ah my friends if these men had but sought first the kingdom of god and his righteousness if the great wealth and the wonderful industry and prudence of russia had been but spent in doing justly and loving mercy what a rich and honourable country of brave and industrious christian men might russia be a blessing and not a curse to half the earth of god  let us pray that she will become so some day and we may have hope for her for she is but young and has time yet for repentance  but some may sayindeed we are all ready enough to saythen the evil of this war is the russians fault and not ours and so in every other case  in every other evil and misery they are rather other peoples fault than ours  if we do our duty well enough and if other people would but do theirs all would be well  we are all apt to say this in our hearts  but our lord does not say so  his promise is to all mankind  but his promise is to each of us also  when he says seek ye first gods kingdom and righteousness he speaks to you and to me to every soul now here believe it my friends  the more that i see of life the more i see how much of our sorrow is our own fault how much of our happiness is in our own hands and the more i see how little use there is in finding fault with this government or that the more i see how much use there is in every mans finding fault with himself and taking his share of the blame  i do not doubt that if the whole people of england for the last forty years had sought first gods kingdom and gods righteousness and said to themselves in every matter not merely what is profitable for us to do but what is right for us to do we should have been spared the expenses and the sorrows of this war but as for blaming our government my friendswhat they are we are we choose them englishmen like ourselves and they truly represent us  not one complaint can we make against them which we may not as justly make against ourselves and if we had been in their places we should have done what they did for the seeds of the same sins are in us and we yield each in his own household and his own business to the same temptations as they to the sins which so easily beset englishmen at this present time  i say frankly i see not one charge brought against them in the newspapers which might not quite as justly be brought against me and for aught i know against every one of us here and while we are not faithful over a few things what right have we to complain of them for not having been faithful over many things  believe rather i believe it that if we had been in their place we should have done far worse than they and ask yourselves do i seek first gods kingdom and gods righteousness for if i do not what right have i to lay the blame of my bad success on other mens not seeking them to each of us as much as to our government or to the russian empire is christs command and each of us must take the consequences if we break it  let us look at ourselves and mend ourselves and try whether gods promise will not hold true for us each in his station let the world round us go as it will  be sure that god is just and that every man bears his own burden  that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee o god shall not the judge of all the earth do right  be sure that those who trust in him shall never be confounded though the earth be moved and the mountains carried into the midst of the sea as it is written trust in the lord and be doing good dwell in the land and work where god has placed thee and verily thou shalt be fed  but have we done so my friends have we sought first gods kingdom and his righteousness have we not rather forgotten the meaning of the text and what gods kingdom is and what his righteousness is do not most people fancy that gods kingdom only means some pleasant place to which people are to go after they die and that seeking gods righteousness only means having christs righteousness imputed to us as they call it without our being righteous and good ourselves  do not most of us fancy that this very text means do you take care of your souls and god will take care of your bodies do you see after the salvation of your souls and god will see after the salvation of your bodies a meaning which in the first place is not true for god will do no such thing and all the religion in the world will not prevent a mans having to work for his daily bread or pay his debts for him without money and a meaning which in the second place people themselves do not believe for religious professors in general now are just as keen about money as irreligious ones and even more so so that covetousness and cunning ambition and greediness to rise in life seem nowadays to go hand in hand with a high religious profession and those who fancy themselves the children of light have become just as wise in their generation as the children of this world whom they despise  no my friends that is not the meaning of the text and when i ask you have you obeyed the text i do not ask you that question but one which i believe is something far more spiritual and more deep something at least which is far more heartsearching and likely to prick a mans conscience perhaps to make him angry with me who ask  do you seek first gods kingdom or your own profit your own pleasure your own reputation  do you believe that you are in gods kingdom that he is your king and has called you to the station in which you are to do good and useful work for him upon this earth of his  whatever be your calling whether you be servant labourer farmer tradesman gentleman maid wife or widow father son or husband do you ask yourself every day now what are the laws of gods kingdom about this station of mine what is my duty here how can i obey god and his laws here and do what he requires of me and so be a good servant a good labourer a good tradesman a good master a good parish officer a good wife a good parent pleasing to god useful to my neighbours and to my countrymen  or do you say to yourselves how can i get the greatest quantity of money and pleasure out of my station with the least trouble to myself  my dearest friends ask yourselves each of you in which of these two ways do you look at your own station in life  and do you seek first gods righteousness  there can be no mistake as to what gods righteousness is for gods righteousness must be christs righteousness seeing that he is the express image of his father  now do you ask yourselves how am i to be righteous in my station as christ was in his how can i do my heavenly fathers will as christ did how can i behave like christ in my station how would the lord jesus christ have behaved if he had been in my place when he was on earth  my friends that is the question the searching question the question which must convince us all of sin and show us so many faults of our own to complain of that we shall find no time to throw stones at our neighbours  how would the lord jesus christ have behaved if he had been in my place when he was upon earth  my dear friends till we can all of us answer that question somewhat better than we can now we have no need to look as far as russia or as our forefathers mistakes or our rulers mistakes to find out why this trouble and that trouble come upon us  for we shall find the reason in our own selfish greedy selfwilled hearts  oh my friends let us each search our own lives and repent and amend and resolve to do our duty as sons of god in the station to which god has called us by the help of the spirit of god which he has promised freely to those who ask him  and now this day as we thank god for this great victory let us thank him not with our lips merely but with our lives by living such lives as he loves to see such lives as he meant us to live lives of loyalty to god and of usefulness to our brethren and of industry and prudence in our calling and so help forward each of us however humble our station the glory of god because we shall each of us in the cottage and in the field in the shop and in the mansion in this our little parish and therefore in the great nation of which it is a part help forward the fulfilment of those blessed words our father which art in heaven thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven and therefore also the fulfilment of the words which come after them and not before them give us this day our daily bread    sermon xiv  englands strength    2 kings xix 34  i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake  the first lesson for this mornings service is of the grandest in the whole old testament grander perhaps than all except the story of the passage of the red sea and the giving of the law on sinai it follows out the story which you heard in the first lesson for last sunday afternoon of the invasion of judea by the assyrians you heard then how this great assyrian conqueror sennacherib after taking all the fortified towns of judah and sweeping the whole country with fire and sword sent three of his generals up to the very walls of jerusalem commanding king hezekiah to surrender at discretion and throw himself and his people on sennacheribs mercy how proudly and boastfully he taunted the jews with their weakness how like the russian emperor now he called in religion as the excuse for his conquests and robberies saying as if gods blessings were on them am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it  the lord said to me go up against this place to destroy it while all the time what he really trusted in as his own words showed was what the russian emperors trust in their own strength and the number of their armies  jerusalem was thus in utter need and danger the vast army of the assyrians was encamped at lachish not more than ten miles off and however strong the walls of jerusalem might be and however advantageously it might stand on its high hill with lofty rocks and cliffs on three sides of it yet hezekiah knew well that no strength of his could stand more than a few days against sennacheribs army for these assyrians had brought the art of war to a greater perfection than any nation of the old world  they lived for war and studied it seems only how to conquer  and they have left behind them very remarkable proofs of what sort of men they were of which i think it right to tell you all for they are most instructive not merely because they prove the truth of isaiahs account but because they explain it and help us in many ways to understand his prophecies  they are a number of sculptures and paintings representing sennacherib his army and his different conquests which were painted by his command in his palace and having been lately discovered there among the ruins of nineveh have been brought to england and are now in the british museum while copies of many of them are in the crystal palace  there we see these terrible assyrian conquerors defeating their enemies torturing and slaughtering their prisoners swimming rivers beating down castles sweeping on from land to land like a devouring fire while over their heads fly fierce spirits who protect and prosper their cruelties and eagles who trail in their claws the entrails of the slain  the very expression of their faces is frightful for its fierceness the countenances of a bitter and hasty nation as the prophet calls them whose feet were swift to shed blood  and as for the art of war and their power of taking walled towns like jerusalem you may see them in these pictures battering down and undermining forts and castles with instruments so well made and powerful that all other nations who came after them for more than two thousand years seem to have been content to copy from them and hardly to have improved on the old assyrian engines  such and so terrible they came up against jerusalem  to attempt to fight them would have been useless madness and hezekiah had but one means of escaping from them and that was to cast himself and his people upon the boundless mercy and faithfulness and power of god  and hezekiah had his answer by isaiah the prophet  and more than an answer  the lord took the matter into his own hand and showed sennacherib which was the stronger his soldiers and horses and engines or the lord god and so that terrible assyrian army came utterly to nought and vanished off the face of the earth  now my friends has this noble history no lesson in it for us  god forbid  it has a lesson which ought to come nearer to our hearts than to the hearts of any nation  for though we or our forefathers have never been for nearly three hundred years in such utter need and danger as jerusalem was yet be sure that we might have been so again and again had it not been for the mercy of the same god who delivered jerusalem from the assyrians  it is now three hundred years ago that the lord delivered this country from as terrible an invader as sennacherib himself when he three times scattered by storms the fleets of the king of spain which were coming to lay waste this land with fire and sword  and since then no foreign foe has set foot on english soil and we almost alone of all the nations of europe have been preserved from those horrors of war even to speak of which is dreadful  oh my friends we know not half gods goodness to us  and if you ask me why god has so blest and favoured this land i can only answerand i am not ashamed or afraid to answeri believe it is on account of the church of england it is because god has put his name here in a peculiar way as he did among the jews of old and that he is jealous for his church and for the special knowledge of his gospel and his law which he has given us in our prayerbook and in our church catechism lighting therein a candle in england which i believe will never be put out  it is not merely that we are a protestant countrygreat blessing as that isit is i believe that there is something in the church of england which there is not in protestant countries abroad unless perhaps sweden  for every one of them except sweden and ourselves has suffered from time to time invading armies and the unspeakable horrors of war  in some of them the light of the gospel has been quenched utterly and in others it lingers like a candle flickering down into the socket  by horrible persecutions and murder and war and pillage have those nations been tormented from time to time and who are we that we should escape  certainly from no righteousness of our own  some may say it is our great wealth which has made us strong  my friends believe it not  look at spain which was once the richest of all nations and did her riches preserve her  has she not dwindled down into the most miserable and helpless of all nations has not her very wealth vanished from her because she sold herself to work all unrighteousness with greediness  some may say it is our freedom which makes us strong  my friends believe it not  freedom is a vast blessing from god but freedom alone will preserve no nation  how many free nations have fallen into every sort of misery ay into bitter slavery in spite of all their freedom  how many free nations in europe lie now in bondage gnawing their tongues for pain and weary with waiting for the deliverance which does not come  no my friends freedom is of little use without something elseand that is loyalty reverence for law and obedience to the powers that be because men believe those powers to be ordained of god because men believe that christ is their king and they his ministers and stewards and that he it is who appoints all orders and degrees of men in his holy church true freedom can only live with true loyalty and obedience such as our prayerbook our catechism our church of england preaches to us  it is a church meant for free men who stand each face to face with their heavenly father  but it is a church meant also for loyal men who look on the law as the ordinance of god and on their rulers as the ministers of god and if our freedom has had anything to do as no doubt it has with our prosperity i believe that we owe the greater part of our freedom to the teaching and the general tone of mind which our prayerbook has given to us and to our forefathers for now three hundred years  not that we have listened to that teaching or acted up to it  god knows we have been but too like the jews in isaiahs time who had the law of god and yet did every man what was right in his own eyes we like them have been hypocritical we like them have neglected the poor and the widow and the orphan we like them have been too apt to pay tithe of mint and anise and neglect the weightier matters of the law justice mercy and judgment  when we read that awful first chapter of isaiah we may well tremble for all the charges which he brings against the jews of his time would just as well apply to us but yet we can trust in the lord as isaiah did and believe that he will be jealous for his land and for his names sake and not suffer the nations to say of us where is now their god  we can trust him that if he turn his hand on us as he did on the jews of old and bring us into danger and trouble yet it will be in love and mercy that he may purge away our dross and take away all our alloy and restore our rulers as at the first and our counsellors as at the beginning that we may be called the city of righteousness the faithful city  true we must not fancy that we have any righteousness of our own that we merit gods favour above other people our consciences ought to tell us that cannot be our bibles tell us that is an empty boast  did we not hear this morning bring forth fruits meet for repentance and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for god is able of these stones to raise up children to abraham  but we may comfort ourselves with the thought that there is one standing among us though we see him not who will ay and does baptize us with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather the wheat into his garner for the use of our children after us and the generations yet unborn while the chaff all among us which is empty and light and rotten and useless he will burn up thanks be to his holy name with fire unquenchable which neither the falsehood and folly of man nor the malice of the devil can put out but which will purge this land of all its sins  this is our hope and this is the cause of our thankfulness  for who but we should be thankful this day that we are englishmen members of christs church of england inhabitants of perhaps the only country in europe which is not now perplexed with fear of change while mens hearts fail them for dread and looking for those things which are coming on the earth a country which has never seen as all the countries round have seen a foreign army trampling down their crops burning their farms cutting down their trees plundering their towns destroying in a day the labour of years while women are dishonoured men tortured to make them give up their money the ablebodied driven from their homes ruined and wanderers and the sick and aged left to perish of famine and neglect  my friends all these things were going on but last year upon the danube  they are going on now in asia  even with all the mercy and moderation of our soldiers and sailors we have not been able to avoid inflicting some of these very miseries upon our own enemies and yet here we are going about our business in peace and safety in a land in which we and our forefathers have found now for many a year that just laws make a quiet and prosperous people that the effect of righteousness is peace and the fruit of righteousness quietness and assurance for evera land in which the good are not terrified the industrious hampered and the greedy and lawless made eager and restless by expectation of change in government but every man can boldly and hopefully work in his calling and whatsoever his hand finds to do do it with all his might in fair hope that the money which he earns in his manhood he will be able to enjoy quietly in his old age and hand it down safely to his children and his childrens childrena land which for hundreds of years has not felt the unspeakable horrors of war a land which even now is safely and peacefully gathering in its harvest while so many countries lie wasted with fire and sword oh my friends who made us to differ from others or what have we that we did not receive  not to ourselves do we owe our blessings hardly even to our wise forefathers  but to god himself and the spirit of god which was with them and is with us still in spite of all our shortcomings  we owe it to our wise constitution to our wise church the principle of which is that god is judge and christ is king in peace as well as in war in times of quiet as well as in times of change i say to our wise constitution and to our wise church which teach us that all power is of god that all men who have power great or small are his stewards that all orders and degrees of men in his holy church from the queen on the throne to the labourer in the harvestfield are called by god to their ministry and vocation and are responsible to god for their conduct therein  how then shall we show forth our thankfulness not only in our lips but in our lives  how but by believing that very principle that very truth which he has taught us and by which england stands that we are gods people and gods servants  he has indeed showed us what is good and our fathers before us and what does the lord require of us in return but to do the good which he has showed us to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with our god  oh my friends come frankly and joyfully to the lords table this day  confess your sins and shortcomings to him and entreat him to enable you to live more worthily of your many blessings  offer to him the sacrifice of your praise and thankfulness imperfect though it is and join with angels and archangels in blessing him for what he is and what he has been to you  and then receive your share of his most perfect sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving the bread and the wine which tell you that you are members of his church that his body gives you whatsoever life and strength your souls have that his blood washes out all your sins and shortcomings that his spirit shall be renewed in you day by day to teach you to do the good work which he has prepared already for you and to walk in the old paths which have led our forefathers and will lead us too i trust safe through the chances and changes of this mortal life and the fall of mighty kingdoms towards that perfect city of god which is eternal in the heavens    sermon xv  the life of god    ephesians iv 17 18  that ye walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart  you heard these words read in the epistle for today  i cannot expect that you all understood them  it is no shame to you that you did not  some of them are long and hard latin words  some of them though they are plain english enough are hard to understand because they have to do with deep matters which can only be understood by the help of gods spirit  and even with the help of gods spirit we cannot any of us expect to understand all which they mean  we cannot expect to be as wise as st paul for we must be as good as st paul before we can be as wise about goodness as he was  i do not pretend to understand all the text myself  no not half nor a tenth part of what it very likely means  but i do seem to myself to understand a little about it by the help and blessing of god and what little of it i do understand i will try to make you understand also  for the words in the text belong to you as much as to me or to st paul himself  what is true for one man is true for every man what is right for one man is right for every man  what god promises for one man he promises to every man  man or woman black or white rich or poor scholar or unlearned there is no respect of persons with him  in christ jesus says st paul there is neither male nor female slave nor freeman jew who fancies that gods promises belong to him alone or gentile who knows nothing about them clever learned greek or stupid ignorant barbarian  it is enough for god that we are all men and women bearing the flesh and blood and human nature which his son jesus christ wore on earth  if we are baptized we belong to him  if we are not baptized we ought to be for we belong to him just as much  every man may be baptized every man may be regenerate god calls all to his grace and adoption and holy baptism which is the sign and seal of his adoption and therefore what is right for the regenerate baptized man is right for the unregenerate unbaptized man for the christian and for the heathen there is but one way one duty one life for both and that is the life of god of which st paul speaks in the text  now of this life of god i will speak hereafter but i mention it now because it is the thing to which i wish to bring your thoughts before the end of the sermon  but first let us see what st paul means when he talks about the gentiles in his day  for that also has to do with us  i said that every man christian or heathen has the same duty and is bound to do the same right every man christian or heathen if he sins breaks his duty in the same way and does the same wrong  there is but one righteousness the life of god there is but one sin and that is being alienated from the life of god  one man may commit different sorts of sins from another one may lie another may steal  one may be proud another may be covetous  but all these different sins come from the same root of sin they are all flowers of the same plant  and st paul tells us what that one root of sin what that same devils plant is which produces all sin in christian or heathen in churchman or dissenter in man or woman the one disease from which has come all the sin which ever was done by man woman or child since the world was made  now what is this one disease to which every man you and i are all liable  why it is that we are every one of us worse than we ought to be worse than we know how to be and strangest of all worse than we wish and like to be  just as far as we are like the heathen of old we shall be worse than we know how to be  for we are all ready enough to turn heathens again at any moment my friends and the best christian in this church knows best that what i say is true that he is beset by the very same temptations which ruined the old heathens and that if he gave way to them a moment they would ruin him likewise  for what does st paul say was the matter with the old heathens  first he says their understanding was darkened  but what part of it  what was it that they had got dark about and could not understand  for in some matters they were as clever as we and cleverer  what part of their understanding was it which was darkened  st paul tells us in the first chapter of the epistle to the romans  it was their heartstheir reason as we should say it was about god and the life of god that they were dark  they had not been always dark about god but they were darkened they grew more and more dark about him generation after generation they gave themselves up more and more to their corrupt and fallen nature and so the children grew worse than their fathers and their children again worse than them till they had lost all notion of what god was like  for from the very first all heathens have had some notion of what god is like and have had a notion also which none but god could have given them that men ought to be like god god taught or if i may so speak tried to teach the heathen from the very first  if god had not taught them they would not have been to blame for knowing nothing of god  for as job says can man by searching find out god  surely not god must teach us about himself  never forget that man cannot find god god must show himself to man of his own free grace and will  god must reveal and unveil himself to us or we shall never even fancy that there is a god  and god did so to the heathen  even before the flood gods spirit strove with man and after the flood we read how the lord jesus christ the son of god revealed himself in many different ways to heathens  to pharaoh king of egypt in abrahams times and again to abimelech king of gerar and again to pharaoh and his servants in josephs time and to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and to cyrus king of persia and no doubt to thousands more indeed no man heathen or christian ever thought a single true thought or felt a single right feeling about god or man or mans duty to god and his neighbour unless god revealed it to him whether or not he also revealed himself to the man and showed him who it was who was putting the right thought into his mind  for every right thought and feeling about god and goodness and duty are the very voice of god himself the word of god whereof st john speaks and moses and the prophets speak speaking to the heart of sinful man to enlighten and to teach him  and therefore st paul says the sinful heathen were without excuse because he says that which may be known of god is manifest that is plain among them for god hath showed it to them  for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things which are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse  but these heathens he says did not like to retain god in their knowledge and when they knew god did not glorify him as god and changed the glory of the incorruptible god into the likeness of corruptible man and beasts and creeping things  and so they were alienated from the life of god that is they became strangers to gods life they forgot what gods life and character was like  or if they even did awake a moment and recollect dimly what god was like they hated that thought  they hated to think that god was what he was and shut their eyes and stopped their ears as fast as possible  and what happened to them in the meantime  what was the fruit of their wilfully forgetting what gods life was  st paul tells us that they fell into the most horrible sinssins too dreadful and shameful to be spoken of and that their common life even when they did not run into such fearful evils was profligate fierce and miserable  and yet st paul tells us all the while they knew the judgment of god that those who do such things are worthy of death  now we know that st paul speaks truth from the writings of heathens for god raised up from time to time even among the heathen greeks and romans witnesses for himself to testify of him and of his life and to testify against the sins of the world such men as socrates and plato among the greeks whose writings st paul knew thoroughly and whom i have no doubt he had in his mind when he wrote his first chapter of romans and told the heathen that they were without excuse  and among the romans also he raised up in the same way witnesses for himself such as juvenal and persius and others whom scholars know well  and to these men heathens though they were god certainly did teach a great deal about himself and gave them courage to rebuke the sins of kings and rich men even at the danger of their lives and to some of them he gave courage even to suffer martyrdom for the message which god had given them and which their neighbours hated to hear  and this was the message which god sent by them to the heathen  that god was good and righteous and that therefore his everlasting wrath must be awaiting sinners  they rebuked their heathen neighbours for those very same horrible crimes which st paul mentions and then they said as st paul does how you make your own sins worse by blasphemies against god  you sin yourselves and then to excuse yourselves you invent fables and lies about god and pretend that god is as wicked as you are in order to drug your own consciences by making god the pattern of your own wickedness  these men saw that man ought to be like god and they saw that god was righteous and good and they saw therefore that unrighteousness and sin must end in ruin and everlasting misery  so much god had taught them but not much more but to st paul he had taught more  those wise and righteous heathen could show their sinful neighbours that sin was death and that god was righteous but they could not tell them how to rise out of the death of sin into gods life of righteousness  they could preach the terrors of the law but they did not know the good news of the gospel and therefore they did not succeed they did not convert their neighbours to god  then came st paul and preached to the very same people and he did convert them to god for he had good news for them of things which prophets and kings had desired to see and had not seen them and to hear and had not heard them  for god who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke to the fathers by the prophets at last spoke to all men by a son his onlybegotten son the exact likeness of his father the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person  he sent him to be a man  very man of the substance of his mother the blessed virgin mary at the same time that he was very god of the substance of his father begotten before all worlds  and so god and the life of god was manifested in the flesh and reasonable soul of a man and from that time there is no doubt what the life of god is for the life of god is the life of jesus christ there is no doubt now what god is like for god is like jesus christ  no one can now say i cannot see god how then can you expect me to be like god for he who has seen jesus christ as his character stands in the gospels has seen god the father  no one can say now how can a man be like god and live a life like gods life for if any one of you say that i can answer him  a man can be like god you can be like god for there was once a man on earth jesus the son of the blessed virgin who was perfectly like god and if you answer but he was like god because he was god i can say and that is the very reason why you can be like god also  if jesus christ had been only a man you could no more become like him than you can become clever because another man is clever or strong because another man is strong  but because he was god the son of god he can give you to make you like god the same holy spirit which made him like god for that holy spirit proceeds from him the son as well as from the father and the father has committed all power to the son and therefore that same man christ jesus has power to change your heart and renew it and shape it to be like him and like his father by the power of his spirit that you may be like god as he was like god and live the life of god which he lived so that the lord jesus christ because he was a man like god showed that all men can become like god and because he was god very god of very god he is able to make all who come to him men like himself men like god and raise them up body and soul to the everlasting life of god that he may be the firstborn among many brethren  now what is this everlasting life of god which the lord jesus christ lived perfectly and which he can and will make every one of us live in proportion as we give up our hearts and wills to him and ask him to take charge of us and shape us and teach us  when we read that blessed story of him who was born in a stable and laid in a manger who went about doing good because god was with him who condescended of his own freewill to be mocked and scourged and spit upon and crucified that he might take away the sins of the whole world who prayed for his murderers and blest those who cursed himwhat sort of life does this life of god which he lived seem to us  is it not a life of love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness patience meekness  surely it is then that is the likeness of god  god is love  and the lord jesus life was a life of loveutter perfect untiring love  he did his fathers will perfectly because he loved men perfectly and to the death he died for those who hated him and so he showed forth to man the name and glory of god for god is love  the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost is love for love is justice and righteousness as it is written love worketh no ill to his neighbour  therefore love is the fulfilling of the law  and god is perfect love because he is perfect righteousness and perfect righteousness because he is perfect love for his love and his justice are not two different things two different parts of god as some say who fancy that gods justice had to be satisfied in one way and his love in another and talk of god as if his justice fought against his love and desired the death of a sinner and then his love fought against his justice and desired to save a sinner no wonder that those who hold such doctrines go further still and talk as if god the father desired to destroy mankind and would have done it if god the son had not interposed and suffered himself instead till they can fancy that they are christians and know god while they use the hideous words of a certain hymn which speaks of   the streaming drops of jesus blood which calmed the fathers frowning face   may god deliver and preserve us and our children from all such blasphemous fables which like the fables of the old heathen change the glory of the incorruptible god into the likeness of a corruptible man which deny the true faith that god has neither parts nor passions by talking of his love and his justice as two different things which confound his persons by saying that the son alone does what the father and the holy spirit do also while they divide his substance by making the will of the son different from the will of the father and deny that such as the father is such is the son and such is the holy ghost all three one perfect love and one perfect justice because they are all three one god and god is love and love is righteousness  believe me my friends this is no mere question of words which only has to do with scholars in their libraries it is a question the question of life and death for you and me and every living soul in this churchdo we know what the life of god is are we living it or are we alienated from it careless about it disliking it  for as i said at the beginning of my sermon we are all ready enough to turn heathens again and if we grow to forget or dislike the life of god we shall be heathen at heart  we may talk about him with our lips we may quarrel and curse each other about religious differences but let us make as great a profession as we may if we do not love the life of god we shall be heathen at heart and we shall sooner or later fall into sin  the heathens fell into sin just in proportion as their hearts were turned away from the life of god and so shall we  and how shall we know whether our hearts are turned away or whether they are right with god  thus what are the fruits of gods spirit what sort of life does the spirit of god make man live  for the spirit of god is god and therefore the life of god is the life which gods spirit makes men live and what is that a life of love and righteousness  the old heathens did not like such a life therefore they did not like to retain god in their knowledge  they knew that man ought to be like god  and st paul says they ought to have known what god was like that he was love for st paul told them he left not himself without witness in that he sent them rain and fruitful seasons filling their hearts with food and gladness  that was in st pauls eyes gods plainest witness of himselfthe sign that god was love making his sun shine on the just and on the unjust and good to the unthankful and the evilin one word perfect because he is perfect love  but they preferred to be selfish covetous envious revengeful delighting to indulge themselves in filthy pleasures to oppress and defraud each other  do you  for you can i can every baptized man can take his choice between the selfish life of the heathens and the loving life of god  we may either keep to the old pattern of man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts or we may put on the new pattern of man which is after gods likeness and founded upon righteousness and truthful holiness  every baptized man may choose  for he is not only bound to live the life of god  every man as the old heathen philosophers knew is bound to live it  but more  the baptized man can live it  that is the good news of his baptism  you can live the life of god for you know what the life of god isit is the life of jesus christ  you can live the life of god for the spirit of god is with you to cleanse your soul and life day by day till they are like the soul and life of christ  then you will be as the apostle says a partaker of a divine nature  thenand it is an awful thing to saya thing past hope past belief but i must say itfor it is in the bible it is the word of the blessed lord himself and of his beloved apostle st john  if a man love me he will keep my commandments and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our abode with him  and this is his commandment says st john that we should love one another  god is love and he who dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him  god is love  as i told you just now the heathens of old might have known that if they had chosen to open their eyes and see  but they would not see  they were dark cruel and unloving and therefore they fancied that god was dark cruel and unloving also  they did not love love and therefore they did not love god for god is love and therefore they did not love loving  they did not enjoy loving and so they lost the spirit of god which is the spirit of love and therefore they did not love each other but lived in hatred and suspicion and selfishness and darkness  they were but heathen but if even they ought to have known that god was love how much more we  for we know of a deed of gods love such as those poor heathen never dreamed of  god so loved the world that he gave his onlybegotten son to die for it  then god showed what his eternal life wasa life of love  then god showed what our eternal life is to know him who is love and jesus christ whom he sent to show forth his love  then god showed that it is the duty and in the power of every man to live the life of god the life of love for he sent forth into the world his spirit the spirit of love to fill with love the heart of every man and woman who sees that love is the image of god and longs to be loving and therefore longs to be like god as it is written blessed are those who hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled for righteousness is keeping christs commandment and christs commandment is that we love one another  and to those who long to do that gods spirit will come to fill them with love and where the spirit of god is there is also the father and there is also the son for gods substance cannot be divided as the athanasian creed tells us and blessed and cheering words they are and he who hath the holy spirit of love with him hath both the father and the son as it is written  if a man love me my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him  and then if we have god abiding with us and filling us with his eternal life what more do we need for life or death or eternity or eternities of eternities  for we shall live in and with and by god who can never die or change an everlasting life of love whereof st paul says that though prophecies shall fail and tongues shall cease and knowledge shall vanish away because all that we know now is but in part and all that we see now is through a glass darkly yet love shall never fail but abide for ever and ever    sermon xvi  gods offspring    galatians iv 7  wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ  i say writes st paul in the epistle which you heard read just now that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by his father  even so he says we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world  but when the fulness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under a law to redeem them that were under a law that we might receive the adoption of sons  when we were children  he is not speaking of the jews only for these galatians to whom he was writing were not jews at all any more than we are  he was speaking to men simply as men  he was speaking to the galatians as we have a right to speak to all men  nor does he mean merely when we were children in age  the greek word which he uses means infants people not come to years of discretion  indeed the word which he uses means very often a simpleton an ignorant or foolish person one who does not know who and what he is what is his duty or how to do it  now this he says was the state of men before christ came this is the state of all men by nature still the state of all poor heathens whether in england or in foreign countries  they are childrenthat is ignorant and unable to take care of themselves because they do not know what they are  st paul tells us what they are  that they are all gods offspring though they know it not  he likens them to young children who though they are their fathers heirs have no more liberty than slaves have but are kept under tutors and masters till they have arrived at years of discretion and are fit to take their places as their fathers sons and to go out into the world and have the management of their own affairs and a share in their fathers property which they may use for themselves instead of being merely fed and clothed by and kept in subjection to him whether they will or not  this is what he means by receiving the adoption of sons  he does not mean that we are not gods children till we find out that we are gods children  that is what some people say but that is the very exact contrary to what st paul used to say  he told the heathen athenians that they were gods children  he put them in mind that one of their own heathen poets had told them so and had said we are also gods offspring  and so in this chapter he says you were gods children all along though you did not know it  you were gods heirs all along although you differed nothing from slaves for as long as you were in your heathen ignorance and foolishness god had to treat you as his slaves not as his children and so you were in bondage under the elements of the world till the fulness of time was come  and then god sent his son born of a woman born under a law to redeem those who were under a lawthat is all mankind  the jews were keeping or pretending to keep moses law and trying to please god by that  the heathens were keeping all manner of old superstitious laws and customs about religion which their forefathers had handed down to them  but heathens and indeed jews too at that time all agreed in one thing  these laws and customs of theirs about religion all went upon the notion of their being gods slaves and not his children  they thought that god did not love them that they must buy his favours  they thought religion meant a plan for making god love them  then appeared the love of god in jesus christ  as at this very christmas time the son of god jesus christ the lord in whose likeness man was made at the beginning was born into the world to redeem us and all mankind  he told them of their heavenly father he preached to them the good news of the kingdom of god that god had not forgotten them did not hate them would freely forgive them all that was past and why  because he was their father and loved them and loved them so that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for them  and now god looks at us human beings not as we are in ourselves sinful and corrupt but he looks at us in the light of jesus christ who has taken our nature upon him and redeemed it and raised it up again so that god can look on it now without disgust and henceforth no one need be ashamed of being a man for to be a man is to be in the likeness of god  man was created in the image and likeness of god and who is the image and likeness of god but jesus christ  therefore man was created at first in jesus christ and now as st paul says he is created anew in jesus christ and now to be a man is to partake of the same flesh and blood which the lord jesus christ wore for us when he was made very man of the substance of his mother and that without spot of sin to show that man need not be sinful that man was meant by god to be holy and pure from sin and that by the holy spirit of jesus christ we every one of us can become pure from sin  this is the blessedness of christmasday  that one man at least has been born into the world spotless and free from sin that he might be the firstborn of many brethren  this is the good news of christmasday that now in christs light and for christs sake our father looks on us as his sons and not his slaves  therefore is every child who comes into the world baptized freely into the name of god  baptism is a sign and warrant that god loves that child that god looks on it as his child not for itself or its own sake but because it belongs to jesus christ who by becoming a man redeemed all mankind and made them his property and his brothers  therefore every child when it is brought to be baptized promises by its godfathers and godmothers repentance and faith when it comes to years of understanding  it is not gods slave as the beasts are  it is gods child  but god does not wish it to remain merely his child under tutors and governors forced to do what is right outwardly and whether it likes or not  god wishes each of us to become his son his grownup and reasonable son  to know who we areto work in his kingdom for himto guide and manage our own wills and hearts and lives in obedience to himto claim and take our share as men of god of the inheritance which he has given us  and that we can only do by faith in jesus christ  we must trust in him our lord our king our saviour our pattern  we must confess that we are nothing in ourselves that we owe all to him  we must follow in his footsteps giving up our wills to gods will doing not our own works but the good works which god has prepared for us to walk in and then we shall be truly confirmed not mere children of god under tutors governors schoolmasters and lawgivers but free reasonable willing hearty christians perfect men of god the sons of god without rebuke  oh my friends will you claim your share in the spirit of god whom the lord bought for us with his precious blood that spirit who was given you at your baptism which may be daily renewed in you if you pray for it who will strengthen and lift you up to lead lives worthy of your high calling  or will you like esau of old despise your birthright and neglect to pray that gods spirit may be renewed in you and so lose more and more day by day the thought that god is your father and the love of holy and godlike things alas take care that like esau you hereafter find no room for repentance though you seek it carefully with tears  it is a fearful thing to despise the mercies of the living god and when you are called to be his sons to fall back under the terrors of his law in slavish fears and a guilty conscience and remorse which cannot repent  and do not give way to false humility says st paul  do not say this is too high an honour for us to claim  do not say it seems too conceited and assuming for us miserable sinners to call ourselves sons of god  we shall please god better and show ourselves more reverent to him by calling ourselves his slaves and crouching and trembling before him as if we expected him to strike us dead and making all sorts of painful and tiresome religious observances and vain repetitions of prayers to win his favour or by saying we dare not call ourselves gods children yet we are not spiritual enough but when we have gone through all the necessary changes of heart and frames and feeling and have been convinced of sin and converted and received the earnest gods spirit by which we cry abba father then we shall have a right to call ourselves gods children  not so says st paul all through this very epistle to the galatians  that is not being reverent to god  it is insulting him for it is despising the honour which he has given you and trying to get another honour of your own invention by observances and frames and feelings of your own  do not say when we have received the earnest of gods spirit by which we can cry abba father then we shall become gods children for it is just because you are gods children alreadyjust because you have been gods children all along that god has taught you to call him father  the lord jesus christ told men that god was their father not merely to the apostles but to poor ignorant sinful wretches publicans and harlots he spoke of their father in heaven who because he is a perfect father sends his sun to shine on the evil and the good and his rain to fall on the just and on the unjust the lord jesus christ taught menall men not merely saints and apostles but all men when they prayedto begin our father  he told them that that was the manner in which they were to pray and therefore no other way of praying can we expect god to hear  no slavish terrified superstitious coaxing and flattering will help you with god  he has told you to call him your father and if you speak to him in any other way you insult him and trample under foot the riches of his grace  this is the good news which the bible preaches  this is the witness of gods spirit proclaiming that we are the sons of god and says st paul in another place our spirit witnesses to that glorious news as well  we feel we knowwhy we cannot tell but we feel and know that we are the sons of god  when we are most calm most humble most free from illtemper and selfconceit most busy about our rightful work then the feeling comes over usi have a father in heaven  and that feeling gives us a strength a peace a sure trust and hope which no other thought can give  yes we are ready to say i may be miserable and unfortunate but the great god of heaven and earth is my father and what can happen to me  i may be borne down with the remembrance of my great sins i may find it almost too hard to fight against all my bad habits but the great god who made heaven and earth is my father and i am his son  he will forgive me for the past he will help me to conquer for the future  if i do but remember that i am gods son and claim my fathers promises neither the world nor the devil nor my own sinful flesh can ever prevail against me  this thought and the peace which it brings st paul tells us is none of our own we did not put it into our own hearts from god it comes that blessed thought that he is our father  we could never have found it out for ourselves  it is the spirit of the son of god the spirit of the lord jesus christ which gives us courage to say our father which art in heaven which makes us feel that those words are true and must be true and are worth all other words in the world put togetherthat god is our father and we his sons  oh my friends believe earnestly this blessed news the news of christmasday that you are not gods slaves but his sons heirs of god and jointheirs with christjointheirs with christ  in what  who can tell  but what an inheritance of glory and bliss that must be which the lord jesus christ himself is to inherit with usan inheritance such as eye hath not seen and incorruptible undefiled and that fadeth not away preserved in heaven for us an inheritance of all that is wise loving noble holy peacefulall that can make us happy all that can make us like god himself  oh what can we expect if we neglect so great salvation  what can we expect if when the great god of heaven and earth tells us that we are his children we turn away and fall down become like the brutes and the savages or worse like the evil spirits who rebel against god instead of growing up to become the sons of god perfect even as our father in heaven is perfect  may he keep us all from that great sin  may he awaken each and every one of you to know the glory and honour which jesus christ brought for you when he was born at bethlehemthe glory and honour which was proclaimed to belong to you when you were christened at that font  may he awaken you to know that you are the sons of god and to look up to him with loving trustful obedient souls saying from your hearts morning and night our father which art in heaven and feeling that those words give you daily strength to conquer your sins and feel assurance of hope that your heavenly father will help and prosper you his family every time you struggle to obey his commandments and follow the example of his perfect and spotless son jesus christ the lord    sermon xvii  death in life    romans viii 12 13  brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh  for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live  does it seem strange to you that st paul should warn you that you are not debtors to your own flesh  it is not strange when you come to understand him certainly not unnecessary  for as in his time so now most people do live as if they were debtors to their own flesh as if their great duty their one duty in life was to please their own bodies and brains and tempers and fancies and feelings  poor people have not much time to indulge their brains and no time at all happily for them to indulge their fancies and feelings as rich people do when they grow idle and dainty and luxurious  but still too many of them live as if they were debtors to their own flesh as if their own bodies and their own tempers were the masters of them and ought to be their masters  young men for instance how often they do things in secret of which it is a shame even to speak just because it is pleasant  young women how often do they sell themselves and their own modesty just for the pleasure of being flattered and courted and of getting a few fine clothes  how often do men just for the pleasure of drink besot their souls and bodies madden their tempers neglect their families make themselves every saturday night and often half the week too lower than the beasts which perish  and then when a clergyman complains of them they think him unreasonable and by so thinking show that he is right and st paul right  for if i say to you my dear young people and i do say it if you give way to filthy living and filthy talking and to drunkenness and to vanity about fine clothes you will surely diedo you not say in your hearts how unreasonable  how hard on us  if we can enjoy ourselves a little why should we not  it is our right and do it we will and if it is wrong it ought not to be wrong  why what is that but saying that you ought to do just what your body likes that you are debtors to your flesh and that your flesh and not gods law is your master  so again when people grow older perhaps they are more prudent about bad living and more careful of their money  but still they live after the flesh  one man sets his heart on making money and cares for nothing but that breaks gods law for that as if that was the thing to which he was a debtor bound by some law which he could not avoid to scrape and scrape money together for ever  another and how often we see that is a slave to his own pride and temper which are just as much bred in his flesh  if he has been injured by any one if he has taken a dislike against any one he cannot forget and forgive  the man may be upright and kindly on many other points prudent too and sober and thoroughly master of himself on most matters and yet you will find that when he gets on that one point he is not master of himself for his flesh is master of him  he may be a strongminded shrewd man upon most matters but just that one point  some old quarrel or grudge or suspicion is as we say his weak point and if you touch on that the mans eye will kindle and his face redden and his lip tremble and he will show that he is not master of himself  but that he is overmastered by his fleshly passion by the suspiciousness or revengefulness or touchiness which every dumb animal has as well as he which is not part of his mans nature not part of gods image in him but which is like the beasts which perish  now my friends suppose i said to you if you give way to such tempers if you give way to pride suspicion sullen spite settled dislike of any human being you will surely die should you not some of you be inclined to think me very unreasonable and to say in your hearts have i not a right to be angry  have i not a right to give a man as good as he brings so confessing that i am right after all and that some of you think that you are debtors to your flesh and its tempers and do not see that you are meant to be masters and not slaves of your tempers and feelings  again  among poor women as well as among rich ones as they grow older how much gossiping talebearing slandering there is and that too among people who call themselves religious  yes i say slandering i put that in too for i am certain that where the first two grow the third is not far off  if gossiping is the root tale bearing and harsh judgment is the stem and plain lying and slandering and bearing false witness against ones neighbour is the fruit  now i say because st paul says it that those who do such things shall surely die  and do not some of you think me unreasonable in that and say in your heart what are we to be tonguetied  shall we not speak our minds  be it so my good women only remember this  that as long as you say that you confess that you are not masters of your tongues but your tongues are masters of you and that you freely confess you owe service to your tongue and not to god  do not therefore complain of me for saying the very same thing namely that you think you are debtors to your fleshto the tongues in your mouths and must needs do what those same little unruly members choose of which st james has said the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity and it sets on fire the whole course of nature and is set on fire of hell  and again  if any person among you seem to be religious and bridles not his tongue but deceives himself that persons religion is vain  againand my good women you must not think me hard on you for you know in your hearts that i am not hard on you but i must speak a word on a sin which i am afraid is growing in this parish and in too many parishes in england and that is deceiving kind and charitable persons in order to get more help from them  god knows the temptation must be sore to poor people at times  and yet you will surely find in the long run that honesty is the best policy deceit is always a losing game  a lie is sure to be found out as the lord jesus himself says there is nothing hid which shall not be made manifest and what we do in secret is sure unless we repent and amend it to be proclaimed on the housetop  and many a poor soul in her haste and greediness to get much ends by getting nothing at all  and if it were not soif you were able to deceive any human being out of the riches of the world  yet know that a mans life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses  and know that if you will not believe thatif you will fancy that your business is to get all you can for your mortal bodies by fair means or foulif you will fancy that you are thus debtors to your own flesh you will surely die  but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live  and by this time some of you are asking live  die  what does all this mean  when we die we shall die good or bad and in the meantime we shall live till we die  and you do not mean to tell us that we shall shorten our lives by our own tempers or our tale bearing though we might perhaps by drunkenness  my friends if such a question rises in your mind be sure that it too is a hint that you think yourself a debtor to the fleshto live according to the flesh  for tell me tell yourselves fairly is your flesh your body the part of yourself which you can see and handle youyou know that it is not  when a neighbours body dies you say perhaps he is dead but you say it carelessly and when one whom you know well and love dieswhen a parent a wife a child dies you feel very differently about them even if you do not speak differently  you feel and know that he the person whom you loved and understood and felt with and felt for here on earth is not dead at all you feel and in proportion as the friend you have lost was loving and good and full of feeling for you you feel it all the more strongly that your friend or your child or the wife of your bosom is alive stillwhere you know not but you feel they are alive that they are very near youthat they are thinking of you watching you caring for youperhaps grieving over you when you go wrongperhaps rejoicing over you when you go rightperhaps helping you though you cannot see them in some wonderful way  you know that only their mortal flesh is dead  that their mortal flesh was all you put into the grave but that they themselves their souls and spirits which were their very and real selves are alive for evermore and you trust and hope to meet them when you dieay to meet them body and soul too at the last day the very same persons whom you knew here on earth though the flesh which they wore here in this life has crumbled into dust years and ages before  is not this true  is not this a blessed lifegiving thoughti had almost said the most blessed and lifegiving thought man can have that those whom we have loved and lost are not dead but only gone before that they live still to god and with god that only their flesh has perished and they themselves are alive for evermore  now believe me my friends as surely as a mans flesh can die and be buried while he himself his soul lives for ever just so a mans self his soul can die while his flesh lives on upon earth you do not think so but the bible thinks so  the bible talks of men being dead in trespasses and sins while their flesh and body is alive and walking this earth  it talks too of a worse state of men twice dead of men who after god has brought their souls to life let those souls of theirs die down again within them and rot away as far as we can see hopelessly and for ever  and what is it which kills a mans soul within him on this side the grave and makes him dead while he has a name to live  sin evildoing the disease of the soul the death of the soul yea the death of the man himself  and what is sin but living according to the flesh and not according to the spirit  what is sin but living as the dumb animals do as if we were debtors to our own flesh to fulfil its lusts and to please our own appetites fancies and tempers instead of remembering that we are debtors to god who made us and blesses us all day longdebtors to our lord jesus christ who bought us with his own blood that we might please him and obey himdebtors to gods holy spirit who puts into our minds good desiresdebtors to our baptism vows in which we were consecrated to god that he and not this flesh of ours might be our master for ever  this is sin to give way to those selfish and evil tempers against which i warned you in the beginning of my sermon and which if any man indulges in them will surely and steadily bit by bit kill that mans soul within him and leave the man dead in trespasses and sins while his body walks this earth  my friends do not fancy these are merely farfetched words out of a book made to sound difficult and terrible in order to frighten you god forbid  when scripture says this it speaks a plain and simple truth and one which i know to be a truth from experience  i speak that which i know and testify that which i have seen  i have seen and what sadder or more fearful sight dead men and dying walk this earth in flesh and blood men busy enough shrewd enough upon some points priding themselves perhaps upon their cleverness and knowledge of the world of whom all one could say was the man is dead the man is lost unless god brings him to life again by his quickening spirit  for goodness is dead in him the powers of his soul are dead in him the hope of being a better man is dead in him all that god wishes to see him be and do is dead gods likeness and glory in him is dead  he thinks himself wise and he is a fool in gods sight for he sees not gods law which is the only wisdom he thinks himself strong but he is utterly weak and helpless for he is the slave of his own tempers the slave of his own foul lust the slave of his own pride and vanity the slave of his own covetousness  oh my friends people are apt to be afraid of what they call seeing a ghostthat is a spirit without a body  they fancy that it would be a very shocking thing to meet one but as for me i know a far more dreadful sight and that is a careless and a hardened sinnera body without a spirit  which is uglier and ghastliera spirit without a body or a body without a spirit  and yet such one meets i dare not think how often  what sadder sight if you recollect that men need not be thus that god hates seeing them thus that they become thus and die down in sin in spite of god with all heaven above and god the lord thereof crying to them why wilt thou die  what sadder sight  how many have i seen living to all intents and purposes as if they had no souls as if there were no god no law of god no right no wrong caring for nothing perhaps but drink and bad women or caring for nothing but scraping together a little more money than their neighbours or caring for nothing but dress and vanity and gossiping and talebearing and yet when one came to know them one saw that that was not what god intended them to be that he had given them hearts which they had hardened good feelings which they had crushed sound brains which they had left idle till one was ready to weep over them as over something beautiful and noble ruined and lost and looked on them as one would on a grand tree struck by lightning decayed and dead useless and only fit to be burned with just enough of its proper shape to show what a tree it ought to have been  and so it is with men and women  hardly a day passes but one sees some one of whom one says with a sigh what a worthy loveable useful person that might have been what a blessing to himself and all around him and now by following his fallen nature and indulging it he is neither worthy nor loveable nor useful neither a blessing to himself nor to any human being he might have been good for so much and now he is good for nothing for the spirit the immortal soul which god gave him is dead within him  my friends i would not say this unless i could say more  i would not say sad words if i could not follow them up by joyful and hopeful ones  it is written if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but it is written also if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live  it is promisedpromised my friends awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light  through the spirit through gods spirit every soul here can live now and for ever  through gods spirit christ not only can but will give you light  and that spirit is near you with you  your baptism is the blessed sign the everlasting pledge that gods spirit is with you  oh believe that and take heart  i will not say you do not know how much good there is in you for in us dwells no good thing and every good thought and feeling comes only from the spirit of god  but i will say boldly to every one of you you do not know how much good there may be in you if you will listen to those good thoughts of gods spirit you do not know how wise how right how strong how happy how useful you may become you do not know what a blessing each of you may become to yourselves and to all around you  only make up your mind to live by gods law only make up your mind in all things small and great to go gods way and not your own  only make up your mind to listen not to your own flesh temper and brain which say this and that is pleasant but to listen to gods spirit which says this is right and that is wrong  this is your duty do it  search out your own besetting sins and if you cannot find them out for yourself ask god to show you them ask him to give you truth in the inward parts and make you to understand wisdom in the secret places of your heart  pray gods spirit to quicken your soul and bring it to life that it may see and love what is good and see and hate what is wrong and instead of being most hard on your neighbours sin to which you are not tempted be most hard on your own sin on the sin to which you are most tempted whatsoever that may be  you have your besetting sin doubt it not every one has  i know that i have  i know that i have inclinations tempers longings to which if i gave way my soul would rot and die within me and make me a curse to myself and you and every one i came near and all i can do is to pray gods spirit to help me to fight those besetting sins of mine and crush them and stamp them down whenever they rise and try to master me and make me live after the flesh  it is a hard fight and may god forgive me for i fight it ill enough  but it is my only hope for my souls life my only hope of remaining a man worth being called a man or doing my duty at all by myself and you and all mankind and it is your only hope too  pray for gods spirit gods strength gods life to give your souls life day by day that you may fight against your sins whatsoever they are lest they kill your souls long before disease and old age kill your bodies  make up your minds to it  make up your minds to mortify the deeds of the body to say to your own bodies tempers longings fancies i will not go your way  you shall go gods way  i am not your debtor i owe you nothing i am gods debtor and owe him everything and i will pay him honestly with the service of my body soul and spirit i will do my duty and you my flesh must and shall do it also whether it is pleasant at first or not and be sure it will be pleasant at last if not at first  keep god always before your eyes  ask yourself in every action what is right what is my duty what would god have me do  and so far from finding it unpleasant you will find that you are saving yourself a thousand troubles and sorrows and petty anxieties which now torment you you will find that in gods presence is life the only life worth having and that at his right hand are pleasures for evermore  oh be sure my friends that in real happiness you will not lose but gain without end  if to have a clear conscience and a quiet mind if to be free from anxiety and discontent free from fear and shame if to be loved respected looked up to by all whose good word is worth having and to know that god approves of you that all day long god is with you and you with god that his loving and mighty arms are under you that he has promised to keep you in all your ways to prosper all you do and reward you for everif this be not happiness my friends what is    sermon xviii  shame    romans x 11  for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed  my friends what this text really means is one thing what we may choose to think it means is another thingperhaps a very different thing  i will try and show you what i believe it really means  whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed  it seems as if st paul thought that not being ashamed had to do with salvation and being saved ay that they were almost the same thing  for he says just before if thou doest so and so thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed as if being ashamed was the very thing from which we were to be saved  and certainly that wise and great man whoever he was some say he was st ambrose bishop of milan in italy who wrote the te deum thought the same for how does he end the te deum  o lord in thee have i trusted  let me never be confounded that is brought to shame  you see after he has spoken of god and the everlasting glory of god of cherubim and seraphim that is all the powers of the earth and the powers of the heavens of apostles prophets martyrs the holy church all praising god and crying holy holy holy  lord god of hosts heaven and earth are full of the majesty of thy glory after he has spoken of the mystery of the trinity father and son and holy ghost of christs redemption and incarnation and ascension and glory of his judging the world of his government and his lifting up his people for ever after he has prayed god to keep them this day without sin and to let his mercy lighten upon them after all this at the end of this glorious hymn all that he has to say is o lord in thee have i trusted  let me never be confoundedall he has to say  but that is a great deal he does not say that merely because he wants to say something more and has nothing else to say  not so  in all great hymns and writings like this the end is almost sure to be the strongest part of all to have the very pith and marrow of the whole matter in it as i believe this end of the te deum has and i believe that whoever wrote it thought that being confounded and brought to shame was just the most horrible and wretched thing which could happen to him or any man and the thing above all others from which he was most bound to pray god to save him and every human being  now how is this  first let us look at what coming to shame is and next how believing in christ will save us from it  now every man and woman of us here who has one spark of good feeling in them will surely agree that coming to shame is dreadful and that there is no pain or torment on earth like the pain of being ashamed of oneself  nothing so painful  and i will prove it to you  you call a man a brave man if he is afraid of nothing  but there is one thing the very bravest man is afraid of and that is of disgrace of coming to shame  ay my friends so terrible is the torment of shame that you may see brave menmen who would face death in battle men who would have a limb cut off without a groan you may see such in spite of all their courage gnash their teeth and writhe in agony and weep bitter tears simply because they are ashamed of themselves so terrible and unbearable is the torment of shame  it may drive a man to do good or evil  it may drive him to do good as when rather than come to shame and be disgraced soldiers will face death in battle willingly and cheerfully and do deeds of daring beyond belief  or it may drive him to do evil rather than come to shame men have killed themselves choosing unhappy and mistaken men rather to face the torment of hell than the torment of disgrace  they are mistaken enough god knows  but shame like all powerful things will work for harm as well as for good and just as a wholesome and godly shame may be the beginning of a mans repentance and righteousness so may an unwholesome and ungodly shame be the cause of his despair and ruin  but judge for yourselves think over your past lives  were you ever oncewere it but for five minutes utterly ashamed of yourself  if you were did you ever feel any torment like that  in all other misery and torment one feels hope one says still life is worth having and when the sorrow wears away i shall be cheerful and enjoy myself again but when one has come to shame when one is not only disgraced in the eyes of other people but disgraced which is a thousand times worse in ones own eyes when one feels that people have real reason to despise one then one feels for the time as if life was not worth having as if one did not care whether one died or not or what became of one  and yet as if dying would do one no good change of place would do one no good times running on would do one no good as if what was done could not be undone and the shame would be with one still and torment one still wherever one was and if one was to live a million years  ay that it would be everlasting  one feels in a word that real shame and deserved disgrace is verily and indeed an everlasting torment  and it is this and the feeling of this which explains why poor wretches will kill themselves as judas iscariot did and rush into hell itself under the horror and pain of shame and disgrace  they feel a hell within them so hot that they actually fancy that they can be no worse off beyond the grave than they are on this side of it  they are mistaken  but that is the reason the misery of disgrace is so intolerable that they are willing like that wretched judas to try any mad and desperate chance to escape it  so much for shames being a dreadful and horrible thing  but again it is a spiritual thing  it grows and works not in our fleshly bodies but in our spirits our consciences our immortal souls you may see this by thinking of people who are not afraid of shame you do not respect them or think them the better for that  not at all  if a man is not afraid of shame if a man when he is found out and exposed and comes to shame does not care for it but brazens out his own shame as we say we do not call him brave we call him what he is a base impudent person lost to all good feeling  why what harder name can we call any man or woman than to say that they are shameless dead to shame  we know that it is the very sign of their being dead in sin the very sign of gods spirit having left them that till they are made to feel shame there is no hope of their mending or repenting or of any good being put into them or coming out of them  so that this feeling of shame is a spiritual feeling which has to do with a mans immortal soul with his conscience and the voice of god in his heart  now consider this  that there will surely come to you and me and every living soul a day of judgment a day in which we shall be judged  think honestly of those two words  first a day not a mere time much less a night  now in a day there is light by which men can see and a sun in heaven which shows all things clearly  in that day that brightest and clearest of all days we shall see what we really have been and what we really have done and for aught we know every one round us every one with whom we have ever had to do will see it also  the secrets of all our hearts will be disclosed and we shall stand before heaven and earth simply for what we are and neither more nor less  that is a fearful thought  shall we come to shame in that day  and it will be a day of judgment  in it we shall be judged  i do not mean merely condemned for we may be acquitted  or punished for we may be rewarded those things come after being judged  first let us think of what being judged is  a judges business is to decide on what we have done or whether we have broken the law or not to hear witnesses for us and against us to sum up the evidence and set forth the evidence for us and the evidence against us  and our judge will be the son of man the lord jesus christ who is sharper than a twoedged sword piercing through the very joints and marrow and discerning the secret intents of the heart neither is anything hid from him for all things are naked and open in the sight of him with whom we have to do  with whom we have to do mind  not merely with whom we shall have to do for he sees all now he knows all now  ever since we were born there has not been a thought in our heart but he has known it altogether  and he is utterly justno respecter of persons like his own wisdom without partiality and without hypocrisy  o lord who shall stand in that day  o lord if thou be extreme to mark what is done amiss who shall abide it  o lord in thee have i trusted  let me never be confounded  for this is being confounded this is shame itself  this is the intolerable horrible hellish shame and torment wherein is weeping and gnashing of teeth this is the everlasting shame and contempt to which as daniel prophesied too many should awake in that dayto be found guilty in that day before god and christ before our neighbours and our relations and worst of all before ourselves worst of all i say before ourselves  it would be dreadful enough to have all the bad things we ever did or thought told openly against us to all our neighbours and friends and to see them turn away from usdreadful to find out at last what we forget all day long that god knows them already but more dreadful to know them all ourselves and see our sins in all their shamefulness in the light of god as god himself sees themmore dreadful still to see the loving god and the loving christ turn away from usbut most dreadful of all to turn away from ourselves to be utterly discontented with ourselves ashamed of ourselves to see that all our misery is our own fault that we have been our own enemies to despise ourselves and hate ourselves for ever to try for ever to get rid of ourselves and escape from ourselves as from some ugly and foul place in which we were ashamed to be seen for a moment and yet not to be able to get rid of ourselves  yes that will be the true misery of a lost soul to be ashamed of itself and hate itself  who shall deliver a man from the body of that death  i thank god through jesus christ our lord  i thank god that at least now here in this life we can be delivered  there is but one hope for us all one way for us all not to come to utter shame and this is in the lord jesus christ who has said though your sins be red as scarlet they shall be white as wool and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more  one hope to cast ourselves utterly on his boundless love and mercy and cry to him blot these sins of mine out of thy book by thy most precious blood which is a full atonement for the sins of the whole world and blot them out of my heart by thy holy spirit that i may hate them and renounce them and flee from them and give them up and be thy servant and do thy work and have thy righteousness and do righteous things like thee  and then my friends how or why we cannot understand but it is gods own promise who cannot lie that he will really and actually forgive these sins of ours and blot them out as if we had never done them and give us clean hearts and right spirits to live new lives right lives lives like his own life so that our past sinful lives shall be behind us like a dream and we shall find them forgotten and forgiven in the day of judgmentwonderful mercy but listen to itit is gods own promiseif the wicked man turneth away from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die  all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned to him  in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live  they shall not be mentioned to him  my friends if as i have been showing the great misery the great horror of all is having our sins mentioned to us in that day and being made utterly ashamed by them what greater mercy can we want than thisnot to have them mentioned to us and not to come to shame not to be plagued for ever with the hideous ghosts of our past bad thoughts bad words bad deeds coming all day long to stare us in the face and cry to us while the accusing devil holds them up to us as if in a looking glasslook at your own picture  this is what you are  this fool this idler this mean covetous hardhearted man who cared only for himselfthis stupid man who never cared to know his duty or do his dutythis proud passionate revengeful man who returned evil for evil took his brothers by the throat and exacted from them the uttermost farthingthis ridiculous foolish useless disagreeable unlovely unlovable person who went through the world neither knowing what he ought to do nor whither he was going but was utterly blind and in a dream this person is you yourself  look at your own likeness and be confounded and utterly ashamed for ever  what greater misery than that  what greater blessing than to escape that  what greater blessing than to be able to answer the accusing devil not so liar  this is not my likeness  this ugly ridiculous hateful person is not i  i was such a one once but i am not now  i am another man now and god knows that i am though you may try to shame me by telling me that i am the same man  i was wrong but i am right now i was as a sheep going astray but now i am returned to the shepherd and overseer of my soul to whom i belonged all the while and now i am right in the right road for with the heart i have believed god unto righteousness and he has given me a clean heart and a right spirit and has purged me and will purge me till i am clean and washed me till i am whiter than snow i do not deny one of my old sins i did them i know that i confess them to thee now oh accusing devil but i confessed them to god ay and to man too long ago and by confessing them to him i was saved from them for with the mouth confession is made unto salvation  and what is more i have not only confessed my own sins but i have confessed christs righteousness and i confess it now i confess i say that christ is perfectly righteous and good the perfect pattern of what i ought to be and because he is perfectly good he does not wish to see me remain bad and sinful that he may taunt me and torment me with my sins as thou the accusing devil dost  but he wishes to make me and every man good like himself blest like himself and he can do it and will do it if we will but give up our hearts to him and i have given up my heart to him  all i ask of him is to be made good and kept good set right and kept right and i can trust in him utterly to do that for he is faithful and just to forgive me my sins and cleanse me from all unrighteousness  therefore accuse me not devil for thou hast no share in me  i belong to christ and not to thee  and set not my old sins before my face for god has set them behind his back because i have renounced them and sworn an oath against them and christ has nailed them to his cross and now they are none of mine and none of thine but are cast long ago into the everlasting fire of god and burnt up and done with for ever and i am a new man and gods man and he has justified me and will justify me and make me just and right and neither thou nor any man has a right to impute to me my past sins for god does not impute them to me and neither thou nor any man has a right to condemn me for god has justified me  and if it please god to humble me more for i know i want humbling every day and to show me more how much i owe to himif it please him i say to bring to light any of my past sins i shall take it patiently as a wholesome chastening of my heavenly fathers and i trust to all gods people and to angels and the spirits of just men made perfect that they will look on my past sins as god looks on them mercifully and lovingly as things past and dead forgiven and blotted out of gods book by the precious blood of christ and look on me as i am in christ not having any righteousness of my own but christs righteousness which comes by the inspiration of his own holy spirit  thus my friends we may answer the devil when he stands up to accuse us and confound us in the day of judgment  thus we may answer him now when in melancholy moments he sets our sins before our face and begins taunting us and crying see what a wretch you are what a hypocrite too  what would all the world think of you if they knew as much against you as i do  what would the world think of you if they saw into that dirty heart of yours  for we can answer himwhatever the world would think i know what god himself thinks  he thinks of me as of a son who after wasting his substance and feeding on husks with the swine has come home to his fathers house and cried father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son and i know that that same good heavenly father instead of shaming me reproaching me shutting his doors against me has seen me afar off and taken me home again without one harsh word and called to all the angels in heaven saying it is meet that we rejoice and be glad for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found  and while almighty god who made heaven and earth is saying that of me it matters little what the lying devil may say  only only if you be wandering from your fathers house come home if you be wrong entreat to be made right  if you are in your fathers house stay there if you are right pray and struggle to keep right if the old account is blotted out then for your souls sake run up no fresh account to stand against you after all in the day of judgment if you have the hope in you of not coming to shame you must purify yourselves even as god is pure if you believe really with your heart you must believe unto righteousness that is you must trust god to make you righteous and good  there is no use trusting him to make you anything else for he will make you nothing else being good himself he will only make you good  but as for trusting in him to leave you bad to leave you quiet in your sins and then to save you after all that is trusting that god will do a most unjust and what is more a most cruel thing to you that is trusting god to do the devils work that is a blasphemous false trust which will be utterly confounded in the day of judgment and will cover you with double shame  the whole question for each of us is do we believe unto righteousness  is righteousness what we want  is to be made good men what we want  if not no confessing with the mouth will be unto salvation for how can a man be saved in his sins  if an animal is diseased can it be saved from dying without curing the disease  if a tree be decayed can it be saved from dying without curing the decay  if a man be bad and sinful can he be saved from eternal death without curing his badness and sinfulness  how can a man be saved from his sins but by becoming sinless  as well ask can a man be saved from his sins without being saved from his sins  but if you wish really to be saved from your sins and taken out of them and cured of them that you may be made good men righteous men useful men just men loving men godlike menthen trust in god for that and you will find that your trust will be unto righteousness for you will become righteous men and confess god with your mouth for that saying i believe in god my father i believe in jesus christ his son who died and rose and ascended on high for me i believe in gods holy spirit which is with me to make me right and your confession will be unto salvation for you will be saved from your sins  always say to yourself this one thing good i will become whatever it cost me and in gods goodness i trust to make me good for i am sure he wishes to see me good more than i do myself and you will find that because you have confessed in that best and most honest of ways that god is good and have so given him real glory and real honour and real praise he will save you from the sins which torment you  and that because you have really trusted in him you shall never come either in this world or the world to come to that worst misery the being ashamed of yourself    sermon xix  forgiveness    psalm li 16 17  thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it  thou delightest not in burnt offering  the sacrifice of god is a broken spirit  a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise  you all heard just now the story of nathan and david and you must have all felt how beautiful and noble and just it was how it declares that there is but one everlasting gods law of justice which is above all men even the greatest and that what is right for the poor man is right for the king upon his throne for god is no respecter of persons  and you must have admired too the frankness and fulness and humbleness of davids repentance and liked and loved the man still in spite of his sins as much almost as you did when you heard of him as a shepherd boy slaying the giant or a wanderer and an outlaw among the hills and forests of judaea  but did it now seem strange to you that davids repentance which was so complete when it did come should have come no sooner  did he need nathan to tell him that he had done wrong  he seduced another mans wife and that man one of his most faithful servants one of the most brave and loyal generals of his army and then over and above his adultery he had plotted the mans death and had had him killed and put out of the way in as base and ungrateful and treacherous a fashion as i ever heard of  his whole conduct in the matter had been simply villanous  there is no word too bad for it and do you fancy that he had to wait the greater part of a year before the thought came into his head that that was not the fashion in which a man ought to behave much more a kingthat gods blessing was not on such doings as thoseand after all not find out for himself that he was wrong but have to be told of it by nathan  surely if he had any common sense any feeling of right and wrong left in him he must have known that he had done a bad thing and his guilty conscience must have tormented him many a time and oft during those months long before nathan came to him  now that he had the feeling of right and wrong left in him we cannot doubt for when nathan told him the parable of the rich man who spared all his own flocks and herds and took the poor mans one ewe lamb his heart told him that that was wrong and unjust and he cried out the man who has done this thing shall surely die  and surely that feeling of right and wrong could not have been quite asleep in him all those months and have been awakened then for the first time  but more if we look at two psalms which he wrote about that time we shall find that his conscience had not been dead in him but had been tormenting him bitterly and that he had been trying to escape from it and afterwards to repentonly in a wrong way  if we look at the thirtysecond psalm we shall see there he had begun by trying to deceive himself to excuse himself before god but that had only made him the more miserable  when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my daily complaining  for thy hand was heavy on me night and day  my moisture was turned to the drought of summer  then he had tried sacrifices  he had fancied i suppose that he could make god pleased with him again by showing great devoutness by offering bullocks and goats without number as sinofferings and peaceofferings but that made him no happier  at last he found out that god required no sacrifice but a broken heart that was what god wanteda broken and a contrite heart for david to be utterly ashamed of himself utterly broken down and silenced so that he had nothing left to pleadneither past good deeds nor present devoutness nor sacrifices  nothing but o god i deserve all thou canst lay on me and more  have mercy on memercy is all i ask  there was nothing for him you see but to make a clean breast of it to face his sin and all its shame and abomination and confess it all and throw himself on gods mercy  and when he did that there then and at once as nathan told him god put away his sin as david says himself i said i will confess my sins unto the lord and so thou forgavest the wickedness of my sin  as it is written if we confess our sins god is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness  and now my friends what lesson may we learn from this  it is easy to say we have not sinned as deeply as david and therefore his story has nothing to do with us  my friends whether we have sinned as deeply as david or not his story has to do with you and me and every soul in this church and every soul in the whole world or it would not be in the bible  for no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation that is it does not only point at one man here and another there  but those who wrote it were moved by the holy ghost who lays down the eternal universal laws of holiness of right and good which are right and good for you and me and all mankind and therefore davids story has to do with you and me every time we do wrong and know that we have done wrong  now my friends when you have done a wrong thing you know your conscience torments you with it you are uneasy and discontented with yourselves perhaps cross with those about you you hardly know why  or rather though you do know why you do not like to tell yourself why  the bad thing which you have done or the bad tempers which you have given way to or the person whom you have quarrelled with hang in your mind and darken all your thoughts  and you try not to remember them  but conscience makes you remember them and will not let the dark thought fly away till you can enjoy nothing because your heart is not clean and clear there is something in the background which makes you sad whenever you try to be happy  then a man tries first to deceive himself  he says to himself no that sin is not what makes me unhappynot that and he tries to find out any and every reason for his uncomfortable feelings except the very thing which he knows all the while in the bottom of his heart is the real reason  he says well perhaps i am unhappy because i have done something wrong  what wrong can i have done  and so he sets to work to find out every sin except the sin which is the cause of all because that one he does not like to face  it is too real and ugly and humbling to his proud spirit and perhaps he is afraid of having to give it up  so i have known a man confess himself a sinner a miserable sinner freely enough and then break out into a rage with you if you dare to speak a word of the one sin which you know that he has actually committed  no sir he will say whatever i may be wrong in i am right there  i have committed sins too many i know  but you cannot charge me with that at leastand all the more because he knows that everybody round is charging him with it and that the thing is as notorious as the sun in heaven  but that makes him in his pride all the more determined not to confess himself in the wrong on that one point and he will go and confess to god and perhaps to man all manner of secret sins nay even invent sins for himself out of things which are no sins and confess himself humbly in the wrong where perhaps he is all right just to drug his conscience and be able to say i have repentedrepented that is of everything but what he and all the world know that he ought to repent of  but still his conscience is not easy  he has no peace of mind  he is like david  while i held my peace my bones waxed old through my daily complaining  gods hand is heavy on him day and night and his moisture is like the drought in summer  his heart feels hard and dry he cannot enjoy himself he is moody he lies awake and frets at night and goes listlessly and heavily about his business in the morning his heart is not right with god and he knows it god and he are not at peace and he knows it  then he tries to repent  but it is a false useless sort of repentance  he says to himself as david did well then i will make my peace with god  i will please him  i have done one wrong thing  i will do two right ones to make up for it  if he is a rich man he perhaps tries davids plan of burntofferings and sacrifices  he says i will give away a great deal in charity i will build a church i will take a great deal of trouble about societies and speak at religious meetings and show god how much i really do care for him after all and what great sacrifices i can make for him  or if he is a poor man he will say well then i will try and be more religious i will think more about my soul and come to church as often as i can and say my prayers regularly and read good books and perhaps that will make my peace with god  at all events god shall see that i am not as bad as i look not altogether bad that i do care for him and for doing right  but rich or poor the man finds out by bitter experience how truly david said thou requirest no sacrifice else would i give it thee thou delightest not in burntofferings  not that they are not good and excellent but that they are not good coming from him because his heart is still unrepentant because instead of confessing his sin and throwing himself on gods mercy he is trying to win god round to overlook his sin  so almsgiving and ordinances and prayer give the poor man no peace  he rises from his knees unrefreshed  he goes out of church with as heavy a heart as he went in and he finds that for all his praying he does not become a better man any more than a happier man  there is still that darkness over his soul like a black cloud spread between him and god  my friends if any of you find yourselves in this sad case the only remedy which i can give you the only remedy which i ever found do me any good or give me back my peace of mind is davids remedy the one which he found out at last and which he spoke of in these blessed psalms  confess your sin to god  bring it all out  make a clean breast of itwhatever it may cost you make a clean breast of it  only be but honest with god and all will come right at once say not with your lips only but from the very bottom of your heart say oh good god heavenly father i have nothing to say i am wrong and yet i do not know how wrong i am but thou knowest thou seest all my sin a thousand times more clearly than i do and if i look black and foul to myself oh god how much more black and how foul must i look to thee i know not  all i know is that i am utterly wrong and thou utterly right  i am shapen in sin conceived in iniquity  my heart it is that is wrong  not merely this or that wrong which i have done but my heart my temper which will have its own way which cares for itself and not for thee  i have nothing to plead nothing to throw into the other scale  for if i have ever done right it was thou didst right in me and not me myself and only my sins are my own doing so the good in me is all thine and the bad in me all my own and in me dwells no good thing  and as for excusing myself by saying that i love thee i had better tell the truth since thou knowest it alreadyi do not love thee  oh god i love myself my pitiful miserable self well enough and too well  but as for loving theehow many of my good deeds have been done for love of thee  i have done right from fear of hell from hope of heaven or to win thy blessings  but how often have i done right really and purely for thy sake  i am ashamed to think  my only comfort my only hope is that whether i love thee or not thou lovest me and hast sent thy son to seek and save me  help me now  save me now out of my sin and darkness and selfconceit  show thy love to me by setting this wrong heart of mine right  give me a clean heart oh god and renew a right spirit within me  if i be wrong myself how can i make myself right  no thou must do it  thou must purge me or i shall never be clean thou must make me to understand wisdom in the secret depth of my heart or i shall never see my way  thou must for i cannot and base and bad as i am i can believe that thou wilt condescend to help me and teach me because i know thy love in jesus christ my lord  and then thou wilt be pleased with my sacrifices and oblations because they come from a right hearta truly humble honest penitent heart which is not trying to deceive god or plaster over its own baseness and weakness but confesses all and yet trusts in gods boundless love  then my alms will rise as a sweet savour before thee oh god then sacraments will strengthen me ordinances will teach me good books will speak to my soul and my prayers will be answered by peace of mind and a clear conscience and the sweet and strengthening sense that i am in my heavenly fathers house about my heavenly fathers business and that his smile is over me and his blessing on me as long as i remain loyal to him and to his laws  feel thus my friends and speak to god thus and see if the dark stupefying cloud does not pass away from your heartsee if there and then does not come sunshine and strength and the sweet assurance that you are indeed forgiven  but how about this old sin which caused the man all this trouble he began by trying to forget it  i think if he be a true penitent he will not wish to forget it any more  he will not torment himself about it for he knows that god has forgiven him  but the more he feels god has forgiven him the less likely he will be to forgive himself  the more sure he feels of gods love and mercy the more utterly ashamed of himself he will be  and what is more it is not wise to forget our own sins when god has not forgotten them  for god does not forget our sins though he forgives them and a very bad thing it would be for us if he did my friends  for the wages of sin is death  and even if god does not slay us for our sins he is certain to punish us for them in some way lest we should forget that sin is sin and fancy that gods mercy is only careless indulgence  so god did to david  he then told him that though he was forgiven he would still be punished the lord has put away thy sin nevertheless the child that shall be born unto thee shall surely die  punishment and forgiveness went together  ay if we will look at it rightly davids being punished was the very sign that god had forgiven him  oh believe that my friends face it thank god for it  i at least do when i look back upon my past life and see that for every wrong i have ever done i have been punished  not punished a tenth part as much as i deserve but still punished more or less and made to smart for my own folly and to learn by hard unmistakable experience that it will not pay me or any man to break the least of gods laws and i thank god for it i tell you to thank god also whensoever you are punished for your sins  it is a sign that god cares for you that god loves you that god is training and educating you that god is your father and he is dealing with you as with his sons  for what son is there whom his father does not chastise  it is a bitter lesson no doubt but we have deserved it  then let us bear it like men  no doubt it is bitter  but there is a blessing in it  no chastisement at first seems pleasant says the apostle but rather grievous  yet afterwards it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who are exercised thereby  be exercised by it then  let god teach you in his own way even if it seem a harsh and painful way  we have had earthly fathers says the apostle who corrected us and we gave them reverence  shall we not much rather be in subjection to god the father of spirits and live  for suffering and punishment is the way to eternal lifeto that true eternal life which is knowing god and gods love and becoming like god  as the apostle says god chastens us only for our profit that we may be partakers of his holiness  and as king hezekiah says of affliction lord by these things by sorrow and chastisement men live and in all these things is the life of the spirit  may god give to you and me and all mankind as often as we do wrong honest and good hearts to confess our sins thoroughly and take our punishment meekly and trust in gods boundless mercy in order that if we humble ourselves under his rod and learn his lessons faithfully in this life we may not need a worse punishment in the life to come but be accepted in the last great day for the sake of jesus christ our blessed lord and saviour    sermon xx  the true gentleman    1 cor xii 31 xiii 1  covet earnestly the best gifts  and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way  though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal  my friends let me say a few plain words this morning to young and old rich and poor upon this text  now you all i suppose think it a good thing to be gentlemen and ladies  all of you i say  there is not a poor man in this church perhaps who has not before now said in his heart ah if i were but a gentleman or a poor woman who has not said in her heart ah if i were but a lady  you see round you in the world thousands plotting and labouring all their lives long to make money and grow rich that they may become as they think gentlemen or at least their sons after them  and those here who are what the world calls gentlemen and ladies know very well that those names are names which are very precious to them and would sooner give up house land money all the comforts upon earth than give up being called gentlemen and ladies and these last know i trust what some poor people do not know and what no man knows who fancies that he can make a gentleman of himself merely by gaining money and setting up a fine house and a good table and horses and carriages and indulging the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eye and the pride of life for these last ought to know that the right to be called gentlemen and ladies is something which this world did not give and cannot take away so that if they were brought to utter poverty and rags or forced to dig the ground for their own livelihood they would be gentlemen and ladies still if they ever had been really and truly such and what is more they would make every one who met them feel that they were gentlemen and ladies in spite of all their poverty  now people do not often understand clearly why this is  they feel more or less that so it is but they cannot explain it  i could tell you why they cannot but i will not take up your time  but if they cannot explain it there are those who can  st paul explains it in the epistle  the lord jesus himself explains it in the gospel  they tell us why money will not make a gentleman  they tell us why poverty will not unmake one  but they tell us more they tell us the one only thing which makes a true gentleman  and they tell us more still  they tell us how every one of us down to the poorest and most ignorant man and woman in this church may become true gentlemen and ladies in the sight of god and of all reasonable men and that not only in this life but after death for ever and ever and ever  and that is by charity by love  now if you will look two or three chapters back in the epistle to the corinthiansat the 11th and 12th chaptersyou will see that these corinthians were behaving to each other very much as people are apt to do in england now  they all wanted to rise in life and they wanted to rise upon each others shoulders  each man and woman wanted to set themselves up above their neighbours and to look down upon them  the rich looked down on the poor and kept apart from them at the lords supper and no doubt the poor envied the rich heartily enough in return  and these corinthians were very religious and some of them too very clever  so those who being poor could not set themselves up above their neighbours on the score of wealth wanted to set themselves up on the score of their spiritual gifts  one looked down on his neighbours because he was a deeper scholar than they another because he had the gift of tongues and understood more languages than they another could prophesy better than any of them and so because he was a very eloquent preacher he tried to get power over his neighbours and abuse the talents which god had given him to pamper his own pride and vanity and love of managing and ordering people and of being run after by silly women as st paul calls them ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth  and of the rest one party sided with one preacher or one teacher and another with another and each party looked down on the other and judged them harshly and said bitter things of them till as st paul says they were all split up by heresies that is by divisions party spirit envying and grudging in the very church of god and at the very table of the lord  now says st paul covet earnestly the best gifts  and yet show i you a more excellent way and that is charity love  as much as to say i do not complain of any of you for trying to be the best that you can for trying to be as wise as you can be as eloquent as you can be as learned as you can be  i do not complain of you for trying to rise but i do complain of you for trying to rise upon each others shoulders  i do complain of you for each trying to set up himself and trying to make use of his neighbours instead of helping them and when god gives you gifts to do good to others with trying to do good only to yourselves with them  for he says you are all members of one body and all the talents gifts understanding power money which god has bestowed on you he has given you only that you may help your neighbours with them of course there is no harm in longing and praying for great gifts longing and praying to be very wise or very eloquent but only that you may do all the more good  and after all says st paul there is something more worth longing for not merely than money but more worth longing for than the wisdom of a prophet or the tongue of an angel and that is charity  if you have that you will be able to do as much good as god requires of you in your station and if you have not that you will not do what god requires of you even though you spoke with the tongues of men and of angels  even though you had the gift of prophecy and understood all mysteries and all knowledge even though you had all faith so that you could remove mountains even though you had all good works and gave all your goods to feed the poor and your body to be burned as a martyr for the sake of religion and had not charity you would be nothing nothing says st paul but sounding brass and a tinkling cymbalan empty vessel which makes the more noise the less there is in it if you have charity says st paul you will be able to do your share of good where god has put you though you may be poor and ignorant and stupid and weak but if you have not charity all the wisdom and learning righteousness and eloquence in the world will only give you greater power of doing harm  yes he says i show you a more excellent way to be really great a way by which the poorest may be as great as the richestthe simple cottagers wife as great as the most accomplished lady and that is charity which comes from the spirit of god  pray for thattry after that and if you want to know what sort of a spirit it is that you are to pray for and try after i will tell you  charity is the very opposite of the selfish covetous ambitious proud grudging spirit of this world  charity suffers long and is kind  charity does not envy  charity does not boast is not puffed up  does not behave itself unseemly that is is never rude or overbearing or careless about hurting peoples feelings by hard words or looks seeketh not its own that is is not always looking on its own rights and thinking about itself and trying to help itself is not easily provoked  thinketh no evil that is is not suspicious ready to make out the worst case against every one rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth that is is not glad as too many are to see people do wrong and to laugh and sneer over their failings  but rejoiceth in the truth tries to find out the truth about every one and judge them honestly and make fair allowances for them  covereth all things that is tries to hide a neighbours sins as far as is right instead of gossiping over them and blazoning them up and down as too many do  believeth all things that is gives every one credit for meaning well as long as it can hopeth all things that is never gives any one up as past mending endureth all things keeps its temper and keeps its tongue not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but on the contrary blessing and so overcomes evil with good  in one word while the spirit of the world thinks of itself and helps itself charity which is the spirit of god thinks of other people and helps other people  and nowto be always thinking of other peoples feelings and always caring for other peoples comfort what is that but the mark and the only mark of a true gentleman and a true lady  there is none other my friends and there never will be  but the poorest man or woman can do that the poorest man or woman can be courteous and tender careful not to pain people ready and willing to help every one to the best of their power and therefore the poorest man or woman can be a true gentleman or a true lady in the sight of god by the inspiration of the spirit of god whose name is charity  they can be  and thanks be to the grace of god they often are  i can say that i have seen among plain sailors and labouring men as perfect gentlemen of gods sort as man need see but then they were always pious and godfearing men and so the spirit of god had made up to them for any want of scholarship and rank  they were gentlemen because gods spirit had made them gentle  for recollect all both rich and poor what that word gentleman means  it is simply a man who is gentle who let him be as brave or as wise as he will yet as st paul says suffers long and is kind does not boast does not behave himself unseemly is not easily provoked thinketh no evil  and recollect too what that word lady means  most of you perhaps do not know  i will tell you  it means in the ancient english tongue a person who gives away bread who deals out loaves to the poor  i have often thought that most beautiful and full of meaning a very message from god to all ladies to tell them what they ought to be and not to them only but to the poorest woman in the parish for who is too poor to help her neighbours  you see there is a difference between a christian mans duty in this and a christian womans duty though they both spring from the same spirit  the man unless he be a clergyman has not so much time as a woman for actually helping his neighbours by acts of charity  he must till the ground sail the seas attend to his business fight the queens enemies and the way in which the holy spirit of charity will show in him will be more in his temper and his language by making him patient cheerful respectful condescending courteous reasonable with every one whom he has to do with  but the woman has time to show acts of charity which the man has not  she can teach in the schools sit by the sick bed work with her hands for the suffering and the helpless even though she cannot with her head  above all she can give those kind looks and kind words which comfort the broken heart better than money and bodily comforts can do  and she does do it thank god  i do not merely mean in such noble instances of divine charity and selfsacrifice as those ladies who have gone out to nurse the wounded soldiers in the easttrue ladies indeed of whom i fear more than one ere they return will be added to the noble army of martyrs to receive in return for the great love which they have shown on earth the full enjoyment of gods love in heavennot these only but poor womenwomen who could not write their own nameswomen who had hardly clothes wherewith to keep themselves warmwomen who were toiling all day long to feed and clothe their own children till one wondered when in the twentyfour hours they could find five spare minutes for helping their neighbourssuch poor women have i seen who in the midst of their own daily work and daily care had still a heart open to hear every ones troubles a head always planning little comforts and pleasures for others and hands always busy in doing good instead of being made hard and selfish by their own troubles they had been taught by them as the lord jesus was to feel for the troubles of all around them and went about like ministering angels in the spirit of god which is peace on earth and goodwill towards men  oh my friends such poor women seemed to me most glorious most honourable most venerable  what was all rank or fashion beauty or accomplishments when compared with the great honour which the lord jesus christ was putting upon those poor women by transforming them thus into his own most blessed likeness and giving them grace to go about as he the lord jesus did doing good because god was with them  then i felt that such women poor and worn and hardhanded as they were were ladies in the sight of that heavenly father who is no respecter of persons and felt how truly a wise ancient has said it is virtue yea virtue gentlemen which maketh gentlemen which maketh the poor rich the strong weak the simple wise the base born noble  this rank neither the whirling wheel of fortune can destroy nor the deceitful cavillings of worldlings separate neither sickness abate nor time abolish  no for it is written that though prophecies shall fail tongues cease knowledge vanish away and all that we now know is but in part yet charity shall never fail those who are full of the spirit of love but abide with them for ever and ever bringing forth fruit through all eternity to everlasting life  but what sort of virtue  do not mistake that  not what the world calls virtue not mere legal respectability which says i do unto others as they do unto me which is often merely the whitening outside the sepulchre and leaves the heart within unrenewed unrighteous full of pride and ambition conceit cunning and envy and unbelief in god  not that virtue but the virtue which the apostle tells us to add to our faith the virtue from above which is the same as the wisdom from above which is first pure then peaceable gentle easy to be entreated in one word the holy spirit of god the spirit of divine love and charity which seeketh not its own which st paul has described to us in this epistle the holy spirit of god with which the lord jesus was filled without measure and which he manifested to all the world in his most blessed life and death  ah my friends this is not an easy lesson to learn  christs disciples and apostles could not learn it all at once  they tried to hinder little children from coming to him  they rebuked the blind man who called after him  how could the great prophet of nazareth stoop to trouble himself about such poor insignificant people  they could not conceive either why the lord jesus should choose to die shamefully when he might have lived in honour  it seemed unworthy of him  they were shocked at his words that be far from thee lord said peter  afterwards when they really understood what that word lord meant and what sort of a man a true and perfect lord ought to be then they saw how fit and proper and glorious christs selfsacrifice was  when too they learnt to look on him not merely as a great prophet but as the son of the living god then they understood his conduct and saw that it behoved an onlybegotten son of god to suffer all these things before he entered into his glory  but the scribes and pharisees never understood it  to the last they were puzzled and angered by that very selfsacrifice of his  he must be a bad man they thought or he would not care so much for bad men  a friend of publicans and sinners they called him thinking that a shameful blame to him while it was really the very highest praise  but if they could not see the beauty of his conduct can we  it is very difficult i do not deny it my friends for the selfishness and pride of fallen man  it is difficult to see that the cross was the most glorious throne that was even set up on earth and that the crown of thorns was worth all the crowns of czars and emperors  difficult indeed not to stumble at the stumblingblock of the cross and to say it cannot surely be more blessed to give than to receive difficult not to say in our hearts the way to be great is surely to rise above other men not to stoop below them to make use of them and not to make ourselves slaves to them  and yet the lord jesus christ did so he took on himself the form of a slave and made himself of no reputation  and what was fit and good for him must surely be fit and good for us  but it is a hard lesson to the pride of fallen creatures  very hard  and nothing i believe but sorrow will teach it us  sorrow is teaching it some of us now  we surely are beginning to see that to suffer patiently for conscience sake is the most beautiful thing on earth or in heaven  we begin to see that those poor soldiers dying by inches of cold and weariness without a murmur because it was their duty were doing a nobler work even than they did when they fought at alma and inkermann and that those ladies who are drudging in the hospitals far away from home amid filth and pestilence are doing if possible a nobler work still a nobler work than if they were queens or empresses because they have taken up the cross and followed christ because they are not seeking their own good but the good of others  and if we will not learn it from those glorious examples god will force us to learn it i trust every one of us by sorrow and disappointment ah my friends might one not learn it at once if one would but open ones eyes and look at things as they are  every one is longing for something each has his little plan for himself of what he would like to be and like to do and says to himself all day long if i could but get that one thing i should be happy  if i could but get that then i should want no more  foolish man self deceived by his own lusts  perhaps he cannot get what he wants and therefore he cannot enjoy what he has and is moody discontented peevish a torment to himself and perhaps a torment to his family or perhaps he does get what he wants  and is he happy after all not he  he is like the greedy israelites of old when they longed for the quails and god sent the quails  but while the meat was yet in their mouths they loathed it  so it is with a mans fancy  he gets what he fancies and he plays with it for a day as a child with a new toy and most probably spoils it and next day throws it away to run after some new pleasure which will cheat him in just the same way as the last did and so happiness flits away ahead before him and he is like the simple boy in the parable who was to find a crock of gold where the rainbow touched the ground  but as he moved on the rainbow moved on too and kept always a field off from him  you may smile  but just as foolish is every soul of us who fancies that he will become happy by making himself great admired rich comfortable in short by making himself anything whatsoever or getting anything whatsoever for himself  just as foolish is every poor soul and just as unhappy as long as he will go on thinking about himself instead of copying the lord jesus christ and thinking about others as long as he will keep to the pattern of the old selfish adam which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts the longings and fancies which deceive a man into expecting to be happy when he will not be happy instead of putting on the new man which after gods likeness is created in righteousness and true holiness  and what is true holiness but that very charity of which st paul has been preaching to us the spirit of love and mercy and gentleness and condescension and patience and active benevolence  ah my friends do not forget what i said just now that a man could not become happy by making himself anything  no  not by making himself anything  but he may by letting god make him something  if he will let god make him a new creature in jesus christ then he will be more than happyhe will be blessed  then he will be a blessing to himself and a blessing to every one whom he meets then all vain longing and selfishness and pride and ambition and covetousness and peevishness and disappointment will vanish out of his heart and he will work manfully and contentedly where god has placed himcheerful and openhearted civil and patient always thinking about others and not about himself trying to be about his masters business which is doing good and always finding too that his master christ sets him some good work to do day by day and gives him strength to do it  and how can a man get that blessed and noble state of mind  by prayer and practice  you must ask for strength from god  but then you must believe that he answers your prayer and gives you that strength and therefore you must try and use it  there is no more use in praying without practising than there is in practising without praying  you cannot learn to walk without walking  no more can you learn to do good without trying to do good  ask then of god grace and help to do good  pray to him this very day to take all selfishness and meanness out of your hearts and to give you instead his holy spirit of love and charity which alone can make you noble in his sight and try this day try every day of your lives to do some good to those around you  oh make a rule and pray to god to help you to keep it never if possible to lie down at night without being able to say i have made one human being at least a little wiser or a little happier or a little better this day  you will find it easier than you think and pleasanter  easier because if you wish to do gods work god will surely find you work to do and pleasanter because in return for the little trouble it may cost you or the little choking of foolish vulgar pride it may cost you you will have a peace of mind a quiet of temper a cheerfulness and hopefulness about yourself and all around you such as you never felt before and over and above that if you look for a reward in the life to come recollect thiswhat we have to hope for in the life to come is to enter into the joy of our lord  and how did he fulfil that joy but by humbling himself and taking the form of a slave and coming not to be ministered to but to minister and to give his whole life even to the death upon the cross a ransom for many  be sure that unless you take up his cross you will not share his crown  be sure that unless you follow in his footsteps you will never reach the place where he is if you wish to enter into the joy of your lord be sure that his joy is now as it was in judaea of old over every sinner that repenteth every mourner that is comforted every hungry mouth that is fed every poor soul sick or in prison who is visited  that is the joy of your lordto show mercy and that must be your joy too if you wish to enter into his joy  surely that is plain you must rejoice in doing the same work that he rejoices in and then his joy and yours will be the same then you will enter into his joy and he will enter into yours then as st john says you will dwell in christ and christ in you because you love the brethren and you will hear through all eternity the blessed words inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these little ones ye did it unto me    sermon xxi  toleration    preached at bideford 1854  philippians iii 15 16  and if in any thing ye shall be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this to you  nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing  my friends allow me to speak a few plain and honest words ere we part on a matter which is near to and probably important to many of us here  we all know how the christian church has in all ages been torn in pieces by religious quarrels we all know too well how painfully these religious quarrels have been brought home to our very doors and hearts of late  now we all deplore or profess to deplore these differences and controversies  but we may do that in two ways  we may say i am very sorry that all christians do not think alike when all we mean is i am very sorry that all christians do not think just as i do for i am right and infallible whosoever else is wrong  the fallen heart of man is too apt to say that my friends in its pride and narrowness and while it cries out against the pope of rome sets itself up as pope in his stead  but there is surely another and a better way of deploring these differences  and that is to say to oneself i am sorry bitterly sorry that christians cannot differ without quarrelling and hating one another over and above  and then comes the deeper home thought and how much more sorry i am that i myself cannot differ from my fellowchristians without growing angry with them suspecting them despising them treating them as if they were not my fellowchristians at all  yes my friends this is what we have to do first when we think of religious controversies to examine our own hearts and deeds and words to see whether we too have not been making bitterness more bitter and as the old proverb says stirring the fire with a sword and to repent humbly and utterly of every harsh word hasty judgment ungenerous suspicion as sins not only against men but against god the father of lights who worketh in each of his children to will and to do of his good pleasure  but some will say we cannot give up what we believe to be right and true  god forbid that you should try to do so my friends for if you really believe it you cannot even if you try and by trying you will only make yourselves dishonest  but does not that hold as good of the man who differs from you  god will not surely lay down one law for you and another for him  but we are right and he is wrong  be it so  you do not surely mean that you are quite right perfect and infallible  you mean that you are right on the whole and as far as you see  and how can you tell but that he is right on the whole and as far as he sees  you will answer that both cannot be right that yes and no cannot be both true that a thing cannot be black and white also  my friends my friendsbut where is the religious controversy the two sides whereof are as clearly opposite to each other as yes and no black and white  i know none now i have hardly found one in the records of the protestant church since first luther and our reformers protested against romish idolatry  on that last matter there should be no doubt as long as the first two commandments stand in the decalogue but with that exception it would be difficult to find a dispute in which the truth lay altogether with one party  the truth rather lies in general not so much halfway between the two combatants as in some third place which neither of them sees which perhaps god does not intend them to see in this life while he leaves his servants each to work out some one side of christian truth dividing to every man severally as he will according to the powers of each mind and the needs of each situation  true we have the infallible rule of scripture  but are our own interpretations of it so sure to be infallible  inspired infinite inexhaustible as it is can we pretend to have fathomed all its abysses to have comprehended all its boundless treasures  the pretence is folly  true again it contains all things necessary to salvation and those so plainly set forth that he who runs may read and the wayfaring man though poor shall not err therein and yet does it not contain things whereof even st paul himself said that he only knew in part and prophesied in part and saw as through a glass darkly and are we to suppose that they are among the truths necessary to salvation  now are not the points about which there has been and is still most dispute just of this very number  do they belong to the simple fundamental truths of the gospel  no  are they such plain matters that the wayfaring man though poor can make up his mind on them for himself  no  are they one of them laid down directly in scripture like the ten commandments the lords prayer or the creeds  no  they are every one as it seems to me whether they be right or wrong abstruse deductions delicate theories built up on single and obscure texts surely if they had been necessary for salvation the lord would have spoken on them in a tone and in words about which there should be no more mistake than about the thunders of sinai and the tables of stone fresh from the fingermark of god  and he has spoken to us my friends on other matters if not on these  his promises are clear enough and short enough though high as heaven and wide as the universe  there is one god and one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus the onlybegotten son of god and whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins  and again if any man lack wisdom let him ask of god who giveth liberally and upbraideth not and he shall receive it   for if ye being evil know how to give good gifts to your children much more shall your heavenly father give his holy spirit to them who ask him  these are gods promisessimple and clear enough  and what are gods demands  are they numerous intricate burdensome a yoke which neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear  god forbid againhe hath showed thee oh man what is good  and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god  and lest thou shouldest mistake in the least the meaning of these words he hath showed thee all this and more by a living example fairer than all the sons of men and through lips full of grace in the blessed life and blessed death of his son jesus christ the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person  to this at least we have already attained let us walk by this rule let us all mind this same thing and if in anything else we are differently minded god in his own good time will reveal even that to us  is not this enough my friends  then why should we bite and tear each other about that which is over and above this  if any man believes this and acts on it let us hail him as a brother  after all let our differences be what they will have we not one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in us all  if this is not bond enough between man and man what bond would we have  oh my friends when we consider this our little life how full of ignorance it is and darkness within us rebellion inconstancy confusion daily sins and shortcomings and without us disappointment fear of loneliness loss of friends loss of all which makes life worth havingwho are we that we should deny proudly one single tie which binds us to any other human being  who are we that we should refuse one hand stretched out to grasp our own  who are we that we should say stand back for i am holier than thou  who are we that we should judge another to his own master let him stand or fallyea and he shall stand says the apostle for god is able to make him stand  think of those last words my friends they are strong and startling but we must not shrink from them  they tell us that god may be as near those whom we heap with hard names as he is near to us that he may intend that they should triumph not over us but with us over evil  and if god be with them who dare be against them  shall we be more dainty than god  and therefore i have never been able to hear without a shudder words which i have heard and from really christian men too  i can wish well to a pious man of a different denomination from mine i can honour and admire the fruits of gods spirit in him but i cannot cooperate with him  when i hear such language from really good men i confess i am puzzled  i have no doubt that their reasons seem to them very sound but what they are i cannot conceive  i cannot conceive why i should not hold out the right hand of fellowship and brotherhood to every man who fears god and works righteousness of whatsoever denomination he may be  we believe the apostles creed surely  then think of the meaning of that one word the holy spirit  to whom are we to attribute any mans good deeds except to the holy spirit  we dare not say that he does them by an innate and natural virtue of his own for that would be to fall at once into the pelagian heresy neither dare we attribute his good deeds to an evil spirit and say however good they may look they must be bad for he belongs to a denomination who cannot have gods spirit  we dare not for that would be to approach fearfully near to the unpardonable sin itself the sin against the holy ghost the bigotry which says he casteth out devils by the prince of the devils  surely if we be christians and churchmen we confess for the bible and the prayer book declare that every good deed of man comes down from the one fountain of good from god the father of lights by the inspiration of his holy spirit  then think my friends think what words we have said  we confess that the great absolute almighty eternal god in whose hand suns and stars ages and generations hell and heaven and all which is and has been and ever will be are but as a grain of sand who has but to take away his breath and the whole universe would become nothing and nowhere the utterly holy and righteous god who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity who charges his angels with folly and the heavens are not clean in his sightwe confess i say that this great god has condescended to visit that mans soul and cherish it and teach it and shape it be it ever so little into his own likeness  and shall we dare to stand aloof from him from whom god does not stand aloof  shall we refuse to walk with one who walks with god  shall we refuse to work with one who is a fellowworker with god to love one whom god loves to take by the hand one whose guest god has become  shall we be more dainty than god more fastidious than god more righteous than god more separate from sinners than god  oh my friends let us pray that we may love god better and know his likeness more clearly that we may be more ready to recognise and admire and welcome every even the smallest trace of that likeness in any human being remembering that it is the likeness of christ who was not merely the teacher of all in every nation who fear god and work righteousness but the saviour who ate and drank with publicans and sinners  and then we shall be more careful how we call unclean what god himself has cleansed with his own presence his own grace his own quickening and renewing and sanctifying spirit  be sure be sure my friends that in proportion as we really love the lord jesus christ we shall love those who love him be it in never so clumsy or mistaken a fashion and love those too whom he loved enough to die for them and whom he loves now enough to teach and strengthen  we shall say to them not wherein do we differ but wherein do we agree  not because i cannot worship with you therefore i will not work with you but rather i wish that i could worship with you i will whenever and wherever i can as far as you allow me as far as the law allows me as far as your worship is not in my eyes an actually sinful thing  but be that as it may we can at least do together something better even than worshipping and that is working  we can surely do good together  together let our denomination or party be what it may we can feed the hungry clothe the naked reform the prisoner humanize the degraded save yearly the lives of thousands by labouring for the public health and educate the minds and morals of the masses though our religious differences shame on us that it should be so force us to part when we begin to talk to them about the world to come  for are we not brothers after all  has not god made us of one blood english men with english hearts  has not christ redeemed us with one and the same sacrifice  has not the holy spirit given us one and the same desire of doing good  and shall we not use that spirit hand in hand  look look at the opportunities of doing good which are around you look at gods field of good works white already to the harvest and the labourers are few  shall these few instead of going manfully to work stand idly quarrelling about the shape of their instruments and their favourite modes of using them god forbid  true there are errors against which we are bound to protest to the uttermost but how few  the one real enemy we have all to fight is sinevildoing  if any man or doctrine makes men worsemakes men do worse deeds protest then if you will and spare not and shrink not  for sin must be of the devil whatever else is not  and therefore we are bound to protest against any doctrine which parts man from god and under whatsoever pretence of reverence or purity draws again the veil between him and his heavenly father and denies him free access to the throne of grace and the feet of jesus that he may carry thither his own sins his own doubts his own sorrows and speak wondrous condescension of redeeming grace speak with god face to face and yet live  for this we must protest for this we must die if needs be for if we lose this we lose all which our reforming forefathers won for us at the stake ay we lose our own souls for we lose righteousness and strength and the power to do the will of god  for to shut a man out from free access to god and christ is to make him certainly false dishonest cowardly degraded slavish and sinful as modern popery has made and always will make those over whom it really gains power  this is the root of our hereditary protest against popery not merely because we do not agree with certain of its doctrines but because we know from experience that as now taught by the jesuits with whom it has identified itself its general tendency is to make men bad men ignorant dishonest rebellious unworthy citizens of a free and loyal state  and there are practices against which congregations have a right to protest not only as christians but as free englishmen congregations have a right to protest against any minister who introduces obsolete ceremonies which empty his church and drive away his people  those ceremonies may be quite harmless in themselves as i really believe most of them are many of them may be beautiful and if properly understood useful as i think they are but a thing may be good in itself and yet become bad by being used at a wrong time and in a way which produces harm  and it is shocking to say the least to see churches emptied and parishes thrown into war for the sake of such matters  the lightest word which can be used for such conduct is pedantry but i fear at times lest the lord in heaven should be using a far more awful word and when he sees weak brethren driven from the fold of the church by the self will and obstinacy of the very men who profess to desire to bring all into the church as the only place where salvation is to be foundi fear i say when i see such deeds lest the lord should repeat against them his own awful words  if any man scandalize one of these little ones who believeth on me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea  what sadder mistake  those who have sworn to seek out christs lambs scattered up and down this wicked world shall they be the very ones to frighten those lambs out of the fold instead of alluring them back into it  shall the shepherd play the part not even of the hireling who flees and leaves the sheep to themselves but of the very wolf who scatters the flock  god forbid  the church like the sabbath was made for man my friends  not man for the church and the son of man as he is lord of the sabbath is lord of the church and will have mercy in its dealings rather than sacrifice  the minister my friends was made for the people  and not the people for the minister  what else does the very name minister mean  not a lord who has dominion but a servant a servant to all who must give up again and again his private notions of what he thinks best in itself for the sake of what will be best for his flock who must be like st paul a jew to the jews under the law to those who are still under the law and yet again without law to those who are without law though not without law to god but under the law to christ weak with the weak strong with the strong that he may gain men of all sorts of opinions and characters by agreeing with them as far as he honestly can and showing his sympathy with each as much as he can and so become all things to all men that he may by all means save some  oh my friends who can read honestly that glorious first epistle to the corinthians and not see how a man may have the most intense earnestness the strongest doctrinal certainty and yet at the same time the greatest freedom and charity and liberality about minor matters of ceremonies and church arrangements and practical methods of usefulness glad even that christ be preached by his enemies and out of spite to him because any way christ is preached  but my friends if it is the right of free englishmen to protest against such doings how shall it be done  surely in gentleness calmness reverence as by men who know that they are standing on holy ground and dealing with sacred things before the throne of god and beneath the eye of jesus christ  not surely as it has been too often done in bitterness and wrath and clamour and evilspeaking with really unjust suspicions exaggerations slanders and those too anonymous in the columns of the public prints  my friends these are not gods weapons  not such is ithuriels magic spear the very touch of which unmasks falsehood this is to try to cast out satan by satan to make evil worse by fighting it with fresh evil  oh my friends if there is one counsel which i would press on all here more earnestly than another it is thisnever never howsoever great may be the temptation to indulge in anonymous attacks on any human being  no man has a right to do it who prays daily to his father in heaven lead us not into temptation  for it is to lead oneself into temptation and that too sore to resist into the temptation to say something which one dare not say and ought not to say were ones name known the temptation to forget not only the charity of christians but even the courtesies of civilized life and to shoot from behind the safe hedge of anonymousness coward and envenomed shafts of which we should be ashamed did the world know that they were ours of which we shall surely be ashamed in that great day when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed  i speak strongly  but only because i know by bitter experience the terrible truth of my own words  and consider my friends can any good result come from handling sacred matters with such harsh and fierce hands as they have been handled of late  for ourselves such evil tempers only excite irritate blind us  they prevent our doing justice to the opposite sidei speak of all partiesthey put us into an unwholesome state of suspicion and tempt us to pass harsh judgments upon men as righteous and perhaps far more righteous than ourselves  they stir up our pride to special plead our case to make the best of our own side and the worst of our opponents  they defile our very prayers till when we ought to be praying god to bless all mankind we catch ourselves unawares calling on him to curse our enemies  for those who are withoutfor the infidel the profligate the carelessoh what a scandal to them  what an excuse for them to blaspheme the holy name whereby we are called and ask as of old is this then the gospel of peace  see how these christians hate one another  while for the young oh my friends what a scandal again to them if you had seen as i have pious parents destroying in their own childrens minds all faith all reverence for holy things by mixing themselves up in religious controversies and indulging by their own firesides in fierce denunciations of men no worse than themselves if you will watch as you may young people taking refuge some in utter frivolity saying what am i to believe  when religionists have settled what religion is it will be time enough for me to think of it  meanwhile let me eat and drink for tomorrow i dieand others the children of strong protestant parents taking refuge in the apostate church of rome and saying if englishmen do not know what to believe rome does if i cannot find certainty in protestantism i can in poperyif you will consider honestly and earnestly these sad tragedies you will look on it as a sacred duty to the children whom god has given you to keep aloof as much as possible from all those points on which christians differ and make your children feel from their earliest years that there are points and those the great vital root points on which all more or less agree which many members of the romish church have held and i doubt not now hold as firmly as protestantsadoption by one common father justification by the blood of one common saviour sanctification by one common holy spirit  and believe me my friends that just in proportion as you delight in and live by these great doctrines all controversies will become less and less important in your eyes  the more you value the living body of christianity the less you will think of its temporary garments the more you feel the power of gods spirit the less scrupulous will you be about the peculiar form in which he may manifest himself  personal trust in christ jesus personal love to christ jesus personal belief that he and he only is governing this poor diseased and confused world that he is really fighting against all evil in it that he really rules all nations and fashions the hearts of all of them and understands all their works and has appointed them their times and the bounds of their habitation if haply they may feel after him and find him  personal and living belief that the just and loving lord christ reigneth be the peoples never so unquietthis this will keep your minds clear and sober and charitable and will make you turn with disgust from platform squabbles and newspaper controversies to do the duty which lies nearest you to walk soberly and righteously with your god and train up your children in his faith and fear not merely to be scholars not merely to be devotees but to be christian englishmen courteous and gentle and yet manful and selfrestraining fearing god and regarding man growing up healthy under that solemn sense of national duty which is the only safeguard of national freedom  and meanwhile you will leave all who differ from you in the hands of a god who wills their salvation far more than you can do who accepts in every nation those who fear him and work righteousness who is merciful in thisthat he rewards every man according to his work and who if our brothers be otherwise minded from us will reveal even that to them if we be right  or again to us if they be right  for we may have to learn from them as well as they from us and both have to learn much from god in the day when all controversies and doubts shall vanish like a cloud when we shall see no longer in part and through a glass darkly but face to face while all things shall be bright in the sunshine of gods presence and of the countenance of his son jesus christ our lord    sermon xxii  public spirit    preached at bideford 1855  1 corinthians xii 25 26  that there should be no division in the body but that the members should have the same care one of another  and whether one member suffer all suffer with it or whether one member be honoured all rejoice with it  i have been asked to preach in behalf of the provident society of this town  i shall begin by asking you to think over with me a matter which may seem at first sight to have very little to do with you or with a provident society but which nevertheless i believe has very much to do with both and is full of wholesome spiritual instruction for us all  did it ever happen to any of you to see a mob of several thousands put to instant flight by a mere handful of soldiers  and did you ever ask yourself how that apparent miracle could come to pass  the first answer which occurred to you perhaps was that the soldiers were well armed and the mob was not  but soon i am sure you felt that you were doing the soldiers an injustice that they would have behaved just as bravely if every man in that mob had been as well armed as they and have resisted till they were overpowered by mere numbers  you felt i am sure that there was something in the hearts and spirits of those soldiers which there was not in the hearts of the mob that though the mob might be boiling over with the greediest passions the fiercest fury while the soldiers were calm cheerful and caring for nothing but doing their duty yet that there was a thought within them which was stronger than all the rage and greediness of the thousands whom they faced that in short the seeming miracle was a moral and a spiritual miracle  what then is this wonderworking thought which makes the soldier strong  courage you answer and the sense of duty  true but what has called out the sense of duty  what has inspired the courage  there was a time perhaps when each of those soldiers was no braver or more steady than the mob in front of them  has it never happened to you to know some young country lad both before and after he has become a soldier  look at him in his native village if you will let me draw for you the sketch of a history which alas is the history of thousands perhaps one of the worst and idlest lads in itunwilling to work steadily haunting the publichouse and the worst of company wandering out at night to poach and caring for nothing but satisfying his gross animal appetites afraid to look you in the face hardly able to give an intelligible certainly not a civil answer his countenance expressing only vacancy sensuality cunning suspicion utter want of selfrespect  it is a sad sight but how common a sight even in this favoured land  at last he vanishes he has been engaged in some drunken affray or in some low intrigue and has fled for fear of the law and enlisted as a soldier  a year or two passes and you meet the same lad againif indeed he is the same  for a strange change has come over him  he walks erect he speaks clearly he looks you boldly in the face with eyes full of intelligence and selfrespect he is become civil and courteous now he touches his cap to you like a soldier he can afford now to be respectful to others because he respects himself and expects you to respect him  you talk to him and find that the change is not merely outward but inward not owing to mere mechanical drill but to something which has been going on in his heart and ten to one the first thing that he begins to talk to you about with honest pride is his regiment  his regiment  yes there is the secret which has worked these wonders there is the talisman which has humanized and civilized and raised from the mire the once savage boor  he belongs to a regiment in one word he has become the member of a body  the member of a body in which if one member suffers all suffer with it if one member be honoured all rejoice with it  a body which has a life of its own and a government of its own a duty of its own a history of its own an allegiance to a sovereign all which are now his life his duty his history his allegiance he does not now merely serve himself and his own selfish lusts  he serves the queen  his nature is not changed but the thought that he is the member of an honourable body has raised him above his nature  if he forgets that and thinks only of himself he will become selfish sluttish drunken cowardly a bad soldier as long as he remembers it he is a hero  he can face mobs now and worse than mobs  he can face hunger and thirst fatigue danger death itself because he is the member of a body  for those know little little of human nature and its weakness who fancy that mere brute courage as of an angry lion will ever avail or availed a few short weeks ago to spur our thousands up the steeps of alma or across the fatal plain of balaklava athwart the corpses of their comrades upon the deadly throats of russian guns  a nobler feeling a more heavenly thought was needed and when needed thanks to god it came to keep each raw lad nursed in the lap of peace true to his country and his queen through the valley of the shadow of death  not mere animal fierceness  but that tattered rag which floated above his head inscribed with the glorious names of egypt or corunna toulouse or waterloo that it was which raised him into a hero  he had seen those victories the men who conquered there were dead long since  but the regiment still lived its history still lived its honour lived and that history that honour were his as well as those old dead warriors  he had fought side by side with them in spirit though not in the flesh and now his turn was come and he must do as they did and for their sakes and count his own life a worthless thing for the sake of the body which he belonged to  he but two years ago the idle selfish country lad now stumbling cheerful on in the teeth of the iron hail across ground slippery with his comrades blood not knowing whether the next moment his own blood might not swell the ghastly stream  what matter  they might kill him but they could not kill the regiment it would live on and conquer ay and should conquer if his life could help on its victory and then its honour would be his its reward be his even when his corpse lay pierced with wounds stiffening beneath a foreign sky  here my friends is one example of the blessed power of fellow feeling public spirit the sense of belonging to a body whose members have not merely a common interest but a common duty a common honour  this christian country thank god gives daily many another example of the same  and every place and every station affords to each one of us opportunitiesmore alas i fear than we shall ever take full advantage of  but i have chosen the case of the soldier not merely because it is perhaps the most striking and affecting but because i wish to see and trust in god that i shall see those who remain at home in safety emulating the public spirit and self sacrifice which our soldiers are showing abroad and by sacrifices more peaceful and easy but still wellpleasing unto god showing that they too have been raised above selfishness by the glorious thought that they are members of a body  for are we not members of a body my friends  are we not members of the body of bodies members of christ children of god inheritors of the kingdom of heaven  members of christwe and the poor for whom i plead as well as we perhaps considering their many trials and our few trials more faithfully and loyally by far than we are  there are some here i doubt not to whom that word that argument is enough  to whom it is enough to say remember that the lord whom you love loves that shivering starving wretch as well as he loves you to open and exhaust at once their heart their purse their labour of love  gods blessing be upon all such  but it would be hypocrisy in me my friends to speak to this or any congregation as if all were of that temper of mind  it is not one in ten alas in the present divided state of religious parties who feels the mere name of christ enough of a bond to make him sacrifice himself for his fellow christians as a soldier does for his fellow soldiers  not one in ten alas feels that he owes the same allegiance to christ as the soldier does to his queen that the honour of christianity is his honour the history of christianity his history the life of christianity his life  would that it were so  but it is not so  and i must appeal to feelings in you less wide honourable and righteous though they are  i must appeal to your public spirit as townsmen of this place  i have a right as a clergyman to do so  i have a duty as a clergyman to do so  for your being townsmen of this place is not a mere material accident depending on your living in one house instead of another  it is a spiritual matter it is a question of eternity your souls and spirits influence each other your tastes opinions tempers habits make those of your neighbours better or worse you feel it in yourselves daily  look at it as a proof that whether you will or not you are one body of which all the members must more or less suffer and rejoice together that you have a common weal a common interest that god has knit you together that you cannot part yourselves even if you will and that you can be happy and prosperous only by acknowledging each other as brothers and by doing to each other as you would they should do unto you  it may be hard at times to bring this thought home to our minds but it is none the less true because we forget it and if we do not choose to bring it home to our own minds it will be sooner or later brought home to them whether we choose or not  for bear in mind that st paul does not say if one member suffers all the rest ought to suffer with it  he says that they do suffer with it  he does not say merely that we ought to feel for our fellow townsmen he says that god has so tempered the body together as to force one member to have the same care of the others as of itself that if we do not care to feel for them we shall be made to feel with them  one limb cannot choose whether or not it will feel the disease of another limb  if one limb be in pain the whole body must be uneasy whether it will or not  and if one class in a town or parish or county be degraded or in want the whole town or parish or county must be the worse for it  st paul is not preaching up sentimental sympathy  he is telling you of a plain fact  he is not saying it is a very fine and saintly thing and will increase your chance of heaven to help the poor  he is saying if you neglect the poor you neglect yourself if you degrade the poor you degrade yourself  his poverty his carelessness his immorality his dirt his illhealth will punish you for you and he are members of the same body knit together inextricably for weal or woe by the eternal laws according to which the lord jesus christ has constituted human society and if you break those laws they will avenge themselvesmy friends do we not see them avenge themselves daily  the slaveholder refuses to acknowledge that his slave is a member of the same body as himself but he does not go unpunished  the degradation to which he has brought his slave degrades him by throwing open to him the downward path of lust laziness ungoverned and tyrannous tempers and the other sins which have in all ages slowly but surely worked the just ruin of slaveholding states  the sinner is his own tempter and the sinner is his own executioner  he lies in wait for his own life says solomon when he lies in wait for his brothers do you see the same law working in our own free country  if you leave the poor careless and filthy you can obtain no good servants if you leave them profligate they make your sons profligate also if you leave them tempted by want your property is unsafe  if you leave them uneducated reckless improvident you cannot get your work properly done and have to waste time and money in watching your workmen instead of trusting them  why what are all poorrates and countyrates if you will consider but gods plain proof to us that the poor are members of the same body as ourselves and that if we will not help them of our own free will we shall find it necessary to help them against our will  that if we will not pay a little to prevent them becoming pauperized or criminal we must pay a great deal to keep them when they have become so  we may draw a lessonand a most instructive one it isfrom the city of liverpool in which it was lately proved that crimeand especially the crime of uneducated boys and girlshad cost in the last few years the city many times more than it would cost to educate civilize and depauperize the whole rising generation of that city and had been a tax upon the capital and industry of liverpool so enormous that they would have submitted to it from no government on earth and yet they had been blindly inflicting it upon themselves for years simply because they chose to forget that they were their brothers keepers  look again at preventible epidemics like cholera  all the great towns of england have discovered what you i fear are discovering also that the expense of a pestilence and of the widows and orphans which it creates is far greater than the expense of putting a town into such a state of cleanliness as would defy the entrance of the disease  so it is throughout the world  nothing is more expensive than penuriousness nothing more anxious than carelessness and every duty which is bidden to wait returns with seven fresh duties at its back  yes my friends we are members of a body and we must realize that fact by painful experience if we refuse to realize it in public spirit and brotherly kindness and the approval of a good conscience and the knowledge that we are living like our lord and master jesus christ who laboured for all but himself cared for all but himself who counted not his own life dear to himself that by laying it down he might redeem into his own likeness the beings whom he had made and who has placed us on this earth each in his own station each in his own parish that we might follow in his footsteps and live by his spirit which is the spirit of love and fellowfeeling that new and risen life of his which is the life of duty honour and selfsacrifice  yes  let us look rather at this brighter side of the question my friends than at the darker  i will preach the gospel to you rather than the law  i will appeal to your higher feelings rather than to your lower to your love rather than your fear to your honour rather than your selfinterest  it will be pleasanter for me  it will meet with a more cordial response i doubt not from you  some dislike appeals to honour  i cannot as long as st paul himself appeals to it so often both in the individual and in bodies  his whole epistle to philemon is an appeal most delicate and graceful to philemons sense of honourto the thought of what he owed paul of what paul wished him to repay not with money but with generosity  and his appeal to the corinthians is a direct appeal to their honour  not to fears of any punishment or wrath of god but to the respect which they owed to themselves as members of a body the church of corinth and to the respect which they owed to that body as a whole and which they had disgraced by allowing an open scandal in it  and his appeal was successful  they took it just as it was meant and he rejoices in the thought that they did so  for this that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves what indignation what fear what vehement desire what zeal what revenge  in all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter  noble words and nobly answered  my friends you too are members of a body  go and do likewise in the matter of this societys failing funds        may i boldly ask you to alter this today  this remember is no common day  it is a day of thankfulness  the thankfulness which you professed and i doubt not many of you felt on thursday night has not evaporated i trust by sunday morning  you have not yet forgotteni trust that there is many a one who will never forget what you owe as townsmen of this place to god who has preserved you safe through the dangers and sorrows of the past autumn  you owe more than one debt to god  you owe all england owes thanks to him for the late bounteous harvest thanks to him for the present prosperous seedtime  think what our state might have been with scarcity as well as war upon us and pay part of your debt this day  you owe a thankoffering for the cessation of the cholera a thankoffering for the sparing of your own livespay it now  you owe a thankoffering for the glorious victories of our armiespay it now  you belong too to an honourable body which has a noble history and sets you many a noble example show yourselves worthy of that body that history those examples now  and what fitter place than this very church to awaken within you the thought of duty and of public spiritthis church which stands as gods own sign that you are the townsmen the representatives ay some of you the very descendants of many a noble spirit of old timethis church in which gods blessing has been invoked on deeds of patriotism and enterprise of which the whole world now bears the fruitthese walls in which elizabeths heroes your ancestors have prayed before sailing against the spanish armada these walls which saw the baptism of the first red indian convert and the gathering in as it were of the firstfruits of the heathenthese walls in which the early settlers of virginia have invoked gods blessing on those tiny ventures which were destined to become the seeds of a mighty nation and the startingpoint of the united statesthese walls which still bear the monument of your heroic townsman strange who expended for his plaguestricken brethren talents time wealth and at last life itself  for to return and to apply i hope to your consciences the example of the soldier with which i began this sermonshall it be only on the battlefield that the power of fellowfeeling is shown forth  shall public spirit be only strong when it has to destroy and not when it has to save and comfort  god forbid  surely you here have a common corporate life common history common allegiance common interest which should inspire you to do your duty whatsoever it may be for the good of your native place and to show that you feel an honourable selfrespect in the thought that you belong to an ancient and once famous town which though it may be outstripped awhile in the race of commerce need never be outstripped if you will be worthy sons of your worthy ancestors in that race to which st paul exhorts us the race of justice and benevolence the noble rivalry of noble deeds  oh look i beseech you upon this church as its old worshippers the forefathers of many of you who sit here this day were wont to look on it  remember that this church is the sign that you are one town one parish one body that century after century this church has stood to witness to your fathers and your fathers fathers that all who kneel within these walls are brothers rich or poor that all are children of one father redeemed by one saviour taught by one spirit  this this is the blessed truth of which the parish church is token as nought else can bethat you are one body members one of another and that gods blessing is on your union and fellowfeeling that god smiles on your bearing each others burdens and so fulfilling the law of christ  look on this church and do to others as this church witnesses that god has done for you  and now some of you may perhaps have been disappointed some a little scornful at my having used so many words about so small a matter and talked of battles legends heroes of old time all merely to induct you to help this society with a paltry extra thirty pounds  be it so  i shall be glad if you think so  if the matter be so small it is the more easily done if the sum be paltry it is the more easily found  if my reasons are very huge and loud sounding and the result at which i aim very light the result ought to follow all the more certainly for believe me my friends the reasons are good ones scriptural ones practical ones and ought to produce the result  i give you the strongest arguments for showing your christian english public spirit and then i ask you to show it in a very small matter  but be sure that to do what i ask of you to do today is just as much your duty small as it may seem as it would be were you soldiers to venture your lives in the cause of your native land  duty be it in a small matter or a great is duty still the command of heaven the eldest voice of god  and believe me my friends that it is only they who are faithful in a few things who will be faithful over many things only they who do their duty in everyday and trivial matters who will fulfil them on great occasions  we all honour and admire the heroes of alma and balaklava we all trust in god that we should have done our duty also in their place  the best test of that my friends is can we do our duty in our own place  here the duty is undeniable plain easy  here is a society instituted for one purpose which has in order to exist to appropriate the funds destined for quite a different purpose  both purposes are excellent but they are different  the offertory money is meant for the sick the widow and the orphan for those who cannot help themselves  the provident society is meant to encourage those who can help themselves to do so  every farthing therefore taken from the offertory money is taken from the widow and the orphan  i ask you whether this is right and just  i appeal not merely to your prudence and good sense in asking you to promote prudence and good sense among the poor by the provident society i appeal to your honour and compassion on behalf of the sick the widow and orphan that they may have the full enjoyment of the funds intended for them  again i say this may seem a small matter to you and i may seem to be using too many words about it  small  nothing is small which affects not merely the temporal happiness but the eternal welfare of an immortal soul  my friends my friends if any one of you had to support yourself and your children on four seven or even mighty sum ten shillings a week it would not seem a small matter to you then  a few shillings more or less would be to you then a treasure won or lost a matter to you of whether you should keep a house over your childrens heads whether you should keep shoes upon their feet and clothes upon their backs whether you should see them as they grew up tempted by want into theft or profligacy whether you should rise in the morning free enough from the sickening load of anxiety and the care which eats out the core of life and makes men deaf and blind as it does many a one to all pleasant sights and sounds and thoughts till the very sunlight seems blotted out of heaven by that black cloud of carecarecare which rises with you in the morning and dogs you at your work all day even if you are happy enough to have work and sits on your pillow all night long ready to whisper in your ear each time you wake be anxious and troubled about many things  what wilt thou eat and what wilt thou drink and wherewithal wilt thou be clothed for thou hast no heavenly father none above who knowest that thou needest these things before thou askest him  oh my friends if you had felt but for a single day that terrible temptation the temptation of poverty and debt and care which leads so many a one to sell their souls for a few paltry pence to them of as much value as pounds would be to youif i say you had once felt that temptation in all its weight you would not merely sacrifice as i ask you now to do some superfluity which you will never miss you would i do believe if you had human hearts within you be ready to sacrifice even the comforts of life to prevent him whose heart may be breaking slowly not a hundred yards from your own door and more hearts break in this world than you fancy my friends from passing through that same dark shadow of want and care and temptation where the devil stands calling to the poor man all day long fall down and worship me and i will relieve those wants of thine which man neglects  i have no more to say  i leave the rest to your own good feeling as townsmen of this ancient and honourable placeremembering always who it was who said inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me
