74506193	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    double dealing   mr fred carter stood on the spacious common inhaling with all the joy of the holidaymaking londoner the salt smell of the sea below and regarding with some interest the movements of a couple of men who had come to a stop a short distance away  as he looked they came on again eying him closely as they approacheda strongly built shambling man of fifty and a younger man evidently his son  illustration stood on the spacious common inhaling the salt smell of the sea below  goodevening said the former as they came abreast of mr carter  goodevening he replied  thats him said both together  they stood regarding him in a fashion unmistakably hostile  mr carter with an uneasy smile awaited developments  what have you got to say for yourself demanded the elder man at last do you call yourself a man  i dont call myself anything said the puzzled mr carter  perhaps youre mistaking me for somebody else  didnt i tell you said the younger man turning to the otherdidnt i tell you hed say that  he can say what he likes said the other but weve got him now  if he gets away from me hell be cleverer than what he thinks he is  what are we to do with him now weve got him inquired his son  the elder man clenched a huge fist and eyed mr carter savagely  if i was just considering myself he said i should hammer him till i was tired and then chuck him into the sea  his son nodded  that wouldnt do nancy much good though he remarked  i want to do everything for the best said the other and i spose the right and proper thing to do is to take him by the scruff of his neck and run him along to nancy  you try it said mr carter hotly  who is nancy  the other growled and was about to aim a blow at him when his son threw himself upon him and besought him to be calm  just one said his father struggling only one  it would do me good and perhaps hed come along the quieter for it  look here  said mr carter  youre mistaking me for somebody else thats what you are doing  what am i supposed to have done  youre supposed to have come courting my daughter mr somebody else said the other releasing himself and thrusting his face into mr carters and after getting her promise to marry you nipping off to london to arrange for the wedding  shes been mourning over you for four years now having an idea that you had been made away with  being true to your memory you skunk said the son  and wont look at decent chaps that want to marry her added the other  its all a mistake said mr carter  i came down here this morning for the first time in my life  bring him along said the son impatiently  its a waste of time talking to him  mr carter took a step back and parleyed  ill come along with you of my own free will he said hastily just to show you that you are wrong but i wont be forced  he turned and walked back with them towards the town pausing occasionally to admire the view  once he paused so long that an ominous growl arose from the elder of his captors  i was just thinking said mr carter eying him in consternation suppose that she makes the same mistake that you have made  oh lord  keeps it up pretty well dont he jim  said the father  the other grunted and drawing nearer to mr carter as they entered the town stepped along in silence  questions which mr carter asked with the laudable desire of showing his ignorance concerning the neighborhood elicited no reply  his discomfiture was increased by the behavior of an elderly boatman who after looking at him hard took his pipe from his mouth and bade him goodevening  father and son exchanged significant glances  illustration an elderly boatman who after looking at him hard took his pipe from his mouth and bade him goodevening  they turned at last into a small street and the elder man opening the door of a neat cottage laid his hand on the prisoners shoulder and motioned him in  mr carter obeyed and entering a spotless living room removed his hat and with affected composure seated himself in an easychair  ill go up and tell nan said jim  dont let him run away  he sprang up the stairs which led from a corner of the room and the next moment the voice of a young lady laboring under intense excitement fell on the ears of mr carter  with a fine attempt at unconcern he rose and inspected an aged engraving of the sailors return  shell be down in a minute said jim returning  praps its as well that i didnt set about him after all said his father  if i had done what i should like to do his own mother wouldnt have known him  mr carter sniffed defiantly and with a bored air resumed his seat ten minutes passedfifteen at the end of half an hour the elder mans impatience found vent in a tirade against the entire sex  shes dressing up thats what it is explained jim  for him  a door opened above and a step sounded on the stairs  mr carter looked up uneasily and after the first sensation of astonishment had passed wondered vaguely what his double had run away for  the girl her lips parted and her eyes bright came swiftly down into the room  where is he she said quickly  eh said her father in surprise  why there  cant you see  the light died out of the girls face and she looked round in dismay the watchful mr carter thought that he also detected in her glance a spice of that temper which had made her relatives so objectionable  that she said loudly  that  thats not my bert  thats what i told em said mr carter deferentially over and over again  what said her father loudly  look again  if i looked all night it wouldnt make any difference said the disappointed miss evans  the idea of making such a mistake  were all liable to mistakes said mr carter magnanimously even the best of us  you take a good look at him urged her brother and dont forget that its four years since you saw him  isnt that berts nose  no said the girl glancing at the feature in question not a bit like it  bert had a beautiful nose  look at his eyes said jim  miss evans looked and meeting mr carters steady gaze tossed her head scornfully and endeavored to stare him down  realizing too late the magnitude of the task but unwilling to accept defeat she stood confronting him with indignant eyes  well said mr evans misunderstanding  not a bit like said his daughter turning thankfully  and if you dont like bert you neednt insult him  she sat down with her back towards mr carter and looked out at the window  well i could ha sworn it was bert simmons said the discomfited mr evans  me too said his son  id ha sworn to him anywhere  its the most extraordinary likeness ive ever seen  he caught his fathers eye and with a jerk of his thumb telegraphed for instructions as to the disposal of mr carter  he can go said mr evans with an attempt at dignity he can go this time and i hope that thisll be a lesson to him not to go about looking like other people  if he does next time praps he wont escape so easy  youre quite right said mr carter blandly  ill get a new face first thing tomorrow morning  i ought to have done it before  he crossed to the door and nodding to the fermenting mr evans bowed to the profile of miss evans and walked slowly out  envy of mr simmons was mingled with amazement at his deplorable lack of taste and common sense he would willingly have changed places with him  there was evidently a strong likeness and  busy with his thoughts he came to a standstill in the centre of the footpath and then with a sudden air of determination walked slowly back to the house  yes said mr evans as the door opened and the face of mr carter was thrust in  what have you come back for  the other stepped into the room and closed the door softly behind him i have come back he said slowlyi have come back because i feel ashamed of myself  ashamed of yourself repeated mr evans rising and confronting him  mr carter hung his head and gazed nervously in the direction of the girl  i cant keep up this deception he said in a low but distinct voice  i am bert simmons  at least that is the name i told you four years ago  i knew i hadnt made a mistake roared mr evans to his son  i knew him well enough  shut the door jim  dont let him go  i dont want to go said mr carter with a glance in the direction of nancy  i have come back to make amends  fancy nancy not knowing him said jim gazing at the astonished miss evans  she was afraid of getting me into trouble said mr carter and i just gave her a wink not to recognize me but she knew me well enough bless her  how dare you  said the girl starting up  why ive never seen you before in my life  all right nan said the brazen mr carter but its no good keeping it up now  ive come back to act fair and square  miss evans struggled for breath  there he is my girl said her father patting her on the back  hes not much to look at and he treated you very shabby but if you want him i suppose you must have him  want him repeated the incensed miss evans  want him  i tell you its not bert  how dare he come here and call me nan  you used not to mind it said mr carter plaintively  i tell you said miss evans turning to her father and brother its not bert  do you think i dont know  well he ought to know who he is said her father reasonably  of course i ought said mr carter smiling at her  besides what reason should i have for saying i am bert if i am not  thats a fair question said jim as the girl bit her lip  why should he  ask him said the girl tartly  look here my girl said mr evans in ominous accents  for four years youve been grieving over bert and me and jim have been hunting high and low for him  weve got him at last and now youve got to have him  if he dont run away again said jim  i wouldnt trust him farther than i could see him  mr evans sat and glowered at his prospective soninlaw as the difficulties of the situation developed themselves  even mr carters reminders that he had come back and surrendered of his own free will failed to move him and he was hesitating between tying him up and locking him in the attic and hiring a man to watch him when mr carter himself suggested a way out of the difficulty  ill lodge with you he said and ill give you all my money and things to take care of  i cant run away without money  he turned out his pockets on the table  seven pounds eighteen shillings and fourpence with his return ticket made one heap his watch and chain penknife and a few other accessories another  a suggestion of jims that he should add his boots was vetoed by the elder man as unnecessary  there you are said mr evans sweeping the things into his own pockets and the day you are married i hand them back to you  his temper improved as the evening wore on  by the time supper was finished and his pipe alight he became almost jocular and the coldness of miss evans was the only drawback to an otherwise enjoyable evening  just showing off a little temper said her father after she had withdrawn and wants to show she aint going to forgive you too easy not but what you behaved badly however let bygones be bygones thats my idea  the behavior of miss evans was so much better next day that it really seemed as though her fathers diagnosis was correct  at dinner when the men came home from work she piled mr carters plate up so generously that her father and brother had ample time at their disposal to watch him eat  and when he put his hand over his glass she poured half a pint of good beer that other men would have been thankful for up his sleeve  illustration she piled mr carters plate up so generously that her father and brother had ample time at their disposal to watch him eat  she was out all the afternoon but at tea time she sat next to mr carter and joined brightly in the conversation concerning her marriage she addressed him as bert and when he furtively pressed her hand beneath the tablecloth she made no attempt to withdraw it  i cant think how it was you didnt know him at first said her father youre usually wideawake enough  silly of me said nancy but i am silly sometimes  mr carter pressed her hand again and gazing tenderly into her eyes received a glance in return which set him thinking  it was too cold and calculating for real affection in fact after another glance he began to doubt if it indicated affection at all  its like old times bert said miss evans with an odd smile  do you remember what you said that afternoon when i put the hot spoon on your neck  yes was the reply  what was it inquired the girl  i wont repeat it said mr carter firmly  he was reminded of other episodes during the meal but by the exercise of tact and the plea of a bad memory did fairly well  he felt that he had done very well indeed when having cleared the teathings away nancy came and sat beside him with her hand in his  her brother grunted but mr evans in whom a vein of sentiment still lingered watched them with much satisfaction  mr carter had got possession of both hands and was murmuring fulsome flatteries when the sound of somebody pausing at the open door caused them to be hastily withdrawn  evening mr evans said a young man putting his head in  why halloa  bert  well of all the  halloa said mr carter with attempted enthusiasm as he rose from his chair  i thought you was lost said the other stepping in and gripping his hand  i never thought i was going to set eyes on you again  well this is a surprise  you aint forgot joe wilson have you  course i havent joe said mr carter  id have known you anywhere  he shook hands effusively and mr wilson after a little pretended hesitation accepted a chair and began to talk about old times  i lay you aint forgot one thing bert he said at last  whats that inquired the other  that arfquid i lent you said mr wilson  mr carter after the first shock of surprise pretended to think mr wilson supplying him with details as to time and place which he was in no position to dispute  he turned to mr evans who was still acting as his banker and after a little hesitation requested him to pay the money  conversation seemed to fail somewhat after that and mr wilson during an awkward pause went off whistling  same old joe said mr carter lightly after he had gone  he hasnt altered a bit  miss evans glanced at him but said nothing  she was looking instead towards a gentleman of middle age who was peeping round the door indulging in a waggish game of peepbo with the unconscious mr carter finding that he had at last attracted his attention the gentleman came inside and breathing somewhat heavily after his exertions stood before him with outstretched hand  illustration a gentleman of middle age was peeping round the door  how goes it said mr carter forcing a smile and shaking hands  hes grown betterlooking than ever said the gentleman subsiding into a chair  so have you said mr carter  i should hardly have known you  well i m glad to see you again said the other in a more subdued fashion  were all glad to see you back and i ope that when the wedding cake is sent out therell be a bit for old ben prout  youll be the first ben said mr carter quickly  mr prout got up and shook hands with him again  it only shows what mistakes a man can make he said resuming his seat  it only shows how easy it is to misjudge ones fellowcreeturs  when you went away sudden four years ago i says to myself ben prout i says make up your mind to it that two quid has gorn  the smile vanished from mr carters face and a sudden chill descended upon the company  two quid  he said stiffly  what two quid  the two quid i lent you said mr prout in a pained voice  when said mr carter struggling  when you and i met him that evening on the pier said miss evans in a matteroffact voice  mr carter started and gazed at her uneasily  the smile on her lip and the triumphant gleam in her eye were a revelation to him  he turned to mr evans and in as calm a voice as he could assume requested him to discharge the debt  mr prout his fingers twitching stood waiting well its your money said mr evans grudgingly extracting a purse from his trouserpocket and i suppose you ought to pay your debts still  he put down two pounds on the table and broke off in sudden amazement as mr prout snatching up the money bolted headlong from the room  his surprise was shared by his son but the other two made no sign  mr carter was now prepared for the worst and his voice was quite calm as he gave instructions for the payment of the other three gentlemen who presented claims during the evening endorsed by miss evans  as the last departed mr evans whose temper had been gradually getting beyond his control crossed over and handed him his watch and chain a few coppers and the return half of his railway ticket  i think we can do without you after all he said breathing thickly ive no doubt you owe money all over england  youre a cadger thats what you are  he pointed to the door and mr carter after twice opening his lips to speak and failing blundered towards it miss evans watched him curiously  cheats never prosper she said with gentle severity  goodby said mr carter pausing at the door  its your own fault continued miss evans who was suffering from a slight touch of conscience  if you hadnt come here pretending to be bert simmons and calling me nan as if you had known me all my life i wouldnt have done it  it doesnt matter said mr carter  i wish i was bert simmons thats all  goodby  wish you was said mr evans who had been listening in openmouthed astonishment  look here  man to manare you bert simmons or are you not  no said mr carter  of course not said nancy  and you didnt owe that money  nobody owed it said nancy  it was done just to punish him  mr evans with a strange cry blundered towards the door  ill have that money out of em he roared if i have to hold em up and shake it out of their trouserpockets  you stay here  he hurried up the road and jim with the set face of a man going into action against heavy odds followed him  your father told me to stay said mr carter coming farther into the room  nancy looked up at him through her eyelashes  you need not unless you want to she said very softly
