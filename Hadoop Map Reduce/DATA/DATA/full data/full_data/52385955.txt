is ended and summer is gone quoted anne shirley gazing across the shorn fields dreamily she and diana barry had been picking apples in the green gables orchard but were now resting from their labors in a sunny corner where airy fleets of thistledown drifted by on the wings of a wind that was still summersweet with the incense of ferns in the haunted wood  but everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn the sea was roaring hollowly in the distance the fields were bare and sere scarfed with golden rod the brook valley below green gables overflowed with asters of ethereal purple and the lake of shining waters was blueblueblue not the changeful blue of spring nor the pale azure of summer but a clear steadfast serene blue as if the water were past all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams  it has been a nice summer said diana twisting the new ring on her left hand with a smile and miss lavendars wedding seemed to come as a sort of crown to it i suppose mr and mrs irving are on the pacific coast now  it seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the world sighed anne  i cant believe it is only a week since they were married everything has changed miss lavendar and mr and mrs allan gonehow lonely the manse looks with the shutters all closed i went past it last night and it made me feel as if everybody in it had died  well never get another minister as nice as mr allan said diana with gloomy conviction i suppose well have all kinds of supplies this winter and half the sundays no preaching at all and you and gilbert goneit will be awfully dull  fred will be here insinuated anne slyly  when is mrs lynde going to move up asked diana as if she had not heard annes remark  tomorrow im glad shes comingbut it will be another change marilla and i cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday do you know i hated to do it of course it was sillybut it did seem as if we were committing sacrilege that old spare room has always seemed like a shrine to me when i was a child i thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world you remember what a consuming desire i had to sleep in a spare room bedbut not the green gables spare room oh no never there it would have been too terriblei couldnt have slept a wink from awe i never walked through that room when marilla sent me in on an errandno indeed i tiptoed through it and held my breath as if i were in church and felt relieved when i got out of it the pictures of george whitefield and the duke of wellington hung there one on each side of the mirror and frowned so sternly at me all the time i was in especially if i dared peep in the mirror which was the only one in the house that didnt twist my face a little i always wondered how marilla dared houseclean that room and now its not only cleaned but stripped bare george whitefield and the duke have been relegated to the upstairs hall so passes the glory of this world concluded anne with a laugh in which there was a little note of regret it is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated even when we have outgrown them  ill be so lonesome when you go moaned diana for the hundredth time and to think you go next week  but were together still said anne cheerily we mustnt let next week rob us of this weeks joy i hate the thought of going myselfhome and i are such good friends talk of being lonesome its i who should groan youll be here with any number of your old friendsand fred while i shall be alone among strangers not knowing a soul  except gilbertand charlie sloane said diana imitating annes italics and slyness  charlie sloane will be a great comfort of course agreed anne sarcastically whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed diana knew exactly what anne thought of charlie sloane but despite sundry confidential talks she did not know just what anne thought of gilbert blythe to be sure anne herself did not know that  the boys may be boarding at the other end of kingsport for all i know anne went on i am glad im going to redmond and i am sure i shall like it after a while but for the first few weeks i know i wont i shant even have the comfort of looking forward to the weekend visit home as i had when i went to queens christmas will seem like a thousand years away  everything is changingor going to change said diana sadly i have a feeling that things will never be the same again anne  we have come to a parting of the ways i suppose said anne thoughtfully we had to come to it do you think diana that being grownup is really as nice as we used to imagine it would be when we were children  i dont knowthere are some nice things about it answered diana again caressing her ring with that little smile which always had the effect of making anne feel suddenly left out and inexperienced but there are so many puzzling things too sometimes i feel as if being grownup just frightened meand then i would give anything to be a little girl again  i suppose well get used to being grownup in time said anne cheerfully there wont be so many unexpected things about it by and bythough after all i fancy its the unexpected things that give spice to life were eighteen diana in two more years well be twenty when i was ten i thought twenty was a green old age in no time youll be a staid middleaged matron and i shall be nice old maid aunt anne coming to visit you on vacations youll always keep a corner for me wont you di darling not the spare room of courseold maids cant aspire to spare rooms and i shall be as umble as uriah heep and quite content with a little overtheporch or offtheparlor cubby hole  what nonsense you do talk anne laughed diana youll marry somebody splendid and handsome and richand no spare room in avonlea will be half gorgeous enough for youand youll turn up your nose at all the friends of your youth  that would be a pity my nose is quite nice but i fear turning it up would spoil it said anne patting that shapely organ i havent so many good features that i could afford to spoil those i have so even if i should marry the king of the cannibal islands i promise you i wont turn up my nose at you diana  with another gay laugh the girls separated diana to return to orchard slope anne to walk to the post office she found a letter awaiting her there and when gilbert blythe overtook her on the bridge over the lake of shining waters she was sparkling with the excitement of it  priscilla grant is going to redmond too she exclaimed isnt that splendid i hoped she would but she didnt think her father would consent he has however and were to board together i feel that i can face an army with bannersor all the professors of redmond in one fell phalanxwith a chum like priscilla by my side  i think well like kingsport said gilbert its a nice old burg they tell me and has the finest natural park in the world ive heard that the scenery in it is magnificent  i wonder if it will becan beany more beautiful than this murmured anne looking around her with the loving enraptured eyes of those to whom home must always be the loveliest spot in the world no matter what fairer lands may lie under alien stars  they were leaning on the bridge of the old pond drinking deep of the enchantment of the dusk just at the spot where anne had climbed from her sinking dory on the day elaine floated down to camelot the fine empurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies but the moon was rising and the water lay like a great silver dream in her light remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures  you are very quiet anne said gilbert at last  im afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will vanish just like a broken silence breathed anne  gilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying on the rail of the bridge his hazel eyes deepened into darkness his still boyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope that thrilled his soul but anne snatched her hand away and turned quickly the spell of the dusk was broken for her  i must go home she exclaimed with a rather overdone carelessness marilla had a headache this afternoon and im sure the twins will be in some dreadful mischief by this time i really shouldnt have stayed away so long  she chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently until they reached the green gables lane poor gilbert hardly had a chance to get a word in edgewise anne felt rather relieved when they parted there had been a new secret selfconsciousness in her heart with regard to gilbert ever since that fleeting moment of revelation in the garden of echo lodge something alien had intruded into the old perfect schoolday comradeshipsomething that threatened to mar it  i never felt glad to see gilbert go before she thought halfresentfully halfsorrowfully as she walked alone up the lane our friendship will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense it mustnt be spoiledi wont let it oh why cant boys be just sensible  anne had an uneasy doubt that it was not strictly sensible that she should still feel on her hand the warm pressure of gilberts as distinctly as she had felt it for the swift second his had rested there and still less sensible that the sensation was far from being an unpleasant onevery different from that which had attended a similar demonstration on charlie sloanes part when she had been sitting out a dance with him at a white sands party three nights before anne shivered over the disagreeable recollection but all problems connected with infatuated swains vanished from her mind when she entered the homely unsentimental atmosphere of the green gables kitchen where an eightyearold boy was crying grievously on the sofa  what is the matter davy asked anne taking him up in her arms where are marilla and dora  marillas putting dora to bed sobbed davy and im crying cause dora fell down the outside cellar steps heels over head and scraped all the skin off her nose and  oh well dont cry about it dear of course you are sorry for her but crying wont help her any shell be all right tomorrow crying never helps any one davyboy and  i aint crying cause dora fell down cellar said davy cutting short annes wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness im crying cause i wasnt there to see her fall im always missing some fun or other seems to me  oh davy anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter would you call it fun to see poor little dora fall down the steps and get hurt  she wasnt much hurt said davy defiantly course if shed been killed id have been real sorry anne but the keiths aint so easy killed theyre like the blewetts i guess herb blewett fell off the hayloft last wednesday and rolled right down through the turnip chute into the box stall where they had a fearful wild cross horse and rolled right under his heels and still he got out alive with only three bones broke mrs lynde says there are some folks you cant kill with a meataxe is mrs lynde coming here tomorrow anne  yes davy and i hope youll be always very nice and good to her  ill be nice and good but will she ever put me to bed at nights anne  perhaps why  cause said davy very decidedly if she does i wont say my prayers before her like i do before you anne  why not  cause i dont think it would be nice to talk to god before strangers anne dora can say hers to mrs lynde if she likes but i wont ill wait till shes gone and then say em wont that be all right anne  yes if you are sure you wont forget to say them davyboy  oh i wont forget you bet i think saying my prayers is great fun but it wont be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you i wish youd stay home anne i dont see what you want to go away and leave us for  i dont exactly want to davy but i feel i ought to go  if you dont want to go you neednt youre grown up when im grown up im not going to do one single thing i dont want to do anne  all your life davy youll find yourself doing things you dont want to do  i wont said davy flatly catch me i have to do things i dont want to now cause you and marillall send me to bed if i dont but when i grow up you cant do that and therell be nobody to tell me not to do things wont i have the time say anne milty boulter says his mother says youre going to college to see if you can catch a man are you anne i want to know  for a second anne burned with resentment then she laughed reminding herself that mrs boulters crude vulgarity of thought and speech could not harm her  no davy im not im going to study and grow and learn about many things  what things       shoes and ships and sealing wax      and cabbages and kings  quoted anne  but if you did want to catch a man how would you go about it i want to know persisted davy for whom the subject evidently possessed a certain fascination  youd better ask mrs boulter said anne thoughtlessly i think its likely she knows more about the process than i do  i will the next time i see her said davy gravely  davy if you do cried anne realizing her mistake  but you just told me to protested davy aggrieved  its time you went to bed decreed anne by way of getting out of the scrape  after davy had gone to bed anne wandered down to victoria island and sat there alone curtained with finespun moonlit gloom while the water laughed around her in a duet of brook and wind anne had always loved that brook many a dream had she spun over its sparkling water in days gone by she forgot lovelorn youths and the cayenne speeches of malicious neighbors and all the problems of her girlish existence in imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of faery lands forlorn where lost atlantis and elysium lie with the evening star for pilot to the land of hearts desire and she was richer in those dreams than in realities for things seen pass away but the things that are unseen are eternal     chapter ii  garlands of autumn   the following week sped swiftly crowded with innumerable last things as anne called them goodbye calls had to be made and received being pleasant or otherwise according to whether callers and calledupon were heartily in sympathy with annes hopes or thought she was too much puffedup over going to college and that it was their duty to take her down a peg or two  the avis gave a farewell party in honor of anne and gilbert one evening at the home of josie pye choosing that place partly because mr pyes house was large and convenient partly because it was strongly suspected that the pye girls would have nothing to do with the affair if their offer of the house for the party was not accepted it was a very pleasant little time for the pye girls were gracious and said and did nothing to mar the harmony of the occasionwhich was not according to their wont josie was unusually amiableso much so that she even remarked condescendingly to anne  your new dress is rather becoming to you anne really you look almost pretty in it  how kind of you to say so responded anne with dancing eyes her sense of humor was developing and the speeches that would have hurt her at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now josie suspected that anne was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes but she contented herself with whispering to gertie as they went downstairs that anne shirley would put on more airs than ever now that she was going to collegeyoud see  all the old crowd was there full of mirth and zest and youthful lightheartedness diana barry rosy and dimpled shadowed by the faithful fred jane andrews neat and sensible and plain ruby gillis looking her handsomest and brightest in a cream silk blouse with red geraniums in her golden hair gilbert blythe and charlie sloane both trying to keep as near the elusive anne as possible carrie sloane looking pale and melancholy because so it was reported her father would not allow oliver kimball to come near the place moody spurgeon macpherson whose round face and objectionable ears were as round and objectionable as ever and billy andrews who sat in a corner all the evening chuckled when any one spoke to him and watched anne shirley with a grin of pleasure on his broad freckled countenance  anne had known beforehand of the party but she had not known that she and gilbert were as the founders of the society to be presented with a very complimentary address and tokens of respectin her case a volume of shakespeares plays in gilberts a fountain pen she was so taken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address read in moody spurgeons most solemn and ministerial tones that the tears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes she had worked hard and faithfully for the avis and it warmed the cockles of her heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely and they were all so nice and friendly and jollyeven the pye girls had their merits at that moment anne loved all the world  she enjoyed the evening tremendously but the end of it rather spoiled all gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental to her as they ate their supper on the moonlit verandah and anne to punish him was gracious to charlie sloane and allowed the latter to walk home with her she found however that revenge hurts nobody quite so much as the one who tries to inflict it gilbert walked airily off with ruby gillis and anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily as they loitered along in the still crisp autumn air they were evidently having the best of good times while she was horribly bored by charlie sloane who talked unbrokenly on and never even by accident said one thing that was worth listening to anne gave an occasional absent yes or no and thought how beautiful ruby had looked that night how very goggly charlies eyes were in the moonlightworse even than by daylightand that the world somehow wasnt quite such a nice place as she had believed it to be earlier in the evening  im just tired outthat is what is the matter with me she said when she thankfully found herself alone in her own room and she honestly believed it was but a certain little gush of joy as from some secret unknown spring bubbled up in her heart the next evening when she saw gilbert striding down through the haunted wood and crossing the old log bridge with that firm quick step of his so gilbert was not going to spend this last evening with ruby gillis after all  you look tired anne he said  i am tired and worse than that im disgruntled im tired because ive been packing my trunk and sewing all day but im disgruntled because six women have been here to say goodbye to me and every one of the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right out of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a november morning  spiteful old cats was gilberts elegant comment  oh no they werent said anne seriously that is just the trouble if they had been spiteful cats i wouldnt have minded them but they are all nice kind motherly souls who like me and whom i like and that is why what they said or hinted had such undue weight with me they let me see they thought i was crazy going to redmond and trying to take a ba and ever since ive been wondering if i am mrs peter sloane sighed and said she hoped my strength would hold out till i got through and at once i saw myself a hopeless victim of nervous prostration at the end of my third year mrs eben wright said it must cost an awful lot to put in four years at redmond and i felt all over me that it was unpardonable of me to squander marillas money and my own on such a folly mrs jasper bell said she hoped i wouldnt let college spoil me as it did some people and i felt in my bones that the end of my four redmond years would see me a most insufferable creature thinking i knew it all and looking down on everything and everybody in avonlea mrs elisha wright said she understood that redmond girls especially those who belonged to kingsport were dreadful dressy and stuckup and she guessed i wouldnt feel much at home among them and i saw myself a snubbed dowdy humiliated country girl shuffling through redmonds classic halls in coppertoned boots  anne ended with a laugh and a sigh commingled with her sensitive nature all disapproval had weight even the disapproval of those for whose opinions she had scant respect for the time being life was savorless and ambition had gone out like a snuffed candle  you surely dont care for what they said protested gilbert you know exactly how narrow their outlook on life is excellent creatures though they are to do anything they have never done is anathema maranatha you are the first avonlea girl who has ever gone to college and you know that all pioneers are considered to be afflicted with moonstruck madness  oh i know but feeling is so different from knowing my common sense tells me all you can say but there are times when common sense has no power over me common nonsense takes possession of my soul really after mrs elisha went away i hardly had the heart to finish packing  youre just tired anne come forget it all and take a walk with mea ramble back through the woods beyond the marsh there should be something there i want to show you  should be dont you know if it is there  no i only know it should be from something i saw there in spring come on well pretend we are two children again and well go the way of the wind  they started gaily off anne remembering the unpleasantness of the preceding evening was very nice to gilbert and gilbert who was learning wisdom took care to be nothing save the schoolboy comrade again mrs lynde and marilla watched them from the kitchen window  thatll be a match some day mrs lynde said approvingly  marilla winced slightly in her heart she hoped it would but it went against her grain to hear the matter spoken of in mrs lyndes gossipy matteroffact way  theyre only children yet she said shortly  mrs lynde laughed goodnaturedly  anne is eighteen i was married when i was that age we old folks marilla are too much given to thinking children never grow up thats what anne is a young woman and gilberts a man and he worships the ground she walks on as any one can see hes a fine fellow and anne cant do better i hope she wont get any romantic nonsense into her head at redmond i dont approve of them coeducational places and never did thats what i dont believe concluded mrs lynde solemnly that the students at such colleges ever do much else than flirt  they must study a little said marilla with a smile  precious little sniffed mrs rachel however i think anne will she never was flirtatious but she doesnt appreciate gilbert at his full value thats what oh i know girls charlie sloane is wild about her too but id never advise her to marry a sloane the sloanes are good honest respectable people of course but when alls said and done theyre sloanes  marilla nodded to an outsider the statement that sloanes were sloanes might not be very illuminating but she understood every village has such a family good honest respectable people they may be but sloanes they are and must ever remain though they speak with the tongues of men and angels  gilbert and anne happily unconscious that their future was thus being settled by mrs rachel were sauntering through the shadows of the haunted wood beyond the harvest hills were basking in an amber sunset radiance under a pale aerial sky of rose and blue the distant spruce groves were burnished bronze and their long shadows barred the upland meadows but around them a little wind sang among the fir tassels and in it there was the note of autumn  this wood really is haunted nowby old memories said anne stooping to gather a spray of ferns bleached to waxen whiteness by frost it seems to me that the little girls diana and i used to be play here still and sit by the dryads bubble in the twilights trysting with the ghosts do you know i can never go up this path in the dusk without feeling a bit of the old fright and shiver there was one especially horrifying phantom which we createdthe ghost of the murdered child that crept up behind you and laid cold fingers on yours i confess that to this day i cannot help fancying its little furtive footsteps behind me when i come here after nightfall im not afraid of the white lady or the headless man or the skeletons but i wish i had never imagined that babys ghost into existence how angry marilla and mrs barry were over that affair concluded anne with reminiscent laughter  the woods around the head of the marsh were full of purple vistas threaded with gossamers past a dour plantation of gnarled spruces and a maplefringed sunwarm valley they found the something gilbert was looking for  ah here it is he said with satisfaction  an apple treeand away back here exclaimed anne delightedly  yes a veritable applebearing apple tree too here in the very midst of pines and beeches a mile away from any orchard i was here one day last spring and found it all white with blossom so i resolved id come again in the fall and see if it had been apples see its loaded they look good tootawny as russets but with a dusky red cheek most wild seedlings are green and uninviting  i suppose it sprang years ago from some chancesown seed said anne dreamily and how it has grown and flourished and held its own here all alone among aliens the brave determined thing  heres a fallen tree with a cushion of moss sit down anneit will serve for a woodland throne ill climb for some apples they all grow highthe tree had to reach up to the sunlight  the apples proved to be delicious under the tawny skin was a white white flesh faintly veined with red and besides their own proper apple taste they had a certain wild delightful tang no orchardgrown apple ever possessed  the fatal apple of eden couldnt have had a rarer flavor commented anne but its time we were going home see it was twilight three minutes ago and now its moonlight what a pity we couldnt have caught the moment of transformation but such moments never are caught i suppose  lets go back around the marsh and home by way of lovers lane do you feel as disgruntled now as when you started out anne  not i those apples have been as manna to a hungry soul i feel that i shall love redmond and have a splendid four years there  and after those four yearswhat  oh theres another bend in the road at their end answered anne lightly ive no idea what may be around iti dont want to have its nicer not to know  lovers lane was a dear place that night still and mysteriously dim in the pale radiance of the moonlight they loitered through it in a pleasant chummy silence neither caring to talk  if gilbert were always as he has been this evening how nice and simple everything would be reflected anne  gilbert was looking at anne as she walked along in her light dress with her slender delicacy she made him think of a white iris  i wonder if i can ever make her care for me he thought with a pang of selfdistrust     chapter iii  greeting and farewell   charlie sloane gilbert blythe and anne shirley left avonlea the following monday morning anne had hoped for a fine day diana was to drive her to the station and they wanted this their last drive together for some time to be a pleasant one but when anne went to bed sunday night the east wind was moaning around green gables with an ominous prophecy which was fulfilled in the morning anne awoke to find raindrops pattering against her window and shadowing the ponds gray surface with widening rings hills and sea were hidden in mist and the whole world seemed dim and dreary anne dressed in the cheerless gray dawn for an early start was necessary to catch the boat train she struggled against the tears that would well up in her eyes in spite of herself she was leaving the home that was so dear to her and something told her that she was leaving it forever save as a holiday refuge things would never be the same again coming back for vacations would not be living there and oh how dear and beloved everything wasthat little white porch room sacred to the dreams of girlhood the old snow queen at the window the brook in the hollow the dryads bubble the haunted woods and lovers laneall the thousand and one dear spots where memories of the old years bided could she ever be really happy anywhere else  breakfast at green gables that morning was a rather doleful meal davy for the first time in his life probably could not eat but blubbered shamelessly over his porridge nobody else seemed to have much appetite save dora who tucked away her rations comfortably dora like the immortal and most prudent charlotte who went on cutting bread and butter when her frenzied lovers body had been carried past on a shutter was one of those fortunate creatures who are seldom disturbed by anything even at eight it took a great deal to ruffle doras placidity she was sorry anne was going away of course but was that any reason why she should fail to appreciate a poached egg on toast not at all and seeing that davy could not eat his dora ate it for him  promptly on time diana appeared with horse and buggy her rosy face glowing above her raincoat the goodbyes had to be said then somehow mrs lynde came in from her quarters to give anne a hearty embrace and warn her to be careful of her health whatever she did marilla brusque and tearless pecked annes cheek and said she supposed theyd hear from her when she got settled a casual observer might have concluded that annes going mattered very little to herunless said observer had happened to get a good look in her eyes dora kissed anne primly and squeezed out two decorous little tears but davy who had been crying on the back porch step ever since they rose from the table refused to say goodbye at all when he saw anne coming towards him he sprang to his feet bolted up the back stairs and hid in a clothes closet out of which he would not come his muffled howls were the last sounds anne heard as she left green gables  it rained heavily all the way to bright river to which station they had to go since the branch line train from carmody did not connect with the boat train charlie and gilbert were on the station platform when they reached it and the train was whistling anne had just time to get her ticket and trunk check say a hurried farewell to diana and hasten on board she wished she were going back with diana to avonlea she knew she was going to die of homesickness and oh if only that dismal rain would stop pouring down as if the whole world were weeping over summer vanished and joys departed even gilberts presence brought her no comfort for charlie sloane was there too and sloanishness could be tolerated only in fine weather it was absolutely insufferable in rain  but when the boat steamed out of charlottetown harbor things took a turn for the better the rain ceased and the sun began to burst out goldenly now and again between the rents in the clouds burnishing the gray seas with copperhued radiance and lighting up the mists that curtained the islands red shores with gleams of gold foretokening a fine day after all besides charlie sloane promptly became so seasick that he had to go below and anne and gilbert were left alone on deck  i am very glad that all the sloanes get seasick as soon as they go on water thought anne mercilessly i am sure i couldnt take my farewell look at the ould sod with charlie standing there pretending to look sentimentally at it too  well were off remarked gilbert unsentimentally  yes i feel like byrons childe haroldonly it isnt really my native shore that im watching said anne winking her gray eyes vigorously nova scotia is that i suppose but ones native shore is the land one loves the best and thats good old pei for me i cant believe i didnt always live here those eleven years before i came seem like a bad dream its seven years since i crossed on this boatthe evening mrs spencer brought me over from hopetown i can see myself in that dreadful old wincey dress and faded sailor hat exploring decks and cabins with enraptured curiosity it was a fine evening and how those red island shores did gleam in the sunshine now im crossing the strait again oh gilbert i do hope ill like redmond and kingsport but im sure i wont  wheres all your philosophy gone anne  its all submerged under a great swamping wave of loneliness and homesickness ive longed for three years to go to redmondand now im goingand i wish i werent never mind i shall be cheerful and philosophical again after i have just one good cry i must have that as a wentand ill have to wait until i get into my boardinghouse bed tonight wherever it may be before i can have it then anne will be herself again i wonder if davy has come out of the closet yet  it was nine that night when their train reached kingsport and they found themselves in the bluewhite glare of the crowded station anne felt horribly bewildered but a moment later she was seized by priscilla grant who had come to kingsport on saturday  here you are beloved and i suppose youre as tired as i was when i got here saturday night  tired priscilla dont talk of it im tired and green and provincial and only about ten years old for pitys sake take your poor brokendown chum to some place where she can hear herself think  ill take you right up to our boardinghouse ive a cab ready outside  its such a blessing youre here prissy if you werent i think i should just sit down on my suitcase here and now and weep bitter tears what a comfort one familiar face is in a howling wilderness of strangers  is that gilbert blythe over there anne how he has grown up this past year he was only a schoolboy when i taught in carmody and of course thats charlie sloane he hasnt changedcouldnt he looked just like that when he was born and hell look like that when hes eighty this way dear well be home in twenty minutes  home groaned anne you mean well be in some horrible boardinghouse in a still more horrible hall bedroom looking out on a dingy back yard  it isnt a horrible boardinghouse annegirl heres our cab hop inthe driver will get your trunk oh yes the boardinghouseits really a very nice place of its kind as youll admit tomorrow morning when a good nights sleep has turned your blues rosy pink its a big oldfashioned gray stone house on st john street just a nice little constitutional from redmond it used to be the residence of great folk but fashion has deserted st john street and its houses only dream now of better days theyre so big that people living in them have to take boarders just to fill up at least that is the reason our landladies are very anxious to impress on us theyre delicious anneour landladies i mean  how many are there  two miss hannah harvey and miss ada harvey they were born twins about fifty years ago  i cant get away from twins it seems smiled anne wherever i go they confront me  oh theyre not twins now dear after they reached the age of thirty they never were twins again miss hannah has grown old not too gracefully and miss ada has stayed thirty less gracefully still i dont know whether miss hannah can smile or not ive never caught her at it so far but miss ada smiles all the time and thats worse however theyre nice kind souls and they take two boarders every year because miss hannahs economical soul cannot bear to waste room spacenot because they need to or have to as miss ada has told me seven times since saturday night as for our rooms i admit they are hall bedrooms and mine does look out on the back yard your room is a front one and looks out on old st johns graveyard which is just across the street  that sounds gruesome shivered anne i think id rather have the back yard view  oh no you wouldnt wait and see old st johns is a darling place its been a graveyard so long that its ceased to be one and has become one of the sights of kingsport i was all through it yesterday for a pleasure exertion theres a big stone wall and a row of enormous trees all around it and rows of trees all through it and the queerest old tombstones with the queerest and quaintest inscriptions youll go there to study anne see if you dont of course nobody is ever buried there now but a few years ago they put up a beautiful monument to the memory of nova scotian soldiers who fell in the crimean war it is just opposite the entrance gates and theres scope for imagination in it as you used to say heres your trunk at lastand the boys coming to say good night must i really shake hands with charlie sloane anne his hands are always so cold and fishyfeeling we must ask them to call occasionally miss hannah gravely told me we could have young gentlemen callers two evenings in the week if they went away at a reasonable hour and miss ada asked me smiling please to be sure they didnt sit on her beautiful cushions i promised to see to it but goodness knows where else they can sit unless they sit on the floor for there are cushions on everything miss ada even has an elaborate battenburg one on top of the piano  anne was laughing by this time priscillas gay chatter had the intended effect of cheering her up homesickness vanished for the time being and did not even return in full force when she finally found herself alone in her little bedroom she went to her window and looked out the street below was dim and quiet across it the moon was shining above the trees in old st johns just behind the great dark head of the lion on the monument anne wondered if it could have been only that morning that she had left green gables she had the sense of a long passage of time which one day of change and travel gives  i suppose that very moon is looking down on green gables now she mused but i wont think about itthat way homesickness lies im not even going to have my good cry ill put that off to a more convenient season and just now ill go calmly and sensibly to bed and to sleep     chapter iv  aprils lady   kingsport is a quaint old town hearking back to early colonial days and wrapped in its ancient atmosphere as some fine old dame in garments fashioned like those of her youth here and there it sprouts out into modernity but at heart it is still unspoiled it is full of curious relics and haloed by the romance of many legends of the past once it was a mere frontier station on the fringe of the wilderness and those were the days when indians kept life from being monotonous to the settlers then it grew to be a bone of contention between the british and the french being occupied now by the one and now by the other emerging from each occupation with some fresh scar of battling nations branded on it  it has in its park a martello tower autographed all over by tourists a dismantled old french fort on the hills beyond the town and several antiquated cannon in its public squares it has other historic spots also which may be hunted out by the curious and none is more quaint and delightful than old st johns cemetery at the very core of the town with streets of quiet oldtime houses on two sides and busy bustling modern thoroughfares on the others every citizen of kingsport feels a thrill of possessive pride in old st johns for if he be of any pretensions at all he has an ancestor buried there with a queer crooked slab at his head or else sprawling protectively over the grave on which all the main facts of his history are recorded for the most part no great art or skill was lavished on those old tombstones the larger number are of roughly chiselled brown or gray native stone and only in a few cases is there any attempt at ornamentation some are adorned with skull and crossbones and this grizzly decoration is frequently coupled with a cherubs head many are prostrate and in ruins into almost all times tooth has been gnawing until some inscriptions have been completely effaced and others can only be deciphered with difficulty the graveyard is very full and very bowery for it is surrounded and intersected by rows of elms and willows beneath whose shade the sleepers must lie very dreamlessly forever crooned to by the winds and leaves over them and quite undisturbed by the clamor of traffic just beyond  anne took the first of many rambles in old st johns the next afternoon she and priscilla had gone to redmond in the forenoon and registered as students after which there was nothing more to do that day the girls gladly made their escape for it was not exhilarating to be surrounded by crowds of strangers most of whom had a rather alien appearance as if not quite sure where they belonged  the freshettes stood about in detached groups of two or three looking askance at each other the freshies wiser in their day and generation had banded themselves together on the big staircase of the entrance hall where they were shouting out glees with all the vigor of youthful lungs as a species of defiance to their traditional enemies the sophomores a few of whom were prowling loftily about looking properly disdainful of the unlicked cubs on the stairs gilbert and charlie were nowhere to be seen  little did i think the day would ever come when id be glad of the sight of a sloane said priscilla as they crossed the campus but id welcome charlies goggle eyes almost ecstatically at least theyd be familiar eyes  oh sighed anne i cant describe how i felt when i was standing there waiting my turn to be registeredas insignificant as the teeniest drop in a most enormous bucket its bad enough to feel insignificant but its unbearable to have it grained into your soul that you will never can never be anything but insignificant and that is how i did feelas if i were invisible to the naked eye and some of those sophs might step on me i knew i would go down to my grave unwept unhonored and unsung  wait till next year comforted priscilla then well be able to look as bored and sophisticated as any sophomore of them all no doubt it is rather dreadful to feel insignificant but i think its better than to feel as big and awkward as i didas if i were sprawled all over redmond thats how i felti suppose because i was a good two inches taller than any one else in the crowd i wasnt afraid a soph might walk over me i was afraid theyd take me for an elephant or an overgrown sample of a potatofed islander  i suppose the trouble is we cant forgive big redmond for not being little queens said anne gathering about her the shreds of her old cheerful philosophy to cover her nakedness of spirit when we left queens we knew everybody and had a place of our own i suppose we have been unconsciously expecting to take life up at redmond just where we left off at queens and now we feel as if the ground had slipped from under our feet im thankful that neither mrs lynde nor mrs elisha wright know or ever will know my state of mind at present they would exult in saying i told you so and be convinced it was the beginning of the end whereas it is just the end of the beginning  exactly that sounds more anneish in a little while well be acclimated and acquainted and all will be well anne did you notice the girl who stood alone just outside the door of the coeds dressing room all the morningthe pretty one with the brown eyes and crooked mouth  yes i did i noticed her particularly because she seemed the only creature there who looked as lonely and friendless as i felt i had you but she had no one  i think she felt pretty allbyherselfish too several times i saw her make a motion as if to cross over to us but she never did ittoo shy i suppose i wished she would come if i hadnt felt so much like the aforesaid elephant id have gone to her but i couldnt lumber across that big hall with all those boys howling on the stairs she was the prettiest freshette i saw today but probably favor is deceitful and even beauty is vain on your first day at redmond concluded priscilla with a laugh  im going across to old st johns after lunch said anne i dont know that a graveyard is a very good place to go to get cheered up but it seems the only getatable place where there are trees and trees i must have ill sit on one of those old slabs and shut my eyes and imagine im in the avonlea woods  anne did not do that however for she found enough of interest in old st johns to keep her eyes wide open they went in by the entrance gates past the simple massive stone arch surmounted by the great lion of england       and on inkerman yet the wild bramble is gory      and those bleak heights henceforth shall be famous in story  quoted anne looking at it with a thrill they found themselves in a dim cool green place where winds were fond of purring up and down the long grassy aisles they wandered reading the quaint voluminous epitaphs carved in an age that had more leisure than our own  here lieth the body of albert crawford esq read anne from a worn gray slab for many years keeper of his majestys ordnance at kingsport he served in the army till the peace of 1763 when he retired from bad health he was a brave officer the best of husbands the best of fathers the best of friends he died october 29th 1792 aged 84 years theres an epitaph for you prissy there is certainly some scope for imagination in it how full such a life must have been of adventure and as for his personal qualities im sure human eulogy couldnt go further i wonder if they told him he was all those best things while he was alive  heres another said priscilla listen  to the memory of alexander ross who died on the 22nd of september 1840 aged 43 years this is raised as a tribute of affection by one whom he served so faithfully for 27 years that he was regarded as a friend deserving the fullest confidence and attachment  a very good epitaph commented anne thoughtfully i wouldnt wish a better we are all servants of some sort and if the fact that we are faithful can be truthfully inscribed on our tombstones nothing more need be added heres a sorrowful little gray stone prissyto the memory of a favorite child and here is another erected to the memory of one who is buried elsewhere i wonder where that unknown grave is really pris the graveyards of today will never be as interesting as this you were righti shall come here often i love it already i see were not alone heretheres a girl down at the end of this avenue  yes and i believe its the very girl we saw at redmond this morning ive been watching her for five minutes she has started to come up the avenue exactly half a dozen times and half a dozen times has she turned and gone back either shes dreadfully shy or she has got something on her conscience lets go and meet her its easier to get acquainted in a graveyard than at redmond i believe  they walked down the long grassy arcade towards the stranger who was sitting on a gray slab under an enormous willow she was certainly very pretty with a vivid irregular bewitching type of prettiness there was a gloss as of brown nuts on her satinsmooth hair and a soft ripe glow on her round cheeks her eyes were big and brown and velvety under oddlypointed black brows and her crooked mouth was rosered she wore a smart brown suit with two very modish little shoes peeping from beneath it and her hat of dull pink straw wreathed with goldenbrown poppies had the indefinable unmistakable air which pertains to the creation of an artist in millinery priscilla had a sudden stinging consciousness that her own hat had been trimmed by her village store milliner and anne wondered uncomfortably if the blouse she had made herself and which mrs lynde had fitted looked very countrified and homemade besides the strangers smart attire for a moment both girls felt like turning back  but they had already stopped and turned towards the gray slab it was too late to retreat for the browneyed girl had evidently concluded that they were coming to speak to her instantly she sprang up and came forward with outstretched hand and a gay friendly smile in which there seemed not a shadow of either shyness or burdened conscience  oh i want to know who you two girls are she exclaimed eagerly ive been dying to know i saw you at redmond this morning say wasnt it awful there for the time i wished i had stayed home and got married  anne and priscilla both broke into unconstrained laughter at this unexpected conclusion the browneyed girl laughed too  i really did i could have you know come lets all sit down on this gravestone and get acquainted it wont be hard i know were going to adore each otheri knew it as soon as i saw you at redmond this morning i wanted so much to go right over and hug you both  why didnt you asked priscilla  because i simply couldnt make up my mind to do it i never can make up my mind about anything myselfim always afflicted with indecision just as soon as i decide to do something i feel in my bones that another course would be the correct one its a dreadful misfortune but i was born that way and there is no use in blaming me for it as some people do so i couldnt make up my mind to go and speak to you much as i wanted to  we thought you were too shy said anne  no no dear shyness isnt among the many failingsor virtuesof philippa gordonphil for short do call me phil right off now what are your handles  shes priscilla grant said anne pointing  and shes anne shirley said priscilla pointing in turn  and were from the island said both together  i hail from bolingbroke nova scotia said philippa  bolingbroke exclaimed anne why that is where i was born  do you really mean it why that makes you a bluenose after all  no it doesnt retorted anne wasnt it dan oconnell who said that if a man was born in a stable it didnt make him a horse im island to the core  well im glad you were born in bolingbroke anyway it makes us kind of neighbors doesnt it and i like that because when i tell you secrets it wont be as if i were telling them to a stranger i have to tell them i cant keep secretsits no use to try thats my worst failingthat and indecision as aforesaid would you believe itit took me half an hour to decide which hat to wear when i was coming herehere to a graveyard at first i inclined to my brown one with the feather but as soon as i put it on i thought this pink one with the floppy brim would be more becoming when i got it pinned in place i liked the brown one better at last i put them close together on the bed shut my eyes and jabbed with a hat pin the pin speared the pink one so i put it on it is becoming isnt it tell me what do you think of my looks  at this naive demand made in a perfectly serious tone priscilla laughed again but anne said impulsively squeezing philippas hand  we thought this morning that you were the prettiest girl we saw at redmond  philippas crooked mouth flashed into a bewitching crooked smile over very white little teeth  i thought that myself was her next astounding statement but i wanted some one elses opinion to bolster mine up i cant decide even on my own appearance just as soon as ive decided that im pretty i begin to feel miserably that im not besides have a horrible old greataunt who is always saying to me with a mournful sigh you were such a pretty baby its strange how children change when they grow up i adore aunts but i detest greataunts please tell me quite often that i am pretty if you dont mind i feel so much more comfortable when i can believe im pretty and ill be just as obliging to you if you want me toi can be with a clear conscience  thanks laughed anne but priscilla and i are so firmly convinced of our own good looks that we dont need any assurance about them so you neednt trouble  oh youre laughing at me i know you think im abominably vain but im not there really isnt one spark of vanity in me and im never a bit grudging about paying compliments to other girls when they deserve them im so glad i know you folks i came up on saturday and ive nearly died of homesickness ever since its a horrible feeling isnt it in bolingbroke im an important personage and in kingsport im just nobody there were times when i could feel my soul turning a delicate blue where do you hang out  thirtyeight st johns street  better and better why im just around the corner on wallace street i dont like my boardinghouse though its bleak and lonesome and my room looks out on such an unholy back yard its the ugliest place in the world as for catswell surely all the kingsport cats cant congregate there at night but half of them must i adore cats on hearth rugs snoozing before nice friendly fires but cats in back yards at midnight are totally different animals the first night i was here i cried all night and so did the cats you should have seen my nose in the morning how i wished i had never left home  i dont know how you managed to make up your mind to come to redmond at all if you are really such an undecided person said amused priscilla  bless your heart honey i didnt it was father who wanted me to come here his heart was set on itwhy i dont know it seems perfectly ridiculous to think of me studying for a ba degree doesnt it not but what i can do it all right i have heaps of brains  oh said priscilla vaguely  yes but its such hard work to use them and bas are such learned dignified wise solemn creaturesthey must be no i didnt want to come to redmond i did it just to oblige father he is such a duck besides i knew if i stayed home id have to get married mother wanted thatwanted it decidedly mother has plenty of decision but i really hated the thought of being married for a few years yet i want to have heaps of fun before i settle down and ridiculous as the idea of my being a ba is the idea of my being an old married woman is still more absurd isnt it im only eighteen no i concluded i would rather come to redmond than be married besides how could i ever have made up my mind which man to marry  were there so many laughed anne  heaps the boys like me awfullythey really do but there were only two that mattered the rest were all too young and too poor i must marry a rich man you know  why must you  honey you couldnt imagine me being a poor mans wife could you i cant do a single useful thing and i am very extravagant oh no my husband must have heaps of money so that narrowed them down to two but i couldnt decide between two any easier than between two hundred i knew perfectly well that whichever one i chose id regret all my life that i hadnt married the other  didnt youloveeither of them asked anne a little hesitatingly it was not easy for her to speak to a stranger of the great mystery and transformation of life  goodness no i couldnt love anybody it isnt in me besides i wouldnt want to being in love makes you a perfect slave i think and it would give a man such power to hurt you id be afraid no no alec and alonzo are two dear boys and i like them both so much that i really dont know which i like the better that is the trouble alec is the best looking of course and i simply couldnt marry a man who wasnt handsome he is goodtempered too and has lovely curly black hair hes rather too perfecti dont believe id like a perfect husbandsomebody i could never find fault with  then why not marry alonzo asked priscilla gravely  think of marrying a name like alonzo said phil dolefully i dont believe i could endure it but he has a classic nose and it would be a comfort to have a nose in the family that could be depended on i cant depend on mine so far it takes after the gordon pattern but im so afraid it will develop byrne tendencies as i grow older i examine it every day anxiously to make sure its still gordon mother was a byrne and has the byrne nose in the byrnest degree wait till you see it i adore nice noses your nose is awfully nice anne shirley alonzos nose nearly turned the balance in his favor but alonzo no i couldnt decide if i could have done as i did with the hatsstood them both up together shut my eyes and jabbed with a hatpinit would have been quite easy  what did alec and alonzo feel like when you came away queried priscilla  oh they still have hope i told them theyd have to wait till i could make up my mind theyre quite willing to wait they both worship me you know meanwhile i intend to have a good time i expect i shall have heaps of beaux at redmond i cant be happy unless i have you know but dont you think the freshmen are fearfully homely i saw only one really handsome fellow among them he went away before you came i heard his chum call him gilbert his chum had eyes that stuck out that far but youre not going yet girls dont go yet  i think we must said anne rather coldly its getting late and ive some work to do  but youll both come to see me wont you asked philippa getting up and putting an arm around each and let me come to see you i want to be chummy with you ive taken such a fancy to you both and i havent quite disgusted you with my frivolity have i  not quite laughed anne responding to phils squeeze with a return of cordiality  because im not half so silly as i seem on the surface you know you just accept philippa gordon as the lord made her with all her faults and i believe youll come to like her isnt this graveyard a sweet place id love to be buried here heres a grave i didnt see beforethis one in the iron railingoh girls look seethe stone says its the grave of a middy who was killed in the fight between the shannon and the chesapeake just fancy  anne paused by the railing and looked at the worn stone her pulses thrilling with sudden excitement the old graveyard with its overarching trees and long aisles of shadows faded from her sight instead she saw the kingsport harbor of nearly a century agone out of the mist came slowly a great frigate brilliant with the meteor flag of england behind her was another with a still heroic form wrapped in his own starry flag lying on the quarter deckthe gallant lawrence times finger had turned back his pages and that was the shannon sailing triumphant up the bay with the chesapeake as her prize  come back anne shirleycome back laughed philippa pulling her arm youre a hundred years away from us come back  anne came back with a sigh her eyes were shining softly  ive always loved that old story she said and although the english won that victory i think it was because of the brave defeated commander i love it this grave seems to bring it so near and make it so real this poor little middy was only eighteen he died of desperate wounds received in gallant actionso reads his epitaph it is such as a soldier might wish for  before she turned away anne unpinned the little cluster of purple pansies she wore and dropped it softly on the grave of the boy who had perished in the great seaduel  well what do you think of our new friend asked priscilla when phil had left them  i like her there is something very lovable about her in spite of all her nonsense i believe as she says herself that she isnt half as silly as she sounds shes a dear kissable babyand i dont know that shell ever really grow up  i like her too said priscilla decidedly she talks as much about boys as ruby gillis does but it always enrages or sickens me to hear ruby whereas i just wanted to laugh goodnaturedly at phil now what is the why of that  there is a difference said anne meditatively i think its because ruby is really so conscious of boys she plays at love and lovemaking besides you feel when she is boasting of her beaux that she is doing it to rub it well into you that you havent half so many now when phil talks of her beaux it sounds as if she was just speaking of chums she really looks upon boys as good comrades and she is pleased when she has dozens of them tagging round simply because she likes to be popular and to be thought popular even alex and alonzoill never be able to think of those two names separately after thisare to her just two playfellows who want her to play with them all their lives im glad we met her and im glad we went to old st johns i believe ive put forth a tiny soulroot into kingsport soil this afternoon i hope so i hate to feel transplanted     chapter v  letters from home   for the next three weeks anne and priscilla continued to feel as strangers in a strange land then suddenly everything seemed to fall into focusredmond professors classes students studies social doings life became homogeneous again instead of being made up of detached fragments the freshmen instead of being a collection of unrelated individuals found themselves a class with a class spirit a class yell class interests class antipathies and class ambitions they won the day in the annual arts rush against the sophomores and thereby gained the respect of all the classes and an enormous confidencegiving opinion of themselves for three years the sophomores had won in the rush that the victory of this year perched upon the freshmens banner was attributed to the strategic generalship of gilbert blythe who marshalled the campaign and originated certain new tactics which demoralized the sophs and swept the freshmen to triumph as a reward of merit he was elected president of the freshman class a position of honor and responsibilityfrom a fresh point of view at leastcoveted by many he was also invited to join the lambsredmondese for lamba thetaa compliment rarely paid to a freshman as a preparatory initiation ordeal he had to parade the principal business streets of kingsport for a whole day wearing a sunbonnet and a voluminous kitchen apron of gaudily flowered calico this he did cheerfully doffing his sunbonnet with courtly grace when he met ladies of his acquaintance charlie sloane who had not been asked to join the lambs told anne he did not see how blythe could do it and he for his part could never humiliate himself so  fancy charlie sloane in a caliker apron and a sunbunnit giggled priscilla hed look exactly like his old grandmother sloane gilbert now looked as much like a man in them as in his own proper habiliments  anne and priscilla found themselves in the thick of the social life of redmond that this came about so speedily was due in great measure to philippa gordon philippa was the daughter of a rich and wellknown man and belonged to an old and exclusive bluenose family this combined with her beauty and charma charm acknowledged by all who met herpromptly opened the gates of all cliques clubs and classes in redmond to her and where she went anne and priscilla went too phil adored anne and priscilla especially anne she was a loyal little soul crystalfree from any form of snobbishness love me love my friends seemed to be her unconscious motto without effort she took them with her into her ever widening circle of acquaintanceship and the two avonlea girls found their social pathway at redmond made very easy and pleasant for them to the envy and wonderment of the other freshettes who lacking philippas sponsorship were doomed to remain rather on the fringe of things during their first college year  to anne and priscilla with their more serious views of life phil remained the amusing lovable baby she had seemed on their first meeting yet as she said herself she had heaps of brains when or where she found time to study was a mystery for she seemed always in demand for some kind of fun and her home evenings were crowded with callers she had all the beaux that heart could desire for ninetenths of the freshmen and a big fraction of all the other classes were rivals for her smiles she was naively delighted over this and gleefully recounted each new conquest to anne and priscilla with comments that might have made the unlucky lovers ears burn fiercely  alec and alonzo dont seem to have any serious rival yet remarked anne teasingly  not one agreed philippa i write them both every week and tell them all about my young men here im sure it must amuse them but of course the one i like best i cant get gilbert blythe wont take any notice of me except to look at me as if i were a nice little kitten hed like to pat too well i know the reason i owe you a grudge queen anne i really ought to hate you and instead i love you madly and im miserable if i dont see you every day youre different from any girl i ever knew before when you look at me in a certain way i feel what an insignificant frivolous little beast i am and i long to be better and wiser and stronger and then i make good resolutions but the first nicelooking mannie who comes my way knocks them all out of my head isnt college life magnificent its so funny to think i hated it that first day but if i hadnt i might never got really acquainted with you anne please tell me over again that you like me a little bit i yearn to hear it  i like you a big bitand i think youre a dear sweet adorable velvety clawless littlekitten laughed anne but i dont see when you ever get time to learn your lessons  phil must have found time for she held her own in every class of her year even the grumpy old professor of mathematics who detested coeds and had bitterly opposed their admission to redmond couldnt floor her she led the freshettes everywhere except in english where anne shirley left her far behind anne herself found the studies of her freshman year very easy thanks in great part to the steady work she and gilbert had put in during those two past years in avonlea this left her more time for a social life which she thoroughly enjoyed but never for a moment did she forget avonlea and the friends there to her the happiest moments in each week were those in which letters came from home it was not until she had got her first letters that she began to think she could ever like kingsport or feel at home there before they came avonlea had seemed thousands of miles away those letters brought it near and linked the old life to the new so closely that they began to seem one and the same instead of two hopelessly segregated existences the first batch contained six letters from jane andrews ruby gillis diana barry marilla mrs lynde and davy janes was a copperplate production with every t nicely crossed and every i precisely dotted and not an interesting sentence in it she never mentioned the school concerning which anne was avid to hear she never answered one of the questions anne had asked in her letter but she told anne how many yards of lace she had recently crocheted and the kind of weather they were having in avonlea and how she intended to have her new dress made and the way she felt when her head ached ruby gillis wrote a gushing epistle deploring annes absence assuring her she was horribly missed in everything asking what the redmond fellows were like and filling the rest with accounts of her own harrowing experiences with her numerous admirers it was a silly harmless letter and anne would have laughed over it had it not been for the postscript gilbert seems to be enjoying redmond judging from his letters wrote ruby i dont think charlie is so stuck on it  so gilbert was writing to ruby very well he had a perfect right to of course only anne did not know that ruby had written the first letter and that gilbert had answered it from mere courtesy she tossed rubys letter aside contemptuously but it took all dianas breezy newsy delightful epistle to banish the sting of rubys postscript dianas letter contained a little too much fred but was otherwise crowded and crossed with items of interest and anne almost felt herself back in avonlea while reading it marillas was a rather prim and colorless epistle severely innocent of gossip or emotion yet somehow it conveyed to anne a whiff of the wholesome simple life at green gables with its savor of ancient peace and the steadfast abiding love that was there for her mrs lyndes letter was full of church news having broken up housekeeping mrs lynde had more time than ever to devote to church affairs and had flung herself into them heart and soul she was at present much worked up over the poor supplies they were having in the vacant avonlea pulpit  i dont believe any but fools enter the ministry nowadays she wrote bitterly such candidates as they have sent us and such stuff as they preach half of it aint true and whats worse it aint sound doctrine the one we have now is the worst of the lot he mostly takes a text and preaches about something else and he says he doesnt believe all the heathen will be eternally lost the idea if they wont all the money weve been giving to foreign missions will be clean wasted thats what last sunday night he announced that next sunday hed preach on the axehead that swam i think hed better confine himself to the bible and leave sensational subjects alone things have come to a pretty pass if a minister cant find enough in holy writ to preach about thats what what church do you attend anne i hope you go regularly people are apt to get so careless about churchgoing away from home and i understand college students are great sinners in this respect im told many of them actually study their lessons on sunday i hope youll never sink that low anne remember how you were brought up and be very careful what friends you make you never know what sort of creatures are in them colleges outwardly they may be as whited sepulchers and inwardly as ravening wolves thats what youd better not have anything to say to any young man who isnt from the island  i forgot to tell you what happened the day the minister called here it was the funniest thing i ever saw i said to marilla if anne had been here wouldnt she have had a laugh even marilla laughed you know hes a very short fat little man with bow legs well that old pig of mr harrisonsthe big tall onehad wandered over here that day again and broke into the yard and it got into the back porch unbeknowns to us and it was there when the minister appeared in the doorway it made one wild bolt to get out but there was nowhere to bolt to except between them bow legs so there it went and being as it was so big and the minister so little it took him clean off his feet and carried him away his hat went one way and his cane another just as marilla and i got to the door ill never forget the look of him and that poor pig was near scared to death ill never be able to read that account in the bible of the swine that rushed madly down the steep place into the sea without seeing mr harrisons pig careering down the hill with that minister i guess the pig thought he had the old boy on his back instead of inside of him i was thankful the twins werent about it wouldnt have been the right thing for them to have seen a minister in such an undignified predicament just before they got to the brook the minister jumped off or fell off the pig rushed through the brook like mad and up through the woods marilla and i run down and helped the minister get up and brush his coat he wasnt hurt but he was mad he seemed to hold marilla and me responsible for it all though we told him the pig didnt belong to us and had been pestering us all summer besides what did he come to the back door for youd never have caught mr allan doing that itll be a long time before we get a man like mr allan but its an ill wind that blows no good weve never seen hoof or hair of that pig since and its my belief we never will  things is pretty quiet in avonlea i dont find green gables as lonesome as i expected i think ill start another cotton warp quilt this winter mrs silas sloane has a handsome new appleleaf pattern  when i feel that i must have some excitement i read the murder trials in that boston paper my niece sends me i never used to do it but theyre real interesting the states must be an awful place i hope youll never go there anne but the way girls roam over the earth now is something terrible it always makes me think of satan in the book of job going to and fro and walking up and down i dont believe the lord ever intended it thats what  davy has been pretty good since you went away one day he was bad and marilla punished him by making him wear doras apron all day and then he went and cut all doras aprons up i spanked him for that and then he went and chased my rooster to death  the macphersons have moved down to my place shes a great housekeeper and very particular shes rooted all my june lilies up because she says they make a garden look so untidy thomas set them lilies out when we were married her husband seems a nice sort of a man but she cant get over being an old maid thats what  dont study too hard and be sure and put your winter underclothes on as soon as the weather gets cool marilla worries a lot about you but i tell her youve got a lot more sense than i ever thought you would have at one time and that youll be all right  davys letter plunged into a grievance at the start  dear anne please write and tell marilla not to tie me to the rale of the bridge when i go fishing the boys make fun of me when she does its awful lonesome here without you but grate fun in school jane andrews is crosser than you i scared mrs lynde with a jacky lantern last nite she was offel mad and she was mad cause i chased her old rooster round the yard till he fell down ded i didnt mean to make him fall down ded what made him die anne i want to know mrs lynde threw him into the pig pen she mite of sold him to mr blair mr blair is giving 50 sense apeace for good ded roosters now i herd mrs lynde asking the minister to pray for her what did she do that was so bad anne i want to know ive got a kite with a magnificent tail anne milty bolter told me a grate story in school yesterday it is troo old joe mosey and leon were playing cards one nite last week in the woods the cards were on a stump and a big black man bigger than the trees come along and grabbed the cards and the stump and disapered with a noys like thunder ill bet they were skared milty says the black man was the old harry was he anne i want to know mr kimball over at spenservale is very sick and will have to go to the hospitable please excuse me while i ask marilla if thats spelled rite marilla says its the silem he has to go to not the other place he thinks he has a snake inside of him whats it like to have a snake inside of you anne i want to know mrs lawrence bell is sick to mrs lynde says that all that is the matter with her is that she thinks too much about her insides  i wonder said anne as she folded up her letters what mrs lynde would think of philippa     chapter vi  in the park   what are you going to do with yourselves today girls asked philippa popping into annes room one saturday afternoon  we are going for a walk in the park answered anne i ought to stay in and finish my blouse but i couldnt sew on a day like this theres something in the air that gets into my blood and makes a sort of glory in my soul my fingers would twitch and id sew a crooked seam so its ho for the park and the pines  does we include any one but yourself and priscilla  yes it includes gilbert and charlie and well be very glad if it will include you also  but said philippa dolefully if i go ill have to be gooseberry and that will be a new experience for philippa gordon  well new experiences are broadening come along and youll be able to sympathize with all poor souls who have to play gooseberry often but where are all the victims  oh i was tired of them all and simply couldnt be bothered with any of them today besides ive been feeling a little bluejust a pale elusive azure it isnt serious enough for anything darker i wrote alec and alonzo last week i put the letters into envelopes and addressed them but i didnt seal them up that evening something funny happened that is alec would think it funny but alonzo wouldnt be likely to i was in a hurry so i snatched alecs letteras i thoughtout of the envelope and scribbled down a postscript then i mailed both letters i got alonzos reply this morning girls i had put that postscript to his letter and he was furious of course hell get over itand i dont care if he doesntbut it spoiled my day so i thought id come to you darlings to get cheered up after the football season opens i wont have any spare saturday afternoons i adore football ive got the most gorgeous cap and sweater striped in redmond colors to wear to the games to be sure a little way off ill look like a walking barbers pole do you know that that gilbert of yours has been elected captain of the freshman football team  yes he told us so last evening said priscilla seeing that outraged anne would not answer he and charlie were down we knew they were coming so we painstakingly put out of sight or out of reach all miss adas cushions that very elaborate one with the raised embroidery i dropped on the floor in the corner behind the chair it was on i thought it would be safe there but would you believe it charlie sloane made for that chair noticed the cushion behind it solemnly fished it up and sat on it the whole evening such a wreck of a cushion as it was poor miss ada asked me today still smiling but oh so reproachfully why i had allowed it to be sat upon i told her i hadntthat it was a matter of predestination coupled with inveterate sloanishness and i wasnt a match for both combined  miss adas cushions are really getting on my nerves said anne she finished two new ones last week stuffed and embroidered within an inch of their lives there being absolutely no other cushionless place to put them she stood them up against the wall on the stair landing they topple over half the time and if we come up or down the stairs in the dark we fall over them last sunday when dr davis prayed for all those exposed to the perils of the sea i added in thought and for all those who live in houses where cushions are loved not wisely but too well there were ready and i see the boys coming through old st johns do you cast in your lot with us phil  ill go if i can walk with priscilla and charlie that will be a bearable degree of gooseberry that gilbert of yours is a darling anne but why does he go around so much with goggleeyes  anne stiffened she had no great liking for charlie sloane but he was of avonlea so no outsider had any business to laugh at him  charlie and gilbert have always been friends she said coldly charlie is a nice boy hes not to blame for his eyes  dont tell me that he is he must have done something dreadful in a previous existence to be punished with such eyes pris and i are going to have such sport with him this afternoon well make fun of him to his face and hell never know it  doubtless the abandoned ps as anne called them did carry out their amiable intentions but sloane was blissfully ignorant he thought he was quite a fine fellow to be walking with two such coeds especially philippa gordon the class beauty and belle it must surely impress anne she would see that some people appreciated him at his real value  gilbert and anne loitered a little behind the others enjoying the calm still beauty of the autumn afternoon under the pines of the park on the road that climbed and twisted round the harbor shore  the silence here is like a prayer isnt it said anne her face upturned to the shining sky how i love the pines they seem to strike their roots deep into the romance of all the ages it is so comforting to creep away now and then for a good talk with them i always feel so happy out here             and so in mountain solitudes oertaken                as by some spell divine            their cares drop from them like the needles shaken                from out the gusty pine  quoted gilbert  they make our little ambitions seem rather petty dont they anne  i think if ever any great sorrow came to me i would come to the pines for comfort said anne dreamily  i hope no great sorrow ever will come to you anne said gilbert who could not connect the idea of sorrow with the vivid joyous creature beside him unwitting that those who can soar to the highest heights can also plunge to the deepest depths and that the natures which enjoy most keenly are those which also suffer most sharply  but there mustsometime mused anne life seems like a cup of glory held to my lips just now but there must be some bitterness in itthere is in every cup i shall taste mine some day well i hope i shall be strong and brave to meet it and i hope it wont be through my own fault that it will come do you remember what dr davis said last sunday eveningthat the sorrows god sent us brought comfort and strength with them while the sorrows we brought on ourselves through folly or wickedness were by far the hardest to bear but we mustnt talk of sorrow on an afternoon like this its meant for the sheer joy of living isnt it  if i had my way id shut everything out of your life but happiness and pleasure anne said gilbert in the tone that meant danger ahead  then you would be very unwise rejoined anne hastily im sure no life can be properly developed and rounded out without some trial and sorrowthough i suppose it is only when we are pretty comfortable that we admit it comethe others have got to the pavilion and are beckoning to us  they all sat down in the little pavilion to watch an autumn sunset of deep red fire and pallid gold to their left lay kingsport its roofs and spires dim in their shroud of violet smoke to their right lay the harbor taking on tints of rose and copper as it stretched out into the sunset before them the water shimmered satin smooth and silver gray and beyond clean shaven williams island loomed out of the mist guarding the town like a sturdy bulldog its lighthouse beacon flared through the mist like a baleful star and was answered by another in the far horizon  did you ever see such a stronglooking place asked philippa i dont want williams island especially but im sure i couldnt get it if i did look at that sentry on the summit of the fort right beside the flag doesnt he look as if he had stepped out of a romance  speaking of romance said priscilla weve been looking for heatherbut of course we couldnt find any its too late in the season i suppose  heather exclaimed anne heather doesnt grow in america does it  there are just two patches of it in the whole continent said phil one right here in the park and one somewhere else in nova scotia i forget where the famous highland regiment the black watch camped here one year and when the men shook out the straw of their beds in the spring some seeds of heather took root  oh how delightful said enchanted anne  lets go home around by spofford avenue suggested gilbert we can see all the handsome houses where the wealthy nobles dwell spofford avenue is the finest residential street in kingsport nobody can build on it unless hes a millionaire  oh do said phil theres a perfectly killing little place i want to show you anne it wasnt built by a millionaire its the first place after you leave the park and must have grown while spofford avenue was still a country road it did growit wasnt built i dont care for the houses on the avenue theyre too brand new and plateglassy but this little spot is a dreamand its namebut wait till you see it  they saw it as they walked up the pinefringed hill from the park just on the crest where spofford avenue petered out into a plain road was a little white frame house with groups of pines on either side of it stretching their arms protectingly over its low roof it was covered with red and gold vines through which its greenshuttered windows peeped before it was a tiny garden surrounded by a low stone wall october though it was the garden was still very sweet with dear oldfashioned unworldly flowers and shrubssweet may southernwood lemon verbena alyssum petunias marigolds and chrysanthemums a tiny brick wall in herringbone pattern led from the gate to the front porch the whole place might have been transplanted from some remote country village yet there was something about it that made its nearest neighbor the big lawnencircled palace of a tobacco king look exceedingly crude and showy and illbred by contrast as phil said it was the difference between being born and being made  its the dearest place i ever saw said anne delightedly it gives me one of my old delightful funny aches its dearer and quainter than even miss lavendars stone house  its the name i want you to notice especially said phil lookin white letters around the archway over the gate pattys place isnt that killing especially on this avenue of pinehursts and elmwolds and cedarcrofts pattys place if you please i adore it  have you any idea who patty is asked priscilla  patty spofford is the name of the old lady who owns it ive discovered she lives there with her niece and theyve lived there for hundreds of years more or lessmaybe a little less anne exaggeration is merely a flight of poetic fancy i understand that wealthy folk have tried to buy the lot time and againits really worth a small fortune now you knowbut patty wont sell upon any consideration and theres an apple orchard behind the house in place of a back yardyoull see it when we get a little pasta real apple orchard on spofford avenue  im going to dream about pattys place tonight said anne why i feel as if i belonged to it i wonder if by any chance well ever see the inside of it  it isnt likely said priscilla  anne smiled mysteriously  no it isnt likely but i believe it will happen i have a queer creepy crawly feelingyou can call it a presentiment if you likethat pattys place and i are going to be better acquainted yet     chapter vii  home again   those first three weeks at redmond had seemed long but the rest of the term flew by on wings of wind before they realized it the redmond students found themselves in the grind of christmas examinations emerging therefrom more or less triumphantly the honor of leading in the freshman classes fluctuated between anne gilbert and philippa priscilla did very well charlie sloane scraped through respectably and comported himself as complacently as if he had led in everything  i cant really believe that this time tomorrow ill be in green gables said anne on the night before departure but i shall be and you phil will be in bolingbroke with alec and alonzo  im longing to see them admitted phil between the chocolate she was nibbling they really are such dear boys you know theres to be no end of dances and drives and general jamborees i shall never forgive you queen anne for not coming home with me for the holidays  never means three days with you phil it was dear of you to ask meand id love to go to bolingbroke some day but i cant go this yeari must go home you dont know how my heart longs for it  you wont have much of a time said phil scornfully therell be one or two quilting parties i suppose and all the old gossips will talk you over to your face and behind your back youll die of lonesomeness child  in avonlea said anne highly amused  now if youd come with me youd have a perfectly gorgeous time bolingbroke would go wild over you queen anneyour hair and your style and oh everything youre so different youd be such a successand i would bask in reflected glorynot the rose but near the rose do come after all anne  your picture of social triumphs is quite fascinating phil but ill paint one to offset it im going home to an old country farmhouse once green rather faded now set among leafless apple orchards there is a brook below and a december fir wood beyond where ive heard harps swept by the fingers of rain and wind there is a pond nearby that will be gray and brooding now there will be two oldish ladies in the house one tall and thin one short and fat and there will be two twins one a perfect model the other what mrs lynde calls a holy terror there will be a little room upstairs over the porch where old dreams hang thick and a big fat glorious feather bed which will almost seem the height of luxury after a boardinghouse mattress how do you like my picture phil  it seems a very dull one said phil with a grimace  oh but ive left out the transforming thing said anne softly therell be love there philfaithful tender love such as ill never find anywhere else in the worldlove thats waiting for me that makes my picture a masterpiece doesnt it even if the colors are not very brilliant  phil silently got up tossed her box of chocolates away went up to anne and put her arms about her  anne i wish i was like you she said soberly  diana met anne at the carmody station the next night and they drove home together under silent starsown depths of sky green gables had a very festal appearance as they drove up the lane there was a light in every window the glow breaking out through the darkness like flamered blossoms swung against the dark background of the haunted wood and in the yard was a brave bonfire with two gay little figures dancing around it one of which gave an unearthly yell as the buggy turned in under the poplars  davy means that for an indian warwhoop said diana mr harrisons hired boy taught it to him and hes been practicing it up to welcome you with mrs lynde says it has worn her nerves to a frazzle he creeps up behind her you know and then lets go he was determined to have a bonfire for you too hes been piling up branches for a fortnight and pestering marilla to be let pour some kerosene oil over it before setting it on fire i guess she did by the smell though mrs lynde said up to the last that davy would blow himself and everybody else up if he was let  anne was out of the buggy by this time and davy was rapturously hugging her knees while even dora was clinging to her hand  isnt that a bully bonfire anne just let me show you how to poke itsee the sparks i did it for you anne cause i was so glad you were coming home  the kitchen door opened and marillas spare form darkened against the inner light she preferred to meet anne in the shadows for she was horribly afraid that she was going to cry with joyshe stern repressed marilla who thought all display of deep emotion unseemly mrs lynde was behind her sonsy kindly matronly as of yore the love that anne had told phil was waiting for her surrounded her and enfolded her with its blessing and its sweetness nothing after all could compare with old ties old friends and old green gables how starry annes eyes were as they sat down to the loaded supper table how pink her cheeks how silverclear her laughter and diana was going to stay all night too how like the dear old times it was and the rosebud teaset graced the table with marilla the force of nature could no further go  i suppose you and diana will now proceed to talk all night said marilla sarcastically as the girls went upstairs marilla was always sarcastic after any selfbetrayal  yes agreed anne gaily but im going to put davy to bed first he insists on that  you bet said davy as they went along the hall i want somebody to say my prayers to again its no fun saying them alone  you dont say them alone davy god is always with you to hear you  well i cant see him objected davy i want to pray to somebody i can see but i wont say them to mrs lynde or marilla there now  nevertheless when davy was garbed in his gray flannel nighty he did not seem in a hurry to begin he stood before anne shuffling one bare foot over the other and looked undecided  come dear kneel down said anne  davy came and buried his head in annes lap but he did not kneel down  anne he said in a muffled voice i dont feel like praying after all i havent felt like it for a week now ii didnt pray last night nor the night before  why not davy asked anne gently  youyou wont be mad if i tell you implored davy  anne lifted the little grayflannelled body on her knee and cuddled his head on her arm  do i ever get mad when you tell me things davy  nooo you never do but you get sorry and thats worse youll be awful sorry when i tell you this anneand youll be shamed of me i spose  have you done something naughty davy and is that why you cant say your prayers  no i havent done anything naughtyyet but i want to do it  what is it davy  ii want to say a bad word anne blurted out davy with a desperate effort i heard mr harrisons hired boy say it one day last week and ever since ive been wanting to say it all the timeeven when im saying my prayers  say it then davy  davy lifted his flushed face in amazement  but anne its an awful bad word  say it  davy gave her another incredulous look then in a low voice he said the dreadful word the next minute his face was burrowing against her  oh anne ill never say it againnever ill never want to say it again i knew it was bad but i didnt spose it was sosoi didnt spose it was like that  no i dont think youll ever want to say it again davyor think it either and i wouldnt go about much with mr harrisons hired boy if i were you  he can make bully warwhoops said davy a little regretfully  but you dont want your mind filled with bad words do you davywords that will poison it and drive out all that is good and manly  no said davy owleyed with introspection  then dont go with those people who use them and now do you feel as if you could say your prayers davy  oh yes said davy eagerly wriggling down on his knees i can say them now all right i aint scared now to say if i should die before i wake like i was when i was wanting to say that word  probably anne and diana did empty out their souls to each other that night but no record of their confidences has been preserved they both looked as fresh and brighteyed at breakfast as only youth can look after unlawful hours of revelry and confession there had been no snow up to this time but as diana crossed the old log bridge on her homeward way the white flakes were beginning to flutter down over the fields and woods russet and gray in their dreamless sleep soon the faraway slopes and hills were dim and wraithlike through their gauzy scarfing as if pale autumn had flung a misty bridal veil over her hair and was waiting for her wintry bridegroom so they had a white christmas after all and a very pleasant day it was in the forenoon letters and gifts came from miss lavendar and paul anne opened them in the cheerful green gables kitchen which was filled with what davy sniffing in ecstasy called pretty smells  miss lavendar and mr irving are settled in their new home now reported anne i am sure miss lavendar is perfectly happyi know it by the general tone of her letterbut theres a note from charlotta the fourth she doesnt like boston at all and she is fearfully homesick miss lavendar wants me to go through to echo lodge some day while im home and light a fire to air it and see that the cushions arent getting moldy i think ill get diana to go over with me next week and we can spend the evening with theodora dix i want to see theodora by the way is ludovic speed still going to see her  they say so said marilla and hes likely to continue it folks have given up expecting that that courtship will ever arrive anywhere  id hurry him up a bit if i was theodora thats what said mrs lynde and there is not the slightest doubt but that she would  there was also a characteristic scrawl from philippa full of alec and alonzo what they said and what they did and how they looked when they saw her  but i cant make up my mind yet which to marry wrote phil i do wish you had come with me to decide for me some one will have to when i saw alec my heart gave a great thump and i thought he might be the right one and then when alonzo came thump went my heart again so thats no guide though it should be according to all the novels ive ever read now anne your heart wouldnt thump for anybody but the genuine prince charming would it there must be something radically wrong with mine but im having a perfectly gorgeous time how i wish you were here its snowing today and im rapturous i was so afraid wed have a green christmas and i loathe them you know when christmas is a dirty grayeybrowney affair looking as if it had been left over a hundred years ago and had been in soak ever since it is called a green christmas dont ask me why as lord dundreary says there are thome thingth no fellow can underthtand  anne did you ever get on a street car and then discover that you hadnt any money with you to pay your fare i did the other day its quite awful i had a nickel with me when i got on the car i thought it was in the left pocket of my coat when i got settled down comfortably i felt for it it wasnt there i had a cold chill i felt in the other pocket not there i had another chill then i felt in a little inside pocket all in vain i had two chills at once  i took off my gloves laid them on the seat and went over all my pockets again it was not there i stood up and shook myself and then looked on the floor the car was full of people who were going home from the opera and they all stared at me but i was past caring for a little thing like that  but i could not find my fare i concluded i must have put it in my mouth and swallowed it inadvertently  i didnt know what to do would the conductor i wondered stop the car and put me off in ignominy and shame was it possible that i could convince him that i was merely the victim of my own absentmindedness and not an unprincipled creature trying to obtain a ride upon false pretenses how i wished that alec or alonzo were there but they werent because i wanted them if i hadnt wanted them they would have been there by the dozen and i couldnt decide what to say to the conductor when he came around as soon as i got one sentence of explanation mapped out in my mind i felt nobody could believe it and i must compose another it seemed there was nothing to do but trust in providence and for all the comfort that gave me i might as well have been the old lady who when told by the captain during a storm that she must put her trust in the almighty exclaimed oh captain is it as bad as that  just at the conventional moment when all hope had fled and the conductor was holding out his box to the passenger next to me i suddenly remembered where i had put that wretched coin of the realm i hadnt swallowed it after all i meekly fished it out of the index finger of my glove and poked it in the box i smiled at everybody and felt that it was a beautiful world  the visit to echo lodge was not the least pleasant of many pleasant holiday outings anne and diana went back to it by the old way of the beech woods carrying a lunch basket with them echo lodge which had been closed ever since miss lavendars wedding was briefly thrown open to wind and sunshine once more and firelight glimmered again in the little rooms the perfume of miss lavendars rose bowl still filled the air it was hardly possible to believe that miss lavendar would not come tripping in presently with her brown eyes astar with welcome and that charlotta the fourth blue of bow and wide of smile would not pop through the door paul too seemed hovering around with his fairy fancies  it really makes me feel a little bit like a ghost revisiting the old time glimpses of the moon laughed anne lets go out and see if the echoes are at home bring the old horn it is still behind the kitchen door  the echoes were at home over the white river as silverclear and multitudinous as ever and when they had ceased to answer the girls locked up echo lodge again and went away in the perfect half hour that follows the rose and saffron of a winter sunset     chapter viii  annes first proposal   the old year did not slip away in a green twilight with a pinkyyellow sunset instead it went out with a wild white bluster and blow it was one of the nights when the stormwind hurtles over the frozen meadows and black hollows and moans around the eaves like a lost creature and drives the snow sharply against the shaking panes  just the sort of night people like to cuddle down between their blankets and count their mercies said anne to jane andrews who had come up to spend the afternoon and stay all night but when they were cuddled between their blankets in annes little porch room it was not her mercies of which jane was thinking  anne she said very solemnly i want to tell you something may i  anne was feeling rather sleepy after the party ruby gillis had given the night before she would much rather have gone to sleep than listen to janes confidences which she was sure would bore her she had no prophetic inkling of what was coming probably jane was engaged too rumor averred that ruby gillis was engaged to the spencervale schoolteacher about whom all the girls were said to be quite wild  ill soon be the only fancyfree maiden of our old quartet thought anne drowsily aloud she said of course  anne said jane still more solemnly what do you think of my brother billy  anne gasped over this unexpected question and floundered helplessly in her thoughts goodness what did she think of billy andrews she had never thought anything about himroundfaced stupid perpetually smiling goodnatured billy andrews did anybody ever think about billy andrews  ii dont understand jane she stammered what do you meanexactly  do you like billy asked jane bluntly  whywhyyes i like him of course gasped anne wondering if she were telling the literal truth certainly she did not dislike billy but could the indifferent tolerance with which she regarded him when he happened to be in her range of vision be considered positive enough for liking what was jane trying to elucidate  would you like him for a husband asked jane calmly  a husband anne had been sitting up in bed the better to wrestle with the problem of her exact opinion of billy andrews now she fell flatly back on her pillows the very breath gone out of her whose husband  yours of course answered jane billy wants to marry you hes always been crazy about youand now father has given him the upper farm in his own name and theres nothing to prevent him from getting married but hes so shy he couldnt ask you himself if youd have him so he got me to do it id rather not have but he gave me no peace till i said i would if i got a good chance what do you think about it anne  was it a dream was it one of those nightmare things in which you find yourself engaged or married to some one you hate or dont know without the slightest idea how it ever came about no she anne shirley was lying there wide awake in her own bed and jane andrews was beside her calmly proposing for her brother billy anne did not know whether she wanted to writhe or laugh but she could do neither for janes feelings must not be hurt  ii couldnt marry bill you know jane she managed to gasp why such an idea never occurred to menever  i dont suppose it did agreed jane billy has always been far too shy to think of courting but you might think it over anne billy is a good fellow i must say that if he is my brother he has no bad habits and hes a great worker and you can depend on him a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush he told me to tell you hed be quite willing to wait till you got through college if you insisted though hed rather get married this spring before the planting begins hed always be very good to you im sure and you know anne id love to have you for a sister  i cant marry billy said anne decidedly she had recovered her wits and was even feeling a little angry it was all so ridiculous there is no use thinking of it jane i dont care anything for him in that way and you must tell him so  well i didnt suppose you would said jane with a resigned sigh feeling that she had done her best i told billy i didnt believe it was a bit of use to ask you but he insisted well youve made your decision anne and i hope you wont regret it  jane spoke rather coldly she had been perfectly sure that the enamored billy had no chance at all of inducing anne to marry him nevertheless she felt a little resentment that anne shirley who was after all merely an adopted orphan without kith or kin should refuse her brotherone of the avonlea andrews well pride sometimes goes before a fall jane reflected ominously  anne permitted herself to smile in the darkness over the idea that she might ever regret not marrying billy andrews  i hope billy wont feel very badly over it she said nicely  jane made a movement as if she were tossing her head on her pillow  oh he wont break his heart billy has too much good sense for that he likes nettie blewett pretty well too and mother would rather he married her than any one shes such a good manager and saver i think when billy is once sure you wont have him hell take nettie please dont mention this to any one will you anne  certainly not said anne who had no desire whatever to publish abroad the fact that billy andrews wanted to marry her preferring her when all was said and done to nettie blewett nettie blewett  and now i suppose wed better go to sleep suggested jane  to sleep went jane easily and speedily but though very unlike macbeth in most respects she had certainly contrived to murder sleep for anne that proposedto damsel lay on a wakeful pillow until the wee smas but her meditations were far from being romantic it was not however until the next morning that she had an opportunity to indulge in a good laugh over the whole affair when jane had gone homestill with a hint of frost in voice and manner because anne had declined so ungratefully and decidedly the honor of an alliance with the house of andrewsanne retreated to the porch room shut the door and had her laugh out at last  if i could only share the joke with some one she thought but i cant diana is the only one id want to tell and even if i hadnt sworn secrecy to jane i cant tell diana things now she tells everything to fredi know she does well ive had my first proposal i supposed it would come some daybut i certainly never thought it would be by proxy its awfully funnyand yet theres a sting in it too somehow  anne knew quite well wherein the sting consisted though she did not put it into words she had had her secret dreams of the first time some one should ask her the great question and it had in those dreams always been very romantic and beautiful and the some one was to be very handsome and darkeyed and distinguishedlooking and eloquent whether he were prince charming to be enraptured with yes or one to whom a regretful beautifully worded but hopeless refusal must be given if the latter the refusal was to be expressed so delicately that it would be next best thing to acceptance and he would go away after kissing her hand assuring her of his unalterable lifelong devotion and it would always be a beautiful memory to be proud of and a little sad about also  and now this thrilling experience had turned out to be merely grotesque billy andrews had got his sister to propose for him because his father had given him the upper farm and if anne wouldnt have him nettie blewett would there was romance for you with a vengeance anne laughedand then sighed the bloom had been brushed from one little maiden dream would the painful process go on until everything became prosaic and humdrum     chapter ix   an unwelcome lover and a welcome friend   the second term at redmond sped as quickly as had the firstactually whizzed away philippa said anne enjoyed it thoroughly in all its phasesthe stimulating class rivalry the making and deepening of new and helpful friendships the gay little social stunts the doings of the various societies of which she was a member the widening of horizons and interests she studied hard for she had made up her mind to win the thorburn scholarship in english this being won meant that she could come back to redmond the next year without trenching on marillas small savingssomething anne was determined she would not do  gilbert too was in full chase after a scholarship but found plenty of time for frequent calls at thirtyeight st johns he was annes escort at nearly all the college affairs and she knew that their names were coupled in redmond gossip anne raged over this but was helpless she could not cast an old friend like gilbert aside especially when he had grown suddenly wise and wary as behooved him in the dangerous proximity of more than one redmond youth who would gladly have taken his place by the side of the slender redhaired coed whose gray eyes were as alluring as stars of evening anne was never attended by the crowd of willing victims who hovered around philippas conquering march through her freshman year but there was a lanky brainy freshie a jolly little round sophomore and a tall learned junior who all liked to call at thirtyeight st johns and talk over ologies and isms as well as lighter subjects with anne in the becushioned parlor of that domicile gilbert did not love any of them and he was exceedingly careful to give none of them the advantage over him by any untimely display of his real feelings anneward to her he had become again the boycomrade of avonlea days and as such could hold his own against any smitten swain who had so far entered the lists against him as a companion anne honestly acknowledged nobody could be so satisfactory as gilbert she was very glad so she told herself that he had evidently dropped all nonsensical ideasthough she spent considerable time secretly wondering why  only one disagreeable incident marred that winter charlie sloane sitting bolt upright on miss adas most dearly beloved cushion asked anne one night if she would promise to become mrs charlie sloane some day coming after billy andrews proxy effort this was not quite the shock to annes romantic sensibilities that it would otherwise have been but it was certainly another heartrending disillusion she was angry too for she felt that she had never given charlie the slightest encouragement to suppose such a thing possible but what could you expect of a sloane as mrs rachel lynde would ask scornfully charlies whole attitude tone air words fairly reeked with sloanishness he was conferring a great honorno doubt whatever about that and when anne utterly insensible to the honor refused him as delicately and considerately as she couldfor even a sloane had feelings which ought not to be unduly laceratedsloanishness still further betrayed itself charlie certainly did not take his dismissal as annes imaginary rejected suitors did instead he became angry and showed it he said two or three quite nasty things annes temper flashed up mutinously and she retorted with a cutting little speech whose keenness pierced even charlies protective sloanishness and reached the quick he caught up his hat and flung himself out of the house with a very red face anne rushed upstairs falling twice over miss adas cushions on the way and threw herself on her bed in tears of humiliation and rage had she actually stooped to quarrel with a sloane was it possible anything charlie sloane could say had power to make her angry oh this was degradation indeedworse even than being the rival of nettie blewett  i wish i need never see the horrible creature again she sobbed vindictively into her pillows  she could not avoid seeing him again but the outraged charlie took care that it should not be at very close quarters miss adas cushions were henceforth safe from his depredations and when he met anne on the street or in redmonds halls his bow was icy in the extreme relations between these two old schoolmates continued to be thus strained for nearly a year then charlie transferred his blighted affections to a round rosy snubnosed blueeyed little sophomore who appreciated them as they deserved whereupon he forgave anne and condescended to be civil to her again in a patronizing manner intended to show her just what she had lost  one day anne scurried excitedly into priscillas room  read that she cried tossing priscilla a letter its from stellaand shes coming to redmond next yearand what do you think of her idea i think its a perfectly splendid one if we can only carry it out do you suppose we can pris  ill be better able to tell you when i find out what it is said priscilla casting aside a greek lexicon and taking up stellas letter stella maynard had been one of their chums at queens academy and had been teaching school ever since  but im going to give it up anne dear she wrote and go to college next year as i took the third year at queens i can enter the sophomore year im tired of teaching in a back country school some day im going to write a treatise on the trials of a country schoolmarm it will be a harrowing bit of realism it seems to be the prevailing impression that we live in clover and have nothing to do but draw our quarters salary my treatise shall tell the truth about us why if a week should pass without some one telling me that i am doing easy work for big pay i would conclude that i might as well order my ascension robe immediately and to onct well you get your money easy some ratepayer will tell me condescendingly all you have to do is to sit there and hear lessons i used to argue the matter at first but im wiser now facts are stubborn things but as some one has wisely said not half so stubborn as fallacies so i only smile loftily now in eloquent silence why i have nine grades in my school and i have to teach a little of everything from investigating the interiors of earthworms to the study of the solar system my youngest pupil is fourhis mother sends him to school to get him out of the wayand my oldest twentyit suddenly struck him that it would be easier to go to school and get an education than follow the plough any longer in the wild effort to cram all sorts of research into six hours a day i dont wonder if the children feel like the little boy who was taken to see the biograph i have to look for whats coming next before i know what went last he complained i feel like that myself  and the letters i get anne tommys mother writes me that tommy is not coming on in arithmetic as fast as she would like he is only in simple reduction yet and johnny johnson is in fractions and johnny isnt half as smart as her tommy and she cant understand it and susys father wants to know why susy cant write a letter without misspelling half the words and dicks aunt wants me to change his seat because that bad brown boy he is sitting with is teaching him to say naughty words  as to the financial partbut ill not begin on that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make country schoolmarms  there i feel better after that growl after all ive enjoyed these past two years but im coming to redmond  and now anne ive a little plan you know how i loathe boarding ive boarded for four years and im so tired of it i dont feel like enduring three years more of it  now why cant you and priscilla and i club together rent a little house somewhere in kingsport and board ourselves it would be cheaper than any other way of course we would have to have a housekeeper and i have one ready on the spot youve heard me speak of aunt jamesina shes the sweetest aunt that ever lived in spite of her name she cant help that she was called jamesina because her father whose name was james was drowned at sea a month before she was born i always call her aunt jimsie well her only daughter has recently married and gone to the foreign mission field aunt jamesina is left alone in a great big house and she is horribly lonesome she will come to kingsport and keep house for us if we want her and i know youll both love her the more i think of the plan the more i like it we could have such good independent times  now if you and priscilla agree to it wouldnt it be a good idea for you who are on the spot to look around and see if you can find a suitable house this spring that would be better than leaving it till the fall if you could get a furnished one so much the better but if not we can scare up a few sticks of finiture between us and old family friends with attics anyhow decide as soon as you can and write me so that aunt jamesina will know what plans to make for next year  i think its a good idea said priscilla  so do i agreed anne delightedly of course we have a nice boardinghouse here but when alls said and done a boardinghouse isnt home so lets go househunting at once before exams come on  im afraid it will be hard enough to get a really suitable house warned priscilla dont expect too much anne nice houses in nice localities will probably be away beyond our means well likely have to content ourselves with a shabby little place on some street whereon live people whom to know is to be unknown and make life inside compensate for the outside  accordingly they went househunting but to find just what they wanted proved even harder than priscilla had feared houses there were galore furnished and unfurnished but one was too big another too small this one too expensive that one too far from redmond exams were on and over the last week of the term came and still their house odreams as anne called it remained a castle in the air  we shall have to give up and wait till the fall i suppose said priscilla wearily as they rambled through the park on one of aprils darling days of breeze and blue when the harbor was creaming and shimmering beneath the pearlhued mists floating over it we may find some shack to shelter us then and if not boardinghouses we shall have always with us  im not going to worry about it just now anyway and spoil this lovely afternoon said anne gazing around her with delight the fresh chill air was faintly charged with the aroma of pine balsam and the sky above was crystal clear and bluea great inverted cup of blessing spring is singing in my blood today and the lure of april is abroad on the air im seeing visions and dreaming dreams pris thats because the wind is from the west i do love the west wind it sings of hope and gladness doesnt it when the east wind blows i always think of sorrowful rain on the eaves and sad waves on a gray shore when i get old i shall have rheumatism when the wind is east  and isnt it jolly when you discard furs and winter garments for the first time and sally forth like this in spring attire laughed priscilla dont you feel as if you had been made over new  everything is new in the spring said anne springs themselves are always so new too no spring is ever just like any other spring it always has something of its own to be its own peculiar sweetness see how green the grass is around that little pond and how the willow buds are bursting  and exams are over and gonethe time of convocation will come soonnext wednesday this day next week well be home  im glad said anne dreamily there are so many things i want to do i want to sit on the back porch steps and feel the breeze blowing down over mr harrisons fields i want to hunt ferns in the haunted wood and gather violets in violet vale do you remember the day of our golden picnic priscilla i want to hear the frogs singing and the poplars whispering but ive learned to love kingsport too and im glad im coming back next fall if i hadnt won the thorburn i dont believe i could have i couldnt take any of marillas little hoard  if we could only find a house sighed priscilla look over there at kingsport annehouses houses everywhere and not one for us  stop it pris the best is yet to be like the old roman well find a house or build one on a day like this theres no such word as fail in my bright lexicon  they lingered in the park until sunset living in the amazing miracle and glory and wonder of the springtide and they went home as usual by way of spofford avenue that they might have the delight of looking at pattys place  i feel as if something mysterious were going to happen right awayby the pricking of my thumbs said anne as they went up the slope its a nice storybookish feeling whywhywhy priscilla grant look over there and tell me if its true or am i seein things  priscilla looked annes thumbs and eyes had not deceived her over the arched gateway of pattys place dangled a little modest sign it said to let furnished inquire within  priscilla said anne in a whisper do you suppose its possible that we could rent pattys place  no i dont averred priscilla it would be too good to be true fairy tales dont happen nowadays i wont hope anne the disappointment would be too awful to bear theyre sure to want more for it than we can afford remember its on spofford avenue  we must find out anyhow said anne resolutely its too late to call this evening but well come tomorrow oh pris if we can get this darling spot ive always felt that my fortunes were linked with pattys place ever since i saw it first     chapter x  pattys place   the next evening found them treading resolutely the herringbone walk through the tiny garden the april wind was filling the pine trees with its roundelay and the grove was alive with robinsgreat plump saucy fellows strutting along the paths the girls rang rather timidly and were admitted by a grim and ancient handmaiden the door opened directly into a large livingroom where by a cheery little fire sat two other ladies both of whom were also grim and ancient except that one looked to be about seventy and the other fifty there seemed little difference between them each had amazingly big lightblue eyes behind steelrimmed spectacles each wore a cap and a gray shawl each was knitting without haste and without rest each rocked placidly and looked at the girls without speaking and just behind each sat a large white china dog with round green spots all over it a green nose and green ears those dogs captured annes fancy on the spot they seemed like the twin guardian deities of pattys place  for a few minutes nobody spoke the girls were too nervous to find words and neither the ancient ladies nor the china dogs seemed conversationally inclined anne glanced about the room what a dear place it was another door opened out of it directly into the pine grove and the robins came boldly up on the very step the floor was spotted with round braided mats such as marilla made at green gables but which were considered out of date everywhere else even in avonlea and yet here they were on spofford avenue a big polished grandfathers clock ticked loudly and solemnly in a corner there were delightful little cupboards over the mantelpiece behind whose glass doors gleamed quaint bits of china the walls were hung with old prints and silhouettes in one corner the stairs went up and at the first low turn was a long window with an inviting seat it was all just as anne had known it must be  by this time the silence had grown too dreadful and priscilla nudged anne to intimate that she must speak  wewesaw by your sign that this house is to let said anne faintly addressing the older lady who was evidently miss patty spofford  oh yes said miss patty i intended to take that sign down today  thenthen we are too late said anne sorrowfully youve let it to some one else  no but we have decided not to let it at all  oh im so sorry exclaimed anne impulsively i love this place so i did hope we could have got it  then did miss patty lay down her knitting take off her specs rub them put them on again and for the first time look at anne as at a human being the other lady followed her example so perfectly that she might as well have been a reflection in a mirror  you love it said miss patty with emphasis does that mean that you really love it or that you merely like the looks of it the girls nowadays indulge in such exaggerated statements that one never can tell what they do mean it wasnt so in my young days then a girl did not say she loved turnips in just the same tone as she might have said she loved her mother or her savior  annes conscience bore her up  i really do love it she said gently ive loved it ever since i saw it last fall my two college chums and i want to keep house next year instead of boarding so we are looking for a little place to rent and when i saw that this house was to let i was so happy  if you love it you can have it said miss patty maria and i decided today that we would not let it after all because we did not like any of the people who have wanted it we dont have to let it we can afford to go to europe even if we dont let it it would help us out but not for gold will i let my home pass into the possession of such people as have come here and looked at it you are different i believe you do love it and will be good to it you can have it  ifif we can afford to pay what you ask for it hesitated anne  miss patty named the amount required anne and priscilla looked at each other priscilla shook her head  im afraid we cant afford quite so much said anne choking back her disappointment you see we are only college girls and we are poor  what were you thinking you could afford demanded miss patty ceasing not to knit  anne named her amount miss patty nodded gravely  that will do as i told you it is not strictly necessary that we should let it at all we are not rich but we have enough to go to europe on i have never been in europe in my life and never expected or wanted to go but my niece there maria spofford has taken a fancy to go now you know a young person like maria cant go globetrotting alone  noii suppose not murmured anne seeing that miss patty was quite solemnly in earnest  of course not so i have to go along to look after her i expect to enjoy it too im seventy years old but im not tired of living yet i daresay id have gone to europe before if the idea had occurred to me we shall be away for two years perhaps three we sail in june and we shall send you the key and leave all in order for you to take possession when you choose we shall pack away a few things we prize especially but all the rest will be left  will you leave the china dogs asked anne timidly  would you like me to  oh indeed yes they are delightful  a pleased expression came into miss pattys face  i think a great deal of those dogs she said proudly they are over a hundred years old and they have sat on either side of this fireplace ever since my brother aaron brought them from london fifty years ago spofford avenue was called after my brother aaron  a fine man he was said miss maria speaking for the first time ah you dont see the like of him nowadays  he was a good uncle to you maria said miss patty with evident emotion you do well to remember him  i shall always remember him said miss maria solemnly i can see him this minute standing there before that fire with his hands under his coattails beaming on us  miss maria took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes but miss patty came resolutely back from the regions of sentiment to those of business  i shall leave the dogs where they are if you will promise to be very careful of them she said their names are gog and magog gog looks to the right and magog to the left and theres just one thing more you dont object i hope to this house being called pattys place  no indeed we think that is one of the nicest things about it  you have sense i see said miss patty in a tone of great satisfaction would you believe it all the people who came here to rent the house wanted to know if they couldnt take the name off the gate during their occupation of it i told them roundly that the name went with the house this has been pattys place ever since my brother aaron left it to me in his will and pattys place it shall remain until i die and maria dies after that happens the next possessor can call it any fool name he likes concluded miss patty much as she might have said after thatthe deluge and now wouldnt you like to go over the house and see it all before we consider the bargain made  further exploration still further delighted the girls besides the big livingroom there was a kitchen and a small bedroom downstairs upstairs were three rooms one large and two small anne took an especial fancy to one of the small ones looking out into the big pines and hoped it would be hers it was papered in pale blue and had a little oldtimey toilet table with sconces for candles there was a diamondpaned window with a seat under the blue muslin frills that would be a satisfying spot for studying or dreaming  its all so delicious that i know we are going to wake up and find it a fleeting vision of the night said priscilla as they went away  miss patty and miss maria are hardly such stuff as dreams are made of laughed anne can you fancy them globetrottingespecially in those shawls and caps  i suppose theyll take them off when they really begin to trot said priscilla but i know theyll take their knitting with them everywhere they simply couldnt be parted from it they will walk about westminster abbey and knit i feel sure meanwhile anne we shall be living in pattys placeand on spofford avenue i feel like a millionairess even now  i feel like one of the morning stars that sang for joy said anne  phil gordon crept into thirtyeight st johns that night and flung herself on annes bed  girls dear im tired to death i feel like the man without a countryor was it without a shadow i forget which anyway ive been packing up  and i suppose you are worn out because you couldnt decide which things to pack first or where to put them laughed priscilla  ezackly and when i had got everything jammed in somehow and my landlady and her maid had both sat on it while i locked it i discovered i had packed a whole lot of things i wanted for convocation at the very bottom i had to unlock the old thing and poke and dive into it for an hour before i fished out what i wanted i would get hold of something that felt like what i was looking for and id yank it up and it would be something else no anne i did not swear  i didnt say you did  well you looked it but i admit my thoughts verged on the profane and i have such a cold in the headi can do nothing but sniffle sigh and sneeze isnt that alliterative agony for you queen anne do say something to cheer me up  remember that next thursday night youll be back in the land of alec and alonzo suggested anne  phil shook her head dolefully  more alliteration no i dont want alec and alonzo when i have a cold in the head but what has happened you two now that i look at you closely you seem all lighted up with an internal iridescence why youre actually shining whats up  we are going to live in pattys place next winter said anne triumphantly live mark you not board weve rented it and stella maynard is coming and her aunt is going to keep house for us  phil bounced up wiped her nose and fell on her knees before anne  girlsgirlslet me come too oh ill be so good if theres no room for me ill sleep in the little doghouse in the orchardive seen it only let me come  get up you goose  i wont stir off my marrow bones till you tell me i can live with you next winter  anne and priscilla looked at each other then anne said slowly phil dear wed love to have you but we may as well speak plainly im poorpris is poorstella maynard is poorour housekeeping will have to be very simple and our table plain youd have to live as we would now you are rich and your boardinghouse fare attests the fact  oh what do i care for that demanded phil tragically better a dinner of herbs where your chums are than a stalled ox in a lonely boardinghouse dont think im all stomach girls ill be willing to live on bread and waterwith just a leetle jamif youll let me come  and then continued anne there will be a good deal of work to be done stellas aunt cant do it all we all expect to have our chores to do now you  toil not neither do i spin finished philippa but ill learn to do things youll only have to show me once i can make my own bed to begin with and remember that though i cant cook i can keep my temper thats something and i never growl about the weather thats more oh please please i never wanted anything so much in my lifeand this floor is awfully hard  theres just one more thing said priscilla resolutely you phil as all redmond knows entertain callers almost every evening now at pattys place we cant do that we have decided that we shall be at home to our friends on friday evenings only if you come with us youll have to abide by that rule  well you dont think ill mind that do you why im glad of it i knew i should have had some such rule myself but i hadnt enough decision to make it or stick to it when i can shuffle off the responsibility on you it will be a real relief if you wont let me cast in my lot with you ill die of the disappointment and then ill come back and haunt you ill camp on the very doorstep of pattys place and you wont be able to go out or come in without falling over my spook  again anne and priscilla exchanged eloquent looks  well said anne of course we cant promise to take you until weve consulted with stella but i dont think shell object and as far as we are concerned you may come and glad welcome  if you get tired of our simple life you can leave us and no questions asked added priscilla  phil sprang up hugged them both jubilantly and went on her way rejoicing  i hope things will go right said priscilla soberly  we must make them go right avowed anne i think phil will fit into our appy little ome very well  oh phils a dear to rattle round with and be chums and of course the more there are of us the easier it will be on our slim purses but how will she be to live with you have to summer and winter with any one before you know if shes livable or not  oh well well all be put to the test as far as that goes and we must quit us like sensible folk living and let live phil isnt selfish though shes a little thoughtless and i believe we will all get on beautifully in pattys place     chapter xi  the round of life   anne was back in avonlea with the luster of the thorburn scholarship on her brow people told her she hadnt changed much in a tone which hinted they were surprised and a little disappointed she hadnt avonlea had not changed either at least so it seemed at first but as anne sat in the green gables pew on the first sunday after her return and looked over the congregation she saw several little changes which all coming home to her at once made her realize that time did not quite stand still even in avonlea a new minister was in the pulpit in the pews more than one familiar face was missing forever old uncle abe his prophesying over and done with mrs peter sloane who had sighed it was to be hoped for the last time timothy cotton who as mrs rachel lynde said had actually managed to die at last after practicing at it for twenty years and old josiah sloane whom nobody knew in his coffin because he had his whiskers neatly trimmed were all sleeping in the little graveyard behind the church and billy andrews was married to nettie blewett they appeared out that sunday when billy beaming with pride and happiness showed his beplumed and besilked bride into the harmon andrews pew anne dropped her lids to hide her dancing eyes she recalled the stormy winter night of the christmas holidays when jane had proposed for billy he certainly had not broken his heart over his rejection anne wondered if jane had also proposed to nettie for him or if he had mustered enough spunk to ask the fateful question himself all the andrews family seemed to share in his pride and pleasure from mrs harmon in the pew to jane in the choir jane had resigned from the avonlea school and intended to go west in the fall  cant get a beau in avonlea thats what said mrs rachel lynde scornfully says she thinks shell have better health out west i never heard her health was poor before  jane is a nice girl anne had said loyally she never tried to attract attention as some did  oh she never chased the boys if thats what you mean said mrs rachel but shed like to be married just as much as anybody thats what what else would take her out west to some forsaken place whose only recommendation is that men are plenty and women scarce dont you tell me  but it was not at jane anne gazed that day in dismay and surprise it was at ruby gillis who sat beside her in the choir what had happened to ruby she was even handsomer than ever but her blue eyes were too bright and lustrous and the color of her cheeks was hectically brilliant besides she was very thin the hands that held her hymnbook were almost transparent in their delicacy  is ruby gillis ill anne asked of mrs lynde as they went home from church  ruby gillis is dying of galloping consumption said mrs lynde bluntly everybody knows it except herself and her family they wont give in if you ask them shes perfectly well she hasnt been able to teach since she had that attack of congestion in the winter but she says shes going to teach again in the fall and shes after the white sands school shell be in her grave poor girl when white sands school opens thats what  anne listened in shocked silence ruby gillis her old schoolchum dying could it be possible of late years they had grown apart but the old tie of schoolgirl intimacy was there and made itself felt sharply in the tug the news gave at annes heartstrings ruby the brilliant the merry the coquettish it was impossible to associate the thought of her with anything like death she had greeted anne with gay cordiality after church and urged her to come up the next evening  ill be away tuesday and wednesday evenings she had whispered triumphantly theres a concert at carmody and a party at white sands herb spencers going to take me hes my latest be sure to come up tomorrow im dying for a good talk with you i want to hear all about your doings at redmond  anne knew that ruby meant that she wanted to tell anne all about her own recent flirtations but she promised to go and diana offered to go with her  ive been wanting to go to see ruby for a long while she told anne when they left green gables the next evening but i really couldnt go alone its so awful to hear ruby rattling on as she does and pretending there is nothing the matter with her even when she can hardly speak for coughing shes fighting so hard for her life and yet she hasnt any chance at all they say  the girls walked silently down the red twilit road the robins were singing vespers in the high treetops filling the golden air with their jubilant voices the silver fluting of the frogs came from marshes and ponds over fields where seeds were beginning to stir with life and thrill to the sunshine and rain that had drifted over them the air was fragrant with the wild sweet wholesome smell of young raspberry copses white mists were hovering in the silent hollows and violet stars were shining bluely on the brooklands  what a beautiful sunset said diana look anne its just like a land in itself isnt it that long low back of purple cloud is the shore and the clear sky further on is like a golden sea  if we could sail to it in the moonshine boat paul wrote of in his old compositionyou rememberhow nice it would be said anne rousing from her reverie do you think we could find all our yesterdays there dianaall our old springs and blossoms the beds of flowers that paul saw there are the roses that have bloomed for us in the past  dont said diana you make me feel as if we were old women with everything in life behind us  i think ive almost felt as if we were since i heard about poor ruby said anne if it is true that she is dying any other sad thing might be true too  you dont mind calling in at elisha wrights for a moment do you asked diana mother asked me to leave this little dish of jelly for aunt atossa  who is aunt atossa  oh havent you heard shes mrs samson coates of spencervalemrs elisha wrights aunt shes fathers aunt too her husband died last winter and she was left very poor and lonely so the wrights took her to live with them mother thought we ought to take her but father put his foot down live with aunt atossa he would not  is she so terrible asked anne absently  youll probably see what shes like before we can get away said diana significantly father says she has a face like a hatchetit cuts the air but her tongue is sharper still  late as it was aunt atossa was cutting potato sets in the wright kitchen she wore a faded old wrapper and her gray hair was decidedly untidy aunt atossa did not like being caught in a kilter so she went out of her way to be disagreeable  oh so youre anne shirley she said when diana introduced anne ive heard of you her tone implied that she had heard nothing good mrs andrews was telling me you were home she said you had improved a good deal  there was no doubt aunt atossa thought there was plenty of room for further improvement she ceased not from cutting sets with much energy  is it any use to ask you to sit down she inquired sarcastically of course theres nothing very entertaining here for you the rest are all away  mother sent you this little pot of rhubarb jelly said diana pleasantly she made it today and thought you might like some  oh thanks said aunt atossa sourly i never fancy your mothers jellyshe always makes it too sweet however ill try to worry some down my appetites been dreadful poor this spring im far from well continued aunt atossa solemnly but still i keep adoing people who cant work arent wanted here if it isnt too much trouble will you be condescending enough to set the jelly in the pantry im in a hurry to get these spuds done tonight i suppose you two ladies never do anything like this youd be afraid of spoiling your hands  i used to cut potato sets before we rented the farm smiled anne  i do it yet laughed diana i cut sets three days last week of course she added teasingly i did my hands up in lemon juice and kid gloves every night after it  aunt atossa sniffed  i suppose you got that notion out of some of those silly magazines you read so many of i wonder your mother allows you but she always spoiled you we all thought when george married her she wouldnt be a suitable wife for him  aunt atossa sighed heavily as if all forebodings upon the occasion of george barrys marriage had been amply and darkly fulfilled  going are you she inquired as the girls rose well i suppose you cant find much amusement talking to an old woman like me its such a pity the boys aint home  we want to run in and see ruby gillis a little while explained diana  oh anything does for an excuse of course said aunt atossa amiably just whip in and whip out before you have time to say howdo decently its college airs i spose youd be wiser to keep away from ruby gillis the doctors say consumptions catching i always knew rubyd get something gadding off to boston last fall for a visit people who aint content to stay home always catch something  people who dont go visiting catch things too sometimes they even die said diana solemnly  then they dont have themselves to blame for it retorted aunt atossa triumphantly i hear you are to be married in june diana  there is no truth in that report said diana blushing  well dont put it off too long said aunt atossa significantly youll fade soonyoure all complexion and hair and the wrights are terrible fickle you ought to wear a hat miss shirley your nose is freckling scandalous my but you are redheaded well i spose were all as the lord made us give marilla cuthbert my respects shes never been to see me since i come to avonlea but i spose i oughtnt to complain the cuthberts always did think themselves a cut higher than any one else round here  oh isnt she dreadful gasped diana as they escaped down the lane  shes worse than miss eliza andrews said anne but then think of living all your life with a name like atossa wouldnt it sour almost any one she should have tried to imagine her name was cordelia it might have helped her a great deal it certainly helped me in the days when i didnt like anne  josie pye will be just like her when she grows up said diana josies mother and aunt atossa are cousins you know oh dear im glad thats over shes so maliciousshe seems to put a bad flavor in everything father tells such a funny story about her one time they had a minister in spencervale who was a very good spiritual man but very deaf he couldnt hear any ordinary conversation at all well they used to have a prayer meeting on sunday evenings and all the church members present would get up and pray in turn or say a few words on some bible verse but one evening aunt atossa bounced up she didnt either pray or preach instead she lit into everybody else in the church and gave them a fearful raking down calling them right out by name and telling them how they all had behaved and casting up all the quarrels and scandals of the past ten years finally she wound up by saying that she was disgusted with spencervale church and she never meant to darken its door again and she hoped a fearful judgment would come upon it then she sat down out of breath and the minister who hadnt heard a word she said immediately remarked in a very devout voice amen the lord grant our dear sisters prayer you ought to hear father tell the story  speaking of stories diana remarked anne in a significant confidential tone do you know that lately i have been wondering if i could write a short storya story that would be good enough to be published  why of course you could said diana after she had grasped the amazing suggestion you used to write perfectly thrilling stories years ago in our old story club  well i hardly meant one of that kind of stories smiled anne ive been thinking about it a little of late but im almost afraid to try for if i should fail it would be too humiliating  i heard priscilla say once that all mrs morgans first stories were rejected but im sure yours wouldnt be anne for its likely editors have more sense nowadays  margaret burton one of the junior girls at redmond wrote a story last winter and it was published in the canadian woman i really do think i could write one at least as good  and will you have it published in the canadian woman  i might try one of the bigger magazines first it all depends on what kind of a story i write  what is it to be about  i dont know yet i want to get hold of a good plot i believe this is very necessary from an editors point of view the only thing ive settled on is the heroines name it is to be averil lester rather pretty dont you think dont mention this to any one diana i havent told anybody but you and mr harrison he wasnt very encouraginghe said there was far too much trash written nowadays as it was and hed expected something better of me after a year at college  what does mr harrison know about it demanded diana scornfully  they found the gillis home gay with lights and callers leonard kimball of spencervale and morgan bell of carmody were glaring at each other across the parlor several merry girls had dropped in ruby was dressed in white and her eyes and cheeks were very brilliant she laughed and chattered incessantly and after the other girls had gone she took anne upstairs to display her new summer dresses  ive a blue silk to make up yet but its a little heavy for summer wear i think ill leave it until the fall im going to teach in white sands you know how do you like my hat that one you had on in church yesterday was real dinky but i like something brighter for myself did you notice those two ridiculous boys downstairs theyve both come determined to sit each other out i dont care a single bit about either of them you know herb spencer is the one i like sometimes i really do think hes mr right at christmas i thought the spencervale schoolmaster was that but i found out something about him that turned me against him he nearly went insane when i turned him down i wish those two boys hadnt come tonight i wanted to have a nice good talk with you anne and tell you such heaps of things you and i were always good chums werent we  ruby slipped her arm about annes waist with a shallow little laugh but just for a moment their eyes met and behind all the luster of rubys anne saw something that made her heart ache  come up often wont you anne whispered ruby come alonei want you  are you feeling quite well ruby  me why im perfectly well i never felt better in my life of course that congestion last winter pulled me down a little but just see my color i dont look much like an invalid im sure  rubys voice was almost sharp she pulled her arm away from anne as if in resentment and ran downstairs where she was gayer than ever apparently so much absorbed in bantering her two swains that diana and anne felt rather out of it and soon went away     chapter xii  averils atonement   what are you dreaming of anne  the two girls were loitering one evening in a fairy hollow of the brook ferns nodded in it and little grasses were green and wild pears hung finelyscented white curtains around it  anne roused herself from her reverie with a happy sigh  i was thinking out my story diana  oh have you really begun it cried diana all alight with eager interest in a moment  yes i have only a few pages written but i have it all pretty well thought out ive had such a time to get a suitable plot none of the plots that suggested themselves suited a girl named averil  couldnt you have changed her name  no the thing was impossible i tried to but i couldnt do it any more than i could change yours averil was so real to me that no matter what other name i tried to give her i just thought of her as averil behind it all but finally i got a plot that matched her then came the excitement of choosing names for all my characters you have no idea how fascinating that is ive lain awake for hours thinking over those names the heros name is perceval dalrymple  have you named all the characters asked diana wistfully if you hadnt i was going to ask you to let me name onejust some unimportant person id feel as if i had a share in the story then  you may name the little hired boy who lived with the lesters conceded anne he is not very important but he is the only one left unnamed  call him raymond fitzosborne suggested diana who had a store of such names laid away in her memory relics of the old story club which she and anne and jane andrews and ruby gillis had had in their schooldays  anne shook her head doubtfully  im afraid that is too aristocratic a name for a chore boy diana i couldnt imagine a fitzosborne feeding pigs and picking up chips could you  diana didnt see why if you had an imagination at all you couldnt stretch it to that extent but probably anne knew best and the chore boy was finally christened robert ray to be called bobby should occasion require  how much do you suppose youll get for it asked diana  but anne had not thought about this at all she was in pursuit of fame not filthy lucre and her literary dreams were as yet untainted by mercenary considerations  youll let me read it wont you pleaded diana  when it is finished ill read it to you and mr harrison and i shall want you to criticize it severely no one else shall see it until it is published  how are you going to end ithappily or unhappily  im not sure id like it to end unhappily because that would be so much more romantic but i understand editors have a prejudice against sad endings i heard professor hamilton say once that nobody but a genius should try to write an unhappy ending and concluded anne modestly im anything but a genius  oh i like happy endings best youd better let him marry her said diana who especially since her engagement to fred thought this was how every story should end  but you like to cry over stories  oh yes in the middle of them but i like everything to come right at last  i must have one pathetic scene in it said anne thoughtfully i might let robert ray be injured in an accident and have a death scene  no you mustnt kill bobby off declared diana laughing he belongs to me and i want him to live and flourish kill somebody else if you have to  for the next fortnight anne writhed or reveled according to mood in her literary pursuits now she would be jubilant over a brilliant idea now despairing because some contrary character would not behave properly diana could not understand this  make them do as you want them to she said  i cant mourned anne averil is such an unmanageable heroine she will do and say things i never meant her to then that spoils everything that went before and i have to write it all over again  finally however the story was finished and anne read it to diana in the seclusion of the porch gable she had achieved her pathetic scene without sacrificing robert ray and she kept a watchful eye on diana as she read it diana rose to the occasion and cried properly but when the end came she looked a little disappointed  why did you kill maurice lennox she asked reproachfully  he was the villain protested anne he had to be punished  i like him best of them all said unreasonable diana  well hes dead and hell have to stay dead said anne rather resentfully if i had let him live hed have gone on persecuting averil and perceval  yesunless you had reformed him  that wouldnt have been romantic and besides it would have made the story too long  well anyway its a perfectly elegant story anne and will make you famous of that im sure have you got a title for it  oh i decided on the title long ago i call it averils atonement doesnt that sound nice and alliterative now diana tell me candidly do you see any faults in my story  well hesitated diana that part where averil makes the cake doesnt seem to me quite romantic enough to match the rest its just what anybody might do heroines shouldnt do cooking i think  why that is where the humor comes in and its one of the best parts of the whole story said anne and it may be stated that in this she was quite right  diana prudently refrained from any further criticism but mr harrison was much harder to please first he told her there was entirely too much description in the story  cut out all those flowery passages he said unfeelingly  anne had an uncomfortable conviction that mr harrison was right and she forced herself to expunge most of her beloved descriptions though it took three rewritings before the story could be pruned down to please the fastidious mr harrison  ive left out all the descriptions but the sunset she said at last i simply couldnt let it go it was the best of them all  it hasnt anything to do with the story said mr harrison and you shouldnt have laid the scene among rich city people what do you know of them why didnt you lay it right here in avonleachanging the name of course or else mrs rachel lynde would probably think she was the heroine  oh that would never have done protested anne avonlea is the dearest place in the world but it isnt quite romantic enough for the scene of a story  i daresay theres been many a romance in avonleaand many a tragedy too said mr harrison drily but your folks aint like real folks anywhere they talk too much and use too highflown language theres one place where that dalrymple chap talks even on for two pages and never lets the girl get a word in edgewise if hed done that in real life shed have pitched him  i dont believe it said anne flatly in her secret soul she thought that the beautiful poetical things said to averil would win any girls heart completely besides it was gruesome to hear of averil the stately queenlike averil pitching any one averil declined her suitors  anyhow resumed the merciless mr harrison i dont see why maurice lennox didnt get her he was twice the man the other is he did bad things but he did them perceval hadnt time for anything but mooning  mooning that was even worse than pitching  maurice lennox was the villain said anne indignantly i dont see why every one likes him better than perceval  perceval is too good hes aggravating next time you write about a hero put a little spice of human nature in him  averil couldnt have married maurice he was bad  shed have reformed him you can reform a man you cant reform a jellyfish of course your story isnt badits kind of interesting ill admit but youre too young to write a story that would be worth while wait ten years  anne made up her mind that the next time she wrote a story she wouldnt ask anybody to criticize it it was too discouraging she would not read the story to gilbert although she told him about it  if it is a success youll see it when it is published gilbert but if it is a failure nobody shall ever see it  marilla knew nothing about the venture in imagination anne saw herself reading a story out of a magazine to marilla entrapping her into praise of itfor in imagination all things are possibleand then triumphantly announcing herself the author  one day anne took to the post office a long bulky envelope addressed with the delightful confidence of youth and inexperience to the very biggest of the big magazines diana was as excited over it as anne herself  how long do you suppose it will be before you hear from it she asked  it shouldnt be longer than a fortnight oh how happy and proud i shall be if it is accepted  of course it will be accepted and they will likely ask you to send them more you may be as famous as mrs morgan some day anne and then how proud ill be of knowing you said diana who possessed at least the striking merit of an unselfish admiration of the gifts and graces of her friends  a week of delightful dreaming followed and then came a bitter awakening one evening diana found anne in the porch gable with suspiciouslooking eyes on the table lay a long envelope and a crumpled manuscript  anne your story hasnt come back cried diana incredulously  yes it has said anne shortly  well that editor must be crazy what reason did he give  no reason at all there is just a printed slip saying that it wasnt found acceptable  i never thought much of that magazine anyway said diana hotly the stories in it are not half as interesting as those in the canadian woman although it costs so much more i suppose the editor is prejudiced against any one who isnt a yankee dont be discouraged anne remember how mrs morgans stories came back send yours to the canadian woman  i believe i will said anne plucking up heart and if it is published ill send that american editor a marked copy but ill cut the sunset out i believe mr harrison was right  out came the sunset but in spite of this heroic mutilation the editor of the canadian woman sent averils atonement back so promptly that the indignant diana declared that it couldnt have been read at all and vowed she was going to stop her subscription immediately anne took this second rejection with the calmness of despair she locked the story away in the garret trunk where the old story club tales reposed but first she yielded to dianas entreaties and gave her a copy  this is the end of my literary ambitions she said bitterly  she never mentioned the matter to mr harrison but one evening he asked her bluntly if her story had been accepted  no the editor wouldnt take it she answered briefly  mr harrison looked sidewise at the flushed delicate profile  well i suppose youll keep on writing them he said encouragingly  no i shall never try to write a story again declared anne with the hopeless finality of nineteen when a door is shut in its face  i wouldnt give up altogether said mr harrison reflectively id write a story once in a while but i wouldnt pester editors with it id write of people and places like i knew and id make my characters talk everyday english and id let the sun rise and set in the usual quiet way without much fuss over the fact if i had to have villains at all id give them a chance anneid give them a chance there are some terrible bad men in the world i suppose but youd have to go a long piece to find themthough mrs lynde believes were all bad but most of us have got a little decency somewhere in us keep on writing anne  no it was very foolish of me to attempt it when im through redmond ill stick to teaching i can teach i cant write stories  itll be time for you to be getting a husband when youre through redmond said mr harrison i dont believe in putting marrying off too longlike i did  anne got up and marched home there were times when mr harrison was really intolerable pitching mooning and getting a husband ow     chapter xiii  the way of transgressors   davy and dora were ready for sunday school they were going alone which did not often happen for mrs lynde always attended sunday school but mrs lynde had twisted her ankle and was lame so she was staying home this morning the twins were also to represent the family at church for anne had gone away the evening before to spend sunday with friends in carmody and marilla had one of her headaches  davy came downstairs slowly dora was waiting in the hall for him having been made ready by mrs lynde davy had attended to his own preparations he had a cent in his pocket for the sunday school collection and a fivecent piece for the church collection he carried his bible in one hand and his sunday school quarterly in the other he knew his lesson and his golden text and his catechism question perfectly had he not studied themperforcein mrs lyndes kitchen all last sunday afternoon davy therefore should have been in a placid frame of mind as a matter of fact despite text and catechism he was inwardly as a ravening wolf  mrs lynde limped out of her kitchen as he joined dora  are you clean she demanded severely  yesall of me that shows davy answered with a defiant scowl  mrs rachel sighed she had her suspicions about davys neck and ears but she knew that if she attempted to make a personal examination davy would likely take to his heels and she could not pursue him today  well be sure you behave yourselves she warned them dont walk in the dust dont stop in the porch to talk to the other children dont squirm or wriggle in your places dont forget the golden text dont lose your collection or forget to put it in dont whisper at prayer time and dont forget to pay attention to the sermon  davy deigned no response he marched away down the lane followed by the meek dora but his soul seethed within davy had suffered or thought he had suffered many things at the hands and tongue of mrs rachel lynde since she had come to green gables for mrs lynde could not live with anybody whether they were nine or ninety without trying to bring them up properly and it was only the preceding afternoon that she had interfered to influence marilla against allowing davy to go fishing with the timothy cottons davy was still boiling over this  as soon as he was out of the lane davy stopped and twisted his countenance into such an unearthly and terrific contortion that dora although she knew his gifts in that respect was honestly alarmed lest he should never in the world be able to get it straightened out again  darn her exploded davy  oh davy dont swear gasped dora in dismay  darn isnt swearingnot real swearing and i dont care if it is retorted davy recklessly  well if you must say dreadful words dont say them on sunday pleaded dora  davy was as yet far from repentance but in his secret soul he felt that perhaps he had gone a little too far  im going to invent a swear word of my own he declared  god will punish you if you do said dora solemnly  then i think god is a mean old scamp retorted davy doesnt he know a fellow must have some way of spressing his feelings  davy said dora she expected that davy would be struck down dead on the spot but nothing happened  anyway i aint going to stand any more of mrs lyndes bossing spluttered davy anne and marilla may have the right to boss me but she hasnt im going to do every single thing she told me not to do you watch me  in grim deliberate silence while dora watched him with the fascination of horror davy stepped off the green grass of the roadside ankle deep into the fine dust which four weeks of rainless weather had made on the road and marched along in it shuffling his feet viciously until he was enveloped in a hazy cloud  thats the beginning he announced triumphantly and im going to stop in the porch and talk as long as theres anybody there to talk to im going to squirm and wriggle and whisper and im going to say i dont know the golden text and im going to throw away both of my collections right now  and davy hurled cent and nickel over mr barrys fence with fierce delight  satan made you do that said dora reproachfully  he didnt cried davy indignantly i just thought it out for myself and ive thought of something else im not going to sunday school or church at all im going up to play with the cottons they told me yesterday they werent going to sunday school today cause their mother was away and there was nobody to make them come along dora well have a great time  i dont want to go protested dora  youve got to said davy if you dont come ill tell marilla that frank bell kissed you in school last monday  i couldnt help it i didnt know he was going to cried dora blushing scarlet  well you didnt slap him or seem a bit cross retorted davy ill tell her that too if you dont come well take the short cut up this field  im afraid of those cows protested poor dora seeing a prospect of escape  the very idea of your being scared of those cows scoffed davy why theyre both younger than you  theyre bigger said dora  they wont hurt you come along now this is great when i grow up i aint going to bother going to church at all i believe i can get to heaven by myself  youll go to the other place if you break the sabbath day said unhappy dora following him sorely against her will  but davy was not scaredyet hell was very far off and the delights of a fishing expedition with the cottons were very near he wished dora had more spunk she kept looking back as if she were going to cry every minute and that spoiled a fellows fun hang girls anyway davy did not say darn this time even in thought he was not sorryyetthat he had said it once but it might be as well not to tempt the unknown powers too far on one day  the small cottons were playing in their back yard and hailed davys appearance with whoops of delight pete tommy adolphus and mirabel cotton were all alone their mother and older sisters were away dora was thankful mirabel was there at least she had been afraid she would be alone in a crowd of boys mirabel was almost as bad as a boyshe was so noisy and sunburned and reckless but at least she wore dresses  weve come to go fishing announced davy  whoop yelled the cottons they rushed away to dig worms at once mirabel leading the van with a tin can dora could have sat down and cried oh if only that hateful frank bell had never kissed her then she could have defied davy and gone to her beloved sunday school  they dared not of course go fishing on the pond where they would be seen by people going to church they had to resort to the brook in the woods behind the cotton house but it was full of trout and they had a glorious time that morningat least the cottons certainly had and davy seemed to have it not being entirely bereft of prudence he had discarded boots and stockings and borrowed tommy cottons overalls thus accoutered bog and marsh and undergrowth had no terrors for him dora was frankly and manifestly miserable she followed the others in their peregrinations from pool to pool clasping her bible and quarterly tightly and thinking with bitterness of soul of her beloved class where she should be sitting that very moment before a teacher she adored instead here she was roaming the woods with those halfwild cottons trying to keep her boots clean and her pretty white dress free from rents and stains mirabel had offered the loan of an apron but dora had scornfully refused  the trout bit as they always do on sundays in an hour the transgressors had all the fish they wanted so they returned to the house much to doras relief she sat primly on a hencoop in the yard while the others played an uproarious game of tag and then they all climbed to the top of the pighouse roof and cut their initials on the saddleboard the flatroofed henhouse and a pile of straw beneath gave davy another inspiration they spent a splendid half hour climbing on the roof and diving off into the straw with whoops and yells  but even unlawful pleasures must come to an end when the rumble of wheels over the pond bridge told that people were going home from church davy knew they must go he discarded tommys overalls resumed his own rightful attire and turned away from his string of trout with a sigh no use to think of taking them home  well hadnt we a splendid time he demanded defiantly as they went down the hill field  i hadnt said dora flatly and i dont believe you hadreallyeither she added with a flash of insight that was not to be expected of her  i had so cried davy but in the voice of one who doth protest too much no wonder you hadntjust sitting there like alike a mule  i aint going to sociate with the cottons said dora loftily  the cottons are all right retorted davy and they have far better times than we have they do just as they please and say just what they like before everybody im going to do that too after this  there are lots of things you wouldnt dare say before everybody averred dora  no there isnt  there is too would you demanded dora gravely would you say tomcat before the minister  this was a staggerer davy was not prepared for such a concrete example of the freedom of speech but one did not have to be consistent with dora  of course not he admitted sulkily  tomcat isnt a holy word i wouldnt mention such an animal before a minister at all  but if you had to persisted dora  id call it a thomas pussy said davy  i think gentleman cat would be more polite reflected dora  you thinking retorted davy with withering scorn  davy was not feeling comfortable though he would have died before he admitted it to dora now that the exhilaration of truant delights had died away his conscience was beginning to give him salutary twinges after all perhaps it would have been better to have gone to sunday school and church mrs lynde might be bossy but there was always a box of cookies in her kitchen cupboard and she was not stingy at this inconvenient moment davy remembered that when he had torn his new school pants the week before mrs lynde had mended them beautifully and never said a word to marilla about them  but davys cup of iniquity was not yet full he was to discover that one sin demands another to cover it they had dinner with mrs lynde that day and the first thing she asked davy was  were all your class in sunday school today  yesm said davy with a gulp all were therecept one  did you say your golden text and catechism  yesm  did you put your collection in  yesm  was mrs malcolm macpherson in church  i dont know this at least was the truth thought wretched davy  was the ladies aid announced for next week  yesmquakingly  was prayermeeting  ii dont know  you should know you should listen more attentively to the announcements what was mr harveys text  davy took a frantic gulp of water and swallowed it and the last protest of conscience together he glibly recited an old golden text learned several weeks ago fortunately mrs lynde now stopped questioning him but davy did not enjoy his dinner  he could only eat one helping of pudding  whats the matter with you demanded justly astonished mrs lynde are you sick  no muttered davy  you look pale youd better keep out of the sun this afternoon admonished mrs lynde  do you know how many lies you told mrs lynde asked dora reproachfully as soon as they were alone after dinner  davy goaded to desperation turned fiercely  i dont know and i dont care he said you just shut up dora keith  then poor davy betook himself to a secluded retreat behind the woodpile to think over the way of transgressors  green gables was wrapped in darkness and silence when anne reached home she lost no time going to bed for she was very tired and sleepy there had been several avonlea jollifications the preceding week involving rather late hours annes head was hardly on her pillow before she was half asleep but just then her door was softly opened and a pleading voice said anne  anne sat up drowsily  davy is that you what is the matter  a whiteclad figure flung itself across the floor and on to the bed  anne sobbed davy getting his arms about her neck im awful glad youre home i couldnt go to sleep till id told somebody  told somebody what  how misrubul i am  why are you miserable dear  cause i was so bad today anne oh i was awful badbaddern ive ever been yet  what did you do  oh im afraid to tell you youll never like me again anne i couldnt say my prayers tonight i couldnt tell god what id done i was shamed to have him know  but he knew anyway davy  thats what dora said but i thought praps he mightnt have noticed just at the time anyway id rather tell you first  what is it you did  out it all came in a rush  i run away from sunday schooland went fishing with the cottonsand i told ever so many whoppers to mrs lyndeoh most half a dozenandandii said a swear word annea pretty near swear word anyhowand i called god names  there was silence davy didnt know what to make of it was anne so shocked that she never would speak to him again  anne what are you going to do to me he whispered  nothing dear youve been punished already i think  no i havent nothings been done to me  youve been very unhappy ever since you did wrong havent you  you bet said davy emphatically  that was your conscience punishing you davy  whats my conscience i want to know  its something in you davy that always tells you when you are doing wrong and makes you unhappy if you persist in doing it havent you noticed that  yes but i didnt know what it was i wish i didnt have it id have lots more fun where is my conscience anne i want to know is it in my stomach  no its in your soul answered anne thankful for the darkness since gravity must be preserved in serious matters  i spose i cant get clear of it then said davy with a sigh are you going to tell marilla and mrs lynde on me anne  no dear im not going to tell any one you are sorry you were naughty arent you  you bet  and youll never be bad like that again  no but added davy cautiously i might be bad some other way  you wont say naughty words or run away on sundays or tell falsehoods to cover up your sins  no it doesnt pay said davy  well davy just tell god you are sorry and ask him to forgive you  have you forgiven me anne  yes dear  then said davy joyously i dont care much whether god does or not  davy  ohill ask himill ask him said davy quickly scrambling off the bed convinced by annes tone that he must have said something dreadful i dont mind asking him anneplease god im awful sorry i behaved bad today and ill try to be good on sundays always and please forgive methere now anne  well now run off to bed like a good boy  all right say i dont feel misrubul any more i feel fine good night  good night  anne slipped down on her pillows with a sigh of relief ohhow sleepyshe was in another second  anne davy was back again by her bed anne dragged her eyes open  what is it now dear she asked trying to keep a note of impatience out of her voice  anne have you ever noticed how mr harrison spits do you spose if i practice hard i can learn to spit just like him  anne sat up  davy keith she said go straight to your bed and dont let me catch you out of it again tonight go now  davy went and stood not upon the order of his going     chapter xiv  the summons   anne was sitting with ruby gillis in the gillis garden after the day had crept lingeringly through it and was gone it had been a warm smoky summer afternoon the world was in a splendor of outflowering the idle valleys were full of hazes the woodways were pranked with shadows and the fields with the purple of the asters  anne had given up a moonlight drive to the white sands beach that she might spend the evening with ruby she had so spent many evenings that summer although she often wondered what good it did any one and sometimes went home deciding that she could not go again  ruby grew paler as the summer waned the white sands school was given upher father thought it better that she shouldnt teach till new yearsand the fancy work she loved oftener and oftener fell from hands grown too weary for it but she was always gay always hopeful always chattering and whispering of her beaux and their rivalries and despairs it was this that made annes visits hard for her what had once been silly or amusing was gruesome now it was death peering through a wilful mask of life yet ruby seemed to cling to her and never let her go until she had promised to come again soon mrs lynde grumbled about annes frequent visits and declared she would catch consumption even marilla was dubious  every time you go to see ruby you come home looking tired out she said  its so very sad and dreadful said anne in a low tone ruby doesnt seem to realize her condition in the least and yet i somehow feel she needs helpcraves itand i want to give it to her and cant all the time im with her i feel as if i were watching her struggle with an invisible foetrying to push it back with such feeble resistance as she has that is why i come home tired  but tonight anne did not feel this so keenly ruby was strangely quiet she said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and fellows she lay in the hammock with her untouched work beside her and a white shawl wrapped about her thin shoulders her long yellow braids of hairhow anne had envied those beautiful braids in old schooldayslay on either side of her she had taken the pins outthey made her head ache she said the hectic flush was gone for the time leaving her pale and childlike  the moon rose in the silvery sky empearling the clouds around her below the pond shimmered in its hazy radiance just beyond the gillis homestead was the church with the old graveyard beside it the moonlight shone on the white stones bringing them out in clearcut relief against the dark trees behind  how strange the graveyard looks by moonlight said ruby suddenly how ghostly she shuddered anne it wont be long now before ill be lying over there you and diana and all the rest will be going about full of lifeand ill be therein the old graveyarddead  the surprise of it bewildered anne for a few moments she could not speak  you know its so dont you said ruby insistently  yes i know answered anne in a low tone dear ruby i know  everybody knows it said ruby bitterly i know itive known it all summer though i wouldnt give in and oh anneshe reached out and caught annes hand pleadingly impulsivelyi dont want to die im afraid to die  why should you be afraid ruby asked anne quietly  becausebecauseoh im not afraid but that ill go to heaven anne im a church member butitll be all so different i thinkand thinkand i get so frightenedandandhomesick heaven must be very beautiful of course the bible says sobut anne it wont be what ive been used to  through annes mind drifted an intrusive recollection of a funny story she had heard philippa gordon tellthe story of some old man who had said very much the same thing about the world to come it had sounded funny thenshe remembered how she and priscilla had laughed over it but it did not seem in the least humorous now coming from rubys pale trembling lips it was sad tragicand true heaven could not be what ruby had been used to there had been nothing in her gay frivolous life her shallow ideals and aspirations to fit her for that great change or make the life to come seem to her anything but alien and unreal and undesirable anne wondered helplessly what she could say that would help her could she say anything i think ruby she began hesitatinglyfor it was difficult for anne to speak to any one of the deepest thoughts of her heart or the new ideas that had vaguely begun to shape themselves in her mind concerning the great mysteries of life here and hereafter superseding her old childish conceptions and it was hardest of all to speak of them to such as ruby gillisi think perhaps we have very mistaken ideas about heavenwhat it is and what it holds for us i dont think it can be so very different from life here as most people seem to think i believe well just go on living a good deal as we live hereand be ourselves just the sameonly it will be easier to be good and tofollow the highest all the hindrances and perplexities will be taken away and we shall see clearly dont be afraid ruby  i cant help it said ruby pitifully even if what you say about heaven is trueand you cant be sureit may be only that imagination of yoursit wont be just the same it cant be i want to go on living here im so young anne i havent had my life ive fought so hard to liveand it isnt any usei have to dieand leave everything i care for anne sat in a pain that was almost intolerable she could not tell comforting falsehoods and all that ruby said was so horribly true she was leaving everything she cared for she had laid up her treasures on earth only she had lived solely for the little things of lifethe things that passforgetting the great things that go onward into eternity bridging the gulf between the two lives and making of death a mere passing from one dwelling to the otherfrom twilight to unclouded day god would take care of her thereanne believedshe would learnbut now it was no wonder her soul clung in blind helplessness to the only things she knew and loved  ruby raised herself on her arm and lifted up her bright beautiful blue eyes to the moonlit skies  i want to live she said in a trembling voice i want to live like other girls ii want to be married anneandandhave little children you know i always loved babies anne i couldnt say this to any one but you i know you understand and then poor herbhehe loves me and i love him anne the others meant nothing to me but he doesand if i could live i would be his wife and be so happy oh anne its hard  ruby sank back on her pillows and sobbed convulsively anne pressed her hand in an agony of sympathysilent sympathy which perhaps helped ruby more than broken imperfect words could have done for presently she grew calmer and her sobs ceased  im glad ive told you this anne she whispered it has helped me just to say it all out ive wanted to all summerevery time you came i wanted to talk it over with youbut i couldnt it seemed as if it would make death so sure if i said i was going to die or if any one else said it or hinted it i wouldnt say it or even think it in the daytime when people were around me and everything was cheerful it wasnt so hard to keep from thinking of it but in the night when i couldnt sleepit was so dreadful anne i couldnt get away from it then death just came and stared me in the face until i got so frightened i could have screamed  but you wont be frightened any more ruby will you youll be brave and believe that all is going to be well with you  ill try ill think over what you have said and try to believe it and youll come up as often as you can wont you anne  yes dear  itit wont be very long now anne i feel sure of that and id rather have you than any one else i always liked you best of all the girls i went to school with you were never jealous or mean like some of them were poor em white was up to see me yesterday you remember em and i were such chums for three years when we went to school and then we quarrelled the time of the school concert weve never spoken to each other since wasnt it silly anything like that seems silly now but em and i made up the old quarrel yesterday she said shed have spoken years ago only she thought i wouldnt and i never spoke to her because i was sure she wouldnt speak to me isnt it strange how people misunderstand each other anne  most of the trouble in life comes from misunderstanding i think said anne i must go now ruby its getting lateand you shouldnt be out in the damp  youll come up soon again  yes very soon and if theres anything i can do to help you ill be so glad  i know you have helped me already nothing seems quite so dreadful now good night anne  good night dear  anne walked home very slowly in the moonlight the evening had changed something for her life held a different meaning a deeper purpose on the surface it would go on just the same but the deeps had been stirred it must not be with her as with poor butterfly ruby when she came to the end of one life it must not be to face the next with the shrinking terror of something wholly differentsomething for which accustomed thought and ideal and aspiration had unfitted her the little things of life sweet and excellent in their place must not be the things lived for the highest must be sought and followed the life of heaven must be begun here on earth  that good night in the garden was for all time anne never saw ruby in life again the next night the avis gave a farewell party to jane andrews before her departure for the west and while light feet danced and bright eyes laughed and merry tongues chattered there came a summons to a soul in avonlea that might not be disregarded or evaded the next morning the word went from house to house that ruby gillis was dead she had died in her sleep painlessly and calmly and on her face was a smileas if after all death had come as a kindly friend to lead her over the threshold instead of the grisly phantom she had dreaded  mrs rachel lynde said emphatically after the funeral that ruby gillis was the handsomest corpse she ever laid eyes on her loveliness as she lay whiteclad among the delicate flowers that anne had placed about her was remembered and talked of for years in avonlea ruby had always been beautiful but her beauty had been of the earth earthy it had had a certain insolent quality in it as if it flaunted itself in the beholders eye spirit had never shone through it intellect had never refined it but death had touched it and consecrated it bringing out delicate modelings and purity of outline never seen beforedoing what life and love and great sorrow and deep womanhood joys might have done for ruby anne looking down through a mist of tears at her old playfellow thought she saw the face god had meant ruby to have and remembered it so always  mrs gillis called anne aside into a vacant room before the funeral procession left the house and gave her a small packet  i want you to have this she sobbed ruby would have liked you to have it its the embroidered centerpiece she was working at it isnt quite finishedthe needle is sticking in it just where her poor little fingers put it the last time she laid it down the afternoon before she died  theres always a piece of unfinished work left said mrs lynde with tears in her eyes but i suppose theres always some one to finish it  how difficult it is to realize that one we have always known can really be dead said anne as she and diana walked home ruby is the first of our schoolmates to go one by one sooner or later all the rest of us must follow  yes i suppose so said diana uncomfortably she did not want to talk of that she would have preferred to have discussed the details of the funeralthe splendid white velvet casket mr gillis had insisted on having for rubythe gillises must always make a splurge even at funerals quoth mrs rachel lyndeherb spencers sad face the uncontrolled hysteric grief of one of rubys sistersbut anne would not talk of these things she seemed wrapped in a reverie in which diana felt lonesomely that she had neither lot nor part  ruby gillis was a great girl to laugh said davy suddenly will she laugh as much in heaven as she did in avonlea anne i want to know  yes i think she will said anne  oh anne protested diana with a rather shocked smile  well why not diana asked anne seriously do you think well never laugh in heaven  ohii dont know floundered diana it doesnt seem just right somehow you know its rather dreadful to laugh in church  but heaven wont be like churchall the time said anne  i hope it aint said davy emphatically if it is i dont want to go church is awful dull anyway i dont mean to go for ever so long i mean to live to be a hundred years old like mr thomas blewett of white sands he says hes lived so long cause he always smoked tobacco and it killed all the germs can i smoke tobacco pretty soon anne  no davy i hope youll never use tobacco said anne absently  whatll you feel like if the germs kill me then demanded davy     chapter xv  a dream turned upside down   just one more week and we go back to redmond said anne she was happy at the thought of returning to work classes and redmond friends pleasing visions were also being woven around pattys place there was a warm pleasant sense of home in the thought of it even though she had never lived there  but the summer had been a very happy one tooa time of glad living with summer suns and skies a time of keen delight in wholesome things a time of renewing and deepening of old friendships a time in which she had learned to live more nobly to work more patiently to play more heartily  all life lessons are not learned at college she thought life teaches them everywhere  but alas the final week of that pleasant vacation was spoiled for anne by one of those impish happenings which are like a dream turned upside down  been writing any more stories lately inquired mr harrison genially one evening when anne was taking tea with him and mrs harrison  no answered anne rather crisply  well no offense meant mrs hiram sloane told me the other day that a big envelope addressed to the rollings reliable baking powder company of montreal had been dropped into the post office box a month ago and she suspicioned that somebody was trying for the prize theyd offered for the best story that introduced the name of their baking powder she said it wasnt addressed in your writing but i thought maybe it was you  indeed no i saw the prize offer but id never dream of competing for it i think it would be perfectly disgraceful to write a story to advertise a baking powder it would be almost as bad as judson parkers patent medicine fence  so spake anne loftily little dreaming of the valley of humiliation awaiting her that very evening diana popped into the porch gable brighteyed and rosy cheeked carrying a letter  oh anne heres a letter for you i was at the office so i thought id bring it along do open it quick if it is what i believe it is i shall just be wild with delight anne puzzled opened the letter and glanced over the typewritten contents   miss anne shirley  green gables  avonlea pe island  dear madam we have much pleasure in informing you that your charming story averils atonement has won the prize of twentyfive dollars offered in our recent competition we enclose the check herewith we are arranging for the publication of the story in several prominent canadian newspapers and we also intend to have it printed in pamphlet form for distribution among our patrons thanking you for the interest you have shown in our enterprise we remain  yours very truly  the rollings reliable  baking powder co   i dont understand said anne blankly  diana clapped her hands  oh i knew it would win the prizei was sure of it i sent your story into the competition anne  dianabarry  yes i did said diana gleefully perching herself on the bed when i saw the offer i thought of your story in a minute and at first i thought id ask you to send it in but then i was afraid you wouldntyou had so little faith left in it so i just decided id send the copy you gave me and say nothing about it then if it didnt win the prize youd never know and you wouldnt feel badly over it because the stories that failed were not to be returned and if it did youd have such a delightful surprise  diana was not the most discerning of mortals but just at this moment it struck her that anne was not looking exactly overjoyed the surprise was there beyond doubtbut where was the delight  why anne you dont seem a bit pleased she exclaimed  anne instantly manufactured a smile and put it on  of course i couldnt be anything but pleased over your unselfish wish to give me pleasure she said slowly but you knowim so amazedi cant realize itand i dont understand there wasnt a word in my story aboutabout anne choked a little over the wordbaking powder  oh i put that in said diana reassured it was as easy as winkand of course my experience in our old story club helped me you know the scene where averil makes the cake well i just stated that she used the rollings reliable in it and that was why it turned out so well and then in the last paragraph where perceval clasps averil in his arms and says sweetheart the beautiful coming years will bring us the fulfilment of our home of dreams i added in which we will never use any baking powder except rollings reliable  oh gasped poor anne as if some one had dashed cold water on her  and youve won the twentyfive dollars continued diana jubilantly why i heard priscilla say once that the canadian woman only pays five dollars for a story  anne held out the hateful pink slip in shaking fingers  i cant take itits yours by right diana you sent the story in and made the alterations ii would certainly never have sent it so you must take the check  id like to see myself said diana scornfully why what i did wasnt any trouble the honor of being a friend of the prizewinner is enough for me well i must go i should have gone straight home from the post office for we have company but i simply had to come and hear the news im so glad for your sake anne  anne suddenly bent forward put her arms about diana and kissed her cheek  i think you are the sweetest and truest friend in the world diana she said with a little tremble in her voice and i assure you i appreciate the motive of what youve done  diana pleased and embarrassed got herself away and poor anne after flinging the innocent check into her bureau drawer as if it were bloodmoney cast herself on her bed and wept tears of shame and outraged sensibility oh she could never live this downnever  gilbert arrived at dusk brimming over with congratulations for he had called at orchard slope and heard the news but his congratulations died on his lips at sight of annes face  why anne what is the matter i expected to find you radiant over winning rollings reliable prize good for you  oh gilbert not you implored anne in an ettu brute tone i thought you would understand cant you see how awful it is  i must confess i cant what is wrong  everything moaned anne i feel as if i were disgraced forever what do you think a mother would feel like if she found her child tattooed over with a baking powder advertisement i feel just the same i loved my poor little story and i wrote it out of the best that was in me and it is sacrilege to have it degraded to the level of a baking powder advertisement dont you remember what professor hamilton used to tell us in the literature class at queens he said we were never to write a word for a low or unworthy motive but always to cling to the very highest ideals what will he think when he hears ive written a story to advertise rollings reliable and oh when it gets out at redmond think how ill be teased and laughed at  that you wont said gilbert wondering uneasily if it were that confounded juniors opinion in particular over which anne was worried the reds will think just as i thoughtthat you being like nine out of ten of us not overburdened with worldly wealth had taken this way of earning an honest penny to help yourself through the year i dont see that theres anything low or unworthy about that or anything ridiculous either one would rather write masterpieces of literature no doubtbut meanwhile board and tuition fees have to be paid  this commonsense matteroffact view of the case cheered anne a little at least it removed her dread of being laughed at though the deeper hurt of an outraged ideal remained     chapter xvi  adjusted relationships   its the homiest spot i ever sawits homier than home avowed philippa gordon looking about her with delighted eyes they were all assembled at twilight in the big livingroom at pattys placeanne and priscilla phil and stella aunt jamesina rusty joseph the sarahcat and gog and magog the firelight shadows were dancing over the walls the cats were purring and a huge bowl of hothouse chrysanthemums sent to phil by one of the victims shone through the golden gloom like creamy moons  it was three weeks since they had considered themselves settled and already all believed the experiment would be a success the first fortnight after their return had been a pleasantly exciting one they had been busy setting up their household goods organizing their little establishment and adjusting different opinions  anne was not oversorry to leave avonlea when the time came to return to college the last few days of her vacation had not been pleasant her prize story had been published in the island papers and mr william blair had upon the counter of his store a huge pile of pink green and yellow pamphlets containing it one of which he gave to every customer he sent a complimentary bundle to anne who promptly dropped them all in the kitchen stove her humiliation was the consequence of her own ideals only for avonlea folks thought it quite splendid that she should have won the prize her many friends regarded her with honest admiration her few foes with scornful envy josie pye said she believed anne shirley had just copied the story she was sure she remembered reading it in a paper years before the sloanes who had found out or guessed that charlie had been turned down said they didnt think it was much to be proud of almost any one could have done it if she tried aunt atossa told anne she was very sorry to hear she had taken to writing novels nobody born and bred in avonlea would do it that was what came of adopting orphans from goodness knew where with goodness knew what kind of parents even mrs rachel lynde was darkly dubious about the propriety of writing fiction though she was almost reconciled to it by that twentyfive dollar check  it is perfectly amazing the price they pay for such lies thats what she said halfproudly halfseverely  all things considered it was a relief when goingaway time came and it was very jolly to be back at redmond a wise experienced soph with hosts of friends to greet on the merry opening day pris and stella and gilbert were there charlie sloane looking more important than ever a sophomore looked before phil with the alecandalonzo question still unsettled and moody spurgeon macpherson moody spurgeon had been teaching school ever since leaving queens but his mother had concluded it was high time he gave it up and turned his attention to learning how to be a minister poor moody spurgeon fell on hard luck at the very beginning of his college career half a dozen ruthless sophs who were among his fellowboarders swooped down upon him one night and shaved half of his head in this guise the luckless moody spurgeon had to go about until his hair grew again he told anne bitterly that there were times when he had his doubts as to whether he was really called to be a minister  aunt jamesina did not come until the girls had pattys place ready for her miss patty had sent the key to anne with a letter in which she said gog and magog were packed in a box under the spareroom bed but might be taken out when wanted in a postscript she added that she hoped the girls would be careful about putting up pictures the living room had been newly papered five years before and she and miss maria did not want any more holes made in that new paper than was absolutely necessary for the rest she trusted everything to anne  how those girls enjoyed putting their nest in order as phil said it was almost as good as getting married you had the fun of homemaking without the bother of a husband all brought something with them to adorn or make comfortable the little house pris and phil and stella had knickknacks and pictures galore which latter they proceeded to hang according to taste in reckless disregard of miss pattys new paper  well putty the holes up when we leave dearshell never know they said to protesting anne  diana had given anne a pine needle cushion and miss ada had given both her and priscilla a fearfully and wonderfully embroidered one marilla had sent a big box of preserves and darkly hinted at a hamper for thanksgiving and mrs lynde gave anne a patchwork quilt and loaned her five more  you take them she said authoritatively they might as well be in use as packed away in that trunk in the garret for moths to gnaw  no moths would ever have ventured near those quilts for they reeked of mothballs to such an extent that they had to be hung in the orchard of pattys place a full fortnight before they could be endured indoors verily aristocratic spofford avenue had rarely beheld such a display the gruff old millionaire who lived next door came over and wanted to buy the gorgeous red and yellow tulippattern one which mrs rachel had given anne he said his mother used to make quilts like that and by jove he wanted one to remind him of her anne would not sell it much to his disappointment but she wrote all about it to mrs lynde that highlygratified lady sent word back that she had one just like it to spare so the tobacco king got his quilt after all and insisted on having it spread on his bed to the disgust of his fashionable wife  mrs lyndes quilts served a very useful purpose that winter pattys place for all its many virtues had its faults also it was really a rather cold house and when the frosty nights came the girls were very glad to snuggle down under mrs lyndes quilts and hoped that the loan of them might be accounted unto her for righteousness anne had the blue room she had coveted at sight priscilla and stella had the large one phil was blissfully content with the little one over the kitchen and aunt jamesina was to have the downstairs one off the livingroom rusty at first slept on the doorstep  anne walking home from redmond a few days after her return became aware that the people that she met surveyed her with a covert indulgent smile anne wondered uneasily what was the matter with her was her hat crooked was her belt loose craning her head to investigate anne for the first time saw rusty  trotting along behind her close to her heels was quite the most forlorn specimen of the cat tribe she had ever beheld the animal was well past kittenhood lank thin disreputable looking pieces of both ears were lacking one eye was temporarily out of repair and one jowl ludicrously swollen as for color if a once black cat had been well and thoroughly singed the result would have resembled the hue of this waifs thin draggled unsightly fur  anne shooed but the cat would not shoo as long as she stood he sat back on his haunches and gazed at her reproachfully out of his one good eye when she resumed her walk he followed anne resigned herself to his company until she reached the gate of pattys place which she coldly shut in his face fondly supposing she had seen the last of him but when fifteen minutes later phil opened the door there sat the rustybrown cat on the step more he promptly darted in and sprang upon annes lap with a halfpleading halftriumphant miaow  anne said stella severely do you own that animal  no i do not protested disgusted anne the creature followed me home from somewhere i couldnt get rid of him ugh get down i like decent cats reasonably well but i dont like beasties of your complexion  pussy however refused to get down he coolly curled up in annes lap and began to purr  he has evidently adopted you laughed priscilla  i wont be adopted said anne stubbornly  the poor creature is starving said phil pityingly why his bones are almost coming through his skin  well ill give him a square meal and then he must return to whence he came said anne resolutely  the cat was fed and put out in the morning he was still on the doorstep on the doorstep he continued to sit bolting in whenever the door was opened no coolness of welcome had the least effect on him of nobody save anne did he take the least notice out of compassion the girls fed him but when a week had passed they decided that something must be done the cats appearance had improved his eye and cheek had resumed their normal appearance he was not quite so thin and he had been seen washing his face  but for all that we cant keep him said stella aunt jimsie is coming next week and she will bring the sarahcat with her we cant keep two cats and if we did this rusty coat would fight all the time with the sarahcat hes a fighter by nature he had a pitched battle last evening with the tobaccokings cat and routed him horse foot and artillery  we must get rid of him agreed anne looking darkly at the subject of their discussion who was purring on the hearth rug with an air of lamblike meekness but the question ishow how can four unprotected females get rid of a cat who wont be got rid of  we must chloroform him said phil briskly that is the most humane way  who of us knows anything about chloroforming a cat demanded anne gloomily  i do honey its one of my fewsadly fewuseful accomplishments ive disposed of several at home you take the cat in the morning and give him a good breakfast then you take an old burlap bagtheres one in the back porchput the cat on it and turn over him a wooden box then take a twoounce bottle of chloroform uncork it and slip it under the edge of the box put a heavy weight on top of the box and leave it till evening the cat will be dead curled up peacefully as if he were asleep no painno struggle  it sounds easy said anne dubiously  it is easy just leave it to me ill see to it said phil reassuringly  accordingly the chloroform was procured and the next morning rusty was lured to his doom he ate his breakfast licked his chops and climbed into annes lap annes heart misgave her this poor creature loved hertrusted her how could she be a party to this destruction  here take him she said hastily to phil i feel like a murderess  he wont suffer you know comforted phil but anne had fled  the fatal deed was done in the back porch nobody went near it that day but at dusk phil declared that rusty must be buried  pris and stella must dig his grave in the orchard declared phil and anne must come with me to lift the box off thats the part i always hate  the two conspirators tiptoed reluctantly to the back porch phil gingerly lifted the stone she had put on the box suddenly faint but distinct sounded an unmistakable mew under the box  hehe isnt dead gasped anne sitting blankly down on the kitchen doorstep  he must be said phil incredulously  another tiny mew proved that he wasnt the two girls stared at each other  what will we do questioned anne  why in the world dont you come demanded stella appearing in the doorway weve got the grave ready what silent still and silent all she quoted teasingly  oh no the voices of the dead sound like the distant torrents fall promptly counterquoted anne pointing solemnly to the box  a burst of laughter broke the tension  we must leave him here till morning said phil replacing the stone he hasnt mewed for five minutes perhaps the mews we heard were his dying groan or perhaps we merely imagined them under the strain of our guilty consciences  but when the box was lifted in the morning rusty bounded at one gay leap to annes shoulder where he began to lick her face affectionately never was there a cat more decidedly alive  heres a knot hole in the box groaned phil i never saw it thats why he didnt die now weve got to do it all over again  no we havent declared anne suddenly rusty isnt going to be killed again hes my catand youve just got to make the best of it  oh well if youll settle with aunt jimsie and the sarahcat said stella with the air of one washing her hands of the whole affair  from that time rusty was one of the family he slept onights on the scrubbing cushion in the back porch and lived on the fat of the land by the time aunt jamesina came he was plump and glossy and tolerably respectable but like kiplings cat he walked by himself his paw was against every cat and every cats paw against him one by one he vanquished the aristocratic felines of spofford avenue as for human beings he loved anne and anne alone nobody else even dared stroke him an angry spit and something that sounded much like very improper language greeted any one who did  the airs that cat puts on are perfectly intolerable declared stella  him was a nice old pussens him was vowed anne cuddling her pet defiantly  well i dont know how he and the sarahcat will ever make out to live together said stella pesimistically catfights in the orchard onights are bad enough but catfights here in the livingroom are unthinkable in due time aunt jamesina arrived anne and priscilla and phil had awaited her advent rather dubiously but when aunt jamesina was enthroned in the rocking chair before the open fire they figuratively bowed down and worshipped her  aunt jamesina was a tiny old woman with a little softlytriangular face and large soft blue eyes that were alight with unquenchable youth and as full of hopes as a girls she had pink cheeks and snowwhite hair which she wore in quaint little puffs over her ears  its a very oldfashioned way she said knitting industriously at something as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud but i am oldfashioned my clothes are and it stands to reason my opinions are too i dont say theyre any the better of that mind you in fact i daresay theyre a good deal the worse but theyve worn nice and easy new shoes are smarter than old ones but the old ones are more comfortable im old enough to indulge myself in the matter of shoes and opinions i mean to take it real easy here i know you expect me to look after you and keep you proper but im not going to do it youre old enough to know how to behave if youre ever going to be so as far as i am concerned concluded aunt jamesina with a twinkle in her young eyes you can all go to destruction in your own way  oh will somebody separate those cats pleaded stella shudderingly  aunt jamesina had brought with her not only the sarahcat but joseph joseph she explained had belonged to a dear friend of hers who had gone to live in vancouver  she couldnt take joseph with her so she begged me to take him i really couldnt refuse hes a beautiful catthat is his disposition is beautiful she called him joseph because his coat is of many colors  it certainly was joseph as the disgusted stella said looked like a walking ragbag it was impossible to say what his ground color was his legs were white with black spots on them his back was gray with a huge patch of yellow on one side and a black patch on the other his tail was yellow with a gray tip one ear was black and one yellow a black patch over one eye gave him a fearfully rakish look in reality he was meek and inoffensive of a sociable disposition in one respect if in no other joseph was like a lily of the field he toiled not neither did he spin or catch mice yet solomon in all his glory slept not on softer cushions or feasted more fully on fat things  joseph and the sarahcat arrived by express in separate boxes after they had been released and fed joseph selected the cushion and corner which appealed to him and the sarahcat gravely sat herself down before the fire and proceeded to wash her face she was a large sleek grayandwhite cat with an enormous dignity which was not at all impaired by any consciousness of her plebian origin she had been given to aunt jamesina by her washerwoman  her name was sarah so my husband always called puss the sarahcat explained aunt jamesina she is eight years old and a remarkable mouser dont worry stella the sarahcat never fights and joseph rarely  theyll have to fight here in selfdefense said stella  at this juncture rusty arrived on the scene he bounded joyously half way across the room before he saw the intruders then he stopped short his tail expanded until it was as big as three tails the fur on his back rose up in a defiant arch rusty lowered his head uttered a fearful shriek of hatred and defiance and launched himself at the sarahcat  the stately animal had stopped washing her face and was looking at him curiously she met his onslaught with one contemptuous sweep of her capable paw rusty went rolling helplessly over on the rug he picked himself up dazedly what sort of a cat was this who had boxed his ears he looked dubiously at the sarahcat would he or would he not the sarahcat deliberately turned her back on him and resumed her toilet operations rusty decided that he would not he never did from that time on the sarahcat ruled the roost rusty never again interfered with her  but joseph rashly sat up and yawned rusty burning to avenge his disgrace swooped down upon him joseph pacific by nature could fight upon occasion and fight well the result was a series of drawn battles every day rusty and joseph fought at sight anne took rustys part and detested joseph stella was in despair but aunt jamesina only laughed  let them fight it out she said tolerantly theyll make friends after a bit joseph needs some exercisehe was getting too fat and rusty has to learn he isnt the only cat in the world  eventually joseph and rusty accepted the situation and from sworn enemies became sworn friends they slept on the same cushion with their paws about each other and gravely washed each others faces  weve all got used to each other said phil and ive learned how to wash dishes and sweep a floor  but you neednt try to make us believe you can chloroform a cat laughed anne  it was all the fault of the knothole protested phil  it was a good thing the knothole was there said aunt jamesina rather severely kittens have to be drowned i admit or the world would be overrun but no decent grownup cat should be done to deathunless he sucks eggs  you wouldnt have thought rusty very decent if youd seen him when he came here said stella he positively looked like the old nick  i dont believe old nick can be so very ugly said aunt jamesina reflectively he wouldnt do so much harm if he was i always think of him as a rather handsome gentleman     chapter xvii  a letter from davy   its beginning to snow girls said phil coming in one november evening and there are the loveliest little stars and crosses all over the garden walk i never noticed before what exquisite things snowflakes really are one has time to notice things like that in the simple life bless you all for permitting me to live it its really delightful to feel worried because butter has gone up five cents a pound  has it demanded stella who kept the household accounts  it hasand heres your butter im getting quite expert at marketing its better fun than flirting concluded phil gravely  everything is going up scandalously sighed stella  never mind thank goodness air and salvation are still free said aunt jamesina  and so is laughter added anne theres no tax on it yet and that is well because youre all going to laugh presently im going to read you davys letter his spelling has improved immensely this past year though he is not strong on apostrophes and he certainly possesses the gift of writing an interesting letter listen and laugh before we settle down to the evenings studygrind  dear anne ran davys letter i take my pen to tell you that we are all pretty well and hope this will find you the same its snowing some today and marilla says the old woman in the sky is shaking her feather beds is the old woman in the sky gods wife anne i want to know  mrs lynde has been real sick but she is better now she fell down the cellar stairs last week when she fell she grabbed hold of the shelf with all the milk pails and stewpans on it and it gave way and went down with her and made a splendid crash marilla thought it was an earthquake at first  one of the stewpans was all dinged up and mrs lynde straned her ribs the doctor came and gave her medicine to rub on her ribs but she didnt under

okward mr harrison says he is left handed in both his feet mr barrys hired man is lazy mrs barry says that but mr barry says he aint lazy exactly only he thinks it easier to pray for things than to

the doctor gave him medicine and it tasted horrid i offered to take it for him for a quarter but the boulters are so mean milty says hed rather take it himself and save his money i asked mrs boulter

ministers do what boys cant i want to know  i havent any more news here are six kisses xxxxxx dora sends one heres hers x  your loving friend david keith   ps anne who was the devils father i want to know     chapter xviii  miss josepine remembers the annegirl   when christmas holidays came the girls of pattys place scattered to their respective homes but aunt jamesina elected to stay where she was  i couldnt go to any of the places ive been invited and take those three cats she said and im not going to leave the poor creatures here alone for nearly three weeks if we had any decent neighbors who would feed them i might but theres nothing except millionaires on this street so ill stay here and keep pattys place warm for you  anne went home with the usual joyous anticipationswhich were not wholly fulfilled she found avonlea in the grip of such an early cold and stormy winter as even the oldest inhabitant could not recall green gables was literally hemmed in by huge drifts almost every day of that illstarred vacation it stormed fiercely and even on fine days it drifted unceasingly no sooner were the roads broken than they filled in again it was almost impossible to stir out the avis tried on three evenings to have a party in honor of the college students and on each evening the storm was so wild that nobody could go so they gave up the attempt in despair anne despite her love of and loyalty to green gables could not help thinking longingly of pattys place its cosy open fire aunt jamesinas mirthful eyes the three cats the merry chatter of the girls the pleasantness of friday evenings when college friends dropped in to talk of grave and gay  anne was lonely diana during the whole of the holidays was imprisoned at home with a bad attack of bronchitis she could not come to green gables and it was rarely anne could get to orchard slope for the old way through the haunted wood was impassable with drifts and the long way over the frozen lake of shining waters was almost as bad ruby gillis was sleeping in the whiteheaped graveyard jane andrews was teaching a school on western prairies gilbert to be sure was still faithful and waded up to green gables every possible evening but gilberts visits were not what they once were anne almost dreaded them it was very disconcerting to look up in the midst of a sudden silence and find gilberts hazel eyes fixed upon her with a quite unmistakable expression in their grave depths and it was still more disconcerting to find herself blushing hotly and uncomfortably under his gaze just as ifjust as ifwell it was very embarrassing anne wished herself back at pattys place where there was always somebody else about to take the edge off a delicate situation at green gables marilla went promptly to mrs lyndes domain when gilbert came and insisted on taking the twins with her the significance of this was unmistakable and anne was in a helpless fury over it  davy however was perfectly happy he reveled in getting out in the morning and shoveling out the paths to the well and henhouse he gloried in the christmastide delicacies which marilla and mrs lynde vied with each other in preparing for anne and he was reading an enthralling tale in a school library book of a wonderful hero who seemed blessed with a miraculous faculty for getting into scrapes from which he was usually delivered by an earthquake or a volcanic explosion which blew him high and dry out of his troubles landed him in a fortune and closed the story with proper eclat  i tell you its a bully story anne he said ecstatically id ever so much rather read it than the bible  would you smiled anne  davy peered curiously at her  you dont seem a bit shocked anne mrs lynde was awful shocked when i said it to her  no im not shocked davy i think its quite natural that a nineyearold boy would sooner read an adventure story than the bible but when you are older i hope and think that you will realize what a wonderful book the bible is  oh i think some parts of it are fine conceded davy that story about joseph nowits bully but if id been joseph i wouldnt have forgive the brothers no siree anne id have cut all their heads off mrs lynde was awful mad when i said that and shut the bible up and said shed never read me any more of it if i talked like that so i dont talk now when she reads it sunday afternoons i just think things and say them to milty boulter next day in school i told milty the story about elisha and the bears and it scared him so hes never made fun of mr harrisons bald head once are there any bears on pe island anne i want to know  not nowadays said anne absently as the wind blew a scud of snow against the window oh dear will it ever stop storming  god knows said davy airily preparing to resume his reading  anne was shocked this time  davy she exclaimed reproachfully  mrs lynde says that protested davy one night last week marilla said will ludovic speed and theodora dix ever get married and mrs lynde said god knowsjust like that  well it wasnt right for her to say it said anne promptly deciding upon which horn of this dilemma to empale herself it isnt right for anybody to take that name in vain or speak it lightly davy dont ever do it again  not if i say it slow and solemn like the minister queried davy gravely  no not even then  well i wont ludovic speed and theodora dix live in middle grafton and mrs rachel says he has been courting her for a hundred years wont they soon be too old to get married anne i hope gilbert wont court you that long when are you going to be married anne mrs lynde says its a sure thing  mrs lynde is a began anne hotly then stopped awful old gossip completed davy calmly thats what every one calls her but is it a sure thing anne i want to know  youre a very silly little boy davy said anne stalking haughtily out of the room the kitchen was deserted and she sat down by the window in the fast falling wintry twilight the sun had set and the wind had died down a pale chilly moon looked out behind a bank of purple clouds in the west the sky faded out but the strip of yellow along the western horizon grew brighter and fiercer as if all the stray gleams of light were concentrating in one spot the distant hills rimmed with priestlike firs stood out in dark distinctness against it anne looked across the still white fields cold and lifeless in the harsh light of that grim sunset and sighed she was very lonely and she was sad at heart for she was wondering if she would be able to return to redmond next year it did not seem likely the only scholarship possible in the sophomore year was a very small affair she would not take marillas money and there seemed little prospect of being able to earn enough in the summer vacation  i suppose ill just have to drop out next year she thought drearily and teach a district school again until i earn enough to finish my course and by that time all my old class will have graduated and pattys place will be out of the question but there im not going to be a coward im thankful i can earn my way through if necessary  heres mr harrison wading up the lane announced davy running out i hope hes brought the mail its three days since we got it i want to see what them pesky grits are doing im a conservative anne and i tell you you have to keep your eye on them grits  mr harrison had brought the mail and merry letters from stella and priscilla and phil soon dissipated annes blues aunt jamesina too had written saying that she was keeping the hearthfire alight and that the cats were all well and the house plants doing fine  the weather has been real cold she wrote so i let the cats sleep in the houserusty and joseph on the sofa in the livingroom and the sarahcat on the foot of my bed its real company to hear her purring when i wake up in the night and think of my poor daughter in the foreign field if it was anywhere but in india i wouldnt worry but they say the snakes out there are terrible it takes all the sarahcatss purring to drive away the thought of those snakes i have enough faith for everything but the snakes i cant think why providence ever made them sometimes i dont think he did im inclined to believe the old harry had a hand in making them  anne had left a thin typewritten communication till the last thinking it unimportant when she had read it she sat very still with tears in her eyes  what is the matter anne asked marilla  miss josephine barry is dead said anne in a low tone  so she has gone at last said marilla well she has been sick for over a year and the barrys have been expecting to hear of her death any time it is well she is at rest for she has suffered dreadfully anne she was always kind to you  she has been kind to the last marilla this letter is from her lawyer she has left me a thousand dollars in her will  gracious aint that an awful lot of money exclaimed davy shes the woman you and diana lit on when you jumped into the spare room bed aint she diana told me that story is that why she left you so much  hush davy said anne gently she slipped away to the porch gable with a full heart leaving marilla and mrs lynde to talk over the news to their hearts content  do you spose anne will ever get married now speculated davy anxiously when dorcas sloane got married last summer she said if shed had enough money to live on shed never have been bothered with a man but even a widower with eight children was bettern living with a sisterinlaw  davy keith do hold your tongue said mrs rachel severely the way you talk is scandalous for a small boy thats what     chapter xix  an interlude   to think that this is my twentieth birthday and that ive left my teens behind me forever said anne who was curled up on the hearthrug with rusty in her lap to aunt jamesina who was reading in her pet chair they were alone in the living room stella and priscilla had gone to a committee meeting and phil was upstairs adorning herself for a party  i suppose you feel kind of sorry said aunt jamesina the teens are such a nice part of life im glad ive never gone out of them myself  anne laughed  you never will aunty youll be eighteen when you should be a hundred yes im sorry and a little dissatisfied as well miss stacy told me long ago that by the time i was twenty my character would be formed for good or evil i dont feel that its what it should be its full of flaws  sos everybodys said aunt jamesina cheerfully mines cracked in a hundred places your miss stacy likely meant that when you are twenty your character would have got its permanent bent in one direction or tother and would go on developing in that line dont worry over it anne do your duty by god and your neighbor and yourself and have a good time thats my philosophy and its always worked pretty well wheres phil off to tonight  shes going to a dance and shes got the sweetest dress for itcreamy yellow silk and cobwebby lace it just suits those brown tints of hers  theres magic in the words silk and lace isnt there said aunt jamesina the very sound of them makes me feel like skipping off to a dance and yellow silk it makes one think of a dress of sunshine i always wanted a yellow silk dress but first my mother and then my husband wouldnt hear of it the very first thing im going to do when i get to heaven is to get a yellow silk dress  amid annes peal of laughter phil came downstairs trailing clouds of glory and surveyed herself in the long oval mirror on the wall  a flattering looking glass is a promoter of amiability she said the one in my room does certainly make me green do i look pretty nice anne  do you really know how pretty you are phil asked anne in honest admiration  of course i do what are looking glasses and men for that wasnt what i meant are all my ends tucked in is my skirt straight and would this rose look better lower down im afraid its too highit will make me look lopsided but i hate things tickling my ears  everything is just right and that southwest dimple of yours is lovely  anne theres one thing in particular i like about youyoure so ungrudging there isnt a particle of envy in you  why should she be envious demanded aunt jamesina shes not quite as goodlooking as you maybe but shes got a far handsomer nose  i know it conceded phil  my nose always has been a great comfort to me confessed anne  and i love the way your hair grows on your forehead anne and that one wee curl always looking as if it were going to drop but never dropping is delicious but as for noses mine is a dreadful worry to me i know by the time im forty it will be byrney what do you think ill look like when im forty anne  like an old matronly married woman teased anne  i wont said phil sitting down comfortably to wait for her escort joseph you calico beastie dont you dare jump on my lap i wont go to a dance all over cat hairs no anne i wont look matronly but no doubt ill be married  to alec or alonzo asked anne  to one of them i suppose sighed phil if i can ever decide which  it shouldnt be hard to decide scolded aunt jamesina  i was born a seesaw aunty and nothing can ever prevent me from teetering  you ought to be more levelheaded philippa  its best to be levelheaded of course agreed philippa but you miss lots of fun as for alec and alonzo if you knew them youd understand why its difficult to choose between them theyre equally nice  then take somebody who is nicer suggested aunt jamesina theres that senior who is so devoted to youwill leslie he has such nice large mild eyes  theyre a little bit too large and too mildlike a cows said phil cruelly  what do you say about george parker  theres nothing to say about him except that he always looks as if he had just been starched and ironed  marr holworthy then you cant find a fault with him  no he would do if he wasnt poor i must marry a rich man aunt jamesina thatand good looksis an indispensable qualification id marry gilbert blythe if he were rich  oh would you said anne rather viciously  we dont like that idea a little bit although we dont want gilbert ourselves oh no mocked phil but dont lets talk of disagreeable subjects ill have to marry sometime i suppose but i shall put off the evil day as long as i can  you mustnt marry anybody you dont love phil when alls said and done said aunt jamesina       oh hearts that loved in the good old way      have been out o the fashion this many a day  trilled phil mockingly theres the carriage i flybibi you two oldfashioned darlings  when phil had gone aunt jamesina looked solemnly at anne  that girl is pretty and sweet and goodhearted but do you think she is quite right in her mind by spells anne  oh i dont think theres anything the matter with phils mind said anne hiding a smile its just her way of talking  aunt jamesina shook her head  well i hope so anne i do hope so because i love her but i cant understand hershe beats me she isnt like any of the girls i ever knew or any of the girls i was myself  how many girls were you aunt jimsie  about half a dozen my dear     chapter xx  gilbert speaks   this has been a dull prosy day yawned phil stretching herself idly on the sofa having previously dispossessed two exceedingly indignant cats  anne looked up from pickwick papers now that spring examinations were over she was treating herself to dickens  it has been a prosy day for us she said thoughtfully but to some people it has been a wonderful day some one has been rapturously happy in it perhaps a great deed has been done somewhere todayor a great poem writtenor a great man born and some heart has been broken phil  why did you spoil your pretty thought by tagging that last sentence on honey grumbled phil i dont like to think of broken heartsor anything unpleasant  do you think youll be able to shirk unpleasant things all your life phil  dear me no am i not up against them now you dont call alec and alonzo pleasant things do you when they simply plague my life out  you never take anything seriously phil  why should i there are enough folks who do the world needs people like me anne just to amuse it it would be a terrible place if everybody were intellectual and serious and in deep deadly earnest my mission is as josiah allen says to charm and allure confess now hasnt life at pattys place been really much brighter and pleasanter this past winter because ive been here to leaven you  yes it has owned anne  and you all love meeven aunt jamesina who thinks im stark mad so why should i try to be different oh dear im so sleepy i was awake until one last night reading a harrowing ghost story i read it in bed and after i had finished it do you suppose i could get out of bed to put the light out no and if stella had not fortunately come in late that lamp would have burned good and bright till morning when i heard stella i called her in explained my predicament and got her to put out the light if i had got out myself to do it i knew something would grab me by the feet when i was getting in again by the way anne has aunt jamesina decided what to do this summer  yes shes going to stay here i know shes doing it for the sake of those blessed cats although she says its too much trouble to open her own house and she hates visiting  what are you reading  pickwick  thats a book that always makes me hungry said phil theres so much good eating in it the characters seem always to be reveling on ham and eggs and milk punch i generally go on a cupboard rummage after reading pickwick the mere thought reminds me that im starving is there any tidbit in the pantry queen anne  i made a lemon pie this morning you may have a piece of it  phil dashed out to the pantry and anne betook herself to the orchard in company with rusty it was a moist pleasantlyodorous night in early spring the snow was not quite all gone from the park a little dingy bank of it yet lay under the pines of the harbor road screened from the influence of april suns it kept the harbor road muddy and chilled the evening air but grass was growing green in sheltered spots and gilbert had found some pale sweet arbutus in a hidden corner he came up from the park his hands full of it  anne was sitting on the big gray boulder in the orchard looking at the poem of a bare birchen bough hanging against the pale red sunset with the very perfection of grace she was building a castle in aira wondrous mansion whose sunlit courts and stately halls were steeped in arabys perfume and where she reigned queen and chatelaine she frowned as she saw gilbert coming through the orchard of late she had managed not to be left alone with gilbert but he had caught her fairly now and even rusty had deserted her  gilbert sat down beside her on the boulder and held out his mayflowers  dont these remind you of home and our old schoolday picnics anne  anne took them and buried her face in them  im in mr silas sloanes barrens this very minute she said rapturously  i suppose you will be there in reality in a few days  no not for a fortnight im going to visit with phil in bolingbroke before i go home youll be in avonlea before i will  no i shall not be in avonlea at all this summer anne ive been offered a job in the daily news office and im going to take it  oh said anne vaguely she wondered what a whole avonlea summer would be like without gilbert somehow she did not like the prospect well she concluded flatly it is a good thing for you of course  yes ive been hoping i would get it it will help me out next year  you mustnt work too hard said anne without any very clear idea of what she was saying she wished desperately that phil would come out youve studied very constantly this winter isnt this a delightful evening do you know i found a cluster of white violets under that old twisted tree over there today i felt as if i had discovered a gold mine  you are always discovering gold mines said gilbertalso absently  let us go and see if we can find some more suggested anne eagerly ill call phil and  never mind phil and the violets just now anne said gilbert quietly taking her hand in a clasp from which she could not free it there is something i want to say to you  oh dont say it cried anne pleadingly dontplease gilbert  i must things cant go on like this any longer anne i love you you know i do ii cant tell you how much will you promise me that some day youll be my wife  ii cant said anne miserably oh gilbertyouyouve spoiled everything  dont you care for me at all gilbert asked after a very dreadful pause during which anne had not dared to look up  notnot in that way i do care a great deal for you as a friend but i dont love you gilbert  but cant you give me some hope that you willyet  no i cant exclaimed anne desperately i never never can love youin that waygilbert you must never speak of this to me again  there was another pauseso long and so dreadful that anne was driven at last to look up gilberts face was white to the lips and his eyesbut anne shuddered and looked away there was nothing romantic about this must proposals be either grotesque orhorrible could she ever forget gilberts face  is there anybody else he asked at last in a low voice  nono said anne eagerly i dont care for any one like thatand i like you better than anybody else in the world gilbert and we mustwe must go on being friends gilbert  gilbert gave a bitter little laugh  friends your friendship cant satisfy me anne i want your loveand you tell me i can never have that  im sorry forgive me gilbert was all anne could say where oh where were all the gracious and graceful speeches wherewith in imagination she had been wont to dismiss rejected suitors  gilbert released her hand gently  there isnt anything to forgive there have been times when i thought you did care ive deceived myself thats all goodbye anne  anne got herself to her room sat down on her window seat behind the pines and cried bitterly she felt as if something incalculably precious had gone out of her life it was gilberts friendship of course oh why must she lose it after this fashion  what is the matter honey asked phil coming in through the moonlit gloom  anne did not answer at that moment she wished phil were a thousand miles away  i suppose youve gone and refused gilbert blythe you are an idiot anne shirley  do you call it idiotic to refuse to marry a man i dont love said anne coldly goaded to reply  you dont know love when you see it youve tricked something out with your imagination that you think love and you expect the real thing to look like that there thats the first sensible thing ive ever said in my life i wonder how i managed it  phil pleaded anne please go away and leave me alone for a little while my world has tumbled into pieces i want to reconstruct it  without any gilbert in it said phil going  a world without any gilbert in it anne repeated the words drearily would it not be a very lonely forlorn place well it was all gilberts fault he had spoiled their beautiful comradeship she must just learn to live without it     chapter xxi  roses of yesterday   the fortnight anne spent in bolingbroke was a very pleasant one with a little under current of vague pain and dissatisfaction running through it whenever she thought about gilbert there was not however much time to think about him mount holly the beautiful old gordon homestead was a very gay place overrun by phils friends of both sexes there was quite a bewildering succession of drives dances picnics and boating parties all expressively lumped together by phil under the head of jamborees alec and alonzo were so constantly on hand that anne wondered if they ever did anything but dance attendance on that willothewisp of a phil they were both nice manly fellows but anne would not be drawn into any opinion as to which was the nicer  and i depended so on you to help me make up my mind which of them i should promise to marry mourned phil  you must do that for yourself you are quite expert at making up your mind as to whom other people should marry retorted anne rather caustically  oh thats a very different thing said phil truly  but the sweetest incident of annes sojourn in bolingbroke was the visit to her birthplacethe little shabby yellow house in an outoftheway street she had so often dreamed about she looked at it with delighted eyes as she and phil turned in at the gate  its almost exactly as ive pictured it she said there is no honeysuckle over the windows but there is a lilac tree by the gate andyes there are the muslin curtains in the windows how glad i am it is still painted yellow  a very tall very thin woman opened the door  yes the shirleys lived here twenty years ago she said in answer to annes question they had it rented i remember em they both died of fever at onct it was turrible sad they left a baby i guess its dead long ago it was a sickly thing old thomas and his wife took itas if they hadnt enough of their own  it didnt die said anne smiling i was that baby  you dont say so why you have grown exclaimed the woman as if she were much surprised that anne was not still a baby come to look at you i see the resemblance youre complected like your pa he had red hair but you favor your ma in your eyes and mouth she was a nice little thing my darter went to school to her and was nigh crazy about her they was buried in the one grave and the school board put up a tombstone to them as a reward for faithful service will you come in  will you let me go all over the house asked anne eagerly  laws yes you can if you like twont take you longthere aint much of it i keep at my man to build a new kitchen but he aint one of your hustlers the parlors in there and theres two rooms upstairs just prowl about yourselves ive got to see to the baby the east room was the one you were born in i remember your ma saying she loved to see the sunrise and i mind hearing that you was born just as the sun was rising and its light on your face was the first thing your ma saw  anne went up the narrow stairs and into that little east room with a full heart it was as a shrine to her here her mother had dreamed the exquisite happy dreams of anticipated motherhood here that red sunrise light had fallen over them both in the sacred hour of birth here her mother had died anne looked about her reverently her eyes with tears it was for her one of the jeweled hours of life that gleam out radiantly forever in memory  just to think of itmother was younger than i am now when i was born she whispered  when anne went downstairs the lady of the house met her in the hall she held out a dusty little packet tied with faded blue ribbon  heres a bundle of old letters i found in that closet upstairs when i came here she said i dunno what they arei never bothered to look in em but the address on the top one is miss bertha willis and that was your mas maiden name you can take em if youd keer to have em  oh thank youthank you cried anne clasping the packet rapturously  that was all that was in the house said her hostess the furniture was all sold to pay the doctor bills and mrs thomas got your mas clothes and little things i reckon they didnt last long among that drove of thomas youngsters they was destructive young animals as i mind em  i havent one thing that belonged to my mother said anne chokily ii can never thank you enough for these letters  youre quite welcome laws but your eyes is like your mas she could just about talk with hers your father was sorter homely but awful nice i mind hearing folks say when they was married that there never was two people more in love with each otherpore creatures they didnt live much longer but they was awful happy while they was alive and i spose that counts for a good deal  anne longed to get home to read her precious letters but she made one little pilgrimage first she went alone to the green corner of the old bolingbroke cemetery where her father and mother were buried and left on their grave the white flowers she carried then she hastened back to mount holly shut herself up in her room and read the letters some were written by her father some by her mother there were not manyonly a dozen in allfor walter and bertha shirley had not been often separated during their courtship the letters were yellow and faded and dim blurred with the touch of passing years no profound words of wisdom were traced on the stained and wrinkled pages but only lines of love and trust the sweetness of forgotten things clung to themthe faroff fond imaginings of those longdead lovers bertha shirley had possessed the gift of writing letters which embodied the charming personality of the writer in words and thoughts that retained their beauty and fragrance after the lapse of time the letters were tender intimate sacred to anne the sweetest of all was the one written after her birth to the father on a brief absence it was full of a proud young mothers accounts of babyher cleverness her brightness her thousand sweetnesses  i love her best when she is asleep and better still when she is awake bertha shirley had written in the postscript probably it was the last sentence she had ever penned the end was very near for her  this has been the most beautiful day of my life anne said to phil that night ive found my father and mother those letters have made them real to me im not an orphan any longer i feel as if i had opened a book and found roses of yesterday sweet and beloved between its leaves     chapter xxii  spring and anne return to green gables   the firelight shadows were dancing over the kitchen walls at green gables for the spring evening was chilly through the open east window drifted in the subtly sweet voices of the night marilla was sitting by the fireat least in body in spirit she was roaming olden ways with feet grown young of late marilla had thus spent many an hour when she thought she should have been knitting for the twins  i suppose im growing old she said  yet marilla had changed but little in the past nine years save to grow something thinner and even more angular there was a little more gray in the hair that was still twisted up in the same hard knot with two hairpinswere they the same hairpinsstill stuck through it but her expression was very different the something about the mouth which had hinted at a sense of humor had developed wonderfully her eyes were gentler and milder her smile more frequent and tender  marilla was thinking of her whole past life her cramped but not unhappy childhood the jealously hidden dreams and the blighted hopes of her girlhood the long gray narrow monotonous years of dull middle life that followed and the coming of annethe vivid imaginative impetuous child with her heart of love and her world of fancy bringing with her color and warmth and radiance until the wilderness of existence had blossomed like the rose marilla felt that out of her sixty years she had lived only the nine that had followed the advent of anne and anne would be home tomorrow night  the kitchen door opened marilla looked up expecting to see mrs lynde anne stood before her tall and starryeyed with her hands full of mayflowers and violets  anne shirley exclaimed marilla for once in her life she was surprised out of her reserve she caught her girl in her arms and crushed her and her flowers against her heart kissing the bright hair and sweet face warmly i never looked for you till tomorrow night how did you get from carmody  walked dearest of marillas havent i done it a score of times in the queens days the mailman is to bring my trunk tomorrow i just got homesick all at once and came a day earlier and oh ive had such a lovely walk in the may twilight i stopped by the barrens and picked these mayflowers i came through violetvale its just a big bowlful of violets nowthe dear skytinted things smell them marilladrink them in  marilla sniffed obligingly but she was more interested in anne than in drinking violets  sit down child you must be real tired im going to get you some supper  theres a darling moonrise behind the hills tonight marilla and oh how the frogs sang me home from carmody i do love the music of the frogs it seems bound up with all my happiest recollections of old spring evenings and it always reminds me of the night i came here first do you remember it marilla  well yes said marilla with emphasis im not likely to forget it ever  they used to sing so madly in the marsh and brook that year i would listen to them at my window in the dusk and wonder how they could seem so glad and so sad at the same time oh but its good to be home again redmond was splendid and bolingbroke delightfulbut green gables is home  gilbert isnt coming home this summer i hear said marilla  no something in annes tone made marilla glance at her sharply but anne was apparently absorbed in arranging her violets in a bowl see arent they sweet she went on hurriedly the year is a book isnt it marilla springs pages are written in mayflowers and violets summers in roses autumns in red maple leaves and winter in holly and evergreen  did gilbert do well in his examinations persisted marilla  excellently well he led his class but where are the twins and mrs lynde  rachel and dora are over at mr harrisons davy is down at boulters i think i hear him coming now  davy burst in saw anne stopped and then hurled himself upon her with a joyful yell  oh anne aint i glad to see you say anne ive grown two inches since last fall mrs lynde measured me with her tape today and say anne see my front tooth its gone mrs lynde tied one end of a string to it and the other end to the door and then shut the door i sold it to milty for two cents miltys collecting teeth  what in the world does he want teeth for asked marilla  to make a necklace for playing indian chief explained davy climbing upon annes lap hes got fifteen already and everybodys elses promised so theres no use in

consequences of being bad davy dont you remember the sunday last summer when you ran away from sunday school you told me then that being bad wasnt worth while what were you and milty doing today  oh we fished and chased the cat and hunted for eggs and yelled at the echo theres a great echo in the bush behind the boulter barn say what is echo anne i want to know  echo is a beautiful nymph davy living far away in the woods and laughing at the world from among the hills  what does she look like  her hair and eyes are dark but her neck and arms are white as snow no mortal can ever see how fair she is she is fleeter than a deer and that mocking voice of hers is all we can know of her you can hear her calling at night you can hear her laughing under the stars but you can never see her she flies afar if you follow her and laughs at you always just over the next hill  is that true anne or is it a whopper demanded davy staring  davy said anne despairingly havent you sense enough to distinguish between a fairytale and a falsehood  then what is it that sasses back from the boulter bush i want to know insisted davy  when you are a little older davy ill explain it all to you  the mention of age evidently gave a new turn to davys thoughts for after a few moments of reflection he whispered solemnly  anne im going to be married  when asked anne with equal solemnity  oh not until im grownup of course  well thats a relief davy who is the lady  stella fletcher shes in my class at school and say anne shes the prettiest girl you ever saw if i die before i grow up youll keep an eye on her wont you  davy keith do stop talking such nonsense said marilla severely  tisnt nonsense protested davy in an injured tone shes my promised wife and if i was to die shed be my promised widow wouldnt she and she hasnt got a soul to look after her except her old grandmother  come and have your supper anne said marilla and dont encourage that child in his absurd talk     chapter xxiii  paul cannot find the rock people   life was very pleasant in avonlea that summer although anne amid all her vacation joys was haunted by a sense of something gone which should be there she would not admit even in her inmost reflections that this was caused by gilberts absence but when she had to walk home alone from prayer meetings and avis powwows while diana and fred and many other gay couples loitered along the dusky starlit country roads there was a queer lonely ache in her heart which she could not explain away gilbert did not even write to her as she thought he might have done she knew he wrote to diana occasionally but she would not inquire about him and diana supposing that anne heard from him volunteered no information gilberts mother who was a gay frank lighthearted lady but not overburdened with tact had a very embarrassing habit of asking anne always in a painfully distinct voice and always in the presence of a crowd if she had heard from gilbert lately poor anne could only blush horribly and murmur not very lately which was taken by all mrs blythe included to be merely a maidenly evasion  apart from this anne enjoyed her summer priscilla came for a merry visit in june and when she had gone mr and mrs irving paul and charlotta the fourth came home for july and august  echo lodge was the scene of gaieties once more and the echoes over the river were kept busy mimicking the laughter that rang in the old garden behind the spruces  miss lavendar had not changed except to grow even sweeter and prettier paul adored her and the companionship between them was beautiful to see  but i dont call her mother just by itself he explained to anne you see that name belongs just to my own little mother and i cant give it to any one else you know teacher but i call her mother lavendar and i love her next best to father ii even love her a little better than you teacher  which is just as it ought to be answered anne  paul was thirteen now and very tall for his years his face and eyes were as beautiful as ever and his fancy was still like a prism separating everything that fell upon it into rainbows he and anne had delightful rambles to wood and field and shore never were there two more thoroughly kindred spirits  charlotta the fourth had blossomed out into young ladyhood she wore her hair now in an enormous pompador and had discarded the blue ribbon bows of auld lang syne but her face was as freckled her nose as snubbed and her mouth and smiles as wide as ever  you dont think i talk with a yankee accent do you miss shirley maam she demanded anxiously  i dont notice it charlotta  im real glad of that they said i did at home but i thought likely they just wanted to aggravate me i dont want no yankee accent not that ive a word to say against the yankees miss shirley maam theyre real civilized but give me old pe island every time  paul spent his first fortnight with his grandmother irving in avonlea anne was there to meet him when he came and found him wild with eagerness to get to the shorenora and the golden lady and the twin sailors would be there he could hardly wait to eat his supper could he not see noras elfin face peering around the point watching for him wistfully but it was a very sober paul who came back from the shore in the twilight  didnt you find your rock people asked anne  paul shook his chestnut curls sorrowfully  the twin sailors and the golden lady never came at all he said nora was therebut nora is not the same teacher she is changed  oh paul it is you who are changed said anne you have grown too old for the rock people they like only children for playfellows i am afraid the twin sailors will never again come to you in the pearly enchanted boat with the sail of moonshine and the golden lady will play no more for you on her golden harp even nora will not meet you much longer you must pay the penalty of growingup paul you must leave fairyland behind you  you two talk as much foolishness as ever you did said old mrs irving halfindulgently halfreprovingly  oh no we dont said anne shaking her head gravely we are getting very very wise and it is such a pity we are never half so interesting when we have learned that language is given us to enable us to conceal our thoughts  but it isntit is given us to exchange our thoughts said mrs irving seriously she had never heard of tallyrand and did not understand epigrams  anne spent a fortnight of halcyon days at echo lodge in the golden prime of august while there she incidentally contrived to hurry ludovic speed in his leisurely courting of theodora dix as related duly in another chronicle of her history1 arnold sherman an elderly friend of the irvings was there at the same time and added not a little to the general pleasantness of life       1 chronicles of avonlea  what a nice playtime this has been said anne i feel like a giant refreshed and its only a fortnight more till i go back to kingsport and redmond and pattys place pattys place is the dearest spot miss lavendar i feel as if i had two homesone at green gables and one at pattys place but where has the summer gone it doesnt seem a day since i came home that spring evening with the mayflowers when i was little i couldnt see from one end of the summer to the other it stretched before me like an unending season now tis a handbreadth tis a tale  anne are you and gilbert blythe as good friends as you used to be asked miss lavendar quietly  i am just as much gilberts friend as ever i was miss lavendar  miss lavendar shook her head  i see somethings gone wrong anne im going to be impertinent and ask what have you quarrelled  no its only that gilbert wants more than friendship and i cant give him more  are you sure of that anne  perfectly sure  im very very sorry  i wonder why everybody seems to think i ought to marry gilbert blythe said anne petulantly  because you were made and meant for each other annethat is why you neednt toss that young head of yours its a fact     chapter xxiv  enter jonas   prospect point august 20th  dear annespelledwithane wrote phil i must prop my eyelids open long enough to write you ive neglected you shamefully this summer honey but all my other correspondents have been neglected too i have a huge pile of letters to answer so i must gird up the loins of my mind and hoe in excuse my mixed metaphors im fearfully sleepy last night cousin emily and i were calling at a neighbors there were several other callers there and as soon as those unfortunate creatures left our hostess and her three daughters picked them all to pieces i knew they would begin on cousin emily and me as soon as the door shut behind us when we came home mrs lilly informed us that the aforesaid neighbors hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever you can always trust mrs lilly to tell you cheerful things like that i have a horror of scarlet fever i couldnt sleep when i went to bed for thinking of it i tossed and tumbled about dreaming fearful dreams when i did snooze for a minute and at three i wakened up with a high fever a sore throat and a raging headache i knew i had scarlet fever i got up in a panic and hunted up cousin emilys doctor book to read up the symptoms anne i had them all so i went back to bed and knowing the worst slept like a top the rest of the night though why a top should sleep sounder than anything else i never could understand but this morning i was quite well so it couldnt have been the fever i suppose if i did catch it last night it couldnt have developed so soon i can remember that in daytime but at three oclock at night i never can be logical  i suppose you wonder what im doing at prospect point well i always like to spend a month of summer at the shore and father insists that i come to his secondcousin emilys select boardinghouse at prospect point so a fortnight ago i came as usual and as usual old uncle mark miller brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his generous purpose horse he is a nice old man and gave me a handful of pink peppermints peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candyi suppose because when i was a little girl grandmother gordon always gave them to me in church once i asked referring to the smell of peppermints is that the odor of sanctity i didnt like to eat uncle marks peppermints because he just fished them loose out of his pocket and had to pick some rusty nails and other things from among them before he gave them to me but i wouldnt hurt his dear old feelings for anything so i carefully sowed them along the road at intervals when the last one was gone uncle mark said a little rebukingly ye shouldnt aet all them candies to onct miss phil youll likely have the stummickache  cousin emily has only five boarders besides myselffour old ladies and one young man my righthand neighbor is mrs lilly she is one of those people who seem to take a gruesome pleasure in detailing all their many aches and pains and sicknesses you cannot mention any ailment but she says shaking her head ah i know too well what that isand then you get all the details jonas declares he once spoke of locomotor ataxia in hearing and she said she knew too well what that was she suffered from it for ten years and was finally cured by a traveling doctor  who is jonas just wait anne shirley youll hear all about jonas in the proper time and place he is not to be mixed up with estimable old ladies  my lefthand neighbor at the table is mrs phinney she always speaks with a wailing dolorous voiceyou are nervously expecting her to burst into tears every moment she gives you the impression that life to her is indeed a vale of tears and that a smile never to speak of a laugh is a frivolity truly reprehensible she has a worse opinion of me than aunt jamesina and she doesnt love me hard to atone for it as aunty j does either  miss maria grimsby sits caticorner from me the first day i came i remarked to miss maria that it looked a little like rainand miss maria laughed i said the road from the station was very prettyand miss maria laughed i said there seemed to be a few mosquitoes left yetand miss maria laughed i said that prospect point was as beautiful as everand miss maria laughed if i were to say to miss maria my father has hanged himself my mother has taken poison my brother is in the penitentiary and i am in the last stages of consumption miss maria would laugh she cant help itshe was born so but is very sad and awful  the fifth old lady is mrs grant she is a sweet old thing but she never says anything but good of anybody and so she is a very uninteresting conversationalist  and now for jonas anne  that first day i came i saw a young man sitting opposite me at the table smiling at me as if he had known me from my cradle i knew for uncle mark had told me that his name was jonas blake that he was a theological student from st columbia and that he had taken charge of the point prospect mission church for the summer  he is a very ugly young manreally the ugliest young man ive ever seen he has a big loosejointed figure with absurdly long legs his hair is towcolor and lank his eyes are green and his mouth is big and his earsbut i never think about his ears if i can help it  he has a lovely voiceif you shut your eyes he is adorableand he certainly has a beautiful soul and disposition  we were good chums right way of course he is a graduate of redmond and that is a link between us we fished and boated together and we walked on the sands by moonlight he didnt look so homely by moonlight and oh he was nice niceness fairly exhaled from him the old ladiesexcept mrs grantdont approve of jonas because he laughs and jokesand because he evidently likes the society of frivolous me better than theirs  somehow anne i dont want him to think me frivolous this is ridiculous why should i care what a towhaired person called jonas whom i never saw before thinks of me  last sunday jonas preached in the village church i went of course but i couldnt realize that jonas was going to preach the fact that he was a ministeror going to be onepersisted in seeming a huge joke to me  well jonas preached and by the time he had preached ten minutes i felt so small and insignificant that i thought i must be invisible to the naked eye jonas never said a word about women and he never looked at me but i realized then and there what a pitiful frivolous smallsouled little butterfly i was and how horribly different i must be from jonas ideal woman she would be grand and strong and noble he was so earnest and tender and true he was everything a minister ought to be i wondered how i could ever have thought him uglybut he really iswith those inspired eyes and that intellectual brow which the roughlyfalling hair hid on week days  it was a splendid sermon and i could have listened to it forever and it made me feel utterly wretched oh i wish i was like you anne  he caught up with me on the road home and grinned as cheerfully as usual but his grin could never deceive me again i had seen the real jonas i wondered if he could ever see the real philwhom nobody not even you anne has ever seen yet  jonas i saidi forgot to call him mr blake wasnt it dreadful but there are times when things like that dont matterjonas you were born to be a minister you couldnt be anything else  no i couldnt he said soberly i tried to be something else for a long timei didnt want to be a minister but i came to see at last that it was the work given me to doand god helping me i shall try to do it  his voice was low and reverent i thought that he would do his work and do it well and nobly and happy the woman fitted by nature and training to help him do it she would be no feather blown about by every fickle wind of fancy she would always know what hat to put on probably she would have only one ministers never have much money but she wouldnt mind having one hat or none at all because she would have jonas  anne shirley dont you dare to say or hint or think that ive fallen in love with mr blake could i care for a lank poor ugly theologuenamed jonas as uncle mark says its impossible and whats more its improbable  good night phil  ps it is impossiblebut i am horribly afraid its true im happy and wretched and scared he can never care for me i know do you think i could ever develop into a passable ministers wife anne and would they expect me to lead in prayer p g     chapter xxv  enter prince charming   im contrasting the claims of indoors and out said anne looking from the window of pattys place to the distant pines of the park  ive an afternoon to spend in sweet doing nothing aunt jimsie shall i spend it here where there is a cosy fire a plateful of delicious russets three purring and harmonious cats and two impeccable china dogs with green noses or shall i go to the park where there is the lure of gray woods and of gray water lapping on the harbor rocks  if i was as young as you id decide in favor of the park said aunt jamesina tickling josephs yellow ear with a knitting needle  i thought that you claimed to be as young as any of us aunty teased anne  yes in my soul but ill admit my legs arent as young as yours you go and get some fresh air anne you look pale lately  i think ill go to the park said anne restlessly i dont feel like tame domestic joys today i want to feel alone and free and wild the park will be empty for every one will be at the football match  why didnt you go to it  nobody axed me sir she saidat least nobody but that horrid little dan ranger i wouldnt go anywhere with him but rather than hurt his poor little tender feelings i said i wasnt going to the game at all i dont mind im not in the mood for football today somehow  you go and get some fresh air repeated aunt jamesina but take your umbrella for i believe its going to rain ive rheumatism in my leg  only old people should have rheumatism aunty  anybody is liable to rheumatism in her legs anne its only old people who should have rheumatism in their souls though thank goodness i never have when you get rheumatism in your soul you might as well go and pick out your coffin  it was novemberthe month of crimson sunsets parting birds deep sad hymns of the sea passionate windsongs in the pines anne roamed through the pineland alleys in the park and as she said let that great sweeping wind blow the fogs out of her soul anne was not wont to be troubled with soul fog but somehow since her return to redmond for this third year life had not mirrored her spirit back to her with its old perfect sparkling clearness  outwardly existence at pattys place was the same pleasant round of work and study and recreation that it had always been on friday evenings the big firelighted livingroom was crowded by callers and echoed to endless jest and laughter while aunt jamesina smiled beamingly on them all the jonas of phils letter came often running up from st columbia on the early train and departing on the late he was a general favorite at pattys place though aunt jamesina shook her head and opined that divinity students were not what they used to be  hes very nice my dear she told phil but ministers ought to be graver and more dignified  cant a man laugh and laugh and be a christian still demanded phil  oh menyes but i was speaking of ministers my dear said aunt jamesina rebukingly and you shouldnt flirt so with mr blakeyou really shouldnt  im not flirting with him protested phil  nobody believed her except anne the others thought she was amusing herself as usual and told her roundly that she was behaving very badly  mr blake isnt of the alecandalonzo type phil said stella severely he takes things seriously you may break his heart  do you really think i could asked phil id love to think so  philippa gordon i never thought you were utterly unfeeling the idea of you saying youd love to break a mans heart  i didnt say so honey quote me correctly i said id like to think i could break it i would like to know i had the power to do it  i dont understand you phil you are leading that man on deliberatelyand you know you dont mean anything by it  i mean to make him ask me to marry him if i can said phil calmly  i give you up said stella hopelessly  gilbert came occasionally on friday evenings he seemed always in good spirits and held his own in the jests and repartee that flew about he neither sought nor avoided anne when circumstances brought them in contact he talked to her pleasantly and courteously as to any newlymade acquaintance the old camaraderie was gone entirely anne felt it keenly but she told herself she was very glad and thankful that gilbert had got so completely over his disappointment in regard to her she had really been afraid that april evening in the orchard that she had hurt him terribly and that the wound would be long in healing now she saw that she need not have worried men have died and the worms have eaten them but not for love gilbert evidently was in no danger of immediate dissolution he was enjoying life and he was full of ambition and zest for him there was to be no wasting in despair because a woman was fair and cold anne as she listened to the ceaseless badinage that went on between him and phil wondered if she had only imagined that look in his eyes when she had told him she could never care for him  there were not lacking those who would gladly have stepped into gilberts vacant place but anne snubbed them without fear and without reproach if the real prince charming was never to come she would have none of a substitute so she sternly told herself that gray day in the windy park  suddenly the rain of aunt jamesinas prophecy came with a swish and rush anne put up her umbrella and hurried down the slope as she turned out on the harbor road a savage gust of wind tore along it instantly her umbrella turned wrong side out anne clutched at it in despair and thenthere came a voice close to her  pardon memay i offer you the shelter of my umbrella  anne looked up tall and handsome and distinguishedlookingdark melancholy inscrutable eyesmelting musical sympathetic voiceyes the very hero of her dreams stood before her in the flesh he could not have more closely resembled her ideal if he had been made to order  thank you she said confusedly  wed better hurry over to that little pavillion on the point suggested the unknown we can wait there until this shower is over it is not likely to rain so heavily very long  the words were very commonplace but oh the tone and the smile which accompanied them anne felt her heart beating strangely  together they scurried to the pavilion and sat breathlessly down under its friendly roof anne laughingly held up her false umbrella  it is when my umbrella turns inside out that i am convinced of the total depravity of inanimate things she said gaily  the raindrops sparkled on her shining hair its loosened rings curled around her neck and forehead her cheeks were flushed her eyes big and starry her companion looked down at her admiringly she felt herself blushing under his gaze who could he be why there was a bit of the redmond white and scarlet pinned to his coat lapel yet she had thought she knew by sight at least all the redmond students except the freshmen and this courtly youth surely was no freshman  we are schoolmates i see he said smiling at annes colors that ought to be sufficient introduction my name is royal gardner and you are the miss shirley who read the tennyson paper at the philomathic the other evening arent you  yes but i cannot place you at all said anne frankly please where do you belong  i feel as if i didnt belong anywhere yet i put in my freshman and sophomore years at redmond two years ago ive been in europe ever since now ive come back to finish my arts course  this is my junior year too said anne  so we are classmates as well as collegemates i am reconciled to the loss of the years that the locust has eaten said her companion with a world of meaning in those wonderful eyes of his  the rain came steadily down for the best part of an hour but the time seemed really very short when the clouds parted and a burst of pale november sunshine fell athwart the harbor and the pines anne and her companion walked home together by the time they had reached the gate of pattys place he had asked permission to call and had received it anne went in with cheeks of flame and her heart beating to her fingertips rusty who climbed into her lap and tried to kiss her found a very absent welcome anne with her soul full of romantic thrills had no attention to spare just then for a cropeared pussy cat  that evening a parcel was left at pattys place for miss shirley it was a box containing a dozen magnificent roses phil pounced impertinently on the card that fell from it read the name and the poetical quotation written on the back  royal gardner she exclaimed why anne i didnt know you were acquainted with roy gardner  i met him in the park this afternoon in the rain explained anne hurriedly my umbrella turned inside out and he came to my rescue with his  oh phil peered curiously at anne and is that exceedingly commonplace incident any reason why he should send us longstemmed roses by the dozen with a very sentimental rhyme or why we should blush divinest rosyred when we look at his card anne thy face betrayeth thee  dont talk nonsense phil do you know mr gardner  ive met his two sisters and i know of him so does everybody worthwhile in kingsport the gardners are among the richest bluest of bluenoses roy is adorably handsome and clever two years ago his mothers health failed and he had to leave college and go abroad with herhis father is dead he must have been greatly disappointed to have to give up his class but they say he was perfectly sweet about it feefifofum anne i smell romance almost do i envy you but not quite after all roy gardner isnt jonas  you goose said anne loftily but she lay long awake that night nor did she wish for sleep her waking fancies were more alluring than any vision of dreamland had the real prince come at last recalling those glorious dark eyes which had gazed so deeply into her own anne was very strongly inclined to think he had     chapter xxvi  enter christine   the girls at pattys place were dressing for the reception which the juniors were giving for the seniors in february anne surveyed herself in the mirror of the blue room with girlish satisfaction she had a particularly pretty gown on originally it had been only a simple little slip of cream silk with a chiffon overdress but phil had insisted on taking it home with her in the christmas holidays and embroidering tiny rosebuds all over the chiffon phils fingers were deft and the result was a dress which was the envy of every redmond girl even allie boone whose frocks came from paris was wont to look with longing eyes on that rosebud concoction as anne trailed up the main staircase at redmond in it  anne was trying the effect of a white orchid in her hair roy gardner had sent her white orchids for the reception and she knew no other redmond girl would have them that nightwhen phil came in with admiring gaze  anne this is certainly your night for looking handsome nine nights out of ten i can easily outshine you the tenth you blossom out suddenly into something that eclipses me altogether how do you manage it  its the dress dear fine feathers  tisnt the last evening you flamed out into beauty you wore your old blue flannel shirtwaist that mrs lynde made you if roy hadnt already lost head and heart about you he certainly would tonight but i dont like orchids on you anne no it isnt jealousy orchids dont seem to belong to you theyre too exotictoo tropicaltoo insolent dont put them in your hair anyway  well i wont i admit im not fond of orchids myself i dont think theyre related to me roy doesnt often send themhe knows i like flowers i can live with orchids are only things you can visit with  jonas sent me some dear pink rosebuds for the eveningbuthe isnt coming himself he said he had to lead a prayermeeting in the slums i dont believe he wanted to come anne im horribly afraid jonas doesnt really care anything about me and im trying to decide whether ill pine away and die or go on and get my ba and be sensible and useful  you couldnt possibly be sensible and useful phil so youd better pine away and die said anne cruelly  heartless anne  silly phil you know quite well that jonas loves you  buthe wont tell me so and i cant make him he looks it ill admit but speaktomeonlywiththineeyes isnt a really reliable reason for embroidering doilies and hemstitching tablecloths i dont want to begin such work until im really engaged it would be tempting fate  mr blake is afraid to ask you to marry him phil he is poor and cant offer you a home such as youve always had you know that is the only reason he hasnt spoken long ago  i suppose so agreed phil dolefully wellbrightening upif he wont ask me to marry him ill ask him thats all so its bound to come right i wont worry by the way gilbert blythe is going about constantly with christine stuart did you know  anne was trying to fasten a little gold chain about her throat she suddenly found the clasp difficult to manage what was the matter with itor with her fingers  no she said carelessly who is christine stuart  ronald stuarts sister shes in kingsport this winter studying music i havent seen her but they say shes very pretty and that gilbert is quite crazy over her how angry i was when you refused gilbert anne but roy gardner was foreordained for you i can see that now you were right after all  anne did not blush as she usually did when the girls assumed that her eventual marriage to roy gardner was a settled thing all at once she felt rather dull phils chatter seemed trivial and the reception a bore she boxed poor rustys ears  get off that cushion instantly you cat you why dont you stay down where you belong  anne picked up her orchids and went downstairs where aunt jamesina was presiding over a row of coats hung before the fire to warm roy gardner was waiting for anne and teasing the sarahcat while he waited the sarahcat did not approve of him she always turned her back on him but everybody else at pattys place liked him very much aunt jamesina carried away by his unfailing and deferential courtesy and the pleading tones of his delightful voice declared he was the nicest young man she ever knew and that anne was a very fortunate girl such remarks made anne restive roys wooing had certainly been as romantic as girlish heart could desire butshe wished aunt jamesina and the girls would not take things so for granted when roy murmured a poetical compliment as he helped her on with her coat she did not blush and thrill as usual and he found her rather silent in their brief walk to redmond he thought she looked a little pale when she came out of the coeds dressing room but as they entered the reception room her color and sparkle suddenly returned to her she turned to roy with her gayest expression he smiled back at her with what phil called his deep black velvety smile yet she really did not see roy at all she was acutely conscious that gilbert was standing under the palms just across the room talking to a girl who must be christine stuart  she was very handsome in the stately style destined to become rather massive in middle life a tall girl with large darkblue eyes ivory outlines and a gloss of darkness on her smooth hair  she looks just as ive always wanted to look thought anne miserably roseleaf complexionstarry violet eyesraven hairyes she has them all its a wonder her name isnt cordelia fitzgerald into the bargain but i dont believe her figure is as good as mine and her nose certainly isnt  anne felt a little comforted by this conclusion     chapter xxvii  mutual confidences   march came in that winter like the meekest and mildest of lambs bringing days that were crisp and golden and tingling each followed by a frosty pink twilight which gradually lost itself in an elfland of moonshine  over the girls at pattys place was falling the shadow of april examinations they were studying hard even phil had settled down to text and notebooks with a doggedness not to be expected of her  im going to take the johnson scholarship in mathematics she announced calmly i could take the one in greek easily but id rather take the mathematical one because i want to prove to jonas that im really enormously clever  jonas likes you better for your big brown eyes and your crooked smile than for all the brains you carry under your curls said anne  when i was a girl it wasnt considered ladylike to know anything about mathematics said aunt jamesina but times have changed i dont know that its all for the better can you cook phil  no i never cooked anything in my life except a gingerbread and it was a failureflat in the middle and hilly round the edges you know the kind but aunty when i begin in good earnest to learn to cook dont you think the brains that enable me to win a mathematical scholarship will also enable me to learn cooking just as well  maybe said aunt jamesina cautiously i am not decrying the higher education of women my daughter is an ma she can cook too but i taught her to cook before i let a college professor teach her mathematics  in midmarch came a letter from miss patty spofford saying that she and miss maria had decided to remain abroad for another year  so you may have pattys place next winter too she wrote maria and i are going to run over egypt i want to see the sphinx once before i die  fancy those two dames running over egypt i wonder if theyll look up at the sphinx and knit laughed priscilla  im so glad we can keep pattys place for another year said stella i was afraid theyd come back and then our jolly little nest here would be broken upand we poor callow nestlings thrown out on the cruel world of boardinghouses again  im off for a tramp in the park announced phil tossing her book aside i think when i am eighty ill be glad i went for a walk in the park tonight  what do you mean asked anne  come with me and ill tell you honey  they captured in their ramble all the mysteries and magics of a march evening very still and mild it was wrapped in a great white brooding silencea silence which was yet threaded through with many little silvery sounds which you could hear if you hearkened as much with your soul as your ears the girls wandered down a long pineland aisle that seemed to lead right out into the heart of a deepred overflowing winter sunset  id go home and write a poem this blessed minute if i only knew how declared phil pausing in an open space where a rosy light was staining the green tips of the pines its all so wonderful herethis great white stillness and those dark trees that always seem to be thinking  the woods were gods first temples quoted anne softly one cant help feeling reverent and adoring in such a place i always feel so near him when i walk among the pines  anne im the happiest girl in the world confessed phil suddenly  so mr blake has asked you to marry him at last said anne calmly  yes and i sneezed three times while he was asking me wasnt that horrid but i said yes almost before he finishedi was so afraid he might change his mind and stop im besottedly happy i couldnt really believe before that jonas would ever care for frivolous me  phil youre not really frivolous said anne gravely way down underneath that frivolous exterior of yours youve got a dear loyal womanly little soul why do you hide it so  i cant help it queen anne you are rightim not frivolous at heart but theres a sort of frivolous skin over my soul and i cant take it off as mrs poyser says id have to be hatched over again and hatched different before i could change it but jonas knows the real me and loves me frivolity and all and i love him i never was so surprised in my life as i was when i found out i loved him id never thought it possible to fall in love with an ugly man fancy me coming down to one solitary beau and one named jonas but i mean to call him jo thats such a nice crisp little name i couldnt nickname alonzo  what about alec and alonzo  oh i told them at christmas that i never could marry either of them it seems so funny now to remember that i ever thought it possible that i might they felt so badly i just cried over both of themhowled but i knew there was only one man in the world i could ever marry i had made up my own mind for once and it was real easy too its very delightful to feel so sure and know its your own sureness and not somebody elses  do you suppose youll be able to keep it up  making up my mind you mean i dont know but jo has given me a splendid rule he says when im perplexed just to do what i would wish i had done when i shall be eighty anyhow jo can make up his mind quickly enough and it would be uncomfortable to have too much mind in the same house  what will your father and mother say  father wont say much he thinks everything i do right but mother will talk oh her tongue will be as byrney as her nose but in the end it will be all right  youll have to give up a good many things youve always had when you marry mr blake phil  but ill have him i wont miss the other things were to be married a year from next june jo graduates from st columbia this spring you know then hes going to take a little mission church down on patterson street in the slums fancy me in the slums but id go there or to greenlands icy mountains with him  and this is the girl who would never marry a man who wasnt rich commented anne to a young pine tree  oh dont cast up the follies of my youth to me i shall be poor as gaily as ive been rich youll see im going to learn how to cook and make over dresses ive learned how to market since ive lived at pattys place and once i taught a sunday school class for a whole summer aunt jamesina says ill ruin jos career if i marry him but i wont i know i havent much sense or sobriety but ive got what is ever so much betterthe knack of making people like me there is a man in bolingbroke who lisps and always testifies in prayermeeting he says if you cant thine like an electric thtar thine like a candlethtick ill be jos little candlestick  phil youre incorrigible well i love you so much that i cant make nice light congratulatory little speeches but im heartglad of your happiness  i know those big gray eyes of yours are brimming over with real friendship anne some day ill look the same way at you youre going to marry roy arent you anne  my dear philippa did you ever hear of the famous betty baxter who refused a man before hed axed her i am not going to emulate that celebrated lady by either refusing or accepting any one before he axes me  all redmond knows that roy is crazy about you said phil candidly and you do love him dont you anne  ii suppose so said anne reluctantly she felt that she ought to be blushing while making such a confession but she was not on the other hand she always blushed hotly when any one said anything about gilbert blythe or christine stuart in her hearing gilbert blythe and christine stuart were nothing to herabsolutely nothing but anne had given up trying to analyze the reason of her blushes as for roy of course she was in love with himmadly so how could she help it was he not her ideal who could resist those glorious dark eyes and that pleading voice were not half the redmond girls wildly envious and what a charming sonnet he had sent her with a box of violets on her birthday anne knew every word of it by heart it was very good stuff of its kind too not exactly up to the level of keats or shakespeareeven anne was not so deeply in love as to think that but it was very tolerable magazine verse and it was addressed to hernot to laura or beatrice or the maid of athens but to her anne shirley to be told in rhythmical cadences that her eyes were stars of the morningthat her cheek had the flush it stole from the sunrisethat her lips were redder than the roses of paradise was thrillingly romantic gilbert would never have dreamed of writing a sonnet to her eyebrows but then gilbert could see a joke she had once told roy a funny storyand he had not seen the point of it she recalled the chummy laugh she and gilbert had had together over it and wondered uneasily if life with a man who had no sense of humor might not be somewhat uninteresting in the long run but who could expect a melancholy inscrutable hero to see the humorous side of things it would be flatly unreasonable     chapter xxviii  a june evening   i wonder what it would be like to live in a world where it was always june said anne as she came through the spice and bloom of the twilit orchard to the front door steps where marilla and mrs rachel were sitting talking over mrs samson coates funeral which they had attended that day dora sat between them diligently studying her lessons but davy was sitting tailorfashion on the grass looking as gloomy and depressed as his single dimple would let him  youd get tired of it said marilla with a sigh  i daresay but just now i feel that it would take me a long time to get tired of it if it were all as charming as today everything loves june davyboy why this melancholy november face in blossomtime  im just sick and tired of living said the youthful pessimist  at ten years dear me how sad  im not making fun said davy with dignity im disdisdiscouragedbringing out the big word with a valiant effort  why and wherefore asked anne sitting down beside him  cause the new teacher that come when mr holmes got sick give me ten sums to do for monday itll take me all day tomorrow to do them it isnt fair to have to work saturdays milty boulter said he wouldnt do them but marilla says ive got to i dont like miss carson a bit  dont talk like that about your teacher davy keith said mrs rachel severely miss carson is a very fine girl there is no nonsense about her  that doesnt sound very attractive laughed anne i like people to have a little nonsense about them but im inclined to have a better opinion of miss carson than you have i saw her in prayermeeting last night and she has a pair of eyes that cant always look sensible now davyboy take heart of grace tomorrow will bring another day and ill help you with the sums as far as in me lies dont waste this lovely hour twixt light and dark worrying over arithmetic  well i wont said davy brightening up if you help me with the sums ill have em done in time to go fishing with milty i wish old aunt atossas funeral was tomorrow instead of today i wanted to go to it cause milty said his mother said aunt atossa would be sure to rise up in her coffin and say sarcastic things to the folks that come to see her buried but marilla said she didnt  poor atossa laid in her coffin peaceful enough said mrs lynde solemnly i never saw her look so pleasant before thats what well there werent many tears shed over her poor old soul the elisha wrights are thankful to be rid of her and i cant say i blame them a mite  it seems to me a most dreadful thing to go out of the world and not leave one person behind you who is sorry you are gone said anne shuddering  nobody except her parents ever loved poor atossa thats certain not even her husband averred mrs lynde she was his fourth wife hed sort of got into the habit of marrying he only lived a few years after he married her the doctor said he died of dyspepsia but i shall always maintain that he died of atossas tongue thats what poor soul she always knew everything about her neighbors but she never was very well acquainted with herself well shes gone anyhow and i suppose the next excitement will be dianas wedding  it seems funny and horrible to think of dianas being married sighed anne hugging her knees and looking through the gap in the haunted wood to the light that was shining in dianas room  i dont see whats horrible about it when shes doing so well said mrs lynde emphatically fred wright has a fine farm and he is a model young man  he certainly isnt the wild dashing wicked young man diana once wanted to marry smiled anne fred is extremely good  thats just what he ought to be would you want diana to marry a wicked man or marry one yourself  oh no i wouldnt want to marry anybody who was wicked but i think id like it if he could be wicked and wouldnt now fred is hopelessly good  youll have more sense some day i hope said marilla  marilla spoke rather bitterly she was grievously disappointed she knew anne had refused gilbert blythe avonlea gossip buzzed over the fact which had leaked out nobody knew how perhaps charlie sloane had guessed and told his guesses for truth perhaps diana had betrayed it to fred and fred had been indiscreet at all events it was known mrs blythe no longer asked anne in public or private if she had heard lately from gilbert but passed her by with a frosty bow anne who had always liked gilberts merry younghearted mother was grieved in secret over this marilla said nothing but mrs lynde gave anne many exasperated digs about it until fresh gossip reached that worthy lady through the medium of moody spurgeon macphersons mother that anne had another beau at college who was rich and handsome and good all in one after that mrs rachel held her tongue though she still wished in her inmost heart that anne had accepted gilbert riches were all very well but even mrs rachel practical soul though she was did not consider them the one essential if anne liked the handsome unknown better than gilbert there was nothing more to be said but mrs rachel was dreadfully afraid that anne was going to make the mistake of marrying for money marilla knew anne too well to fear this but she felt that something in the universal scheme of things had gone sadly awry  what is to be will be said mrs rachel gloomily and what isnt to be happens sometimes i cant help believing its going to happen in annes case if providence doesnt interfere thats what mrs rachel sighed she was afraid providence wouldnt interfere and she didnt dare to  anne had wandered down to the dryads bubble and was curled up among the ferns at the root of the big white birch where she and gilbert had so often sat in summers gone by he had gone into the newspaper office again when college closed and avonlea seemed very dull without him he never wrote to her and anne missed the letters that never came to be sure roy wrote twice a week his letters were exquisite compositions which would have read beautifully in a memoir or biography anne felt herself more deeply in love with him than ever when she read them but her heart never gave the queer quick painful bound at sight of his letters which it had given one day when mrs hiram sloane had handed her out an envelope addressed in gilberts black upright handwriting anne had hurried home to the east gable and opened it eagerlyto find a typewritten copy of some college society reportonly that and nothing more anne flung the harmless screed across her room and sat down to write an especially nice epistle to roy  diana was to be married in five more days the gray house at orchard slope was in a turmoil of baking and brewing and boiling and stewing for there was to be a big oldtimey wedding anne of course was to be bridesmaid as had been arranged when they were twelve years old and gilbert was coming from kingsport to be best man anne was enjoying the excitement of the various preparations but under it all she carried a little heartache she was in a sense losing her dear old chum dianas new home would be two miles from green gables and the old constant companionship could never be theirs again anne looked up at dianas light and thought how it had beaconed to her for many years but soon it would shine through the summer twilights no more two big painful tears welled up in her gray eyes  oh she thought how horrible it is that people have to grow upand marryand change     chapter xxix  dianas wedding   after all the only real roses are the pink ones said anne as she tied white ribbon around dianas bouquet in the westwardlooking gable at orchard slope they are the flowers of love and faith  diana was standing nervously in the middle of the room arrayed in her bridal white her black curls frosted over with the film of her wedding veil anne had draped that veil in accordance with the sentimental compact of years before  its all pretty much as i used to imagine it long ago when i wept over your inevitable marriage and our consequent parting she laughed you are the bride of my dreams diana with the lovely misty veil and i am your bridesmaid but alas i havent the puffed sleevesthough these short lace ones are even prettier neither is my heart wholly breaking nor do i exactly hate fred  we are not really parting anne protested diana im not going far away well love each other just as much as ever weve always kept that oath of friendship we swore long ago havent we  yes weve kept it faithfully weve had a beautiful friendship diana weve never marred it by one quarrel or coolness or unkind word and i hope it will always be so but things cant be quite the same after this youll have other interests ill just be on the outside but such is life as mrs rachel says mrs rachel has given you one of her beloved knitted quilts of the tobacco stripe pattern and she says when i am married shell give me one too  the mean thing about your getting married is that i wont be able to be your bridesmaid lamented diana  im to be phils bridesmaid next june when she marries mr blake and then i must stop for you know the proverb three times a bridesmaid never a bride said anne peeping through the window over the pink and snow of the blossoming orchard beneath here comes the minister diana  oh anne gasped diana suddenly turning very pale and beginning to tremble oh anneim so nervousi cant go through with itanne i know im going to faint  if you do ill drag you down to the rainwater hogshed and drop you in said anne unsympathetically cheer up dearest getting married cant be so very terrible when so many people survive the ceremony see how cool and composed i am and take courage  wait till your turn comes miss anne oh anne i hear father coming upstairs give me my bouquet is my veil right am i very pale  you look just lovely di darling kiss me goodbye for the last time diana barry will never kiss me again  diana wright will though there mothers calling come  following the simple oldfashioned way in vogue then anne went down to the parlor on gilberts arm they met at the top of the stairs for the first time since they had left kingsport for gilbert had arrived only that day gilbert shook hands courteously he was looking very well though as anne instantly noted rather thin he was not pale there was a flush on his cheek that had burned into it as anne came along the hall towards him in her soft white dress with liliesofthevalley in the shining masses of her hair as they entered the crowded parlor together a little murmur of admiration ran around the room what a finelooking pair they are whispered the impressible mrs rachel to marilla  fred ambled in alone with a very red face and then diana swept in on her fathers arm she did not faint and nothing untoward occurred to interrupt the ceremony feasting and merrymaking followed then as the evening waned fred and diana drove away through the moonlight to their new home and gilbert walked with anne to green gables  something of their old comradeship had returned during the informal mirth of the evening oh it was nice to be walking over that wellknown road with gilbert again  the night was so very still that one should have been able to hear the whisper of roses in blossomthe laughter of daisiesthe piping of grassesmany sweet sounds all tangled up together the beauty of moonlight on familiar fields irradiated the world  cant we take a ramble up lovers lane before you go in asked gilbert as they crossed the bridge over the lake of shining waters in which the moon lay like a great drowned blossom of gold  anne assented readily lovers lane was a veritable path in a fairyland that nighta shimmering mysterious place full of wizardry in the whitewoven enchantment of moonlight there had been a time when such a walk with gilbert through lovers lane would have been far too dangerous but roy and christine had made it very safe now anne found herself thinking a good deal about christine as she chatted lightly to gilbert she had met her several times before leaving kingsport and had been charmingly sweet to her christine had also been charmingly sweet indeed they were a most cordial pair but for all that their acquaintance had not ripened into friendship evidently christine was not a kindred spirit  are you going to be in avonlea all summer asked gilbert  no im going down east to valley road next week esther haythorne wants me to teach for her through july and august they have a summer term in that school and esther isnt feeling well so im going to substitute for her in one way i dont mind do you know im beginning to feel a little bit like a stranger in avonlea now it makes me sorrybut its true its quite appalling to see the number of children who have shot up into big boys and girlsreally young men and womenthese past two years half of my pupils are grown up it makes me feel awfully old to see them in the places you and i and our mates used to fill  anne laughed and sighed she felt very old and mature and wisewhich showed how young she was she told herself that she longed greatly to go back to those dear merry days when life was seen through a rosy mist of hope and illusion and possessed an indefinable something that had passed away forever where was it nowthe glory and the dream  so wags the world away quoted gilbert practically and a trifle absently anne wondered if he were thinking of christine oh avonlea was going to be so lonely nowwith diana gone     chapter xxx  mrs skinners romance   anne stepped off the train at valley road station and looked about to see if any one had come to meet her she was to board with a certain miss janet sweet but she saw no one who answered in the least to her preconception of that lady as formed from esthers letter the only person in sight was an elderly woman sitting in a wagon with mail bags piled around her two hundred would have been a charitable guess at her weight her face was as round and red as a harvestmoon and almost as featureless she wore a tight black cashmere dress made in the fashion of ten years ago a little dusty black straw hat trimmed with bows of yellow ribbon and faded black lace mits  here you she called waving her whip at anne are you the new valley road schoolmaam  yes  well i thought so valley road is noted for its goodlooking schoolmaams just as millersville is noted for its humly ones janet sweet asked me this morning if i could bring you out i said sartin i kin if she dont mind being scrunched up some this rig of mines kinder small for the mail bags and im some heftier than thomas just wait miss till i shift these bags a bit and ill tuck you in somehow its only two miles to janets her nextdoor neighbors hired boy is coming for your trunk tonight my name is skinneramelia skinner  anne was eventually tucked in exchanging amused smiles with herself during the process  jog along black mare commanded mrs skinner gathering up the reins in her pudgy hands this is my first trip on the mail rowte thomas wanted to hoe his turnips today so he asked me to come so i jest sot down and took a standingup snack and started i sorter like it o course its rather tejus part of the time i sits and thinks and the rest i jest sits jog along black mare i want to git home airly thomas is terrible lonesome when im away you see we havent been married very long  oh said anne politely  just a month thomas courted me for quite a spell though it was real romantic anne tried to picture mrs skinner on speaking terms with romance and failed  oh she said again  yes ysee there was another man after me jog along black mare id been a widder so long folks had given up expecting me to marry again but when my dartershes a schoolmaam like youwent out west to teach i felt real lonesome and wasnt nowise sot against the idea bimeby thomas began to come up and so did the other fellerwilliam obadiah seaman his name was for a long time i couldnt make up my mind which of them to take and they kep coming and coming and i kep worrying ysee wo was richhe had a fine place and carried considerable style he was by far the best match jog along black mare  why didnt you marry him asked anne  well ysee he didnt love me answered mrs skinner solemnly  anne opened her eyes widely and looked at mrs skinner but there was not a glint of humor on that ladys face evidently mrs skinner saw nothing amusing in her own case  hed been a widderman for three yers and his sister kept house for him then she got married and he just wanted some one to look after his house it was worth looking after too mind you that its a handsome house jog along black mare as for thomas he was poor and if his house didnt leak in dry weather it was about all that could be said for it though it looks kind of pictureaskew but ysee i loved thomas and i didnt care one red cent for wo so i argued it out with myself sarah crowe say imy first was a croweyou can marry your rich man if you like but you wont be happy folks cant get along together in this world without a little bit of love youd just better tie up to thomas for he loves you and you love him and nothing else aint going to do you jog along black mare so i told thomas id take him all the time i was getting ready i never dared drive past wos place for fear the sight of that fine house of his would put me in the swithers again but now i never think of it at all and im just that comfortable and happy with thomas jog along black mare  how did william obadiah take it queried anne  oh he rumpussed a bit but hes going to see a skinny old maid in millersville now and i guess shell take him fast enough shell make him a better wife than his first did wo never wanted to marry her he just asked her to marry him cause his father wanted him to never dreaming but that shed say no but mind you she said yes there was a predicament for you jog along black mare she was a great housekeeper but most awful mean she wore the same bonnet for eighteen years then she got a new one and wo met her on the road and didnt know her jog along black mare i feel that id a narrer escape i might have married him and been most awful miserable like my poor cousin jane ann jane ann married a rich man she didnt care anything about and she hasnt the life of a dog she come to see me last week and says says she sarah skinner i envy you id rather live in a little hut on the side of the road with a man i was fond of than in my big house with the one ive got jane anns man aint such a bad sort nuther though hes so contrary that he wears his fur coat when the thermometers at ninety the only way to git him to do anything is to coax him to do the opposite but there aint any love to smooth things down and its a poor way of living jog along black mare theres janets place in the hollowwayside she calls it quite pictureaskew aint it i guess youll be glad to git out of this with all them mail bags jamming round you  yes but i have enjoyed my drive with you very much said anne sincerely  git away now said mrs skinner highly flattered wait till i tell thomas that he always feels dretful tickled when i git a compliment jog along black mare well here we are i hope youll git on well in the school miss theres a short cut to it through the mash back of janets if you take that way be awful keerful if you once got stuck in that black mud youd be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment like adam palmers cow jog along black mare    chapter xxxi  anne to philippa   anne shirley to philippa gordon greeting  wellbeloved its high time i was writing you here am i installed once more as a country schoolmaam at valley road boarding at wayside the home of miss janet sweet janet is a dear soul and very nicelooking tall but not overtall stoutish yet with a certain restraint of outline suggestive of a thrifty soul who is not going to be overlavish even in the matter of avoirdupois she has a knot of soft crimpy brown hair with a thread of gray in it a sunny face with rosy cheeks and big kind eyes as blue as forgetmenots moreover she is one of those delightful oldfashioned cooks who dont care a bit if they ruin your digestion as long as they can give you feasts of fat things  i like her and she likes meprincipally it seems because she had a sister named anne who died young  im real glad to see you she said briskly when i landed in her yard my you dont look a mite like i expected i was sure youd be darkmy sister anne was dark and here youre redheaded  for a few minutes i thought i wasnt going to like janet as much as i had expected at first sight then i reminded myself that i really must be more sensible than to be prejudiced against any one simply because she called my hair red probably the word auburn was not in janets vocabulary at all  wayside is a dear sort of little spot the house is small and white set down in a delightful little hollow that drops away from the road between road and house is an orchard and flowergarden all mixed up together the front door walk is bordered with quahog clamshellscowhawks janet calls them there is virginia creeper over the porch and moss on the roof my room is a neat little spot off the parlorjust big enough for the bed and me over the head of my bed there is a picture of robby burns standing at highland marys grave shadowed by an enormous weeping willow tree robbys face is so lugubrious that it is no wonder i have bad dreams why the first night i was here i dreamed i couldnt laugh  the parlor is tiny and neat its one window is so shaded by a huge willow that the room has a grottolike effect of emerald gloom there are wonderful tidies on the chairs and gay mats on the floor and books and cards carefully arranged on a round table and vases of dried grass on the mantelpiece between the vases is a cheerful decoration of preserved coffin platesfive in all pertaining respectively to janets father and mother a brother her sister anne and a hired man who died here once if i go suddenly insane some of these days know all men by these presents that those coffinplates have caused it  but its all delightful and i said so janet loved me for it just as she detested poor esther because esther had said so much shade was unhygienic and had objected to sleeping on a feather bed now i glory in featherbeds and the more unhygienic and feathery they are the more i glory janet says it is such a comfort to see me eat she had been so afraid i would be like miss haythorne who wouldnt eat anything but fruit and hot water for breakfast and tried to make janet give up frying things esther is really a dear girl but she is rather given to fads the trouble is that she hasnt enough imagination and has a tendency to indigestion  janet told me i could have the use of the parlor when any young men called i dont think there are many to call i havent seen a young man in valley road yet except the nextdoor hired boysam toliver a very tall lank towhaired youth he came over one evening recently and sat for an hour on the garden fence near the front porch where janet and i were doing fancywork the only remarks he volunteered in all that time were hev a peppermint miss dew nowfine thing for cararrh peppermints and powerful lot o jumpgrasses round here ternight yep  but there is a love affair going on here it seems to be my fortune to be mixed up more or less actively with elderly love affairs mr and mrs irving always say that i brought about their marriage mrs stephen clark of carmody persists in being most grateful to me for a suggestion which somebody else would probably have made if i hadnt i do really think though that ludovic speed would never have got any further along than placid courtship if i had not helped him and theodora dix out  in the present affair i am only a passive spectator ive tried once to help things along and made an awful mess of it so i shall not meddle again ill tell you all about it when we meet     chapter xxxii  tea with mrs douglas   on the first thursday night of annes sojourn in valley road janet asked her to go to prayermeeting janet blossomed out like a rose to attend that prayermeeting she wore a paleblue pansysprinkled muslin dress with more ruffles than one would ever have supposed economical janet could be guilty of and a white leghorn hat with pink roses and three ostrich feathers on it anne felt quite amazed later on she found out janets motive in so arraying herselfa motive as old as eden  valley road prayermeetings seemed to be essentially feminine there were thirtytwo women present two halfgrown boys and one solitary man beside the minister anne found herself studying this man he was not handsome or young or graceful he had remarkably long legsso long that he had to keep them coiled up under his chair to dispose of themand he was stoopshouldered his hands were big his hair wanted barbering and his moustache was unkempt but anne thought she liked his face it was kind and honest and tender there was something else in it toojust what anne found it hard to define she finally concluded that this man had suffered and been strong and it had been made manifest in his face there was a sort of patient humorous endurance in his expression which indicated that he would go to the stake if need be but would keep on looking pleasant until he really had to begin squirming  when prayermeeting was over this man came up to janet and said  may i see you home janet  janet took his armas primly and shyly as if she were no more than sixteen having her first escort home anne told the girls at pattys place later on  miss shirley permit me to introduce mr douglas she said stiffly  mr douglas nodded and said i was looking at you in prayermeeting miss and thinking what a nice little girl you were  such a speech from ninetynine people out of a hundred would have annoyed anne bitterly but the way in which mr douglas said it made her feel that she had received a very real and pleasing compliment she smiled appreciatively at him and dropped obligingly behind on the moonlit road  so janet had a beau anne was delighted janet would make a paragon of a wifecheery economical tolerant and a very queen of cooks it would be a flagrant waste on natures part to keep her a permanent old maid  john douglas asked me to take you up to see his mother said janet the next day shes bedrid a lot of the time and never goes out of the house but shes powerful fond of company and always wants to see my boarders can you go up this evening  anne assented but later in the day mr douglas called on his mothers behalf to invite them up to tea on saturday evening  oh why didnt you put on your pretty pansy dress asked anne when they left home it was a hot day and poor janet between her excitement and her heavy black cashmere dress looked as if she were being broiled alive  old mrs douglas would think it terrible frivolous and unsuitable im afraid john likes that dress though she added wistfully  the old douglas homestead was half a mile from wayside cresting a windy hill the house itself was large and comfortable old enough to be dignified and girdled with maple groves and orchards there were big trim barns behind it and everything bespoke prosperity whatever the patient endurance in mr douglas face had meant it hadnt so anne reflected meant debts and duns  john douglas met them at the door and took them into the sittingroom where his mother was enthroned in an armchair  anne had expected old mrs douglas to be tall and thin because mr douglas was instead she was a tiny scrap of a woman with soft pink cheeks mild blue eyes and a mouth like a babys dressed in a beautiful fashionablymade black silk dress with a fluffy white shawl over her shoulders and her snowy hair surmounted by a dainty lace cap she might have posed as a grandmother doll  how do you do janet dear she said sweetly i am so glad to see you again dear she put up her pretty old face to be kissed and this is our new teacher im delighted to meet you my son has been singing your praises until im half jealous and im sure janet ought to be wholly so  poor janet blushed anne said something polite and conventional and then everybody sat down and made talk it was hard work even for anne for nobody seemed at ease except old mrs douglas who certainly did not find any difficulty in talking she made janet sit by her and stroked her hand occasionally janet sat and smiled looking horribly uncomfortable in her hideous dress and john douglas sat without smiling  at the tea table mrs douglas gracefully asked janet to pour the tea janet turned redder than ever but did it anne wrote a description of that meal to stella  we had cold tongue and chicken and strawberry preserves lemon pie and tarts and chocolate cake and raisin cookies and pound cake and fruit cakeand a few other things including more piecaramel pie i think it was after i had eaten twice as much as was good for me mrs douglas sighed and said she feared she had nothing to tempt my appetite  im afraid dear janets cooking has spoiled you for any other she said sweetly of course nobody in valley road aspires to rival her wont you have another piece of pie miss shirley you havent eaten anything  stella i had eaten a helping of tongue and one of chicken three biscuits a generous allowance of preserves a piece of pie a tart and a square of chocolate cake  after tea mrs douglas smiled benevolently and told john to take dear janet out into the garden and get her some roses miss shirley will keep me company while you are outwont you she said plaintively she settled down in her armchair with a sigh  i am a very frail old woman miss shirley for over twenty years ive been a great sufferer for twenty long weary years ive been dying by inches  how painful said anne trying to be sympathetic and succeeding only in feeling idiotic  there have been scores of nights when theyve thought i could never live to see the dawn went on mrs douglas solemnly nobody knows what ive gone throughnobody can know but myself well it cant last very much longer now my weary pilgrimage will soon be over miss shirley it is a great comfort to me that john will have such a good wife to look after him when his mother is gonea great comfort miss shirley  janet is a lovely woman said anne warmly  lovely a beautiful character assented mrs douglas and a perfect housekeepersomething i never was my health would not permit it miss shirley i am indeed thankful that john has made such a wise choice i hope and believe that he will be happy he is my only son miss shirley and his happiness lies very near my heart  of course said anne stupidly for the first time in her life she was stupid yet she could not imagine why she seemed to have absolutely nothing to say to this sweet smiling angelic old lady who was patting her hand so kindly  come and see me soon again dear janet said mrs douglas lovingly when they left you dont come half often enough but then i suppose john will be bringing you here to stay all the time one of these days anne happening to glance at john douglas as his mother spoke gave a positive start of dismay he looked as a tortured man might look when his tormentors gave the rack the last turn of possible endurance she felt sure he must be ill and hurried poor blushing janet away  isnt old mrs douglas a sweet woman asked janet as they went down the road  mm answered anne absently she was wondering why john douglas had looked so  shes been a terrible sufferer said janet feelingly she takes terrible spells it keeps john all worried up hes scared to leave home for fear his mother will take a spell and nobody there but the hired girl     chapter xxxiii  he just kept coming and coming   three days later anne came home from school and found janet crying tears and janet seemed so incongruous that anne was honestly alarmed  oh what is the matter she cried anxiously  imim forty today sobbed janet  well you were nearly that yesterday and it didnt hurt comforted anne trying not to smile  butbut went on janet with a big gulp john douglas wont ask me to marry him  oh but he will said anne lamely you must give him time janet  time said janet with indescribable scorn he has had twenty years how much time does he want  do you mean that john douglas has been coming to see you for twenty years  he has and he has never so much as mentioned marriage to me and i dont believe he ever will now ive never said a word to a mortal about it but it seems to me ive just got to talk it out with some one at last or go crazy john douglas begun to go with me twenty years ago before mother died well he kept coming and coming and after a spell i begun making quilts and things but he never said anything about getting married only just kept coming and coming there wasnt anything i could do mother died when wed been going together for eight years i thought he maybe would speak out then seeing as i was left alone in the world he was real kind and feeling and did everything he could for me but he never said marry and thats the way it has been going on ever since people blame me for it they say i wont marry him because his mother is so sickly and i dont want the bother of waiting on her why id love to wait on johns mother but i let them think so id rather theyd blame me than pity me its so dreadful humiliating that john wont ask me and why wont he seems to me if i only knew his reason i wouldnt mind it so much  perhaps his mother doesnt want him to marry anybody suggested anne  oh she does shes told me time and again that shed love to see john settled before her time comes shes always giving him hintsyou heard her yourself the other day i thought id ha gone through the floor  its beyond me said anne helplessly she thought of ludovic speed but the cases were not parallel john douglas was not a man of ludovics type  you should show more spirit janet she went on resolutely why didnt you send him about his business long ago  i couldnt said poor janet pathetically you see anne ive always been awful fond of john he might just as well keep coming as not for there was never anybody else id want so it didnt matter  but it might have made him speak out like a man urged anne  janet shook her head  no i guess not i was afraid to try anyway for fear hed think i meant it and just go i suppose im a poorspirited creature but that is how i feel and i cant help it  oh you could help it janet it isnt too late yet take a firm stand let that man know you are not going to endure his shillyshallying any longer ill back you up  i dunno said janet hopelessly i dunno if i could ever get up enough spunk things have drifted so long but ill think it over  anne felt that she was disappointed in john douglas she had liked him so well and she had not thought him the sort of man who would play fast and loose with a womans feelings for twenty years he certainly should be taught a lesson and anne felt vindictively that she would enjoy seeing the process therefore she was delighted when janet told her as they were going to prayermeeting the next night that she meant to show some sperrit  ill let john douglas see im not going to be trodden on any longer  you are perfectly right said anne emphatically  when prayermeeting was over john douglas came up with his usual request janet looked frightened but resolute  no thank you she said icily i know the road home pretty well alone i ought to seeing ive been traveling it for forty years so you neednt trouble yourself mr douglas  anne was looking at john douglas and in that brilliant moonlight she saw the last twist of the rack again without a word he turned and strode down the road  stop stop anne called wildly after him not caring in the least for the other dumbfounded onlookers mr douglas stop come back  john douglas stopped but he did not come back anne flew down the road caught his arm and fairly dragged him back to janet  you must come back she said imploringly its all a mistake mr douglasall my fault i made janet do it she didnt want tobut its all right now isnt it janet  without a word janet took his arm and walked away anne followed them meekly home and slipped in by the back door  well you are a nice person to back me up said janet sarcastically  i couldnt help it janet said anne repentantly i just felt as if i had stood by and seen murder done i had to run after him  oh im just as glad you did when i saw john douglas making off down that road i just felt as if every little bit of joy and happiness that was left in my life was going with him it was an awful feeling  did he ask you why you did it asked anne  no he never said a word about it replied janet dully     chapter xxxiv  john douglas speaks at last   anne was not without a feeble hope that something might come of it after all but nothing did john douglas came and took janet driving and walked home from prayermeeting with her as he had been doing for twenty years and as he seemed likely to do for twenty years more the summer waned anne taught her school and wrote letters and studied a little her walks to and from school were pleasant she always went by way of the swamp it was a lovely placea boggy soil green with the greenest of mossy hillocks a silvery brook meandered through it and spruces stood erectly their boughs atrail with graygreen mosses their roots overgrown with all sorts of woodland lovelinesses  nevertheless anne found life in valley road a little monotonous to be sure there was one diverting incident  she had not seen the lank towheaded samuel of the peppermints since the evening of his call save for chance meetings on the road but one warm august night he appeared and solemnly seated himself on the rustic bench by the porch he wore his usual working habiliments consisting of varipatched trousers a blue jean shirt out at the elbows and a ragged straw hat he was chewing a straw and he kept on chewing it while he looked solemnly at anne anne laid her book aside with a sigh and took up her doily conversation with sam was really out of the question  after a long silence sam suddenly spoke  im leaving over there he said abruptly waving his straw in the direction of the neighboring house  oh are you said anne politely  yep  and where are you going now  wall ive been thinking some of gitting a place of my own theres one thatd suit me over at millersville but ef i rents it ill want a woman  i suppose so said anne vaguely  yep  there was another long silence finally sam removed his straw again and said  will yeh hev me  what gasped anne  will yeh hev me  do you meanmarry you queried poor anne feebly  yep  why im hardly acquainted with you cried anne indignantly  but yehd git acquainted with me after we was married said sam  anne gathered up her poor dignity  certainly i wont marry you she said haughtily  wall yeh might do worse expostulated sam im a good worker and ive got some money in the bank  dont speak of this to me again whatever put such an idea into your head said anne her sense of humor getting the better of her wrath it was such an absurd situation  yehre a likelylooking girl and hev a rightsmart way o stepping said sam i dont want no lazy woman think it over i wont change my mind yit awhile wall i must be gitting gotter milk the cows  annes illusions concerning proposals had suffered so much of late years that there were few of them left so she could laugh wholeheartedly over this one not feeling any secret sting she mimicked poor sam to janet that night and both of them laughed immoderately over his plunge into sentiment  one afternoon when annes sojourn in valley road was drawing to a close alec ward came driving down to wayside in hot haste for janet  they want you at the douglas place quick he said i really believe old mrs douglas is going to die at last after pretending to do it for twenty years  janet ran to get her hat anne asked if mrs douglas was worse than usual  shes not half as bad said alec solemnly and thats what makes me think its serious other times shed be screaming and throwing herself all over the place this time shes lying still and mum when mrs douglas is mum she is pretty sick you bet  you dont like old mrs douglas said anne curiously  i like cats as is cats i dont like cats as is women was alecs cryptic reply  janet came home in the twilight  mrs douglas is dead she said wearily she died soon after i got there she just spoke to me oncei suppose youll marry john now she said it cut me to the heart anne to think johns own mother thought i wouldnt marry him because of her i couldnt say a word eitherthere were other women there i was thankful john had gone out  janet began to cry drearily but anne brewed her a hot drink of ginger tea to her comforting to be sure anne discovered later on that she had used white pepper instead of ginger but janet never knew the difference  the evening after the funeral janet and anne were sitting on the front porch steps at sunset the wind had fallen asleep in the pinelands and lurid sheets of heatlightning flickered across the northern skies janet wore her ugly black dress and looked her very worst her eyes and nose red from crying they talked little for janet seemed faintly to resent annes efforts to cheer her up she plainly preferred to be miserable  suddenly the gatelatch clicked and john douglas strode into the garden he walked towards them straight over the geranium bed janet stood up so did anne anne was a tall girl and wore a white dress but john douglas did not see her  janet he said will you marry me  the words burst out as if they had been wanting to be said for twenty years and must be uttered now before anything else  janets face was so red from crying that it couldnt turn any redder so it turned a most unbecoming purple  why didnt you ask me before she said slowly  i couldnt she made me promise not tomother made me promise not to nineteen years ago she took a terrible spell we thought she couldnt live through it she implored me to promise not to ask you to marry me while she was alive i didnt want to promise such a thing even though we all thought she couldnt live very longthe doctor only gave her six months but she begged it on her knees sick and suffering i had to promise  what had your mother against me cried janet  nothingnothing she just didnt want another womanany womanthere while she was living she said if i didnt promise shed die right there and id have killed her so i promised and shes held me to that promise ever since though ive gone on my knees to her in my turn to beg her to let me off  why didnt you tell me this asked janet chokingly if id only known why didnt you just tell me  she made me promise i wouldnt tell a soul said john hoarsely she swore me to it on the bible janet id never have done it if id dreamed it was to be for so long janet youll never know what ive suffered these nineteen years i know ive made you suffer too but youll marry me for all wont you janet oh janet wont you ive come as soon as i could to ask you  at this moment the stupefied anne came to her senses and realized that she had no business to be there she slipped away and did not see janet until the next morning when the latter told her the rest of the story  that cruel relentless deceitful old woman cried anne  hushshes dead said janet solemnly if she wasntbut she is so we mustnt speak evil of her but im happy at last anne and i wouldnt have minded waiting so long a bit if id only known why  when are you to be married  next month of course it will be very quiet i suppose people will talk terrible theyll say i made enough haste to snap john up as soon as his poor mother was out of the way john wanted to let them know the truth but i said no john after all she was your mother and well keep the secret between us and not cast any shadow on her memory i dont mind what people say now that i know the truth myself it dont matter a mite let it all be buried with the dead says i to him so i coaxed him round to agree with me  youre much more forgiving than i could ever be anne said rather crossly  youll feel differently about a good many things when you get to be my age said janet tolerantly thats one of the things we learn as we grow olderhow to forgive it comes easier at forty than it did at twenty     chapter xxxv  the last redmond year opens   here we are all back again nicely sunburned and rejoicing as a strong man to run a race said phil sitting down on a suitcase with a sigh of pleasure isnt it jolly to see this dear old pattys place againand auntyand the cats rusty has lost another piece of ear hasnt he  rusty would be the nicest cat in the world if he had no ears at all declared anne loyally from her trunk while rusty writhed about her lap in a frenzy of welcome  arent you glad to see us back aunty demanded phil  yes but i wish youd tidy things up said aunt jamesina plaintively looking at the wilderness of trunks and suitcases by which the four laughing chattering girls were surrounded you can talk just as well later on work first and then play used to be my motto when i was a girl  oh weve just reversed that in this generation aunty our motto is play your play and then dig in you can do your work so much better if youve had a good bout of play first  if you are going to marry a minister said aunt jamesina picking up joseph and her knitting and resigning herself to the inevitable with the charming grace that made her the queen of housemothers you will have to give up such expressions as dig in  why moaned phil oh why must a ministers wife be supposed to utter only prunes and prisms i shant everybody on patterson street uses slangthat is to say metaphorical languageand if i didnt they would think me insufferably proud and stuck up  have you broken the news to your family asked priscilla feeding the sarahcat bits from her lunchbasket  phil nodded  how did they take it  oh mother rampaged but i stood rockfirmeven i philippa gordon who never before could hold fast to anything father was calmer fathers own daddy was a minister so you see he has a soft spot in his heart for the cloth i had jo up to mount holly after mother grew calm and they both loved him but mother gave him some frightful hints in every conversation regarding what she had hoped for me oh my vacation pathway hasnt been exactly strewn with roses girls dear butive won out and ive got jo nothing else matters  to you said aunt jamesina darkly  nor to jo either retorted phil you keep on pitying him why pray i think hes to be envied hes getting brains beauty and a heart of gold in me  its well we know how to take your speeches said aunt jamesina patiently i hope you dont talk like that before strangers what would they think  oh i dont want to know what they think i dont want to see myself as others see me im sure it would be horribly uncomfortable most of the time i dont believe burns was really sincere in that prayer either  oh i daresay we all pray for some things that we really dont want if we were only honest enough to look into our hearts owned aunt jamesina candidly ive a notion that such prayers dont rise very far i used to pray that i might be enabled to forgive a certain person but i know now i really didnt want to forgive her when i finally got that i did want to i forgave her without having to pray about it  i cant picture you as being unforgiving for long said stella  oh i used to be but holding spite doesnt seem worth while when you get along in years  that reminds me said anne and told the tale of john and janet  and now tell us about that romantic scene you hinted so darkly at in one of your letters demanded phil  anne acted out samuels proposal with great spirit the girls shrieked with laughter and aunt jamesina smiled  it isnt in good taste to make fun of your beaux she said severely but she added calmly i always did it myself  tell us about your beaux aunty entreated phil you must have had any number of them  theyre not in the past tense retorted aunt jamesina ive got them yet there are three old widowers at home who have been casting sheeps eyes at me for some time you children neednt think you own all the romance in the world  widowers and sheeps eyes dont sound very romantic aunty  well no but young folks arent always romantic either some of my beaux certainly werent i used to laugh at them scandalous poor boys there was jim elwoodhe was always in a sort of daydreamnever seemed to sense what was going on he didnt wake up to the fact that id said no till a year after id said it when he did get married his wife fell out of the sleigh one night when they were driving home from church and he never missed her then there was dan winston he knew too much he knew everything in this world and most of what is in the next he could give you an answer to any question even if you asked him when the judgment day was to be milton edwards was real nice and i liked him but i didnt marry him for one thing he took a week to get a joke through his head and for another he never asked me horatio reeve was the most interesting beau i ever had but when he told a story he dressed it up so that you couldnt see it for frills i never could decide whether he was lying or just letting his imagination run loose  and what about the others aunty  go away and unpack said aunt jamesina waving joseph at them by mistake for a needle the others were too nice to make fun of i shall respect their memory theres a box of flowers in your room anne they came about an hour ago  after the first week the girls of pattys place settled down to a steady grind of study for this was their last year at redmond and graduation honors must be fought for persistently anne devoted herself to english priscilla pored over classics and philippa pounded away at mathematics sometimes they grew tired sometimes they felt discouraged sometimes nothing seemed worth the struggle for it in one such mood stella wandered up to the blue room one rainy november evening anne sat on the floor in a little circle of light cast by the lamp beside her amid a surrounding snow of crumpled manuscript  what in the world are you doing  just looking over some old story club yarns i wanted something to cheer and inebriate id studied until the world seemed azure so i came up here and dug these out of my trunk they are so drenched in tears and tragedy that they are excruciatingly funny  im blue and discouraged myself said stella throwing herself on the couch nothing seems worthwhile my very thoughts are old ive thought them all before what is the use of living after all anne  honey its just brain fag that makes us feel that way and the weather a pouring rainy night like this coming after a hard days grind would squelch any one but a mark tapley you know it is worthwhile to live  oh i suppose so but i cant prove it to myself just now  just think of all the great and noble souls who have lived and worked in the world said anne dreamily isnt it worthwhile to come after them and inherit what they won and taught isnt it worthwhile to think we can share their inspiration and then all the great souls that will come in the future isnt it worthwhile to work a little and prepare the way for themmake just one step in their path easier  oh my mind agrees with you anne but my soul remains doleful and uninspired im always grubby and dingy on rainy nights  some nights i like the raini like to lie in bed and hear it pattering on the roof and drifting through the pines  i like it when it stays on the roof said stella it doesnt always i spent a gruesome night in an old country farmhouse last summer the roof leaked and the rain came pattering down on my bed there was no poetry in that i had to get up in the mirk midnight and chivy round to pull the bedstead out of the dripand it was one of those solid oldfashioned beds that weigh a tonmore or less and then that dripdrop dripdrop kept up all night until my nerves just went to pieces youve no idea what an eerie noise a great drop of rain falling with a mushy thud on a bare floor makes in the night it sounds like ghostly footsteps and all that sort of thing what are you laughing over anne  these stories as phil would say they are killingin more senses than one for everybody died in them what dazzlingly lovely heroines we hadand how we dressed them  silkssatinsvelvetsjewelslacesthey never wore anything else here is one of jane andrews stories depicting her heroine as sleeping in a beautiful white satin nightdress trimmed with seed pearls  go on said stella i begin to feel that life is worth living as long as theres a laugh in it  heres one i wrote my heroine is disporting herself at a ball glittering from head to foot with large diamonds of the first water but what booted beauty or rich attire the paths of glory lead but to the grave they must either be murdered or die of a broken heart there was no escape for them  let me read some of your stories  well heres my masterpiece note its cheerful titlemy graves i shed quarts of tears while writing it and the other girls shed gallons while i read it jane andrews mother scolded her frightfully because she had so many handkerchiefs in the wash that week its a harrowing tale of the wanderings of a methodist ministers wife i made her a methodist because it was necessary that she should wander she buried a child every place she lived in there were nine of them and their graves were severed far apart ranging from newfoundland to vancouver i described the children pictured their several death beds and detailed their tombstones and epitaphs i had intended to bury the whole nine but when i had disposed of eight my invention of horrors gave out and i permitted the ninth to live as a hopeless cripple  while stella read my graves punctuating its tragic paragraphs with chuckles and rusty slept the sleep of a just cat who has been out all night curled up on a jane andrews tale of a beautiful maiden of fifteen who went to nurse in a leper colonyof course dying of the loathsome disease finallyanne glanced over the other manuscripts and recalled the old days at avonlea school when the members of the story club sitting under the spruce trees or down among the ferns by the brook had written them what fun they had had how the sunshine and mirth of those olden summers returned as she read not all the glory that was greece or the grandeur that was rome could weave such wizardry as those funny tearful tales of the story club among the manuscripts anne found one written on sheets of wrapping paper a wave of laughter filled her gray eyes as she recalled the time and place of its genesis it was the sketch she had written the day she fell through the roof of the cobb duckhouse on the tory road  anne glanced over it then fell to reading it intently it was a little dialogue between asters and sweetpeas wild canaries in the lilac bush and the guardian spirit of the garden after she had read it she sat staring into space and when stella had gone she smoothed out the crumpled manuscript  i believe i will she said resolutely     chapter xxxvi  the gardnerscall   here is a letter with an indian stamp for you aunt jimsie said phil here are three for stella and two for pris and a glorious fat one for me from jo theres nothing for you anne except a circular  nobody noticed annes flush as she took the thin letter phil tossed her carelessly but a few minutes later phil looked up to see a transfigured anne  honey what good thing has happened  the youths friend has accepted a little sketch i sent them a fortnight ago said anne trying hard to speak as if she were accustomed to having sketches accepted every mail but not quite succeeding  anne shirley how glorious what was it when is it to be published did they pay you for it  yes theyve sent a check for ten dollars and the editor writes that he would like to see more of my work dear man he shall it was an old sketch i found in my box i rewrote it and sent it inbut i never really thought it could be accepted because it had no plot said anne recalling the bitter experience of averils atonement  what are you going to do with that ten dollars anne lets all go up town and get drunk suggested phil  i am going to squander it in a wild soulless revel of some sort declared anne gaily at all events it isnt tainted moneylike the check i got for that horrible reliable baking powder story i spent it usefully for clothes and hated them every time i put them on  think of having a real live author at pattys place said priscilla  its a great responsibility said aunt jamesina solemnly  indeed it is agreed pris with equal solemnity authors are kittle cattle you never know when or how they will break out anne may make copy of us  i meant that the ability to write for the press was a great responsibility said aunt jamesina severely and i hope anne realizes it my daughter used to write stories before she went to the foreign field but now she has turned her attention to higher things she used to say her motto was never write a line you would be ashamed to read at your own funeral youd better take that for yours anne if you are going to embark in literature though to be sure added aunt jamesina perplexedly elizabeth always used to laugh when she said it she always laughed so much that i dont know how she ever came to decide on being a missionary im thankful she didi prayed that she mightbuti wish she hadnt  then aunt jamesina wondered why those giddy girls all laughed  annes eyes shone all that day literary ambitions sprouted and budded in her brain their exhilaration accompanied her to jennie coopers walking party and not even the sight of gilbert and christine walking just ahead of her and roy could quite subdue the sparkle of her starry hopes nevertheless she was not so rapt from things of earth as to be unable to notice that christines walk was decidedly ungraceful  but i suppose gilbert looks only at her face so like a man thought anne scornfully  shall you be home saturday afternoon asked roy  yes  my mother and sisters are coming to call on you said roy quietly  something went over anne which might be described as a thrill but it was hardly a pleasant one she had never met any of roys family she realized the significance of his statement and it had somehow an irrevocableness about it that chilled her  i shall be glad to see them she said flatly and then wondered if she really would be glad she ought to be of course but would it not be something of an ordeal gossip had filtered to anne regarding the light in which the gardners viewed the infatuation of son and brother roy must have brought pressure to bear in the matter of this call anne knew she would be weighed in the balance from the fact that they had consented to call she understood that willingly or unwillingly they regarded her as a possible member of their clan  i shall just be myself i shall not try to make a good impression thought anne loftily but she was wondering what dress she would better wear saturday afternoon and if the new style of high hairdressing would suit her better than the old and the walking party was rather spoiled for her by night she had decided that she would wear her brown chiffon on saturday but would do her hair low  friday afternoon none of the girls had classes at redmond stella took the opportunity to write a paper for the philomathic society and was sitting at the table in the corner of the livingroom with an untidy litter of notes and manuscript on the floor around her stella always vowed she never could write anything unless she threw each sheet down as she completed it anne in her flannel blouse and serge skirt with her hair rather blown from her windy walk home was sitting squarely in the middle of the floor teasing the sarahcat with a wishbone joseph and rusty were both curled up in her lap a warm plummy odor filled the whole house for priscilla was cooking in the kitchen presently she came in enshrouded in a huge workapron with a smudge of flour on her nose to show aunt jamesina the chocolate cake she had just iced  at this auspicious moment the knocker sounded nobody paid any attention to it save phil who sprang up and opened it expecting a boy with the hat she had bought that morning on the doorstep stood mrs gardner and her daughters  anne scrambled to her feet somehow emptying two indignant cats out of her lap as she did so and mechanically shifting her wishbone from her right hand to her left priscilla who would have had to cross the room to reach the kitchen door lost her head wildly plunged the chocolate cake under a cushion on the inglenook sofa and dashed upstairs stella began feverishly gathering up her manuscript only aunt jamesina and phil remained normal thanks to them everybody was soon sitting at ease even anne priscilla came down apronless and smudgeless stella reduced her corner to decency and phil saved the situation by a stream of ready small talk  mrs gardner was tall and thin and handsome exquisitely gowned cordial with a cordiality that seemed a trifle forced aline gardner was a younger edition of her mother lacking the cordiality she endeavored to be nice but succeeded only in being haughty and patronizing dorothy gardner was slim and jolly and rather tomboyish anne knew she was roys favorite sister and warmed to her she would have looked very much like roy if she had had dreamy dark eyes instead of roguish hazel ones thanks to her and phil the call really went off very well except for a slight sense of strain in the atmosphere and two rather untoward incidents rusty and joseph left to themselves began a game of chase and sprang madly into mrs gardners silken lap and out of it in their wild career mrs gardner lifted her lorgnette and gazed after their flying forms as if she had never seen cats before and anne choking back slightly nervous laughter apologized as best she could  you are fond of cats said mrs gardner with a slight intonation of tolerant wonder  anne despite her affection for rusty was not especially fond of cats but mrs gardners tone annoyed her inconsequently she remembered that mrs john blythe was so fond of cats that she kept as many as her husband would allow  they are adorable animals arent they she said wickedly  i have never liked cats said mrs gardner remotely  i love them said dorothy they are so nice and selfish dogs are too good and unselfish they make me feel uncomfortable but cats are gloriously human  you have two delightful old china dogs there may i look at them closely said aline crossing the room towards the fireplace and thereby becoming the unconscious cause of the other accident picking up magog she sat down on the cushion under which was secreted priscillas chocolate cake priscilla and anne exchanged agonized glances but could do nothing the stately aline continued to sit on the cushion and discuss china dogs until the time of departure  dorothy lingered behind a moment to squeeze annes hand and whisper impulsively  i know you and i are going to be chums oh roy has told me all about you im the only one of the family he tells things to poor boynobody could confide in mamma and aline you know what glorious times you girls must have here wont you let me come often and have a share in them  come as often as you like anne responded heartily thankful that one of roys sisters was likable she would never like aline so much was certain and aline would never like her though mrs gardner might be won altogether anne sighed with relief when the ordeal was over       of all sad words of tongue or pen      the saddest are it might have been  quoted priscilla tragically lifting the cushion this cake is now what you might call a flat failure and the cushion is likewise ruined never tell me that friday isnt unlucky  people who send word they are coming on saturday shouldnt come on friday said aunt jamesina  i fancy it was roys mistake said phil that boy isnt really responsible for what he says when he talks to anne where is anne  anne had gone upstairs she felt oddly like crying but she made herself laugh instead rusty and joseph had been too awful and dorothy was a dear     chapter xxxvii  fullfledged bas   i wish i were dead or that it were tomorrow night groaned phil  if you live long enough both wishes will come true said anne calmly  its easy for you to be serene youre at home in philosophy im notand when i think of that horrible paper tomorrow i quail if i should fail in it what would jo say  you wont fail how did you get on in greek today  i dont know perhaps it was a good paper and perhaps it was bad enough to make homer turn over in his grave ive studied and mulled over notebooks until im incapable of forming an opinion of anything how thankful little phil will be when all this examinating is over  examinating i never heard such a word  well havent i as good a right to make a word as any one else demanded phil  words arent madethey grow said anne  never mindi begin faintly to discern clear water ahead where no examination breakers loom girls do youcan you realize that our redmond life is almost over  i cant said anne sorrowfully it seems just yesterday that pris and i were alone in that crowd of freshmen at redmond and now we are seniors in our final examinations  potent wise and reverend seniors quoted phil do you suppose we really are any wiser than when we came to redmond  you dont act as if you were by times said aunt jamesina severely  oh aunt jimsie havent we been pretty good girls take us by and large these three winters youve mothered us pleaded phil  youve been four of the dearest sweetest goodest girls that ever went together through college averred aunt jamesina who never spoiled a compliment by misplaced economy  but i mistrust you havent any too much sense yet its not to be expected of course experience teaches sense you cant learn it in a college course youve been to college four years and i never was but i know heaps more than you do young ladies       there are lots of things that never go by rule      theres a powerful pile o knowledge      that you never get at college      there are heaps of things you never learn at school  quoted stella  have you learned anything at redmond except dead languages and geometry and such trash queried aunt jamesina  oh yes i think we have aunty protested anne  weve learned the truth of what professor woodleigh told us last philomathic said phil he said humor is the spiciest condiment in the feast of existence laugh at your mistakes but learn from them joke over your troubles but gather strength from them make a jest of your difficulties but overcome them isnt that worth learning aunt jimsie  yes it is dearie when youve learned to laugh at the things that should be laughed at and not to laugh at those that shouldnt youve got wisdom and understanding  what have you got out of your redmond course anne murmured priscilla aside  i think said anne slowly that i really have learned to look upon each little hindrance as a jest and each great one as the foreshadowing of victory summing up i think that is what redmond has given me  i shall have to fall back on another professor woodleigh quotation to express what it has done for me said priscilla you remember that he said in his address there is so much in the world for us all if we only have the eyes to see it and the heart to love it and the hand to gather it to ourselvesso much in men and women so much in art and literature so much everywhere in which to delight and for which to be thankful i think redmond has taught me that in some measure anne  judging from what you all say remarked aunt jamesina the sum and substance is that you can learnif youve got natural gumption enoughin four years at college what it would take about twenty years of living to teach you well that justifies higher education in my opinion its a matter i was always dubious about before  but what about people who havent natural gumption aunt jimsie  people who havent natural gumption never learn retorted aunt jamesina neither in college nor life if they live to be a hundred they really dont know anything more than when they were born its their misfortune not their fault poor souls but those of us who have some gumption should duly thank the lord for it  will you please define what gumption is aunt jimsie asked phil  no i wont young woman any one who has gumption knows what it is and any one who hasnt can never know what it is so there is no need of defining it  the busy days flew by and examinations were over anne took high honors in english priscilla took honors in classics and phil in mathematics stella obtained a good allround showing then came convocation  this is what i would once have called an epoch in my life said anne as she took roys violets out of their box and gazed at them thoughtfully she meant to carry them of course but her eyes wandered to another box on her table it was filled with liliesofthevalley as fresh and fragrant as those which bloomed in the green gables yard when june came to avonlea gilbert blythes card lay beside it  anne wondered why gilbert should have sent her flowers for convocation she had seen very little of him during the past winter he had come to pattys place only one friday evening since the christmas holidays and they rarely met elsewhere she knew he was studying very hard aiming at high honors and the cooper prize and he took little part in the social doings of redmond annes own winter had been quite gay socially she had seen a good deal of the gardners she and dorothy were very intimate college circles expected the announcement of her engagement to roy any day anne expected it herself yet just before she left pattys place for convocation she flung roys violets aside and put gilberts liliesofthevalley in their place she could not have told why she did it somehow old avonlea days and dreams and friendships seemed very close to her in this attainment of her longcherished ambitions she and gilbert had once picturedout merrily the day on which they should be capped and gowned graduates in arts the wonderful day had come and roys violets had no place in it only her old friends flowers seemed to belong to this fruition of oldblossoming hopes which he had once shared  for years this day had beckoned and allured to her but when it came the one single keen abiding memory it left with her was not that of the breathless moment when the stately president of redmond gave her cap and diploma and hailed her ba it was not of the flash in gilberts eyes when he saw her lilies nor the puzzled pained glance roy gave her as he passed her on the platform it was not of aline gardners condescending congratulations or dorothys ardent impulsive good wishes it was of one strange unaccountable pang that spoiled this longexpected day for her and left in it a certain faint but enduring flavor of bitterness  the arts graduates gave a graduation dance that night when anne dressed for it she tossed aside the pearl beads she usually wore and took from her trunk the small box that had come to green gables on christmas day in it was a threadlike gold chain with a tiny pink enamel heart as a pendant on the accompanying card was written with all good wishes from your old chum gilbert anne laughing over the memory the enamel heart conjured up the fatal day when gilbert had called her carrots and vainly tried to make his peace with a pink candy heart had written him a nice little note of thanks but she had never worn the trinket tonight she fastened it about her white throat with a dreamy smile  she and phil walked to redmond together anne walked in silence phil chattered of many things suddenly she said  i heard today that gilbert blythes engagement to christine stuart was to be announced as soon as convocation was over did you hear anything of it  no said anne  i think its true said phil lightly  anne did not speak in the darkness she felt her face burning she slipped her hand inside her collar and caught at the gold chain one energetic twist and it gave way anne thrust the broken trinket into her pocket her hands were trembling and her eyes were smarting  but she was the gayest of all the gay revellers that night and told gilbert unregretfully that her card was full when he came to ask her for a dance afterwards when she sat with the girls before the dying embers at pattys place removing the spring chilliness from their satin skins none chatted more blithely than she of the days events  moody spurgeon macpherson called here tonight after you left said aunt jamesina who had sat up to keep the fire on he didnt know about the graduation dance that boy ought to sleep with a rubber band around his head to train his ears not to stick out i had a beau once who did that and it improved him immensely it was i who suggested it to him and he took my advice but he never forgave me for it  moody spurgeon is a very serious young man yawned priscilla he is concerned with graver matters than his ears he is going to be a minister you know  well i suppose the lord doesnt regard the ears of a man said aunt jamesina gravely dropping all further criticism of moody spurgeon aunt jamesina had a proper respect for the cloth even in the case of an unfledged parson     chapter xxxviii  false dawn   just imaginethis night week ill be in avonleadelightful thought said anne bending over the box in which she was packing mrs rachel lyndes quilts but just imaginethis night week ill be gone forever from pattys placehorrible thought  i wonder if the ghost of all our laughter will echo through the maiden dreams of miss patty and miss maria speculated phil  miss patty and miss maria were coming home after having trotted over most of the habitable globe  well be back the second week in may wrote miss patty i expect pattys place will seem rather small after the hall of the kings at karnak but i never did like big places to live in and ill be glad enough to be home again when you start traveling late in life youre apt to do too much of it because you know you havent much time left and its a thing that grows on you im afraid maria will never be contented again  i shall leave here my fancies and dreams to bless the next comer said anne looking around the blue room wistfullyher pretty blue room where she had spent three such happy years she had knelt at its window to pray and had bent from it to watch the sunset behind the pines she had heard the autumn raindrops beating against it and had welcomed the spring robins at its sill she wondered if old dreams could haunt roomsif when one left forever the room where she had joyed and suffered and laughed and wept something of her intangible and invisible yet nonetheless real did not remain behind like a voiceful memory  i think said phil that a room where one dreams and grieves and rejoices and lives becomes inseparably connected with those processes and acquires a personality of its own i am sure if i came into this room fifty years from now it would say anne anne to me what nice times weve had here honey what chats and jokes and good chummy jamborees oh dear me im to marry jo in june and i know i will be rapturously happy but just now i feel as if i wanted this lovely redmond life to go on forever  im unreasonable enough just now to wish that too admitted anne no matter what deeper joys may come to us later on well never again have just the same delightful irresponsible existence weve had here its over forever phil  what are you going to do with rusty asked phil as that privileged pussy padded into the room  i am going to take him home with me and joseph and the sarahcat announced aunt jamesina following rusty it would be a shame to separate those cats now that they have learned to live together its a hard lesson for cats and humans to learn  im sorry to part with rusty said anne regretfully but it would be no use to take him to green gables marilla detests cats and davy would tease his life out besides i dont suppose ill be home very long ive been offered the principalship of the summerside high school  are you going to accept it asked phil  ii havent decided yet answered anne with a confused flush  phil nodded understandingly naturally annes plans could not be settled until roy had spoken he would soonthere was no doubt of that and there was no doubt that anne would say yes when he said will you please anne herself regarded the state of affairs with a seldomruffled complacency she was deeply in love with roy true it was not just what she had imagined love to be but was anything in life anne asked herself wearily like ones imagination of it it was the old diamond disillusion of childhood repeatedthe same disappointment she had felt when she had first seen the chill sparkle instead of the purple splendor she had anticipated thats not my idea of a diamond she had said but roy was a dear fellow and they would be very happy together even if some indefinable zest was missing out of life when roy came down that evening and asked anne to walk in the park every one at pattys place knew what he had come to say and every one knew or thought they knew what annes answer would be  anne is a very fortunate girl said aunt jamesina  i suppose so said stella shrugging her shoulders roy is a nice fellow and all that but theres really nothing in him  that sounds very like a jealous remark stella maynard said aunt jamesina rebukingly  it doesbut i am not jealous said stella calmly i love anne and i like roy everybody says she is making a brilliant match and even mrs gardner thinks her charming now it all sounds as if it were made in heaven but i have my doubts make the most of that aunt jamesina  roy asked anne to marry him in the little pavilion on the harbor shore where they had talked on the rainy day of their first meeting anne thought it very romantic that he should have chosen that spot and his proposal was as beautifully worded as if he had copied it as one of ruby gillis lovers had done out of a deportment of courtship and marriage the whole effect was quite flawless and it was also sincere there was no doubt that roy meant what he said there was no false note to jar the symphony anne felt that she ought to be thrilling from head to foot but she wasnt she was horribly cool when roy paused for his answer she opened her lips to say her fateful yes and thenshe found herself trembling as if she were reeling back from a precipice to her came one of those moments when we realize as by a blinding flash of illumination more than all our previous years have taught us she pulled her hand from roys  oh i cant marry youi canti cant she cried wildly  roy turned paleand also looked rather foolish he hadsmall blame to himfelt very sure  what do you mean he stammered  i mean that i cant marry you repeated anne desperately i thought i couldbut i cant  why cant you roy asked more calmly  becausei dont care enough for you  a crimson streak came into roys face  so youve just been amusing yourself these two years he said slowly  no no i havent gasped poor anne oh how could she explain she couldnt explain there are some things that cannot be explained i did think i caredtruly i didbut i know now i dont  you have ruined my life said roy bitterly  forgive me pleaded anne miserably with hot cheeks and stinging eyes  roy turned away and stood for a few minutes looking out seaward when he came back to anne he was very pale again  you can give me no hope he said  anne shook her head mutely  thengoodbye said roy i cant understand iti cant believe you are not the woman ive believed you to be but reproaches are idle between us you are the only woman i can ever love i thank you for your friendship at least goodbye anne  goodbye faltered anne when roy had gone she sat for a long time in the pavilion watching a white mist creeping subtly and remorselessly landward up the harbor it was her hour of humiliation and selfcontempt and shame their waves went over her and yet underneath it all was a queer sense of recovered freedom  she slipped into pattys place in the dusk and escaped to her room but phil was there on the window seat  wait said anne flushing to anticipate the scene wait til you hear what i have to say phil roy asked me to marry himand i refused  youyou refused him said phil blankly  yes  anne shirley are you in your senses  i think so said anne wearily oh phil dont scold me you dont understand  i certainly dont understand youve encouraged roy gardner in every way for two yearsand now you tell me youve refused him then youve just been flirting scandalously with him anne i couldnt have believed it of you  i wasnt flirting with himi honestly thought i cared up to the last minuteand thenwell i just knew i never could marry him  i suppose said phil cruelly that you intended to marry him for his money and then your better self rose up and prevented you  i didnt i never thought about his money oh i cant explain it to you any more than i could to him  well i certainly think you have treated roy shamefully said phil in exasperation hes handsome and clever and rich and good what more do you want  i want some one who belongs in my life he doesnt i was swept off my feet at first by his good looks and knack of paying romantic compliments and later on i thought i must be in love because he was my darkeyed ideal  i am bad enough for not knowing my own mind but you are worse said phil  i do know my own mind protested anne the trouble is my mind changes and then i have to get acquainted with it all over again  well i suppose there is no use in saying anything to you  there is no need phil im in the dust this has spoiled everything backwards i can never think of redmond days without recalling the humiliation of this evening roy despises meand you despise meand i despise myself  you poor darling said phil melting just come here and let me comfort you ive no right to scold you id have married alec or alonzo if i hadnt met jo oh anne things are so mixedup in real life they arent clearcut and trimmed off as they are in novels  i hope that no one will ever again ask me to marry him as long as i live sobbed poor anne devoutly believing that she meant it     chapter xxxix  deals with weddings   anne felt that life partook of the nature of an anticlimax during the first few weeks after her return to green gables she missed the merry comradeship of pattys place she had dreamed some brilliant dreams during the past winter and now they lay in the dust around her in her present mood of selfdisgust she could not immediately begin dreaming again and she discovered that while solitude with dreams is glorious solitude without them has few charms  she had not seen roy again after their painful parting in the park pavilion but dorothy came to see her before she left kingsport  im awfully sorry you wont marry roy she said i did want you for a sister but you are quite right he would bore you to death i love him and he is a dear sweet boy but really he isnt a bit interesting he looks as if he ought to be but he isnt  this wont spoil our friendship will it dorothy anne had asked wistfully  no indeed youre too good to lose if i cant have you for a sister i mean to keep you as a chum anyway and dont fret over roy he is feeling terribly just nowi have to listen to his outpourings every daybut hell get over it he always does  ohalways said anne with a slight change of voice so he has got over it before  dear me yes said dorothy frankly twice before and he raved to me just the same both times not that the others actually refused himthey simply announced their engagements to some one else of course when he met you he vowed to me that he had never really loved beforethat the previous affairs had been merely boyish fancies but i dont think you need worry  anne decided not to worry her feelings were a mixture of relief and resentment roy had certainly told her she was the only one he had ever loved no doubt he believed it but it was a comfort to feel that she had not in all likelihood ruined his life there were other goddesses and roy according to dorothy must needs be worshipping at some shrine nevertheless life was stripped of several more illusions and anne began to think drearily that it seemed rather bare  she came down from the porch gable on the evening of her return with a sorrowful face  what has happened to the old snow queen marilla  oh i knew youd feel bad over that said marilla i felt bad myself that tree was there ever since i was a young girl it blew down in the big gale we had in march it was rotten at the core  ill miss it so grieved anne the porch gable doesnt seem the same room without it ill never look from its window again without a sense of loss and oh i never came home to green gables before that diana wasnt here to welcome me  diana has something else to think of just now said mrs lynde significantly  well tell me all the avonlea news said anne sitting down on the porch steps where the evening sunshine fell over her hair in a fine golden rain  there isnt much news except what weve wrote you said mrs lynde i suppose you havent heard that simon fletcher broke his leg last week its a great thing for his family theyre getting a hundred things done that theyve always wanted to do but couldnt as long as he was about the old crank  he came of an aggravating family remarked marilla  aggravating well rather his mother used to get up in prayermeeting and tell all her childrens shortcomings and ask prayers for them course it made them mad and worse than ever  you havent told anne the news about jane suggested marilla  oh jane sniffed mrs lynde well she conceded grudgingly jane andrews is home from the westcame last weekand shes going to be married to a winnipeg millionaire you may be sure mrs harmon lost no time in telling it far and wide  dear old janeim so glad said anne heartily she deserves the good things of life  oh i aint saying anything against jane shes a nice enough girl but she isnt in the millionaire class and youll find theres not much to recommend that man but his money thats what mrs harmon says hes an englishman who has made money in mines but i believe hell turn out to be a yankee he certainly must have money for he has just showered jane with jewelry her engagement ring is a diamond cluster so big that it looks like a plaster on janes fat paw  mrs lynde could not keep some bitterness out of her tone here was jane andrews that plain little plodder engaged to a millionaire while anne it seemed was not yet bespoken by any one rich or poor and mrs harmon andrews did brag insufferably  what has gilbert blythe been doing to at college asked marilla i saw him when he came home last week and he is so pale and thin i hardly knew him  he studied very hard last winter said anne you know he took high honors in classics and the cooper prize it hasnt been taken for five years so i think hes rather run down were all a little tired  anyhow youre a ba and jane andrews isnt and never will be said mrs lynde with gloomy satisfaction  a few evenings later anne went down to see jane but the latter was away in charlottetowngetting sewing done mrs harmon informed anne proudly of course an avonlea dressmaker wouldnt do for jane under the circumstances  ive heard something very nice about jane said anne  yes jane has done pretty well even if she isnt a ba said mrs harmon with a slight toss of her head mr inglis is worth millions and theyre going to europe on their wedding tour when they come back theyll live in a perfect mansion of marble in winnipeg jane has only one troubleshe can cook so well and her husband wont let her cook he is so rich he hires his cooking done theyre going to keep a cook and two other maids and a coachman and a manofallwork but what about you anne i dont hear anything of your being married after all your collegegoing  oh laughed anne i am going to be an old maid i really cant find any one to suit me it was rather wicked of her she deliberately meant to remind mrs andrews that if she became an old maid it was not because she had not had at least one chance of marriage but mrs harmon took swift revenge  well the overparticular girls generally get left i notice and whats this i hear about gilbert blythe being engaged to a miss stuart charlie sloane tells me she is perfectly beautiful is it true  i dont know if it is true that he is engaged to miss stuart replied anne with spartan composure but it is certainly true that she is very lovely  i once thought you and gilbert would have made a match of it said mrs harmon if you dont take care anne all of your beaux will slip through your fingers  anne decided not to continue her duel with mrs harmon you could not fence with an antagonist who met rapier thrust with blow of battle axe  since jane is away she said rising haughtily i dont think i can stay longer this morning ill come down when she comes home  do said mrs harmon effusively jane isnt a bit proud she just means to associate with her old friends the same as ever shell be real glad to see you  janes millionaire arrived the last of may and carried her off in a blaze of splendor mrs lynde was spitefully gratified to find that mr inglis was every day of forty and short and thin and grayish mrs lynde did not spare him in her enumeration of his shortcomings you may be sure  it will take all his gold to gild a pill like him thats what said mrs rachel solemnly  he looks kind and goodhearted said anne loyally and im sure he thinks the world of jane  humph said mrs rachel  phil gordon was married the next week and anne went over to bolingbroke to be her bridesmaid phil made a dainty fairy of a bride and the rev jo was so radiant in his happiness that nobody thought him plain  were going for a lovers saunter through the land of evangeline said phil and then well settle down on patterson street mother thinks it is terribleshe thinks jo might at least take a church in a decent place but the wilderness of the patterson slums will blossom like the rose for me if jo is there oh anne im so happy my heart aches with it  anne was always glad in the happiness of her friends but it is sometimes a little lonely to be surrounded everywhere by a happiness that is not your own and it was just the same when she went back to avonlea this time it was diana who was bathed in the wonderful glory that comes to a woman when her firstborn is laid beside her anne looked at the white young mother with a certain awe that had never entered into her feelings for diana before could this pale woman with the rapture in her eyes be the little blackcurled rosycheeked diana she had played with in vanished schooldays it gave her a queer desolate feeling that she herself somehow belonged only in those past years and had no business in the present at all  isnt he perfectly beautiful said diana proudly  the little fat fellow was absurdly like fredjust as round just as red anne really could not say conscientiously that she thought him beautiful but she vowed sincerely that he was sweet and kissable and altogether delightful  before he came i wanted a girl so that i could call her anne said diana but now that little fred is here i wouldnt exchange him for a million girls he just couldnt have been anything but his own precious self  every little baby is the sweetest and the best quoted mrs allan gaily if little anne had come youd have felt just the same about her  mrs allan was visiting in avonlea for the first time since leaving it she was as gay and sweet and sympathetic as ever her old girl friends had welcomed her back rapturously the reigning ministers wife was an estimable lady but she was not exactly a kindred spirit  i can hardly wait till he gets old enough to talk sighed diana i just long to hear him say mother and oh im determined that his first memory of me shall be a nice one the first memory i have of my mother is of her slapping me for something i had done i am sure i deserved it and mother was always a good mother and i love her dearly but i do wish my first memory of her was nicer  i have just one memory of my mother and it is the sweetest of all my memories said mrs allan i was five years old and i had been allowed to go to school one day with my two older sisters when school came out my sisters went home in different groups each supposing i was with the other instead i had run off with a little girl i had played with at recess we went to her home which was near the school and began making mud pies we were having a glorious time when my older sister arrived breathless and angry  you naughty girl she cried snatching my reluctant hand and dragging me along with her come home this minute oh youre going to catch it mother is awful cross she is going to give you a good whipping  i had never been whipped dread and terror filled my poor little heart i have never been so miserable in my life as i was on that walk home i had not meant to be naughty phemy cameron had asked me to go home with her and i had not known it was wrong to go and now i was to be whipped for it when we got home my sister dragged me into the kitchen where mother was sitting by the fire in the twilight my poor wee legs were trembling so that i could hardly stand and mothermother just took me up in her arms without one word of rebuke or harshness kissed me and held me close to her heart i was so frightened you were lost darling she said tenderly i could see the love shining in her eyes as she looked down on me she never scolded or reproached me for what i had doneonly told me i must never go away again without asking permission she died very soon afterwards that is the only memory i have of her isnt it a beautiful one  anne felt lonelier than ever as she walked home going by way of the birch path and willowmere she had not walked that way for many moons it was a darklypurple bloomy night the air was heavy with blossom fragrancealmost too heavy the cloyed senses recoiled from it as from an overfull cup the birches of the path had grown from the fairy saplings of old to big trees everything had changed anne felt that she would be glad when the summer was over and she was away at work again perhaps life would not seem so empty then       ive tried the worldit wears no more      the coloring of romance it wore  sighed anneand was straightway much comforted by the romance in the idea of the world being denuded of romance     chapter xl  a book of revelation   the irvings came back to echo lodge for the summer and anne spent a happy three weeks there in july miss lavendar had not changed charlotta the fourth was a very grownup young lady now but still adored anne sincerely  when alls said and done miss shirley maam i havent seen any one in boston thats equal to you she said frankly  paul was almost grown up too he was sixteen his chestnut curls had given place to closecropped brown locks and he was more interested in football than fairies but the bond between him and his old teacher still held kindred spirits alone do not change with changing years  it was a wet bleak cruel evening in july when anne came back to green gables one of the fierce summer storms which sometimes sweep over the gulf was ravaging the sea as anne came in the first raindrops dashed against the panes  was that paul who brought you home asked marilla why didnt you make him stay all night its going to be a wild evening  hell reach echo lodge before the rain gets very heavy i think anyway he wanted to go back tonight well ive had a splendid visit but im glad to see you dear folks again east west hames best davy have you been growing again lately  ive growed a whole inch since you left said davy proudly im as tall as milty boulter now aint i glad hell have to stop crowing about being bigger say anne did you know that gilbert blythe is dying anne stood quite silent and motionless looking at davy her face had gone so white that marilla thought she was going to faint  davy hold your tongue said mrs rachel angrily anne dont look like thatdont look like that we didnt mean to tell you so suddenly  isittrue asked anne in a voice that was not hers  gilbert is very ill said mrs lynde gravely he took down with typhoid fever just after you left for echo lodge did you never hear of it  no said that unknown voice  it was a very bad case from the start the doctor said hed been terribly run down theyve a trained nurse and everythings been done dont look like that anne while theres life theres hope  mr harrison was here this evening and he said they had no hope of him reiterated davy  marilla looking old and worn and tired got up and marched davy grimly out of the kitchen  oh dont look so dear said mrs rachel putting her kind old arms about the pallid girl i havent given up hope indeed i havent hes got the blythe constitution in his favor thats what  anne gently put mrs lyndes arms away from her walked blindly across the kitchen through the hall up the stairs to her old room at its window she knelt down staring out unseeingly it was very dark the rain was beating down over the shivering fields the haunted woods was full of the groans of mighty trees wrung in the tempest and the air throbbed with the thunderous crash of billows on the distant shore and gilbert was dying  there is a book of revelation in every ones life as there is in the bible anne read hers that bitter night as she kept her agonized vigil through the hours of storm and darkness she loved gilberthad always loved him she knew that now she knew that she could no more cast him out of her life without agony than she could have cut off her right hand and cast it from her and the knowledge had come too latetoo late even for the bitter solace of being with him at the last if she had not been so blindso foolishshe would have had the right to go to him now but he would never know that she loved himhe would go away from this life thinking that she did not care oh the black years of emptiness stretching before her she could not live through themshe could not she cowered down by her window and wished for the first time in her gay young life that she could die too if gilbert went away from her without one word or sign or message she could not live nothing was of any value without him she belonged to him and he to her in her hour of supreme agony she had no doubt of that he did not love christine stuartnever had loved christine stuart oh what a fool she had been not to realize what the bond was that had held her to gilbertto think that the flattered fancy she had felt for roy gardner had been love and now she must pay for her folly as for a crime  mrs lynde and marilla crept to her door before they went to bed shook their heads doubtfully at each other over the silence and went away the storm raged all night but when the dawn came it was spent anne saw a fairy fringe of light on the skirts of darkness soon the eastern hilltops had a fireshot ruby rim the clouds rolled themselves away into great soft white masses on the horizon the sky gleamed blue and silvery a hush fell over the world  anne rose from her knees and crept downstairs the freshness of the rainwind blew against her white face as she went out into the yard and cooled her dry burning eyes a merry rollicking whistle was lilting up the lane a moment later pacifique buote came in sight  annes physical strength suddenly failed her if she had not clutched at a low willow bough she would have fallen pacifique was george fletchers hired man and george fletcher lived next door to the blythes mrs fletcher was gilberts aunt pacifique would know ififpacifique would know what there was to be known  pacifique strode sturdily on along the red lane whistling he did not see anne she made three futile attempts to call him he was almost past before she succeeded in making her quivering lips call pacifique  pacifique turned with a grin and a cheerful good morning  pacifique said anne faintly did you come from george fletchers this morning  sure said pacifique amiably i got de word las night dat my fader he was seeck it was so stormy dat i couldnt go den so i start vair early dis mornin im goin troo de woods for short cut  did you hear how gilbert blythe was this morning annes desperation drove her to the question even the worst would be more endurable than this hideous suspense  hes better said pacifique he got de turn las night de doctor say hell be all right now dis soon while had close shave dough dat boy he jus keel himself at college well i mus hurry de old man hell be in hurry to see me  pacifique resumed his walk and his whistle anne gazed after him with eyes where joy was driving out the strained anguish of the night he was a very lank very ragged very homely youth but in her sight he was as beautiful as those who bring good tidings on the mountains never as long as she lived would anne see pacifiques brown round blackeyed face without a warm remembrance of the moment when he had given to her the oil of joy for mourning  long after pacifiques gay whistle had faded into the phantom of music and then into silence far up under the maples of lovers lane anne stood under the willows tasting the poignant sweetness of life when some great dread has been removed from it the morning was a cup filled with mist and glamor in the corner near her was a rich surprise of newblown crystaldewed roses the trills and trickles of song from the birds in the big tree above her seemed in perfect accord with her mood a sentence from a very old very true very wonderful book came to her lips  weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning     xli  love takes up the glass of time   ive come up to ask you to go for one of our oldtime rambles through september woods and over hills where spices grow this afternoon said gilbert coming suddenly around the porch corner suppose we visit hester grays garden  anne sitting on the stone step with her lap full of a pale filmy green stuff looked up rather blankly  oh i wish i could she said slowly but i really cant gilbert im going to alice penhallows wedding this evening you know ive got to do something to this dress and by the time its finished ill have to get ready im so sorry id love to go  well can you go tomorrow afternoon then asked gilbert apparently not much disappointed  yes i think so  in that case i shall hie me home at once to do something i should otherwise have to do tomorrow so alice penhallow is to be married tonight three weddings for you in one summer annephils alices and janes ill never forgive jane for not inviting me to her wedding  you really cant blame her when you think of the tremendous andrews connection who had to be invited the house could hardly hold them all i was only bidden by grace of being janes old chumat least on janes part i think mrs harmons motive for inviting me was to let me see janes surpassing gorgeousness  is it true that she wore so many diamonds that you couldnt tell where the diamonds left off and jane began  anne laughed  she certainly wore a good many what with all the diamonds and white satin and tulle and lace and roses and orange blossoms prim little jane was almost lost to sight but she was very happy and so was mr inglisand so was mrs harmon  is that the dress youre going to wear tonight asked gilbert looking down at the fluffs and frills  yes isnt it pretty and i shall wear starflowers in my hair the haunted wood is full of them this summer  gilbert had a sudden vision of anne arrayed in a frilly green gown with the virginal curves of arms and throat slipping out of it and white stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair the vision made him catch his breath but he turned lightly away  well ill be up tomorrow hope youll have a nice time tonight  anne looked after him as he strode away and sighed gilbert was friendlyvery friendlyfar too friendly he had come quite often to green gables after his recovery and something of their old comradeship had returned but anne no longer found it satisfying the rose of love made the blossom of friendship pale and scentless by contrast and anne had again begun to doubt if gilbert now felt anything for her but friendship in the common light of common day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning had faded she was haunted by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectified it was quite likely that it was christine whom gilbert loved after all perhaps he was even engaged to her anne tried to put all unsettling hopes out of her heart and reconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the place of love she could do good if not noble work as a teacher and the success her little sketches were beginning to meet with in certain editorial sanctums augured well for her budding literary dreams butbutanne picked up her green dress and sighed again  when gilbert came the next afternoon he found anne waiting for him fresh as the dawn and fair as a star after all the gaiety of the preceding night she wore a green dressnot the one she had worn to the wedding but an old one which gilbert had told her at a redmond reception he liked especially it was just the shade of green that brought out the rich tints of her hair and the starry gray of her eyes and the irislike delicacy of her skin gilbert glancing at her sideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath thought she had never looked so lovely anne glancing sideways at gilbert now and then thought how much older he looked since his illness it was as if he had put boyhood behind him forever  the day was beautiful and the way was beautiful anne was almost sorry when they reached hester grays garden and sat down on the old bench but it was beautiful there tooas beautiful as it had been on the faraway day of the golden picnic when diana and jane and priscilla and she had found it then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets now golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely the call of the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches with all its old allurement the mellow air was full of the purr of the sea beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers and long hills scarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds with the blowing of the west wind old dreams returned  i think said anne softly that the land where dreams come true is in the blue haze yonder over that little valley  have you any unfulfilled dreams anne asked gilbert  something in his tonesomething she had not heard since that miserable evening in the orchard at pattys placemade annes heart beat wildly but she made answer lightly  of course everybody has it wouldnt do for us to have all our dreams fulfilled we would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream about what a delicious aroma that lowdescending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns i wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them im sure they would be very beautiful  gilbert was not to be thus sidetracked  i have a dream he said slowly i persist in dreaming it although it has often seemed to me that it could never come true i dream of a home with a hearthfire in it a cat and dog the footsteps of friendsand you  anne wanted to speak but she could find no words happiness was breaking over her like a wave it almost frightened her  i asked you a question over two years ago anne if i ask it again today will you give me a different answer  still anne could not speak but she lifted her eyes shining with all the loverapture of countless generations and looked into his for a moment he wanted no other answer  they lingered in the old garden until twilight sweet as dusk in eden must have been crept over it there was so much to talk over and recallthings said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood  i thought you loved christine stuart anne told him as reproachfully as if she had not given him every reason to suppose that she loved roy gardner  gilbert laughed boyishly  christine was engaged to somebody in her home town i knew it and she knew i knew it when her brother graduated he told me his sister was coming to kingsport the next winter to take music and asked me if i would look after her a bit as she knew no one and would be very lonely so i did and then i liked christine for her own sake she is one of the nicest girls ive ever known i knew college gossip credited us with being in love with each other i didnt care nothing mattered much to me for a time there after you told me you could never love me anne there was nobody elsethere never could be anybody else for me but you ive loved you ever since that day you broke your slate over my head in school  i dont see how you could keep on loving me when i was such a little fool said anne  well i tried to stop said gilbert frankly not because i thought you what you call yourself but because i felt sure there was no chance for me after gardner came on the scene but i couldntand i cant tell you either what its meant to me these two years to believe you were going to marry him and be told every week by some busybody that your engagement was on the point of being announced i believed it until one blessed day when i was sitting up after the fever i got a letter from phil gordonphil blake ratherin which she told me there was really nothing between you and roy and advised me to try again well the doctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that  anne laughedthen shivered  i can never forget the night i thought you were dying gilbert oh i knewi knew thenand i thought it was too late  but it wasnt sweetheart oh anne this makes up for everything doesnt it lets resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us  its the birthday of our happiness said anne softly ive always loved this old garden of hester grays and now it will be dearer than ever  but ill have to ask you to wait a long time anne said gilbert sadly it will be three years before ill finish my medical course and even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls  anne laughed  i dont want sunbursts and marble halls i just want you you see im quite as shameless as phil about it sunbursts and marble halls may be all very well but there is more scope for imagination without them and as for the waiting that doesnt matter well just be happy waiting and working for each otherand dreaming oh dreams will be very sweet now  gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her then they walked home together in the dusk crowned king and queen in the bridal realm of love along winding paths fringed with the sweetest flowers that ever bloomed and over haunted meadows where winds of hope and memory blew
