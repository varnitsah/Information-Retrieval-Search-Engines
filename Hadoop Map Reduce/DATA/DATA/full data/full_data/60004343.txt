60004343	ships company  by ww jacobs    good intentions   jealousy thats wot it is said the nightwatchman trying to sneer pure jealousy  he had left his broom for a hurried halfpint at the bulls headleft it leaning in a negligent attitude against the warehousewall now lashed to the top of the crane at the jetty end it pointed its soiled bristles towards the evening sky and defied capture  and i know who it is and why es done it he continued  fust and last i dont suppose i was talking to the gal for more than ten minutes and arf of that was about the weather  i dont suppose anybody as suffered more from jealousy than wot i ave other peoples jealousy i mean  ever since i was married the missis has been setting traps for me and asking people to keep an eye on me  i blacked one of the eyes oncelike a fooland the chap it belonged to made up a tale about me that i aint lived down yet  years ago when i was out with the missis one evening i saved a gals life for her  she slipped as she was getting off a bus and i caught er just in time  fine strapping gal she was and afore i could get my balance we ad danced round and round arfway acrost the road with our arms round each others necks and my missis watching us from the pavement  when we were safe she said the gal adnt slipped at all and as soon as the gal ad got er breath im blest if she didnt say so too  you cant argufy with jealous people and you cant shame em  when i told my missis once that i should never dream of being jealous of her instead of up and thanking me for it she spoilt the best fryingpan we ever had  when the widderwoman nextdoor but two and me ad rheumatics at the same time she went and asked the doctor whether it was catching  the worse trouble o that kind i ever got into was all through trying to do somebody else a kindness  i went out o my way to do it i wasted the whole evening for the sake of other people and got into such trouble over it that even now it gives me the cold shivers to think of  capn tarbell was the man i tried to do a good turn to a man what used to be master of a ketch called the ilizzie and anniei trading between ere and shoremouth  artful jack he used to be called and if ever a man deserved the name he did  a widderman of about fifty and as silly as a boy of fifteen  he ad been talking of getting married agin for over ten years and thinking it was only talk i didnt give im any good advice  then he told me one night that e was keeping company with a woman named lamb who lived at a place near shoremouth  when i asked im what she looked like he said that she had a good art and knowing wot that meant i wasnt at all surprised when he told me some time arter that e had been a silly fool  well if shes got a good art i ses praps shell let you go  talk sense he ses  it aint good enough for that  why she worships the ground i tread on  she thinks there is nobody like me in the whole wide world  lets ope shell think so arter youre married i ses trying to cheer him up  im not going to get married he ses  leastways not to er  but ow to get out of it without breaking her art and being had up for breach o promise i cant think  and if the other one got to ear of it i should lose her too  other one i ses wot other one  capn tarbell shook his ead and smiled like a silly gal  she fell in love with me on top of a bus in the mile end road he ses love at fust sight it was  shes a widder lady with a nice little ouse at bow and plenty to live onher usband having been a builder  i dont know what to do  you see if i married both of em its sure to be found out sooner or later  youll be found out as it is i ses if you aint careful  im surprised at you  yes he ses getting up and walking backwards and forwards especially as mrs plimmer is always talking about coming down to see the ship  one thing is the crew wont give me away theyve been with me too long for that  praps you could give me a little advice bill  i did  i talked to that man for an hour and aarf and when i ad finished he said he didnt want that kind of advice at all  wot e wanted was for me to tell im ow to get rid of miss lamb and marry mrs plimmer without anybody being offended or having their feelings hurt  mrs plimmer came down to the ship the very next evening  finelooking woman she was and wot with er watch and chain and dimond rings and brooches and suchlike i should think she must ave ad five or six pounds worth of jewellry on er  she gave me a very pleasant smile and i gave er one back and we stood chatting there like old friends till at last she tore erself away and went on board the ship  she came off by and by hanging on capn tarbells arm  the capn was dressed up in is sunday clothes with one of the cleanest collars on i ave ever seen in my life and smoking a cigar that smelt like an escape of gas  he came back alone at hapast eleven that night and e told me that if it wasnt for the other one down shoremouth way he should be the appiest man on earth  mrs plimmers only got one fault he ses shaking his cad and thats jealousy  if she got to know of laura lamb it would be all up it makes me go cold all over when i think of it  the only thing is to get married as quick as i can then she cant help erself  it wouldnt prevent the other one making a fuss though i ses  no he ses very thoughtfully it wouldnt  i shall ave to do something there but wot i dont know  he climbed on board like a man with a load on his mind and arter a look at the sky went below and forgot both is troubles in sleep  mrs plimmer came down to the wharf every time the ship was up arter that  sometimes shed spend the evening aboard and sometimes theyd go off and spend it somewhere else  she ad a fancy for the cabin i think and the capn told me that she ad said when they were married she was going to sail with im sometimes  but it aint for six months yet he ses and a lot o things might appen to the other one in that time with luck  it was just about a month arter that that e came to me one evening trembling all over  i ad just come on dooty and afore i could ask im wot was the matter he ad got me in the bulls head and stood me three arfpints one arter the other  im ruined he ses in a usky whisper im done for  why was wimmen made  wot good are they  fancy ow bright and appy we should all be without em  i started to pint out one or two things to im that he seemed to ave forgot but e wouldnt listen  he was so excited that he didnt seem to know wot e was doing and arter he ad got three more arfpints waiting for me all in a row on the counter i ad to ask im whether he thought i was there to do conjuring tricks or wot  there was a letter waiting for me in the office he ses  from miss lambshes in london  shes coming to pay me a surprise visit this eveningi know wholl get the surprise  mrs plimmers coming too  i gave im one of my arfpints and made im drink it  he chucked the pot on the floor when he ad done in a desprit sort o way and im and the landlord ad a little breeze then that did im more good than wot the beer ad  when we came outside e seemed more contented with imself but he shook his ead and got miserable as soon as we got to the wharf agin  spose they both come along at the same time he ses  wots to be done  i shut the gate with a bang and fastened the wicket  then i turned to im with a smile  im watchman ere i ses and i lets in who i thinks i will  this aint a public ighway i ses its a wharf  bill he ses youre a genius  if miss lamb comes ere asking arter you i ses i shall say youve gone out for the evening  wot about her letter he ses  you didnt ave it i ses winking at im  and suppose she waits about outside for me and mrs plimmer wants me to take er out he ses shivering  shes a fearful obstinate woman and shed wait a week for me  he kept peeping up the road while we talked it over and then we both see mrs plimmer coming along  he backed on to the wharf and pulled out is purse  bill he ses gabbling as fast as e could gabble heres five or six shillings  if the other one comes and wont go away tell er ive gone to the pagoda musicall and youll take er to me keep er out all the evening someow if you can if she comes back too soon keep er in the office  and wot about leaving the wharf and my dooty i ses staring  ill put joe on to keep watch for you he ses pressing the money in my and  i rely on you bill and ill never forget you  you wont lose by it trust me  he nipped off and tumbled aboard the ship afore i could say a word  i just stood there staring arter im and feeling the money and afore i could make up my mind mrs plimmer came up  i thought i should never ha got rid of er  she stood there chatting and smiling and seemed to forget all about the capn and every moment i was afraid that the other one might come up  at last she went off looking behind er to the ship and then i went outside and put my back up agin the gate and waited  i ad hardly been there ten minutes afore the other one came along  i saw er stop and speak to a policeman and then she came straight over to me  i want to see capn tarbell she ses  capn tarbell i ses very slow capn tarbell as gone off for the evening  gone off she ses staring  but he cant ave  are you sure  sartain i ses  then i ad a bright idea  and theres a letter come for im i ses  oh dear she ses  and i thought it would be in plenty of time well i must go on the ship and wait for im i suppose  if i ad only let er go i should ha saved myself a lot o trouble and the man wot deserved it would ha got it  instead o that i told er about the musicall and arter carrying on like a silly gal o seventeen and saying she couldnt think of it she gave way and said shed go with me to find im  i was all right so far as clothes went as it happened mrs plimmer said once that i got more and more dressy every time she saw me and my missis ad said the same thing only in a different way  i just took a peep through the wicket and saw that joe ad taken up my dooty and then we set off  i said i wasnt quite sure which one hed gone to but wed try the pagoda musicall fust and we went there on a bus from aldgate  it was the fust evening out i ad ad for years and i should ave enjoyed it if it adnt been for miss lamb  wotever capn tarbell could ha seen in er i cant think  she was quiet and stupid and badtempered  when the busconductor came round for the fares she adnt got any change and when we got to the hall she did such eggsterrordinary things trying to find er pocket that i tried to look as if she didnt belong to me  when she left off she smiled and said she was farther off than ever and arter three or four wot was standing there ad begged er to have another try i ad to pay for the two  the ouse was pretty full when we got in but she didnt take no notice of that  her idea was that she could walk about all over the place looking for capn tarbell and it took three men in buttons and a policeman to persuade er different  we were pushed into a couple o seats at last and then she started finding fault with me  where is capn tarbell she ses  why dont you find him  ill go and look for im in the bar presently i ses  hes sure to be there arter a turn or two  i managed to keep er quiet for arf an hourwith the elp of the people wot sat near usand then i ad to go  i ad a glass o beer to pass the time away and while i was drinking it who should come up but the cook and one of the hands from the ilizzie and anniei  we saw you ses the cook winking didnt we bob  yes ses bob shaking his silly ead but it wasnt no surprise to me  ive ad my eye on im for a long time past  i thought e was married ses the cook  so he is ses bob and to the best wife in london  i know where she lives  mines a bottle o bass he ses turning to me  sos mine ses the cook  i paid for two bottles for em and arter that they said that theyd ave a whisky and soda apiece just to show as there was no illfeeling  its very good ses bob sipping his but it wants a sixpenny cigar to go with it  its been the dream o my life to smoke a sixpenny cigar  so it as mine ses the cook but i dont suppose i ever shall  they both coughed arter that and like a goodnatured fool i stood em a sixpenny cigar apiece and i ad just turned to go back to my seat when up come two more hands from the lizzie and annie  halloa watchman ses one of em  why i thought you was ataking care of the wharf  hes got something better than the wharf to take care of ses bob grinning  i know we see im ses the other chap  weve been watching is goingson for the last arfhour better than a play it was  i stopped their mouths with a glass o bitter each and went back to my seat while they was drinking it  i told miss lamb in whispers that e wasnt there but id ave another look for him by and by  if shed ha whispered back it would ha been all right but she wouldnt and arter a most unpleasant scene she walked out with her ead in the air follered by me with two men in buttons and a policeman  o course nothing would do but she must go back to the wharf and wait for capn tarbell and all the way there i was wondering wot would appen if she went on board and found im there with mrs plimmer  however when we got there i persuaded er to go into the office while i went aboard to see if i could find out where he was and three minutes arterwards he was standing with me behind the galley trembling all over and patting me on the back  keep er in the office a little longer he ses in a whisper  the others going soon  keep er there as long as you can  and suppose she sees you and mrs plimmer passing the window i ses  thatll be all right im going to take er to the stairs in the ships boat he ses  its more romantic  he gave me a little punch in the ribs playfullike and arter telling me i was worth my weight in golddust went back to the cabin agin  i told miss lamb that the cabin was locked up but that capn tarbell was expected back in about arfanhours time  then i found er an old newspaper and a comfortable chair and sat down to wait  i couldnt go on the wharf for fear shed want to come with me and i sat there as patient as i could till a little clicking noise made us both start up and look at each other  wots that she ses listening  it sounded i ses it sounded like somebody locking the door  i went to the door to try it just as somebody dashed past the window with their ead down  it was locked fast and arter i had ad a try at it and miss lamb had ad a try at it we stood and looked at each other in surprise  somebodys playing a joke on us i ses  joke ses miss lamb  open that door at once  if you dont open it ill call for the police  she looked at the windows but the iron bars wot was strong enough to keep the vans outside was strong enough to keep er in and then she gave way to such a fit o temper that i couldnt do nothing with er  capn tarbell cant be long now i ses as soon as i could get a word in  we shall get out as soon as e comes  she flung erself down in the chair agin with er back to me and for nearly threequarters of an hour we sat there without a word  then to our joy we eard footsteps turn in at the gate  quick footsteps they was  somebody turned the handle of the door and then a face looked in at the window that made me nearly jump out of my boots in surprise  a face that was as white as chalk with temper and a bonnet cocked over one eye with walking fast  she shook er fist at me and then she shook it at miss lamb  whos that ses miss lamb  my missis i ses in a loud voice  thank goodness shes come  open the door ses my missis with a screech  open the door  i cant i ses  somebodys locked it  this is capn tarbells young lady  ill capn tarbell er when i get in ses my wife  you too  ill musicall you  ill learn you to go gallivanting about  open the door  she walked up and down the alleyway in front of the window waiting for me just like a lion walking up and down its cage waiting for its dinner and i made up my mind then and there that i should ave to make a clean breast of it and let capn tarbell get out of it the best way he could i wasnt going to suffer for him  ow long my missis walked up and down there i dont know  it seemed ages to me but at last i eard footsteps and voices and bob and the cook and the other two chaps wot we ad met at the musicall came along and stood grinning in at the window  somebodys locked us in i ses  go and fetch capn tarbell  capn tarbell ses the cook  you dont want to see im  why hes the last man in the world you ought to want to see  you dont know ow jealous he is  you go and fetch im i ses  ow dare you talk like that afore my wife  i dursent take the responserbility ses the cook  it might mean bloodshed  you go and fetch im ses my missis  never mind about the bloodshed i dont  open the door  she started banging on the door agin and arter talking among themselves for a time they moved off to the ship  they came back in three or four minutes and the cook eld up something in front of the window  the boy ad got it he ses  now shall i open the door and let your missis in or would you rather stay where you are in peace and quietness  i saw my missis jump at the key and bob and the others laughing fit to split their sides olding her back  then i heard a shout and the next moment capn tarbell came up and asked em wot the trouble was about  they all started talking at once and then the capn arter one look in at the window threw up his ands and staggered back as if e couldnt believe his eyesight  he stood dazedlike for a second or two and then e took the key out of the cooks and opened the door and walked in the four men was close beind im and do all she could my missis couldnt get in front of em  watchman he ses in a stuckup voice wot does this mean  laura lamb  wot ave you got to say for yourself  where ave you been all the evening  shes been to a musicall with bill ses the cook  we saw em  wot ses the capn falling back again  it cant be  it was them ses my wife  a little boy brought me a note telling me you let me go its my husband and i want to talk to im  its all right i ses waving my and at miss lamb wot was going to speak and smiling at my missis wot was trying to get at me  we went to look for you ses miss lamb very quick  he said you were at the musicall and as you adnt got my letter i thought it was very likely  but i did get your letter ses the capn  he said you didnt ses miss lamb  look ere i ses  why dont you keep quiet and let me explain  i can explain everything  im glad o that for your sake my man ses the capn looking at me very hard  i ope you will be able to explain ow it was you came to leave the wharf for three hours  i saw it all then  if i split about mrs plimmer hed split to the guvnor about my leaving my dooty and i should get the sack  i thought i should ha choked and judging by the way they banged me on the back bob and the cook thought so too  they elped me to a chair when i got better and i sat there elpless while the capn went on talking  im no mischiefmaker he ses and besides praps hes been punished enough  and as far as im concerned he can take this lady to a musicall every night of the week if e likes  ive done with her  there was an eggsterrordinary noise from where my missis was standing like the gurgling water makes sometimes running down the kitchen sink at ome only worse  then they all started talking together and arfa dozen times or more miss lamb called me to back er up in wot she was saying but i only shook my ead and at last arter tossing her ead at capn tarbell and telling im she wouldnt ave im if hed got fifty million a year the five of em eld my missis while she went off  they gave er ten minutes start and then capn tarbell arter looking at me and shaking his ead said he was afraid they must be going  and i ope this nightll be a lesson to you he ses  dont neglect your dooty again  i shall keep my eye on you and if you beave yourself i shant say anything  why for all you know or could ha done the wharf might ha been burnt to the ground while you was away  he nodded to his crew and they all walked out laughing and left me alonewith the missis
